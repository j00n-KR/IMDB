0,bkoganbing,The life of Earth depends on gaming skills,6,5 November 2013,"After all the controversy surrounding the author of Ender's Game and his iconoclastic views on so many subjects, I quite frankly didn't know what to expect from this film. It's far from the greatest science fiction endeavor I've ever seen. It really ought to be seen back to back with Starship Troopers on a number of levels.In both cases the earth has been subject to an alien invasion of an insect civilization of sorts. Starship Troopers never has any doubts or qualms about the citizen's exercising their right to defend planet earth from the bug invasion. The insects aren't even given a generic name, they're simply referred to as 'bugs'. And the bugs only see earth as some kind of feeding ground.These insects in Ender's Game are called Formi and they invaded and several million people were killed before the invasion was repelled. But they've been quiet over the last several decades, no one can say for certainty what they're intentions are. But earth isn't waiting, Harrison Ford is in charge of developing young and I do mean young new commanders with computer precision skills, honed to perfection on computer games.The one he favors is young Asa Butterfield who seems to have more of the right stuff than anyone else. In the end as you would imagine he does, but what he does raises certain issues that Starship Troopers would never imagine.It's ironic that the biggest strength of Ender's Game is the way that computer gaming skills have been refined and are so desirable. The Armed Forces in its recruiting for several years has made a selling point of gaming skills. All the weapons from the most sophisticated missiles down to tanks and even some hand held weapons have a computer guidance system of sorts. No more just point, aim, and shoot. Ender's Game has multiplied that exponentially. In fact in this futuristic society, one with the requisite skills can be drafted.In the end a mixed message is sent to the audience robbing some of the effectiveness of Ender's Game. It still has a lot to recommend it and the contrast to Starship Troopers is quite intense.",Ender's Game
1,Leofwine_draca,Young adult with a sci-fi flavour,5,3 June 2016,"Another week, another young adult novel adaptation, this time a novel by Orson Scott Card. I haven't read it - I'm not into science fiction literature so much - so watching ENDER'S GAME was a whole new experience to me; I had little idea of what to expect.It turns out to be a fairly average movie with both good and bad elements throughout. The main character is a young cadet who joins a military training program in order to combat the threat of an alien invasion. The premise that kids are better disposed to be military commanders than adults is a frankly ludicrous notion that's never properly addressed, but this film just expects you to go with it which is fair enough.Much of this film is about training in the academy and the relationships that go with it. I enjoyed the scenes of Ender squaring up to various bullies and rivals as well as the adults in the installation. I didn't realise it was the kid from HUGO at first, but Asa Butterfield is acceptable as the lead character. They throw in a bone for adult viewers with a likable Harrison Ford in support, although Ben Kingsley must be the oddest choice to play a Maori ever.Where ENDER'S GAME falls down is in the training sequences. Most of them are weightless and they make the actors involved look rather ludicrous as they giggle and float around. Later, things progress to pure CGI adventures and simulations, and as usual, the CGI space stuff is bland and formulaic. It's a pity, because there are some good twists here and a neat ending, and a halfway-decent movie emerges somewhere along the line; you end up wondering what could have been.",Ender's Game
2,SnoopyStyle,"High Concept, Big CGI, but unconvincing",5,14 February 2014,"It's been 50 years since the Earth was attacked by an alien race called Formics. The human race survived by a single act of heroism. Now earth has gathered the most gifted children to train for commanding an earth fleet to annihilate the aliens with a super weapon.There are a lot of great things in this movie. The CGI effects look great. There is a really fun looking zero G training game. I would love to play it in real life. It looks insanely fun. The actors do a good job especially the kids Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld. Harrison Ford plays the hard nose trainer. The best adult actor is Ben Kingsley with the wild facial tattoo. As for the battle, it all feels very removed. It has the playing-a-video-game quality. It doesn't lend itself for intensity. It looks amazing, but it doesn't feel exciting.The story is trying to mind bend the audience with a crazy moral argument. It does it ham fisted and oddly. Instead of poignant or compelling, it's head scratching and confused. The idea is a little too academic and has little use in reality. If the book was about this one idea, then it fails. 'Hunger Games' asks a similar morality question infinitely better. This is a high concept movie with big budget CGI and soon forgotten.",Ender's Game
3,Prismark10,Ender of the road,4,14 March 2014,"Starship Troopers was a right wing book subverted by a left wing film-maker. The Ender's Game books are similarly conservative themed books which should had a radicalized left leaning interpretation. What we get is Harry Potter meets The Hunger Games via Starship Troopers (PG rated.)Harrison Ford sleepwalks through this film, then again he has been sleepwalking in his films since Air Force One. Ben Kingsley turns up as a tattooed Maori with cod Yoda leanings.The film relies on some gifted kid fighters in a training academy using simulation battles in preparation to launch an assault on the planet of the alien invaders.The fact that some of the kids live in a regimented environment where bullying is common place just like the regular army makes you think what sort of kids were being recruited by Harrison Ford and Co. Ender is the only one who shows sign of actually engaging a tactical brain seems to be lost on the other bullies whose response to losing to a better boy is to lash out. It actually makes the people running the entire academy look like a bunch of incompetents when there is a looming alien threat.There are some good special effects, Asa Butterfield shows spirit as Ender but this is a franchise that is not going very far.",Ender's Game
4,claudio_carvalho,Contradictory Rip-off of Starship Troopers for Juvenile Audiences,4,15 March 2014,"In the future, Earth was attacked by the alien race Formics and after many casualties, the hero Mazer Rackham destroys the mothership and defeats the aliens.Fifty years later, the outcast boy Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) to be part of a selected team of boys and girls that are being prepared by the International Military for the next invasion of the Formics. Colonel Graff believes that he may be the leader and savior of the human race, but Major Anderson is concerned with the psychological damages that may be caused to Ender.""Ender's Game"" is a rip-off of ""Starship Troopers"" for juvenile audiences with a story with many contradictions. Ender is trained to kill but has conflictive crisis when he is bullied by the violent Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias). His attitudes always generate negative comments from Anderson and Graff and it is difficult to follow what he should do to please the military. Why experienced commanders would need a kid to command the earthling fleet? Harrison Ford is awful in the role of a tough colonel. My vote is fourTitle (Brazil): ""Ender's Game - O Jogo do Exterminador"" (""Ender's Game – The Terminator Game"")",Ender's Game
5,nogodnomasters,There is no teacher but the enemy.,8,25 February 2018,"In the future Earth is nearly destroyed by an alien race of bug like creatures, but we were saved by a great hero that wasn't Casper Van Dien but Gandhi (Ben Kinsley). Children play video games to see who will become the next war leader. The overly robotic Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield) is on the fast track to become that leader, trained by Han Solo (Harrison Ford).The film is magnificent in its graphics. The characters are fairly dry as in too many science fiction films which are theme driven. Written in 1985 the film looks at the ""First Strike"" debate. Should you attack your enemy first if you believe you are about to be attacked? This was debated in the 1980's and during the 1930's. It became policy in Iraq and is still debated today, the reason why Hollywood chose to make this film now. The film also touches on population control and structural society for the common good.The multiple adult themes have been dummy downed for the young target audience who are surely more enthralled by the computer games than any under lying meaning. If ""Ender's Game"" reminds you of other modern films it is because they copied from it, or the book upon it was based. In that regard this feature is similar to ""John Carter."" a film that was not as popular as those it inspired.Worth while viewing for the kids. Adults might find themselves at times bored during the formulaic plot.",Ender's Game
6,kosmasp,Game time,4,21 March 2014,"You have to suspend disbelief ... big time! Just the fact the movie relies on kids to save humanity is more than a stretch. Of course there is a bit more to the story than this, but all is fuddled with a story that is repeating itself too often. There is some payoff, but not enough to keep most people interested.It's also unclear what audience this is aiming at. Themes running through it are too mature for little kids, but the movie itself is too simple for adults. So is it teenagers? And are they really interested in something like this? The box office wasn't clear either. While the movie didn't really make any money, it did get back what the movie cost (US and overall box office that is). Still while the effects are good, the story lacks a lot ...",Ender's Game
7,lee_eisenberg,controversy only works when there's dignity,2,30 July 2014,"I had never heard of ""Ender's Game"" or Orson Scott Card before the movie got released. Around the time of the release, Card's anti-gay views became a point of contention, with some LGBT rights activists calling on people to boycott the movie.Now that I've seen the movie, I'd say that it's not interesting enough to deserve a controversy. Oh it's got an interesting story alright. Unfortunately, it seems that they tried too hard to make the movie family-friendly. I prefer for sci-fi flicks to have either a gritty side (Alien), an intellectual side (2001: A Space Odyssey) or a nerdy side (Star Wars). ""Ender's Game"" has none of these. All that I can say is that it's a wasted effort.",Ender's Game
8,jboothmillard,Ender's Game,4,3 August 2020,"This movie had been on TV quite a lot of times in the last few years, and I kept missing it or having to delete it from my recordings, so I was relieved when I finally got to watching it, directed by Gavin Hood (Tsotsi, Rendition, Eye in the Sky). Basically, set in the future, an insectoid alien race called the Formics attacked Earth fifty years ago, killing millions. The invasion was stopped by Mazer Rackham, who crashed his fighter plane into Formic queenship, apparently killing himself. Since then, humanity has been in fear that they will return, and are preparing a counterattack on the aliens' home world. Several gifted children with video gaming skills are recruited by the International Fleet as part of a military squad who will go through rigorous training for an upcoming battle. Cadet Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) draws the attention of Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) based on his capabilities in simulated space combat. Ender is attacked by Stilson (Caleb J. Thaggard), a student he defeated in the combat simulation, but Ender fights back and severely injures him. Ender confesses his distress at what happened to his older sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) but is further intimidated by their older brother Peter (Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak). Graff reveals to Ender was being tested and is still part of the program. Graff brings Ender to Battle School and places him with other same-age cadets, but treats him as extraordinary, causing him to be ostracised by the others. The cadets are placed in squads and perform training games in a zero-gravity ""Battle Room"". Ender quickly adapts to the games, devising new strategies older students have not yet seen. Graff reassigns Ender to Salamander Army, led by Commander Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias), who is sceptical of Ender, fearing he will cause the squad to fail and prevent him from training the others. Another cadet, Petra Arkanian (Hailee Steinfeld), takes Ender under her wing and trains him privately. Bonzo becomes aware of this but does not take any action, and Ender secretly persuades him to let him continue, to increase his chances of being accepted into another squad. In the next match, Bonzo orders Ender to do nothing during the match, but seeing his team losing and Petra in trouble, he cannot help but intervene and allowing the opposing the Salamander Army to win. After the match, Bonzo is humiliated by the other students and threatens to kill Ender if he embarrasses him again. Meanwhile, Ender plays a computerised ""mind game"" set in a fantasy world, which presents difficult choices to the player. In one situation, choosing one of two boxes proves unsolvable, so he goes outside the box. He also encounters games with simulated images of Valentine and Peter. These are noted as unusual additions to the game, which is seemingly being altered by Ender's interaction with the computer. Graff promotes Ender to the leader of his own squad, made from other students who have gained Ender's trust. They are put in increasingly difficult battles. Graff is impressed by Ender in a surprise match against two other teams, when he devises a novel strategy of sacrificing part of his team to achieve a goal. Bonzo attacks Ender in the bathroom after the match, but Ender fights back, and Bonzo is seriously injured. Ender is distraught and prepares to quit Battle School, but Graff has Valentine speak to him and convince him to continue. Graff takes Ender to a base close to a Formic planet near their home world. There, Ender meets Mazer Rackham (Sir Ben Kingsley), who did not die as had been previously believed. Ender finds that his former squad members are also there to help him train in computerised simulations of large fleet combat. Ender's training is rigorous, and Anderson expresses concern they are pushing Ender too fast, but Graff notes they have run out of time to replace him. Ender's final test is monitored by several of the fleet commanders. As the simulation starts, Ender finds his fleet over the Formic home world and vastly outnumbered. He orders most of his fleet to sacrifice themselves to protect the Molecular Detachment (MD) Device, capable of disintegrating matter, long enough to fire it. The resulting chain reaction burns over the surface of the planet, killing the entire population. The simulation ends, and Ender believes the test is over. But it turns out that the destruction of the Formic home world was real, and Ender had been controlling the real fleet. Despite Graff's assurance that he is a hero, revealing Ender had also been controlling the real fleet in all previous ""simulations"", Ender is horrified and outraged at the annihilation of an entire race and believes everyone will only remember him as a killer. As Ender struggles with his emotions during sleep, he believes the Formics are trying to communicate with him. He follows the path he recalls from a game to enter the Formic structure and encounters a dying Formic queen. The Queen recognises Ender's role in the genocide but conveys that she wanted peace and forgives him. The Queen gives Ender an alien egg that she had been protecting. With the war over, Ender is promoted to Admiral, given a small ship, and left to his own devices. Ender writes a letter to Valentine, explaining that he is going into deep space, determined to form a new Formic colony with the egg. Also starring Aramis Knight as Bean, Suraj Parthasarathy as Alai, Stevie Ray Dallimore as John Wiggin, Andrea Powell as Theresa Wiggin, and Kyle Clements as Young Mazer Rackham. Veterans like Ford and Kingsley add gravitas, and supporting cast members Steinfeld and Breslin are good, but it is Butterfield that is the star and carries the film as the reluctant teen recruit. I am not surprised that this was a box office failure, while it has fantastic special effects, fight and battle sequences and good acting, the script and story are iffy and predictable, it was not as gripping as I was hoping, a slightly disappointing but reasonable science-fiction action adventure. Okay!",Ender's Game
9,paul_haakonsen,A super ridiculous and laughable movie presented in great CGI effects...,4,19 April 2014,"While visually great, then ""Ender's Game"" turned out to be somewhat of a hollow experience that lacked any sense of believability. I mean, a boy about 13 years old who rises through the ranks of an intergalactic military force to end up commanding a massive army? Sure, that was just so believable as it is as scratching yourself.This movie appeals for a young audience, a very young audience, because anything that even remotely bears any sense of reality or realism is out the window, and there is a young boy wonder who handles every single thing thrown against him with brilliancy and ease. Yeah, I will buy that for a dollar.Not only is the storyline very hard to buy into or believe for a second, then the entire movie bears no particular contents, and it is a hollow experience that is carried only by the spectacular visual effects and the names of Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley.Let's take a moment and look at the combat training, shall we? A bunch of kids playing laser tag in zero gravity, that qualifies for making commanders that will lead the entire military force in space? And these are kids, mind you. The older, seasoned and experienced military officers and leaders just sat back and gave way to children. Yeah, all very, very believable.And for those who suffer through the entire course of the movie, brace yourself for a slap in the face kind of an ending. Now, I am not going to spoil it here by saying what it is, but come on, seriously? That ending was just laughable and ridiculous.I enjoy Sci-Fi, but ""Ender's Game"" was just a swing and a miss, a massive swing and a miss. It scores a mere 4 out of 10 stars from me, solely because of the visual effects and because of Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley.",Ender's Game
10,tavm,Ender's Game was a good enough epic drama of teens doing battle in space,8,1 November 2013,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend on an IMAX screen. The battle scenes are awesome and the story is imaginative and much of the dialogue is compelling. Knowing this was based on the first of a series of novels, what I watched was good enough to be nearly entirely enthralled by. Certainly, veterans Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley give their roles some depth as officers knowing what needs to be done. The teens that dominate are well-chosen. The ongoing score was good at moving things along. I also enjoyed feeling some of the sound effects at the bottom of my seat. And the twist at the end was compellingly dramatic. So on that note, I recommend Ender's Game.",Ender's Game
11,michaelRokeefe,Humanity worth protecting,7,24 October 2020,"Superior FX and intelligent action flick that finds an insectoid race returning to infect Earth. The International Military makes use of talented preteens, including Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), to conjure a game plan to battle the second invasion. The characters are developed well for a syfy film and the action is strongly paced.An outstanding cast also featuring: Harrison Ford, Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Moises Arias and Ben Kingsley.",Ender's Game
12,sunwarrior13,Children Acting As Soldiers,7,14 September 2014,"Ender's Game is an epic adventure based on the novel of the same title by Orson Scott Card.It is a science fiction that tells that story of an unusually gifted child that is sent to an advanced military academy in outer space to prepare for defense against an alien invasion that is about to happen in the future.It stars Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford together with Hailee Steinfeld,Viola Davis,Abigail Breslin and Ben Kingsley.A hostile alien race known as the Formic have attacked the earth.International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham and his troops led the successful defense against it.In preparation for a future,Colonel Hyrum Graff and the International Military prepares the best young children in preparation for its defense.A boy named Ender Wiggin is pulled out from his school to join the training and impressed everyone due to his ingenuity and brilliance.He was assigned to become the children's leader in an epic battle that will once again save the planet and the human race.This is a watchable science fiction film that offers interesting themes such as genocide,children acting as soldiers,pro-war and desire for power.It also presents grand visuals that will surprise and impress the viewer.While it has some flaws like having a slow pace and being boring at some parts,it still manages to be entertaining as well as compelling for the viewer especially with the themes in it.",Ender's Game
13,LeonLouisRicci,KiddiesThis One's For You,5,21 February 2014,"The End Game here is to be Exciting Without Resorting to Great Big Explosions, or at Least too Many of them. Make an Action Oriented Movie for the Adrenaline Types with Most of the Action on Computer Screens (that seem to have a defective zoom in function) with the Central Set Action Piece taking Place in a Zero Gravity Training Facility that is about as Engaging as Watching Paintball.The Movie has a Sheen about it and there are Many Extreme Long Shots of Thousands of Spacecraft Zipping About (Yawn) with Very Little Attention to Detail and Never gets Close Enough for much of a Feeling about what's Going On. Speaking of Feeling, there is Not Much here. This is a Cold and Shallow Affair with its Attempts at Heart Rather Facile and Fake.This may be Enjoyed by Kids and Tweens but is Comparitivly Tame and Boring Stuff when Compared to Current Video Games, Movies and TV Shows that for Better or Worse Pack a whole lot of Punch that is Sorely Lacking in this Bland and Boring Story Masquerading as Juvenile Science-Fiction Intellectualism.",Ender's Game
14,utgard14,Boring,4,1 March 2014,"To start with, I never read the book. So I don't have that baggage of complaints and nitpicks that movies based on books seem to generate from fans. So my review is strictly based on what I thought of the movie. In short, it was competently put together but boring as hell. I'm so sick of stories about people waiting for a leader or a chosen one to guide them. It's been done to death, Hollywood! Yeah I realize it's based on a book from 1985 but, again, this is a review of a movie that came out in 2013 not the book. In 2013 we had seen literally dozens of movies and television shows with very similar plot lines as this in just the last decade.To make matters worse, I hated the cast. Especially Asa Butterfield. I just can't with this kid. If I have to guess whether you are acting badly or if the part is written that way, then you're screwed. As an actor, nine times out of ten you're taking the blame for that one. Usually rightfully so. He wasn't the only one I didn't care for. Harrison Ford goes without saying. Just retire, Harrison, if this is the best you can do at staying relevant. I disliked the entire supporting cast of no-name actors. They were all bland and colorless. The special effects also failed to impress me. They weren't bad, just nothing that will stay with me over time. Forgettable, like this movie. I can't recommend you see this unless you are really young and haven't seen much yet. Because I've seen this type of story done before and better. Many times, actually.",Ender's Game
15,zardoz-13,Mediocre At Best,5,27 November 2013,"Parents have complained since the dawn of creation that children grow up too quickly. The urchins in ""Ender's Game,"" based on Orson Scott Card's allegorical but fascist 1985 science fiction novel, must grow up far more quickly if mankind hopes to survive a second cataclysmic intergalactic extraterrestrial invasion. The pugnacious aliens determined to destroy humanity are called Formics, and they resemble praying mantises. These predatory Formics constitute a far more perilous foe than any other that Earth has ever encountered. Launching a Pearl Harbor-style attack, these formidable bugs surprised Earthlings and nearly devastated us. Fortunately, one hero emerged to repulse the deadly invasion. Anxious about surviving a second assault, the military establishes a program to indoctrinate children in the art of warfare. It seems that kids are far better equipped to triumph over their adversaries than any adults. War has always been a young man's fight, while the elders supervise strategy safely behind the lines. The conceit of writer & director Gavin Hood's ""Ender's Game"" is that innocent adolescents stand a better chance of saving society than their elders. Since I haven't read Scott's popular bestsellers, I cannot say for sure what Hood left on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, according to one fan that I chatted with the day I saw the film, Hood deleted a great deal, but none of the missing segments seriously disturbed her. Mind you, ""Ender's Game"" isn't the first movie where children have had to resort to violence. The three problems that I have with ""Ender's Game"" are the anticlimactic scripting, the lackluster villains, and the overabundance of simulation without a shred of suspense. Never for one moment in this 114-minute science fiction extravaganza did I feel that our heroes were in jeopardy. ""Ender's Game"" stars Harrison Ford, but he doesn't engage in any ""Star Wars"" heroics. He wears a uniform, a closely trimmed hair-cut, and growls his dialogue with convincing menace. He neither wields a weapon of any sort nor does his aide played Viola Davis. Aside from Ford and Davis, the cast consists of children from a rainbow of ethnic denominations. ""Ender's Game"" applauds multiculturalism but deplores the necessity to steal the innocence of youth.Fifty years have elapsed since the warmongering Formics sought to destroy Earth. Had it not been for the intervention of legendary fighter pilot Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley of ""Iron Man 3""), humanity would have disappeared from the galaxy. Apparently, Rackham died in combat when he committed suicide by crashing his fighter into a Formic battle cruiser. The destruction of that battle cruiser took the spirit out of the Formics and they retreated back to their home planet. As it turns out, the news of Rackham's demise was greatly exaggerated. Meantime, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford of ""Cowboys & Aliens"") and his superiors suspect that the Formics will embark on another all-out effort to vanquish mankind. Since they feel youth is their best weapon against the Formics, they have set up military academies to train young leaders. Now, Graff is convinced that he has discovered the ideal strategist to take the fight to the Formics. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of ""Hugo"") qualifies as a classic underdog. He is a ten-year old who doesn't fit in well with others. Nevertheless, Graff admires Ender's tenacity to pummel his opponents into submission without a qualm. The only thing that bothers Graff and military psychologist Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis of ""The Help"") is that Ender might have a latent streak of sadism. Earlier, the International Fleet had pinned their hopes on Ender's older brother Peter (Jimmy Jax Pinchak of ""Let Me In""), but he turns out to be a sadist. Graff has Ender transferred to a training station orbiting the Earth and pits him against the best of the best who have proved their mettle in simulated warfare. Ender defeats each of them. Furthermore, Ender befriends surly Drill Sergeant Dap (Nonso Anozie of ""Conan the Barbarian"") who appears to have nothing but contempt for youngsters. Eventually, Ender learns Mazer Rackham didn't die, and Ender must prove himself to the legendary pilot. Mazer doesn't have Graff's faith in Ender, but Ender wins over Mazer. What bothers Ender is that Graff may be lying to him about each new battle simulation. Secretly, Ender isn't certain if he is playing a game or playing for real.The first half of ""Ender's Game"" tops the second half. Initially, Hood dwells on our hero's confrontations with bullies at military academies. Indisputably, the filmmakers argue that bullying is as harmful for the bullies as it is for their victims. Ender relies on his agile wits to topple his tormentors who not only out-number him but also are far more cynical. Nothing about these fights is simulated. Vividly, Ender goes head-to-head with his enemies, while Hood aligns our sympathies with him. The raw violence that Hood orchestrates in these instances far surpasses the simulated, computer game quality of Ender's fights with the Formics. Top-notch adventure movies boast strong, intimidating villains. Watching ""Ender's Game"" reminded me of ""Starship Troopers"" where the Arachnids posed a genuine threat to mankind. Unfortunately, Hood depicts only one Formic in ""Ender's Game,"" and this Formic is harmless. During the massive battles, we never see the Formics in their own battleships, only their ships. This shortage of Formics suggests that Hood didn't want to make them too antagonistic. Essentially, the Formics don't contain a shred of personality. You cannot abhor a villain who never appears either aggressive or hostile. Virtually all of the battles that Ender engages in with the Formics are presented from the perspective of a video gamer. Anybody who has read Orson Scott Card's novels knows the fight is far from over at fade-out. The last minute surprise will make you wonder whether we should have aligned our sympathies with our own species at the expense of another culture. Performances, especially those of the children, are compelling. Meanwhile, ""Ender's Game"" never quickened my pulse.",Ender's Game
16,grantss,Sci fi movie for kids,2,18 January 2015,"A sci fi movie made for kids (and even they might find this craptacular).Incredibly weak and contrived plot.

18,view_and_review,"Good Adaptation, Not a Fan",6,20 September 2014,"Ender's Game is in the same vein as the dystopian movies with teens/young adults playing the key roles. In this movie Earth was attacked by aliens and although Earthicans won the battle for the planet they want to ensure that they are never attacked again. To that end, Earthlings have been training child soldiers all the while searching for the one that will lead all Earthians to annihilate the aliens once and for all. Ender seems to be just the one that they've been looking for but can he deliver?The movie is based upon a book written in 1983 by Orson Scott Card. I read the book, and even though there are some deviations from the source material, they adapted it pretty well for the big screen. The director did a nice job bringing to life the events depicted in the book but he didn't do much for the acting. The acting in this movie is atrocious even if they were kids. I think even Harrison Ford was affected by it.Ultimately, what I disliked about the movie (besides the acting) is what I disliked about the book... the ending. That's no fault of the movie, it is what it is.",Ender's Game
19,neil-476,"Well realised, and enjoyable",9,1 November 2013,"Following a war with insect-like aliens called Formics, won only narrowly, a training programme is instituted whereby young people are hothoused for military command in order to bring on tactical abilities at an age when minds are most agile. Ender Wiggin is a promising trainee, and the film follows him from boot camp into battle school.I have not read the book, but this hard sci-fi movie was very well made and enjoyable to watch, and provided some food for thought. Much of the story appears inspired by Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers - a war against insect-like aliens and following a recruit through training are common - but the course of Ender's training and the philosophical issues are quite different.The performances are all good - Asa Butterfield continues to impress, with a performance of depth and emotion. Harrison Ford, having phoned in performances for a considerable number of years, shows some commitment here. And Moises Arias as venomous fellow trainee Bonzo Madrid is excellent (in fact, all the young actors are good). The effects, both physical and CGI, are excellent.I thoroughly enjoyed this - it is my sort of science fiction.",Ender's Game
20,phd_travel,Visually stunning but it's meant for teens,5,6 November 2013,For someone who was unfamiliar with the story I thought this was an okay watch because of it's visuals. But bear in mind I feel it's a teenagers show. I think adults may find it childish. Visually it's quite spectacular. The games and battles are beautifully shot.The story is really meant for teenage science fiction fans. Doesn't have the universal appeal of a Star Wars story. The young kids saving the planet is fun in a kids fantasy but that's all. At least the violence and concept weren't revolting like in the Hunger Games.Harrison Ford is a little old for the role. Middle aged actor would have been better than an elderly one. Asa Butterfield from the tedious Hugo has a lot to carry on this shoulders in the role and he does a good job with the role he is given - feisty and vulnerable at the same time. Hailee Steinfeld is suited to her role too. Can't imagine they could cast her as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet though she isn't romantic role beautiful.Overall it's a grandly done kids movie - that's all.,Ender's Game
21,siderite,Phew! They didn't mess it up.,9,23 January 2014,"I vaguely remember the story in the books, but I know that when I read it, a child myself - just like the main character, I was really impressed. The details have been lost in the mists of memory and I know that the following books did not have the same impact, but the first, oh boy, I cried at the end. What remained with me was that the story was essentially antiwar, a cautionary tale against winning a battle while losing ourselves. Antiwar, just like Starship Troopers, and we know how that turned out as a movie franchise.And so I was rather on the edge hoping that they would not mess this up. I am glad to report that they did not... much. True, it would have been impossible to convey more of the book in a film. Even a series would have been ill advised, since the story is, indeed, in the details, but has a major punchline at the end. The book was all about the boy overcoming everything they threw at him: training games, cruel jokes, mind games. There was a lot of space dedicated to his interactions with the computer game, which was adapting itself to the user, revealing much. It was impossible to put this into a film, and this is where there is the pity. Therefore my recommendation is first read the book, then watch the movie, which is a good one, a well made film made by someone who clearly enjoyed and respected the original book.OK, if you are a die hard fan of the book you will start noticing differences in the details or the scene order or even the end of the film, but personally I didn't think it hurt the story much.Now, about the film, I can't really find a fault with it. The cast was perfect, the acting good, the effects well done, but not over done, the music supporting the mood of each scene, but not being exaggerated in any way, the story faithful to the book and the script properly condensed in a movie. I said that there was a lot from the book that could not have been put in the film, but watching it I did not feel rushed, with scenes that make no sense or things moving too fast. Perhaps overall, looking back, it did seem hurried, but I can honestly say that I only realized it when the movie was over and I had to write this review and not during it.I really wonder about the next bit of the story, which is fundamentally different from its start. Will it have to be changed dramatically in order to keep audiences happy, will the screenplay be as good as for Ender's Game and convey to the viewer the emotions and intentions of the book author, thus needing no intervention in the story? And now, while writing this, I wonder if at my age now I would really like the first book a lot more than the rest. Perhaps it would be the other way around.Bottom line: Respecting the original work, the film made me enjoy it even when I knew the plot. I found no real flaw in it, so I am forced to rate it top grade. And what was even nicer, it made me have hope for the next films which now I eagerly await. Good job!",Ender's Game
22,namashi_1,A Passable Fare!,6,19 March 2014,"Based on the novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card, 'Ender's Game' is A Passable Fare!

But. how one wishes if the Writing Material was as strong. Though the first-hour is well-written, the second-hour is dragged & even the culmination, is underwhelming. A much stronger Screenplay was needed! Gavin Hood's Direction is credible. Cinematography is ordinary. Editing & Background Score, are good. Performance-Wise: Asa Butterfield delivers an earnest performance. Harrison Ford is hugely impressive. He's the scene-stealer here. Sir Ben Kingsley is strictly okay, while the talented Viola Davis is wasted. Hailee Steinfeld is charming.

24,KineticSeoul,It's a blast,8,13 November 2013,"Despite the pacing and development, which could have used some work. ""Ender's Game"" the movie is a highly enjoyable movie. The story is about this genius likable badass kid Ender Wiggin that joins a crew vessel full of other kid recruits. And train with them in order to save the world from another alien invasion. Now I know they couldn't fit everything from to book into this movie, who knows maybe it can be possible. And although too much of it can bore the audiences, it just needed more when it came to the development. Which made the emotional impact scenes, not as powerful. Asa Butterfield just nails it as Ender(there is a bright future for this teen in this industry), and Harrison Ford fit right in and seemed to enjoy playing Colonel Graff. I am glad Hailee Steinfeld is getting more roles, she was really good in ""True Grit"". And Moisés Arias who plays Bonzo is a great actor, he can play really different characters, although I think he is better in comedies. Just check out ""The Kings of Summer"" where he steals just about every scene. When it comes to Ender Wiggin, he is the drive of this movie, not just because of the character depth and complexity. But he is just a really likable genius. You know those so called smart people or people that want to appear smart, that has major insecurities and thus needs to exploit it constantly and prove to others how much better they are compared to others? Well Ender is not that type, he just has the leadership quality and charisma that makes the crew want to follow him and I totally bought it. Overall this is a great movie that could have been superb, with better pacing and development.8/10",Ender's Game
25,Hellmant,I'm pretty sure the point of the movie was that resorting to violence is wrong.,7,5 November 2013,"'ENDER'S GAME': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Harrison Ford returns to sci-fi for this adaptation of the popular 1985 novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card. It stars 16-year-old Asa Butterfield (of 'HUGO' fame) as a genius military student recruited to save mankind from an alien army. Gavin Hood (who also directed movies like 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE' and 'RENDITION') wrote and directed the film. It co-stars Hailee Steinfeld (of 2010's 'TRUE GRIT' fame), Abigail Breslin, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley. It's not nearly as good as a lot of the hype it's been getting but it is a decent sci-fi youth book adaption film and it's nice to see Ford in this type of role again.The film is set in the distant future after Earth is invaded by an alien race called formics. A young pilot saved the human race by apparently sacrificing himself and stopping their deadly attack. Now mankind depends on their youth to prevent future attacks, and stop the formics, by training young teens to be violent and brilliant soldiers. Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) is one such hopeful savior and has become Earth's last hope. He's recruited and trained by Colonel Graff (Ford), who sees great potential in him.The film is supposed to launch a new series (following the multiple books) but has been negatively criticized for it's justification of violence and it's author's bigoted views (that he's recently made public). A boycott of the film has been promoted by those offended by Card's hateful vocal viewpoints and other's associated with the film (like Ford) have distanced themselves from the author. The guy seems like an ass but, like with all art, you can't judge a person's work by their personality or personal actions. Mel Gibson still makes good films and gives likable performances despite his disrespectful behavior (so do filmmakers like Roman Polanski). I don't know how good the book is but I enjoyed the movie. In some ways it seems to justify violence but it also seems to take a strong anti-war standpoint (by the film's end). I don't know if the book does this as well but I'm pretty sure the point of the movie was that resorting to violence (without looking for other, better, solutions) is wrong. Ford and Butterfield are great in the film and the visuals are spectacular. It's a little slow and uninvolving at times but not a bad sci-fi flick by any means.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4",Ender's Game

SPOILERS
not a fan of the open ending",Ender's Game
27,Robert_duder,An almost amazing sci-fi epic,8,6 November 2013,"First let me say I loved Ender's Game. I have never read the books, and I don't give a lick about the author's sexual opinions. It bares no weight on a film. Ender's Game was a clean, fun, non-stop action ride that was well acted, well written and the perfect potential beginning to another franchise. There are a few mis-steps to the film but considering how long the movie spent in production it was very good. The pacing for the film in the beginning is a little slow and the entire movie focuses on the young recruits training but it works and I was never bored. Each character is well introduced and most importantly we become completely riveted and enthralled with the character of Ender. The film reminded me so much of Star Wars and I mean that in a good way. It is a squeaky clean movie that young people who love science fiction can absolutely revel in and there isn't anything wrong with that. Die hard adult sci-fi fans might find it a little too simple but it really is just an enjoy time at the movies. The special effects were absolutely solid and nothing looked silly. There were a few times when some of the dialogue felt just a little bit cheesy but nothing that drags the movie down for a moment.The amazing young actor Asa Butterfield is perfect for the character of Ender. He floored me in the film Hugo and now he proves he can be a mainstream action hero with this film. He seems so unassuming and yet he commands the screen when he's on it which makes him perfect for the role. Abigail Breslin is probably one of the biggest hiccups to the supporting cast. I don't dislike Breslin but this role was just cheesy and she spends more time squeezing out fake tears and delivering a really campy role that it drags down her co-stars. Hailee Steinfeld (another young actor I have great respect for) is quite good in her role. The unfortunate part is that its a very small role so she doesn't really get to demonstrate her ability but she is good with what she is given and the chemistry between her and Butterfield is very good but left unexplored. Moises Arias was also very good in his role as Ender's trainer and superior. Arias looks sort of campy but he actually made the role work and was good in it. I am quite surprised that a lot of IMDb reviewers are saying Harrison Ford was disappointing. I am a huge Ford fan and I thought he was terrific. This was his best role in a very long time. Yes, he is a little monotone but isn't that the point? He's a respected and driven Colonel who sees nothing more than the end game battle against this species. I think there was more to explore to his character but I thought Ford was fantastic and the chemistry between him and Butterfield was near perfect. On the flip side I thought Viola Davis (a brilliant actor) was sort of ho-hum in this and I would have liked to have seen more interaction between her and Ford. She was still good in the film. And Ben Kingsley (I didn't even realize he was in the film until he showed up) was decent as the legendary Mazer Rackham. Once again, I think there was more to this character to explore but Kingsley did pretty well and seeing him and Ford together on screen was a cinematic treat.Maybe the biggest issue I had with Ender's Game is not an issue at all. I think I just felt like I wanted to see more, I wanted more of it and more characters and more background and I didn't want it to end. But that isn't a problem is it? That's actually a testament to how well the film came together. Ironically director and screenplay writer Gavin Hood comes from a whole lot of B-Movie straight to DVD schlock but thank goodness for him he proved himself with this that he can handle a big budget. However, it might also be the reason every once in awhile during the movie I thought I saw a little sprout of camp popping up. However, it never takes away from the film. Do yourself a favour sci-fi fans and give this a chance so that we can get another instalment. It is worth seeing in the theatre and bravo to them for not wasting the time on 3D because it is visually spectacular on its own and a solid movie to boot. 8.5/10",Ender's Game
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Its main problem: it's just unjustly and uncompromisingly boring.,3,26 March 2018,"'Ender's Game (2013)' doesn't explain or even really explore anything, displaying not so much ambiguity but rather a total lack of the regard or ability to convey or establish any of its sub-surface and world-building plot elements, including its few but genuine deep ideas surrounding the morality of war, violence and the concept of 'winning' at such endeavours, which welcomely pop up here and there but are unfortunately shrouded in a mire of murky, dour self-seriousness, a schlocky and exposition-filled screenplay and boringly bad dialogue. That's the main problem with the piece, though, that it's just unjustly and uncompromisingly boring from beginning to end. The fact that it never gets out of the gate or backtracks on its one good, gut-wrenching moment become minor annoyances when you simply cannot care about anything happening on screen, since there's no engagement to come from the cardboard characters or clichéd plot and certainly not from the well-rendered but usually stakes-less action sequences. It's an extremely poor effort more adept at putting you to sleep than anything else, and it isn't even all that great at that. 3/10",Ender's Game
29,bowmanblue,Ender's in school,6,26 June 2014,"Okay, so I'll admit I didn't like this film as much as I wanted to. I'm a fan of big-budget sci-fi and alien invasion movies in general, so was hoping for an 'us versus them' kind of vibe.I haven't read the book, so perhaps anyone who has will already know what I found out namely that the film is basically all about Ender who's training to fight a second (alleged) alien attack on Earth. And train he does. About 75% of the film is about him in a sort of space school/boot camp. He doesn't do that much fighting of aliens.Apparently we (Earth) need kids to fight for us. This is because er we just do, okay? Moving on And, while these wonderkids are preparing to take on every last intergalactic nasty, they spend their time being bullied. Ender gets bullied at his school on Earth. Then he goes home to his family to be bullied by his older brother. Finally, when he makes it to boot camp he's bullied there, too. And, when he shines out among his peers he's then elevated to a squad of cadets including the biggest (or should I say 'smallest?') bully ever to grace the screen.This film is rated '12' here in the UK and I reckon that if I was still a twelve-year-old boy then I would have loved it. Sadly, I'm an adult now and found it all a little boring.But, it's not all so bad. This boy who plays Ender does a really good job and will doubtless grow up to become a pretty big name in Hollywood. Plus you have Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley – both of which turn in typically excellent performances.Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure it'll find an audience somewhere. Now I just need to know where I can play 'zero gravity Quasar' – I may not be twelve any more, but that looks like serious fun!",Ender's Game
30,g-bodyl,A Faithful Book Adaptation!,9,31 December 2014,"Ender's Game is a rather faithful adaptation from the source material, well about as faithful one could hope for. The book itself is a very conceptual book and I was pleased many of the themes were prevalent in the movie. Themes on friendship and war are the biggest themes on display here. The visuals are fantastic and it shows how far the visual effects game has gone. The battle room, which features zero gravity, rendered me speechless at the awe of the film.Gavin Hood's film is based off this kid named Ender Wiggins, who is prone to reactive violence and possess the skills of a fearless leader, according to Colonel Graff. He is also very fond of his sister. Ender finally gets accepted to Battle School, where he is trained to become a leader. One that will follow in the footsteps of Mazer Rackham in defeating the Formics, a group of genocidal aliens bent on destroying Earth.The film has a very strong cast and they do well. Asa Butterfield wasn't exactly the Ender my mine pictured, but he did blow me away. Harrison Ford returns to his sci-fi roots as Colonel Graff and he does excellent, especially when he belittles Ender. Hailee Steinfeld does very well as one of Ender's few friends, Petra. We also get solid performances from the veterans Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis.Overall, Ender's Game is a very good movie with very conceptual themes remaining intact. 2013 was a very strong year for science fiction and fantasy films, and the film continues that trend in a positive direction. The movie, in addition to having a strong story, has excellent visuals. The battle scenes are very well-done. As a YA-adaptation, the film works more of an action movie and that is always a good thing in my book. I would love to see more of Ender as he faces the aftermath of the respective Battle and Command Schools. I rate this film 9/10.",Ender's Game
31,cricketbat,Feels a little rushed,6,21 September 2018,"Ender's Game has a lot of material to cram into one movie, so it feels a little rushed. Plot points are glossed over, character arcs are limited and the timeline gets a little muddled. The visual effects are great, though. The Battle Room scenes, in particular, are very well done. This isn't the best adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel, but it's probably as good as we're gonna get.",Ender's Game
32,lesleyharris30,"Does Nothing New or Exciting,",4,28 December 2017,"Ender's Game is a very poor film with a lazily written plot and a cast that all seem to be eagerly anticipating their paycheck. It makes no effort to really pull its audience in and tell a properly engaging story. I had a complete lack of care or remorse for every character in this and the situation they were in.It is immensely cliched, not doing anything new or interesting, clearly borrowing material that worked in other Sci-Fi or adventure movies, but not doing them in a way that is half as inspired. It boasts a very decent cast, but it saddens me to say that they are all delivering some of their blandest performances. The likes of Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley and Harrison Ford have certainly proven their worth in previous roles, but they can not do anything to save the immensely poor dialogue here. Did nothing to engage or entertain me. Stale and uninspired, it is in your best interest to give Enders Game a miss.

33,A_Different_Drummer,The most lavish morality play ever set to film,9,18 January 2014,"Elsewhere in the IMDb I reviewed Claire's Knee, one of the many ""morality"" films of Eric Rohmer, at one time considered the master of the genre. Wrong! ENDERS GAME is to Rohmer's work what the Federal Reserve is to an ATM. It is possibly the most elaborate morality play ever filmed, including not only top A-list stars but top CGI effects as well. Plus of course the blessing (and participation) of Orson Scott Card, the author of the original work. Most astonishing of all (to this reviewer) is how the film succeeds in spite of itself. The idea of entrusting children with the future of your planet is both brilliant and counter-intuitive at the same time. And with the sole exception of Asa Butterfield -- who, trust me, has a major career ahead of him if he wants it, he could pass for William Shatner's greatgrandson - the rest of the children are, well, children, and this creates some uncomfortable moments in the film which, I suspect, were NOT intentional. And Harrison Ford was very brave for taking this role because frankly the closeups were not kind -- he is a half-decade younger than the almost-80 Bob Redford (also working these days) but looks older. THE TRUE BRILLIANCE OF THIS FILM, moreso than any other in recent memory, is the way the director allowed it to work simultaneously on the viewer's two natures -- the logical, and the emotional. Through the two hours, your logic tells you that something is amiss and you cannot believe you are tolerating this twisty tale. Yet at the same time, your emotions -- aided by a great sound track, great cinematography, -- and the aforementioned young Asa who more or less carries the entire film on his back -- is having a great old time and really getting into the (completely illogical) story. A very unique work, and one that will not easily be forgotten.",Ender's Game

37,atlasmb,"""Independence Day"" Filmed With Kids, From A Distance",7,5 January 2017,"""Ender's Game"" has some similarities to other films we have seen, with its use of the young-gun-learning-from-the-grizzled-gun-slinger motif (iike ""The Karate Kid"") and the use of games to develop or recruit warriors (like ""The Last Starfighter""). And there are definite similarities to ""War Games"". But the protagonist (Ender) in this film is younger, making it harder to film convincingly.There was one scene where it felt silly to me that such young people were playing adult (military) roles, but otherwise I had no trouble accepting that premise. The film includes wonderful visuals, which could easily have been its downfall; but the real problem is the lack of exposition, which feels like the result of excessive editing. We need believable action based upon the psychology of the characters. ""Ender's Game"" comes up short in this area. The viewer can, in his mind, stitch the scenes of the film together to make a decent whole, but the story is short-changed and it fails to achieve the level of quality it could have had.Despite its visuals, the story is essentially a morality piece, asking the viewer to process the choices that the protagonist makes on his quest to achieve his goal. It can be difficult to put the audience in the mind of the hero, but that is especially true when they are not given enough clues to his thought processes.This is a film worth seeing, but it could have been much more.",Ender's Game
38,tabuno,A Surprisingly Deeply Emotive and Substantive Sci Fi Action Thriller,8,16 January 2019,"31 October 2013. Curiously enough Starship Troopers (1997) and Star Trek (2009) have similar parallels in plot outline and action sequences, yet with a huge difference. The dichotomy between even younger cadet students, the focus on younger, more pliable, but creative, out of the box minds and the older, aging generation of warriors offers a fascinating psychological and moralistic interplay. The emotive and deeper substantive emotive and philosophical, humanistic issues at play here provide a much more solid and meaningful foundation making this movie pertinent and relevant to a mass audience.Three minor weaknesses appear in this movie that don't really diminish the overall impact of the quality of this movie: Below average set designs and special effects especially at the beginning of the movie, the less than convincing training of the Dragon Team, and less than emotionally compelling and appealing huge change of Ender's mind in the movie. However, there is a wonderfully interesting and strangely emotionally riveting shot of a world in transformation at the end of the movie that speaks powerfully, much more than a transformative planet scene from an earlier Star Trek movie.Ender's persona is one of the most fascinating to be presented on screen and depending one's perspective this maudlin and politically correct movie or perceptively astute middle way movie that contains an especially sharp edge to both its violence and compassion, usually lacking in most action, adventure movies and reserved for theatrical dramas for the screen. When Orson Scott Card wrote the original novel upon which this movie was based in 1985, it was among the leading edge of sci fi and the fusion of creative ideas of space warfare and alien communication (or perhaps the ""apparent"" lack of it) taken from this book and incorporated into this movie remain fresh and excitingly potent.There is a unique sci fi bench mark set in this movie in terms of sci fi psychology and the human psyche as The Matrix (1999) set in terms of virtual reality and Avatar (2009) and Inception (2010) in terms of visual effects or even Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) in terms of a revealing hard core sci fi alien plot element. Ender's Game might be compared to the youthful version of Gerard Butler's Gamers (2009), a hard-edged futuristic, high-tech, new wave sci fi movie, some resemblance to a less hard-hitting 2002 sci fi movie adapted from the classic juvenile book A Wrinkle In Time or a sci fi version of the parallel fantasy movies The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005) and The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) which is also based on C.S. Lewis books which focus on deeper humanistic issues.",Ender's Game
39,The-Sarkologist,Exploring the nature of the pre-emptive strike,8,11 December 2013,"This is a movie based on a best selling book by Orson Scott Card, and it is interesting that when this particular author is mentioned there is always an outcry against his position on homosexuality. While I am tolerant of homosexuality and will tend not to make statements as controversial as Card may have done, I do feel that the same tolerance that I am showing to the LGBT community is the same form of tolerance that is shown towards Card. In fact it sounds as if the producers of this movie deliberately kept Card away from its production due to a potential backlash from certain groups who are threatened by his views, and this is a man who is a self proclaimed Democrat, communitarian (I note that he does not use the term communist, but his description makes it sound like a less Stalinist version). While I may not agree with his Mormon beliefs, I do not find him anywhere near as objectionable as some people claim him to be (and I assure you that there are worse people out there than Card).As for the movie, I thought it was brilliant. Earth has been attacked by a race of aliens known as the Formic, and by a bit of luck, were beaten off. However, the people of Earth have decided that they need to act to prevent another such tragedy, and begin a rigorous training program to find a general that will lead them to victory against the Formic and they do this by recruiting children and testing them through the use of games which become progressively harder, and more realistic.The movie follows the life of a boy named Ender, and the military minds who are watching his progress. It is clear that Ender has an exceptional tactical mind, but it is also clear that he is not a warrior and does not have the mentality of a warrior, which makes it difficult for the military to use him to meet their objectives – which is why they end up disguising the operations as games and military exercises, and why they also work exceptionally hard to hide the truth about his actions from him.The key to this is the idea where at the beginning of the movie he knocks down a bully, and then proceeds to continue to kick him not to exact vengeance or uncontrolled anger on him, but to prevent him from getting up again. This is an aspect of violence that many people do not understand. When you win a fight, you do not necessarily defeat your opponent, but rather you end up angering your opponent who then looks for the opportunity to seek revenge against you. It is an endless cycle that ends up going nowhere.However, despite the attitude of Ender in that he only fights to defend himself, it is clear that the Earth military are seeking vengeance. In the final battle Ender notices that the enemy are not attacking, and they only attack when he makes the first move. There are a number of instances in the film where he makes the first move in a simulated battle, however it is clear that this is simulated and the first movie needs to be made. However, in the real battle (which is disguised as a game) this is not the case, however because he believes that it is a simulation he believes that this is a case where the first move needs to be made.This is a film which is about battle and about military tactics, however it also questions the need for a pre-emptive strike. While Ender does make some strikes in this film, it is clear that it is in a battle situation, however there is a different situation where, as is clear in the final scene, or at least revealed in the final scene, that this is not a battle in a war, but it is a final strike against an enemy who has already fallen and is not willing to get up again. This is why Ender is so sickened at the outcome at the end because he is not kicking him to prevent him from getting up again, but taking out vengeance against an opponent that has already been defeated.",Ender's Game

It has the main plot, themes and characters all portrayed very well. It also cuts out the pointless Demosthenes and Locke subplot. However, my main criticism is the casting of the main character Ender. This actor seems too dull.

41,leonblackwood,Disappointing! 4/10,4,15 March 2014,"Review: I really didn't like this movie. The director wasted so much time on the kids training. I struggled to stay awake because I didn't find the storyline that interesting and the kid was quite annoying. Near the end it gets pretty ridiculous and the kid ends up getting over confident and cocky. If the director would have got on with the core of the storyline except of watching kids battling against each other, it might have been a better movie. Harrison Ford didn't get used to his full ability, like Ben Kingsley who plays a strange Australian pilot. Anyway, in all I didn't enjoy this movie at all and I won't be watching the sequel, unless the kid becomes an adult. Disappointing!Round-Up: I had big hopes for this movie, but once again I was thoroughly let down. The CGI wasn't bad and I did enjoy watching Harrison Ford being cold as ice, but the storyline was appalling, along with the whole of the dull tone of the movie. Harrison Ford is the best thing in the movie and in some ways, it did remind me of Star Wars when they were watching over the little kid who eventually becomes Anakin Skywalker. I'm sure that there is going to be a sequel, judging by the ridiculous ending, but it was a waste of a big budget. I haven't heard anything good about this movie from the critics, so I don't stand alone when I say that it could have been much better.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $112millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there zero to hero space movies about a kid saving the world. 4/10",Ender's Game
42,TheMovieDiorama,Ender's Game strategised an adaptation that annihilated its own source material.,4,9 February 2020,"Obliteration. Destruction. Decimation. War, in all its principles, sets out to bring peace through nihilistic chaos. Battles commanded by lieutenants whom implement strategies to garner victories amongst enemies. Followers obeying orders from leaders, like ants instinctively abiding by queens. Brute strength alone cannot muster peace, intrinsic intelligence must also be integrated, creating that much desired harmonious balance.Card's original sci-fi novel sits among the very best of its genre. Portraying tacticians through propagandism. Manipulating the youth into battling endless hordes of simulated aliens. Granting ""Ender"" an opportunity like no other. To lead a galactic army. Hood's adaptation is fuelled with cosmically arresting visuals, grandiose battleships flooding the backdrop of Ender's zero-gravity training montages. Pitted in gunfire tournaments, enabling strategies of war to come bursting through the metallic shielding surrounding the spherical arena. Gorgeously rendered rag-doll bodies obeying the laws of physics when paralysed without any noticeable green screen. Intensely designed swarms of insectoid characteristics rapture the atmospheric skies, providing aerial excitement throughout.Alas, for all its technical merit, Hood's adaptation is unable to tackle the bulk of Card's story in a captivating manner. Ender's Game is treated much like the ""mind game"" that the titular character uncovers. Ender and his peers are all one-dimensional, with the ironic emotional capacities of ants. The morality conflict that resides within Ender, as he becomes occasionally inflicted with rage, failed to exert any kinetic energy. Partly due to Butterfield's mellow pubescent performance, but mostly due to the expositional screenplay that treats its characters like chess pieces. Clinical without an ounce of relatability towards anyone. Seriously hindering the conclusive nature of the story, which just so happens to be a terrible ending regardless.The older generation of actors unfortunately looked bored, particularly Davis and Kingsley. Ford gives a decent enough performance, albeit monotonous. The constant shift between batches of characters, especially the transition between Ender's preliminary training and the subsequent promotion, skewed the pacing even further. And again, that ending was atrocious. Never mind the conclusive narration that unimaginatively left the film open-ended. Just the entire simulated ordeal in itself was handled poorly. Not to mention the obscene absence of authority from all actors involved. Shouting loudly isn't authoritative. It's annoying.In the end (heh heh), this simulated game falls short in the tactical psychology of warfare that Card's novel lovingly produced. Fantastical visuals can't disguise wooden acting and flimsy storytelling. Ender should've just called it quits at the beginning.",Ender's Game

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A light-speed adaptation reined in by brilliant visuals and a strong grasp of the heart of Card's classic,8,11 November 2013,"It's been nearly 30 years since ""Ender's Game"" etched itself into the canon of important science-fiction novels, and like so many important science-fiction novels, a film adaptation has toiled in movie development hell, with the ""unfilmable"" label frequently cast upon it. Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") has taken a stab at adapting and directing Orson Scott Card's classic, and with a bold vision, he manages to capture its essence in spite of how narrowly he clears the hurdles of the adaptation.Timing could not have been more perfect for an adaptation of ""Ender's Game."" The popularity of stories featuring teens training for battle and alien invasion films in combination with today's visual effects capabilities created the perfect storm to finally warrant Ender a green light. The story takes place after Earth was nearly destroyed at the hands of an alien race called Formics, and decades later, we have prepared by training our youngest and brightest in the event that they return, to find a leader capable of eliminating the threat. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is young boy who has been scouted by Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) and Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) for the military's elite battle school. He catches their eye because he exhibits unusual genius but also has tendencies toward both courage and ferocity as well as compassion and empathy. They push him through rigorous tests of character and skill to see if he might really be the one.Pushing through also appears to be the motto behind Hood's script. He strings together a number of well-constructed scenes that either inform us about Ender or challenge him in some way, but the film bulldozes through them, practically shoving Ender into his destiny. There are plenty of low-key moments that are unmistakably character-building in nature, but the film's forward momentum is so strong that there's little time to stop and look around, to live in the fascinating world of the movie.Surprisingly, the film doesn't suffer that much for its breakneck pace. Although it would have been nice to see more of the captivating zero-gravity battle room sequences, or have more time to completely grasp the budding friendships between Ender and his schoolmates including Hailee Steinfeld as Petra Arkanian, Hood does a nice job identifying the core themes and universal elements of the story and getting them across with effective storytelling devices.Most of this is as it relates to Ender. A victim of bullying who knows how to turn the tide in his favor, Ender is torn between the ruthlessness it takes to win and the monstrous toll it can take on ones conscience. He strives to be the balance between his older brother Peter's (Jimmy Pinchak) aggression and his old sister, Valentine's (Abigail Breslin) sensitivity. The way Butterfield manages to portray this inner conflict, which is the film's only real ""sub-plot,"" suggests he won't be the kind of child actor who disappears after his teens.Entertainment value, however, rates highest of all that ""Ender's Game"" has to offer. Hood's vision of Card's world is rich to look at, with outstanding production design that blends sleek, stylish sci-fi elements with tangible technology. You're never once distracted or surprised by the futuristic elements of the film because they blend so well. Battle room choreography and the other sequences that play off technology benefit as a result.Something dissatisfying lingers and lurks about the film as it goes, like you feel cheated each time it takes a big step forward, but sometimes wanting to see more of a film is not a sign of a failed adaptation but of a great one. It would be a stretch to call Hood's adaptation great, but it's to the point and it manages to do the most important parts of the story — the themes — justice. It's not easy to make a movie adaptation that both meets the PG-13 blockbuster requirements of a studio and effectively communicates the mature themes of the source material. ""Ender's Game"" does it, and in less than two hours at that.Considering ""Ender's Game"" was once difficult to imagine in one's head, the fact that it comes together on screen in something of a miracle, regardless what you think of Hood's decision- making in actually getting it from one to the other. Plot-wise it leaves something to be desired, but the film achieves so much on a visual level without losing sight of the social message that Card meticulously crafted it to say. When it comes to films with weighty expectations, filmmakers have failed much worse.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Ender's Game
45,Vartiainen,"Looks pretty, but doesn't work as an adaptation",5,13 January 2014,"Ender's Game was never an easy book to adapt into a movie. It covers several years of time from the point of view of a young, growing boy, so having a single, identifiable child actor was always going to be difficult. And many of those years were important so you couldn't just skip over them, although this movie largely did just that, which pretty much killed any value or depth in it.Not that I blame them for doing so, because it could have worked. Asa Butterfield hits that right butter zone, no pun intended, where he is old enough to be a capable actor, theoretically, but he isn't too old for a movie that's all about child soldiers. Compressing the timeline within a year allows Butterfield to play the lead throughout the entire film, though it creates the slightest sense of ""why didn't they start this whole process sooner?"" There's some handwaving involved, but it's not enough. Still, it's a tough problem and I can't blame them for trying.Unfortunately it still leaves us with the problem of there not being enough character development. Ender's Game was always all about, well, Ender. It was his journey, and we followed as he grew up, learned from his mistakes, achieved victories. But when the movie isn't even two hours long - a bawling choice if there ever was one - we don't get to see much of that growth, which begs the question ""What then?"" What else is there to show if the film makers apparently decided that Ender's growth doesn't warrant much screen time? Apparently special effects and flashy sets drew the long stick, as they're very much in front. This creates a weird paradox, because the actual book described to Battle School as a very sterile place. White and cold, a very utilitarian military feeling, yet there was a lot of going on on a personal level. Whereas in the movie there's too much flashiness on a visual level, but the character interactions feel sterile. Not the right call, film makers.I really think that this movie would have benefited from an extra half an hour. Now everything feels shoehorned in and we don't get enough time or space to mull over things. It's supposed to be this big dramatic movie about using children as instruments of war, but the film tries to force the message down our throats through heavy dialogue and exposition. Not the right way to do pretty much anything. If you like the book, this isn't your movie. If you're looking for a visually pleasing scifi film, I've seen worse.",Ender's Game

47,Turfseer,Battlestar Galactica meets Lord of the Flies as absurd premise of kid space cadets fighting aliens sinks this flick from the get-go,3,5 May 2014,"After watching 'Ender's Game' for the first five minutes and understanding the film's premise, my immediate reaction was 'Yikes!— look's like I'm in for a long ride.' Yes I must confess that my initial impression that the premise was ludicrous, was borne out by the rest of the plot and attendant hokey character machinations. Why exactly does humanity choose to employ children to battle insect-like aliens (aka Formics) who attacked and almost successfully destroyed earth fifty years earlier? That's a good question for Orson Scott Card, the author of the original source material, who wrote the book (of the same title) which the movie is based on. It's an easier question for profit-hungry producers, who speculated that allowing prepubescent kids to act out their fantasies in what essentially is one monotonous video game on screen, would translate into mega-profits at the box office. At the end of the day, 'Ender's Game', only made a very small profit due to its reliance on a slew of computer generated effects.As for the Ender's plot, it revolves around a kid who has the same apocalyptic sounding name (does it mean he 'ends' the threat of the alien invasion or earth is at an end?) Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin (played by an overly intense Asa Butterfield), is a cadet who catches the eye of Commander Graff, who sees potential in the reserved and thoughtful twelve or thirteen year old. Graff is played by Harrison Ford who manages to be unpleasant throughout, barking orders at Ender and generally conforming to the script's call to play the boss as a boorish martinet. While in a regular training school, Ender gets into his first physical confrontation with classmate Stilson, after defeating him in a space ship simulation. He also impresses Graff's subordinate, Gwen Anderson, when he figures out how to defeat a giant troll-like creature in a 'mind game' program designed as a no-win scenario (the CGI-effects here, along with a later scene involving one of Ender's visions, are perhaps the best parts of the film). Ender then graduates to the much more fancy battle school where students fire laser guns at each other in a giant sphere dubbed the 'Battle Room' in a zero gravity atmosphere. Kids who love video games will probably find all of this endearing but for me, most of it reminded me of the typical dated paeans to military school cadet culture (here now with the students dressed up in spacesuits). When Ender is appointed the 'commander' of his own band of 'misfits' and defeats his former commander, Bonzo Madrid (no, not Bonzo the chimp!) in one of those battles inside the sphere, the second clichéd fight occurs between the two afterward, inside a shower room. Ender decides it's 'Bedtime for Bonzo' after he puts Madrid into a coma (again Commander Braff is impressed by Ender channeling his hardly utilized inner Rambo).Ender ends up being promoted to Commander of all forces and is transferred to a base of a former Formic colony. There he meets Rackham, the legendary commander who found the key to defeating the Formics in the epic battle fifty years ago. Ben Kingsley manages to out growl Harrison Ford, as another over aggressive mentor assisting the heralded lap dog, Ender (and yes, Kingsley's atrocious tattoos all over his face, are certainly not endearing at all). I have no guilt feelings about revealing the film's deus ex machina, so SUPER SPOILERS are ahead: the simulation that Ender (along with all of his pals from Battle School) engage in, which annihilates the Formic planet, was for real. Thus Graff turns out to be a true martinet, a stand-in for over-aggressive, right wing, American military types. Ender, however, feels horribly guilty about being duped into wiping out the Formics. He realizes that the earlier mind game scene he involves himself in, is right outside the base and after encountering a dying Formic Queen, he vows to take the Queen's egg and colonize a new world with it. Ender justifies his actions by claiming that the Formics attempted to communicate with him, before Graff and his minions did their 'dirty work'. The problem is the Formics did indeed try to destroy the earth's population but the film's scenarists provide no explanation as to the original reason for the invasion. Therefore, Ender's assumption that their attempt to communicate is not justification enough for him to save the Formic species. Ender is unable to refute Graff, who implicitly argues that any attempt to communicate could very well have been a ruse. Unfortunately, the idea of kids being put in charge of a fighting team in place of adults, seems to be an absurd conceit. And at a certain point, it isn't difficult to figure out that the filmmakers intentionally allowed Ender to take the moral high ground after he gets oh so 'touchy feely' with the that one last Formic egg (damning Graff for encouraging the kids' aggression, deceiving them but not explaining why he was wrong in the first place about the danger of another Formic invasion).There were a few moments here and there which were nicely done, particularly Ender's mind game where he encounters the Formics for the first time inside the castle that was destroyed during the initial invasion. But watching juveniles beat each other up or blast one another in simulated war games, was not my cup of tea. This despite the films' scenarists wishful thinking that killing is bad if you don't give a dangerous, former adversary, a chance to redeem themselves, in the face of the flimsiest of evidence. Others might dub all this 'liberalism run amok'; as for me I'll simply return this disc to Netflix as fast as possible and move on to something more worthwhile!",Ender's Game
48,BeneCumb,Moralizing Star Trek for schoolchildren,6,10 February 2014,"I have not read the book, I knew nothing about the plot, thus I sat to watch it with an open mind (usually I do either-or as I like to follow unknown twists). But the outcome was the following: many good and distinct performances (Butterfield, Ford, Davis, Kingsley, Steinfeld - in particular), lots of political correctness (different races-genders-religions included), hypocritical approaches-attitudes (child warriors are good everywhere, aren't they?) and visual over-sophistication (all this technology and weaponry). All wrapped in an elaborate package and apparently meant to encourage not-so-popular youngsters with strong characters and high ambitions...

51,freemantle_uk,A Fine Thematic Sci-Fi Flick,8,30 October 2013,"As the saying goes, War is hell and apparently so is adapting teen novels. For every success like The Hunger Games, we get a movie much like The Host. Based on what is considered one of the greatest sci-fi novels ever written, Gavin Hood delivers an entertaining mix of The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Starship Troopers, with his adaptation of Ender's Game.50 years after Earth repelled an invasion from an ant like alien race called the Formics, Earth's society has become highly militarised, fearing a second invasion. From a young age, children are taught using computer games to develop military skills and fight a future war. These children and teenagers minds have become so advanced and intelligent, that they're able to process data and comprehend much more than most adults can.Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is a skilled cadet at the International Fleet and is being groomed by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) to be the great leader to win the war against the Formics. Ender is taken to Battle School, where Ender rapidly rises up the ranks. Though Ender's tactical ability is never in doubt, he has an internal crisis between his violent and humane sides.Ignoring the controversy involving Orson Scott Card and his vile views, Ender's Game is well structured sci-fi movie. Director Gavin Hood has shown a massive improvement to his previous effort X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with improved storytelling, substance and special effects. Hood assembles a dream cast with the likes of Butterfield, Ford, Viola Davis, Hailee Steinfeld and Sir Ben Kingsley just to name a few. As expected from a cast of that calibre, most of the cast give strong performances, centred around Butterfield performance, given a difficult role of someone who is emotionally cold, highly intelligent and has to show what he is feeling with subtle looks: and Butterfield does it well, showing his talent at his young age. The character of Ender himself does come off as someone who is simply perfect at everything he does.The screenplay does keep to the structure of a novel, as it is easy to tell when chapters would have start: we go from Ender seemingly being kicked out of school, Ender getting emitted to Battle School, Ender joining a team, Ender commanding his own team, etc... Ender's Game sticks very much to its themes about this military society and the effects on the youth. Throughout the movie there are constant themes of manipulation, from Colonel Graff's manipulation of Ender, Ender's manipulation of other students and the culture of competition within teams and against teams. This theme also leads to the emphasis and expectations placed upon Ender, the effects on him and the doubts it might cause, as we look at an extreme of overbearing education.Hood improves massively as an action director and has always shown what he is capable with the dramatic elements. The stand out set pieces are the zero gravity training sequences, as it showcases the evolution of the students and their ability for tactics in a 3D environment, accompanied with Steve Jablonsky's soaring score where he uses his Inception style horns. The final battle is a tense and well crafted sequence with excellent CGI.For a movie based on a popular and critically acclaimed novel that is revered by many, it felt like some parts of the story were only given the briefest look. Moments that were only hinted at were Ender's older brother's violent tendencies and it is only near the end when there is a debate about the Formics and their motives. But Card himself was a producer, so he must have signed off or approved the changes.While Ender's Game does have solid action set-pieces, the movie is at its best focusing on its themes and character development, working as a moral tale and a compelling sci-fi story. For a movie that will be shoehorned into the teen genre, it is a going to be one of the strongest because of the strength of the story, performances and source material.",Ender's Game
52,stevendbeard,Thought Provoking Sci-Fi,7,1 November 2013,"I saw ""Ender's Game"", starring Asa Butterfield-Hugo, The Wolfman-2010; Harrison Ford-Cowboys & Aliens, Force 10 From Navarone; Hailee Steinfeld-Romeo and Juliet-2013, True Grit-2010; Abigail Breslin-The Call, Zombieland and Ben Kingsley-Iron Man 3, Hugo.This is a movie based on a 1985 book by Orson Scott Card-FYI: There has been talk about people protesting the film because of the personal views of Mr. Card; he is anti-gay. The story takes place years after an alien invasion of the Earth. The aliens-ant like creatures-were eventually defeated by the courage and skill of a single fighter pilot-in the right place at the right time, kind of like Randy Quaid in 'Independence Day'. But, they decided that it would be best if they started preparing for a return engagement; you know how ants always come back. Harrison is in charge of the recruiting and it is decided that the best chance of winning would be to start using younger cadets, since they have the ability to think fast and they have fast reflexes, probably due to all the video games they play. Asa is the top contender and is sent through basic training with other kids his age. Hailee is a fellow cadet, Abigail plays his sister, back on Earth, and Ben plays one of the trainers during the sessions. Ben sports head and facial tattoos that are sort of like a road map to his personal ancestry of his home back in New Zealand. The training sessions resemble video gaming and there is more to the storyline than you would expect, including a discussion of the dilemmas of war and there is a nice little twist at the end. FYI: The US Marine Corps has 'Ender's Game' on their recommended reading list for officers because of the lessons in training methodology, leadership and ethics. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Ender's Game

54,drqshadow-reviews,"Beautiful but Passionless, it Never Really Gets Off the Launchpad",5,30 January 2014,"Falling somewhere between The Hunger Games and The Last Starfighter, Ender's Game plops us down on an authoritarian, near-future Earth that's still reeling from an alien infestation some seven decades earlier. This generation's children, limited by mandate like modern-day China, dream of one day participating in the orbital war games tasked with producing the next five-star general, and our protagonist (Ender) is the cream of the crop. Though steeped in lore and a long, rich back story, just like the novel, I was taken aback by just how much screen time was devoted to laying this groundwork. Maybe I'm spoiled by recent films, such as Pacific Rim, who manage to effectively build a similar world in just a five-minute opening narrative sequence, but it seems a colossal waste of time to still be working on the preamble midway through the second act. That gives the impression that we're just getting started when, in reality, the plot is already nearing its crescendo. It's a very literal interpretation of the source, with many lines and plot points arriving verbatim from the printed page, but plays as extremely hollow and emotionally detached. Much of that can be attributed to Ender himself, an admittedly nuanced, complicated character that fails to make a graceful transition to the screen. Despite spotting several flashes of myself in his actions, I never empathized with him as an individual, nor did I like him on a basic level. This is a production that deserves points for tackling an extremely difficult property - I was sure the scenes of the game itself would make or break it, when they did neither - but one that, apart from a thoroughly excellent visual effort, falls just short of the mark in every way. It's not a bad effort, but the lack of warmth, depth and power leaves it with a stiflingly bland flavor.Fresh thoughts after a recent re-watch (9/2019):This long-simmering adaptation of an award winning sci-fi classic stays loyal to its source material, but loses a ton of emotion in the translation. Its version of a future Earth, one generation removed from near-extinction at the hands of an invading alien fleet, isn't a particularly romantic one, but that doesn't mean it has to be this joyless. Everything's so dry and analytical, every plot point over-explained and talked to death, while the book's most exciting chapters are merely skimmed.Where we get them, the special effects come through exceptionally well. The game room, where the planet's unified military force trains its cadets for interstellar combat, doesn't look exactly like I'd imagined, but still makes for a rich scene or two. Space launches have immense power and impact. Zero gravity fight scenes play out in unique ways. There's an awful lot of untapped potential here; ideas and concepts that are properly explored in the novel, merely served as a garnish and tossed aside.And maybe a focus on the human element could have been the right call, given the right cast to really dig in; a good script to touch on the more delicate metaphors; a capable director to pull everything together. Three strikes in that regard. With a stiff, off-putting young Asa Butterfield in the leading role, plus a disengaged Harrison Ford and a barely-there Ben Kingsley as support, nobody seems interested in picking up the ball for a run at the goal line. It's an uncertain film, one that never completely settles on an identity, and it honestly isn't much fun to watch. A missed opportunity.",Ender's Game

Even Orson Scott Card says they stuck to the basic book - So if the Author thinks that, then I can deal with it as well.So - Asa Butterfield, aka ""Hugo"" is in another film with his Hugo Co- Star Gandhi, aka Ben Kingsley. And Harry Ford is looking OK just shy of what, 70? And ready for another Star Wars adventure, I think.What I liked about this film was the mixing of Child Actors and the older actors, who we've seen over and over, so there is a lot to anchor on here- We see these kids, in ""Battle School"" and we see their Teacher Colonel Graff, so I can handle the Unknown Kids factor much better.Most astonishing is the appearance of Abigail Breslin as ""Valentine"" being the exact same little girl she was in ""Signs"" - She becomes the way the ""Buggers""/""Formics"" can get into Ender's Mind.The other total standout here is Hailee Steinfeld, who I thought was a better Mattie Ross for True Grit than the original actress in the John Wayne version. Her Petra is perfect for this film, I don't think anyone else could have done it as well.And this is the big MacGuffin of the film and of the book - Ender thinks he has stumbled into a Game loaded into his school ""iPad"" - But his ""Game"" is more related to what is really happening in his universe than what Graff and later ""Mazer Rackham"" (Kingsley) are telling him.And he has to figure this out, but he is being tricked, as we are being tricked by the clever underlying story of the book.In fact, during the first battle with the Formics, Mazer had learned something important, something which Ender is learning through his Game. In fact, Mazer is tricking Ender into playing His game, while Ender is being shown the Real Game in his device.When it comes down to it, we can either blow up our enemies into molecule sized chunks and obliterate them forever, or we can find a way to talk to them, even if they do not have Mouths and cannot Scream.",Ender's Game
56,alindsay-al,a great sci fi,8,14 October 2014,"My favourite genre of film is that of sci fi and this is a very good sci fi that I advise everybody gives a shot. This story sees earth barely survive a war with aliens thanks to the heroics of one commander, now the military want a new inspirational commander and they believe young kid ender is the one to fulfill this goal. Now the kid they got to play ender does a fantastic job in the role as he manages to combine the smarts he has with a realistic personality to make us think he is a good leader and that we should be rooting for him all the way. The supporting cast is a mixed bag with Harrison ford doing an awesome job and proving he is a great actor, his chemistry with ender was really goof and their dialogue together felt really natural and flowed well. Another good performance is that of sir Ben kingsley even though he is not in the film that he much he does a good job with the screen time he gets and his chemistry with ender was pretty good too. Now there is a sort of love interest in the film but the actress they got to play the girl wasn't great and they never really committed to it showing that she was a bit of a throwaway character. Another character that annoyed me a bit is enders sister Valentine played by Abigail breslan, and even though she isn't in the film that much her whole point of being in the plot is pointless and I don't like the way her character affected the film. The story is okay I really liked the battle school scenes and I do wish there was more of it, also the Harrison ford relationship part of the plot was done well. But once again I didn't like the whole romance and sister part of the story and I also thought the ending was quite abrupt and not entirely fulfilling. The script is really good with great dialogue scenes with ender, ford and kingsley providing a great launching pad for this film. The style is also great with the tech looking cool and the whole idea of the school system being intriguing ans unique to this sci fi. Overall I really liked enders game and I think anybody who sees this film will feel this way too.",Ender's Game
57,estebangonzalez10,It manages to rival After Earth as the worst sci-fi film of 2013,4,9 January 2014,"""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.""I honestly don't understand some of the love this film is receiving considering how bored I was through the entire running time. The philosophy in this film didn't make much sense for me either and nothing in this sci-fi world felt believable. It was like having to sit through watching my little brother play one of his video games. Gavin Hood has received a lot of hate for his 2009 Wolverine film, but I was a huge fan of his South African film Tsotsi so I did have some hope for this. I guess he should stick to smaller productions because big scale films don't seem to work for him. The screenplay is based on Orson Scott Card's famous book of the same name which I never had heard of so I can't rate this based on its faithfulness to it. What I can say is that there isn't really anything thought provoking about it, which is some of the praise the book received. Here the themes are lost under all the CGI and extended action scenes. There are a lot of child actors in this film, which also hurt it a bit despite how much I like Abigail Breslin, Asa Butterfield, and Hailee Steinfeld. I didn't find anything spectacular form Harrison Ford's performance either, although I understand all the excitement from fanboys getting to see him back in space again. I just found this film hard to endure at times and found it a bit too grim and serious considering the subject matter.Seventy years after an alien race known as the Formics attacked Earth and almost wiped out its existence if it weren't for Commander Mazer Rackham's (Ben Kingsley) heroics, Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) has been preparing a troop for the next attack. He has decided to attack the Formics at their home ground before they come back and destroy them, and in order to do so he has been training young children in hopes of discovering the next Mazer. He believes the one is Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a very quiet and shy boy who has unique strategizing skills. Graff brings him to space to begin his training at a battle school along with other elite kids like Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), Bean (Aramis Knight), Alai (Suraj Partha), and Bonzo (Moises Arias). Ender quickly shows his potential as he masters the training games by understanding the enemy. Despite Graff's assurance that Ender is the chosen one, Ender still fears he might fail because he hasn't quite understood the real enemy's motivation. Will he be able to save the human race? Are the Formics still a threat to humanity? These are questions racing through Ender's head as he begins to dislike who he's shaping up to be.I found Ender's Game to be one of the worst sci-fi pics of the year along with After Earth. There was nothing really thought provoking about it for me and it completely failed to engage me. This seems to be only the first chapter to a franchise I'm not really looking forward to enduring. I don't even feel inspired to write a proper review for this film and I don't really have much to say about it. There is no charm or appeal found here, and I never bought into the drama. The story could've at least used some dramatic tension to draw me in, but I never felt anything worth engaging in here.",Ender's Game
58,pixrox1,This kid's crusade . . .,7,4 November 2013,". . . may appeal to a slightly older age group than the upcoming Lego flick, but not by much. ENDER'S GAME posits that Han Solo and Ghandi have gone senile, and decided to put the fate of all mankind in the hands of the toughest kid they can find. Furthermore, they do not bother to tell the kid that the lives of ""a thousand"" unseen extras--grown men--are at the mercy of whatever rash decision the child makes in what the adults emphasize is only a ""training exercise."" The alien threat is totally stolen from the original STARSHIP TROOPERS (and TROOPERS author Robert Heinlein), but the only acknowledgment of this plagiarism is a scene in which the adults in the room emphasize that the showers are NOT unisex (as was the case with the forward-thinking TROOPERS), presumably because these child actors are so young they required THREE studio teachers, and ripping off that aspect of TROOPERS would be tantamount to ""kiddie porn."" Still, this derivative piece--while nice to look at in spots--will strain the credulity of anyone over the age of 8 (which constitutes a 3-year edge on the Lego Movie).",Ender's Game

I don't know that the script here really attempts to change that, but the performances naturally soften that edge and make them more palatable.It's an impressive film visually, I really liked Steve Jablonsky's score, and as mentioned the cast really help to humanize their otherwise cold characters. Amazingly the twists remained unknown to me despite the book's age and popularity, though the second one felt inevitable in one form or another.

60,jimbo-53-186511,"It didn't entirely live up to my expectations and is a little bit slow-paced, but some interesting themes are contained within",6,23 May 2021,"Ender Wiggin is recruited by the International Military as the next big hope of leading the fight against the formics - an alien race who threatened Earth 50 years ago and whom may have succeeded had it not been for the heroic actions of former commander Mazer Rackham. Whilst some question whether Ender is up to the task, Colonel Graff sees potential in Ender and is determined that Ender will be the next best thing regardless of the costs...The first half of this film focuses on Ender's training and how he gels with his unit; predictably his journey to leadership is met with cynicism and spectism by some of his colleagues, but eventually this leads to acceptance when the team start to see some of Ender's leadership skills. Naturally, Ender's journey isn't plain sailing and his recruitment process causes a lot of physical and emotional strain on his person. As shown throughout this film it is when Ender's fight or flight instincts kick in that he is at his most devastating, but the Military see this as an advantage and a strength in that he can overcome and destroy anything or anyone that crosses his path which is a vital characteristic for warfare.Whilst there's a lot of positivites to take from Ender's recruitment and training journey it's when you see things from behind closed doors that a slightly darker picture begins to emerge; as with many people who are recruited and trained by government agencies the people they recruit are 'assets' and are therefore expendable. Graff for example is an atypical high-ranking official whom is so obsessed by war and the events that happened 50 years ago that his judgment becomes clouded and he sees war as being the only option and fails to think outside the box. This is given a cruel twist at the end in what I can only describe as a 'reverse-placebo effect' which leaves poor Ender devastated.The acting is good; moreso from the younger actors such as Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld - although everyone does their bit. The visuals and special-effects are top notch. The only things that lets the film down slightly is the direction which was a bit sluggish, the script was also a bit dry and the ending was a bit abrupt.Despite some notable weaknesses, Ender's Game is well-acted, contains some nice visuals and also has some interesting themes and ideology in how some people are affected by preparing for warfare (although this has been covered better in other films). Still it's worth a look - just don't set your expectations too high.",Ender's Game

62,3xHCCH,Twisted Training,6,8 December 2013,"""Ender's Game"" is a science-fiction film about kids being recruited to be soldiers to fight aliens who threaten to destroy humanity. Andrew Wiggin (nicknamed Ender) was the youngest of three siblings, an elder brother Peter who hates him and a sister Valentine who is very devoted to him. Ender was recruited by Coronel Graff when he was observed to have the requisite temperament and leadership potential. He defied all the odds stacked against him by his wits and cunning, and finally being able to successfully destroy his targets in the ultimate simulation test. But he finds out that he has done more than the game he thought he was playing.Lead star Asa Butterfield has grown up taller since his role two years ago in the Oscar-nominated film Hugo under Martin Scorsese. It is impressive that he has these two big films in a row, both with him playing the title role. He is obviously older than the book Ender (by 10 years!), but he was still able to show the vulnerability of this character underneath his military tactical genius. The rest of the cast are an impressive mix of Academy-Award winning or nominated actors. Harrison Ford (nominated for Witness in 1986) energetically plays gruff Coronel Graff. Viola Davis (nominated for The Help in 2011) plays Graff's assistant Maj. Gwen Anderson. Hailee Steinfeld (nominated for True Grit in 2010) plays Ender's training pal Petra. Abigail Breslin (nominated for Little Miss Sunshine in 2006) plays Ender's loving sister Valentine. And finally Ben Kingsley (won for Gandhi in 1982) plays Mazer Rackham, savior of the human race in the second alien attack, who also became Ender's mentor.This film is based on the first novel of what would be a series of five books by Orson Scott Card, aimed for the teenage-young adult crowd. The book contained a lot of psychological analysis of children and violence that underlie the action, which the movie cannot possibly completely convey. The book also had much younger characters than what was shown on screen, like Ender was supposed to have been six years old only. The film nevertheless was a faithful enough adaptation, albeit rushed in parts in the name of cinematic license. It was able to bring to life the action in the training hall and the zero-gravity simulation rooms that would of course rely on the reader's imagination in the book.The film's casting of short and hook-nosed Moises Arias as Bonzo Madrid is also puzzling, since the book describes Ender's tormentor in Battle School to be ""a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage."" Arias is nothing like that physically at all, but the contrast of his Bonzo with Asa's Ender was strikingly ironic.I found it strange that a movie about a devastating alien race never actually shows anything scary about these monsters or what they were supposed to have destroyed on Earth in the past. Instead we see a seemingly gentle and graceful leaf-like insect creature, so as the audience, we are not completely convinced about Ender's mission or Graff's true intentions. So, ""Ender's Game"" is good enough as a sci-fi movie with young adult characters in the lead. For me though, the whole film, even with its spectacular special effects, feels strangely generic, and an amalgam of various similar movies in the past. Maybe I am just not its proper target demographic. 6/10.",Ender's Game
63,peterp-450-298716,The visual part is top notch but in the end the story is as meaningless as a blonde bombshell driving a Smart ...,6,8 February 2014,"There's only one kid on this launch with any brains at all so far, and that's Ender Wiggin.Brace yourself for again a graphically stunning looking SF, with a strong beginning, a story that will make you frown your eyebrows and a fairly disappointing end. It's again based on a book I haven't read. The good news is, it's not a very complicated story. It's not such a story you don't know what it's about, because you didn't read the book in which the details are usually described. You'll notice as the movie progresses that it's a youth book. I couldn't get rid of the impression that this was a kind of ""Harry Potter in Space"". A kind of magic boy possesses certain qualities that adults have long been looking for. He's repeatedly called ""The One"" (an echoing reverberating sound effect wouldn't be out of place here) and is apparently a wet dream of the leader of the cadet school (Harrison Ford). Of course, this little boy is looked at as an emerging hero and hailed for his intelligence that others apparently do not possess cause of a momentary brain disorder. Strange, because after all they also belong to the select group of highly intellectual kids. Well anyway, it leads to resentment, jealousy and hate. But our friend Ender eventually turns the tide and gathers together a fan base to protect the earth's population against the oncoming swarm of Formics.As I said already, this SF is an eye catcher. I bet the ""Special Effects"" department has spent a lot of money on this one. It looks nice, crispy and flashy. As a SF fan you'll start to drool for sure. The comparison with recent works such as ""Oblivion"", ""Elysium"" and ""Prometheus"" is obvious. Even ""Gravity"" is included when it's about the images from space with a beautiful planet at the background. I even got flashbacks from earlier films like ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Independence Day"" and ""The Black Hole"". Generally you can say that it looked fine and worked out into perfection. The space battles in both the simulator and the real one, looked pretty impressive. The alien spacecrafts that moved like a flock of starlings was magnificent to see. And indeed, the heroic deed by Mazer Rackham looked like a duplicate of scenes out of ""Independence Day"".The performances were usually excellent. No Oscar material, but nothing that really annoyed me. Asa Butterfield was a convincing Ender. Harrison Ford was a confident Colonel who has no problem with the fact that they actually are training kid soldiers. Viola Davis, the psychologist on board, was a convincing motherly military. And the rest of the little ones did what they had to do: or they were from the beginning an adoring friend of Ender (Petra and Co) or buggers who immediately began to tease him. Moisos Arias was the best example. In Ender's place, I would have kicked this South American annoying brat into space.The thing that started to annoy me was the content of the story. Indeed it is kept simple and rather childish. Initially I don't have a problem with that. The run-up to the training was fascinating to watch and kept my attention. I just started to question myself about the usefulness of the whole training since later on, they didn't make much use of it anyway. It looked like a sort of ""Quidditch"" but then in space suits. And you could also win the game by getting someone of your own team through the opponents gate, instead of throwing a ball ! It was a pleasure to see the various team members floating around in those glass balls. But that was it. Only some floating around! The idea of those little guys learning a kind of Lasergun teen game and afterwards using real war material to teach those aliens a lesson, kind of felt unreal and surealistic. The lack of explanation about the relationship between Ender and his brother Peter and sister Valentine was kind of a disappointment. I wanted to know more about that. It would have been interesting material. And as a grand finale Ender suddenly transformed into a Good Samaritan and was outraged about the fact they have lied to him. I thought they were preparing him for this task anyway and that he fully understood that. But no, the little fellow got extremely mad and suddenly he unravels the complete mystery and goes on his last mission as Admiral to accomplish a promise he made. Deep disappointment ! I can only conclude that it's a visually delightful film. The story is of a childish level, but is actually still a bridge too far for the youngest. But I found the end a huge letdown that screwed up the rest of the movie.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Ender's Game

Plot - The problem with this movie is that it is too short. I know that not everything that was in the book can be in the movie, but a lot of what they did include was a bit rushed. This kinda makes that overlong boring action scene thing at the end even more annoying. Overall though, this movie retains most of the nuance and intelligence from the book and was extremely entertaining to watch. This movie has an extremely effective twist that is only ruined if you have read the book. Characters - The child actors are actually very good for the most part. Most of the characters are intelligent, making the story very enjoyable. The characters are interesting, though a few of them could've been better developed. Sights and Sounds - The cinematography in this movie is great, as well as the sound design. The effects are all pretty good, except for some dream/game sequences that were so bad that my DVD player automatically decided to skim through them (I didn't touch the remote, the player just skipped past those terrible sequences).Action - The action scenes in this movie are clever and entertaining.

66,lemon_magic,"Beautiful and well acted, but oddly unengaging",7,28 December 2017,"I'll start out by admitting that I started Card's novel, but gave up after the first 100 pages or so because I just couldn't get into it. Nothing against OSC - I thought his novelization of ""The Abyss"" was wonderful - but the ideas and dialog left me cold. Having admitted that, I will also admit to finding my reaction to this movie adaptation puzzling - based on the visuals and Asa Butterfield's amazing acting job as Ender Wiggins, I should have loved it. But my enthusiasm for ""Ender's Game"" was not unbounded, and I blame that on the same problems with the plot that I found in the novel, and on the fact that it was obvious that the film makers could only fit in a ""sketch"" of the full story into the movie.For instance, I was never convinced that a pastime that was essentially ""Zero Gee Laser Tag"" would have all that much to do with massive star fleet battles. Yes, it was fun to watch, and yes, I could see Ender's tactics in the game foreshadowing his tactics in the final invasion - but it seemed like a contrivance. (Ender's interaction with the tablet game as a precursor to the true intent of the Formics was far more convincing). And the whole ""newbie enters the Military academy"" trope has been done to death already. And also, the plot twist about the final training exercise - while it did shake things up, it was essentially ""a dirty bit o' cheating"" in my opinion, and left me completely unsatisfied. Just as Petra's role in the big battle was completely contrived - it was obvious that a voice command and an automated aiming system could have done her role far better. (Nothing against the actress, who was quite likable and sympathetic). Probably the movie should have been expanded to two parts to let the plot development ""breathe"" and expand, but given what it cost to make and the flops of many of its expensive, high-tech contemporaries, I am sure the studio didn't dare. So it is what it is, and my reaction is what it is. Worth watching if you really liked the visuals in bombs like ""Valerian"", ""Jupiter Rising"", or ""John Carter"" enough to overlook the writing problems. Harmless enough even if you didn't.",Ender's Game

Scene-after-scene of training followed by gruff, slow, aging Ford yacking and sympathetic Davis wore thin. The training seemed to be the focus of the movie and becomes feeble and cliché when measured against the aliens themselves and interaction with them which deserved much more coverage. Too much is made of Ender being genius and lethal - much too repetitive. And of course the class bully and training bully are both thrown in. The insect race while not terribly original are well conceived and deserved better. This movie may be adapted from a novel, and I don't know how much it leverages from it, but it needed rework.

Earth has now regrouped and 11-year old Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to lead a team of Children Warriors to once and for all defeat the Formics so they would never again be a threat to Earth. Why the decision to go with youth? As Col Graf (Harrison Ford) explains, ""we need a new kind of soldier. One who doesn't think the way we think."" Hmmm.seems to make sense.

In his free time Ender plays a game on his tablet but doesn't understand why a certain a bird-like creature appears in the game and lures him to a collapsed building. That was not part of the game. He stops the game. The title of this movie being what it is, I thought that Ender Wiggin had a game plan and just needed to complete training to implement that plan when the war was really on.

70,moviexclusive,"Don't go in expecting typical young-adult fare. ""Ender's Game"" is an engaging and visually entertaining adaption of a classic sci-fi novel",8,30 October 2013,"With a rumoured US$100 million production budget, ""Ender's Game"" could be written off as one of the latest in a growing line of high-budget young adult flicks, which its co-producing company Summit Entertainment probably hopes it will be. A more interesting fact is that it's also one of the first films whereby one of the other co-producers is James Cameron's special-effects firm Digital Domain, responsible for creating most of the futuristic sets and backdrops. But visual effects, even in a sci-fi movie, can only go so far in capturing audiences. The source material's acclaim far exceeds that of recent YA successes like ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"": Orson Scott Card's sci-fi novel won both the prestigious Nebula Award and the Hugo Award in 1985 and 1986 respectively, and is also recommended reading for the US Marine Corps.Attempting to give sufficient credit to such a classic novel is director and writer Gavin Hood, best remembered for the unimpressive ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", which received a lukewarm response from critics and audiences alike. This time though, the pieces look to be in place for a box office success. Beyond the lauded source material, he's also got a stellar cast, led by 16-year-old Asa Butterfield, who effectively wields his expressive, bright blue eyes to convey a contradictory mix of childlike vulnerability and a preternatural ruthlessness. These are useful tools for portraying Ender Wiggin, a brilliant boy-genius recruited by the military in a world that is still recovering from the aftermath of an attack by insect-like aliens. The government is somehow convinced that training children barely on the cusp of adolescence in the ways of war will ensure future victory. Employing a combination of relentless physical training, psychological manipulation and social isolation in Battle School, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) are looking to sieve out a suitable leader.Ender appears to have the ideal traits, a result of both nature and nurture. On the one hand his intellect and tactical instinct are innate gifts. On the other, a troubled family background consisting of ambivalent parents, a psychotic older brother and a compassionate sister creates a detached demeanour and an understanding that mercy must be shelved in exchange for a thorough victory. Graff, convinced that Ender is 'The One', pulls no stops in his training and quickly puts him in command of his own platoon. The inter-team battles resemble laser tag in a spherical zero-gravity court, lit in blue neon and dotted with blocks. Ender establishes himself as a leader worth his salt; crushing enemies along the way and swallowing the resultant guilt until an ill-fated showdown with a belligerent team leader Bonzo (Moises Arias) one day throws him off- course. Questioning whether the toll on his psyche is worth all this training to ultimately become a killer, Ender quits, only to change his mind after a rather brief talk with the one person he loves most in the world, his sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin). He moves on to advanced training in Command School under revered war veteran Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley). The script takes on a more existential tone after this point, leading up to the climactic final ""game"" where the theme of morality / oppression in war takes centre-stage.The pacing may be slightly uneven but the film moves fast enough to retain your attention throughout. Visually, most scenes are filtered with bright electric blue lights and warm amber hues set against black space, which feels familiar and reminiscent of ""Tron: Legacy"" – both films share the same production designers, Sean Haworth and Ben Procter. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuarón's astoundingly beautiful ""Gravity"" doesn't do ""Ender's Game"" any favours. That's not to say that it isn't aesthetically impressive on its own; the glossy and clinical sets are believably futuristic and highly pleasing to the eye.Acting-wise, Ford leverages on his grandfatherly gravitas in portraying a man who is convinced that the end he has in mind will justify any means. Alongside him, Butterfield ably holds his own, following his adorable turn in ""Hugo"" with another praiseworthy performance and creating a tense dynamic with Ford that hits the boiling point in the concluding scenes. Abigail Breslin, unfortunately, is underused. Movie adaptations of books invariably result in the loss of certain elements: While Ender's siblings are keenly-developed and complex characters in the novel, the lack of screen time and development in the movie render them as mere placeholders.",Ender's Game

The trailer didn't say much, and gives the film a flat form of being a film for youths. Well it isn't - only. this is a film made with both a heart and a brain. What more can you crave and expect? Not unlike ""The Hunger Games"" in the sincerity, but with a lot more to offer sci-fi wise.What's it about? Young Ender, only 12-13 years of age, is so tactical smart and good at playing games in a future world that needs this ability to make sure the drones with win a war of the worlds. young Ender is the chosen one. Together with the kids he gets military training make sure the end of all future wars. But this is Ender's game, isn't it? I had a blast watching this, expecting it to be mediocre after most of the reviews, but it's better than most reviews, and still not entirely top notch. Why? Because the film actually takes itself a tad too seriously. There's too much of the pathos, maybe thanks to Harrison Ford. He does great, but are maybe too serious. Well, I know it's meant to be serious, and dealing with serious and thoughtful matters, wanting you to give food for thoughts. Still I can see that some will find it up for raspberry nominations due to this.Still I loved so much the visuals in this, that I won't hold that against it. The universe of this film is so brilliantly made, that together with Oblivion and The Lord of the Rings this tells me that no illusion is impossible to make. And it looks as real as can be.Imrpressive also from young Asa Butterfield. It's almost impossible for a guy that young being able to hold up a movie like this. He does great, and only falters a couple of times. Still he is to be young, even in the film. That is the point. Even though the seriousness takes over a couple of times, there's no doubt the cast loved the work in this. Harrison Ford is better than for years! This is Gavin Hoods first memorable film so far. He's on his way up! A couple of quotes was enough for me to watch this again. You don't have to have kids to go watch this, but if you do, bring them! You don't even need the kid inside you, because this is quite grown up film making!",Ender's Game
72,Troy_Campbell,Doesn't live up to its potential.,6,7 December 2013,"Ender's Game is the very definition of middling. Countlessly flip-flopping from fantastic to awful within the blink of an eye, it's an extremely hard motion picture to get a handle on, enjoyment wise. The concept of teenagers leading our world's unified military - adapted from Orson Scott Card's best-selling novel - is intriguing and writer-director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) mines it for surprisingly bleak moments of social commentary, especially in the potent final 20 minutes. For a flick that has been marketed as an adolescent-friendly sci-fi romp, it's assuredly dark and thankfully doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, but, along with some good quality CGI spectacle, this is where the film's strengths largely stop. At the other end of the scale, the acting is woefully subpar. Ranging from lazy and one-note (Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley) to uncomfortable (Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld) to downright absurd (Moises Arias as the prickly Bonzo), there's little to praise in the work of the cast. Mind you, it doesn't help that there's a lot of truly horrendous dialogue that would make even Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis look silly. With the unexpectedly sombre narrative and a gripping finale this should've been brilliant, as is it's a passable futuristic voyage that, frustratingly, doesn't live up to its potential.",Ender's Game
73,gianmarcoronconi,Nice but banal,7,16 August 2021,"Really nice movie for kids even if a bit banal and with a very predictable ending, but apart from that the movie is very nice. You have to overcome the banality of the plot and watch it unpretentious if you want to fully enjoy it.",Ender's Game
74,classicalsteve,Harry Potter Meets Star Wars: Excellent Adaption of One of the Classics of Science Fiction,9,17 November 2013,"Despite any misgivings concerning Orson Scott Card's personal beliefs about controversial subjects, his novel ""Ender's Game"" (TOR, 1985) often shows up in the top 2 or 3 titles of the most loved books among Science Fiction readers. The original novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel, not an easy feat since few have won both awards for the same book. (""Dune"" by Frank Herbert, ""The Left-Hand of Darkness"" by Ursula K. Le Guin, and ""Doomsday Book"" by Connie Willis are a few examples which are double winners.) After many starts and stops over a 20+ year period, ""Ender's Game"" has finally graced the big screen. And it has been worth the long wait.The screen adaptation of ""Ender's Game"" is one of the best among classic science fiction novels. (By contrast, the original ""Dune"" film directed by David Lynch was an atrocious screen version of Herbert's famous novel.) Where ""Ender's Game"" succeeds (and the original ""Dune"" film didn't) was because the former understood the sensibility of the story. While on the surface, the plot seems simple: a young cadet is in training at a kind of military space school. At the same time, the story is much deeper than merely a bunch of kids playing shoot 'em up in a weightless battlefield. Underlying the setting of a training school for pre-teen space soldiers (written over 10 years before Harry Potter) is the idea of how a youth becomes a leader among his/her peers. Is leadership in-born, or is it taught? Or does it come from facing adversity in which the person must find within him or herself the ability to be self-reliant? The administrators of the space school don't believe that leaders are born, but rather can be forged, like a sword. And Earth needs someone forged for the task to stop the alien meanies who threatened to conquer earth. In the last battle, the meanies were stopped by a hero who had the guts and cleverness to use every resource available to ensure victory. To replicate their former hero, they contrive to offer one of their best students a series of experiences which will instill the idea that he is a leader. And that student is Ender Wiggin. The administrators in charge of his experiences are Harrison Ford and Viola Davis who put Ender through a ringer of impossible situations that would be nearly unbearable to almost everyone else. The story is not only about how Ender deals with these experiences at the training school but also how he grows into something a bit different than what the administrators had planned. And after having graduated to different levels of the training school, he meets someone he thought so much larger than life that he can't believe he has met him face-to-face.A beautiful and moving adaption of one of the great science fiction classics. The cast is first rate all-around with exceptional performances by the kids, particularly Hailee Steinfeld as Petra and the highest marks for Asa Butterfield as Ender. The special effects are fantastic, which is to be expected, but they support the story rather than overwhelm it, which seems to be the trend these days for most science fiction offerings. This is one of the few science fiction films that is simultaneously dazzling and moving. A rare find in the annals of SF filmmaking. And as stated by others involved with this film, the message of ""Ender's Game"" has absolutely nothing to do with the author's opinions on other subjects.",Ender's Game
75,phubbs,Ender's Game,5,4 February 2014,"Yep its another film adaptation of a book, and this one sounds weird doesn't it...Ender's Game, what kind of name is Ender?. No I haven't read the book so I can't compare obviously, but I will say straight off the bat that this film did sound very much like a swish version of the old movie 'WarGames'.So in the year 2086 aliens attack the Earth, ravage it but get beaten by the heroics of a bunch of jet fighter pilots (no doubt US ones) and one specific pilot called Ben Kingsley. We see this at the start in a lovely 'Independence Day' rip off which really really does look and feel like a complete rip off right down to how one human manages to bring down the alien mothership. He flies his jet into the ship...yep that's it, he crashes his jet into the underside of it and that somehow manages to completely tear it apart. Wow, after all that time fighting all they had to do was smash a jet into it.Fifty years later and the human race now depends on young children to defend the world against further alien attacks. Yes the powers that be have decided that the worlds smartest scroats, that have been raised on...errr videogames, are the best chance for human survival in the future. So all those hours playing Grand Theft Auto will finally pay off for you it this universe. So all these super gaming kids get sent to a strict military space camp where they are trained a whole lot of military crap that doesn't seem to have any remote use for what they are gonna be doing at the end of the day which is commanding massive fleets like a video game.Yes this film had me thinking, why are all these kids being taught how to shoot each other in big zero G war games? why are they being run into the ground like a common grunt? why are they being taught martial arts and self defense?. At the end of the day none of that, in my view, will be of any use when it comes to commanding these fleets...like videogames. The whole thing just felt so bizarre, the fact the world relies on prepubescent kids in the first place, kids that seem to crack easily quite understandably and all that film time based on those pointless zero G war games. Yeah so the training gets them tough OK, but end of the day they're still only using a large touch screen monitor.Essentially this entire film is all about watching this one sulky kid getting trained because Harrison Ford thinks he's 'the one' (haven't seen that before). That's it! that's all it is! just glossy looking videogaming and training with lots of pomp and emotional musical scores which fail to evoke any emotion because he's only playing flippin' videogames and training!. Oh and can't forget about the obligatory bullying of the new kid, gotta have that training camp bullying. It all looks fantastically slick and shiny no doubt, can't fault the visuals at all just like all modern films, it looks superb. But the film is so utterly dull and pointless and it doesn't even explain anything like why do these aliens attack Earth in the first place. Also these aliens are actually large bugs, overgrown locust looking bugs (Starship Troopers novel much?), they don't have hands fingers or thumbs of any kind. So how in the hell do they manage to even build spacecraft let alone fly them like some kind of divine air Gods. These ships actually manoeuvre like small flying bugs, zipping around in massive cloud-like swarms, its insane!. Daft thing is the human ships do the same thing too! they perform moves that would render 'Han Solo' and 'Pete Mitchell' lost for words.What made me laugh was the fact that when Ender fudges up his training missions both Ford and Kingsley's characters berate him like no ones business! yeah that will help him sheesh!. I dunno what think of this film I really don't, the acting by the adults is limp with Ford merely growling all the time and Kingsley slipping in and out of his Kiwi accent. The Maori tattoos on his face are pretty much just there to give him a more interesting look, otherwise he'd just be another grumpy officer. The kids do all act pretty well I can't deny, although Butterfield as Ender does grate with his pouting face and whining.I can't say much about the finale without giving it away but it did catch me out I'll admit, didn't see that twist. So I must give kudos for that, after which the plot does get more interesting as Ender does kinda go native with the bugs, but then it ends so that sucked. Seems to me that the next chapter is more interesting than the stuff we just had to sit through. So don't go expecting lots of futuristic space battles and bug zapping cos you ain't gonna get it folks. No bug hunts here I'm afraid, just lots of tedious military war games explained to you via lots of fast talking incomprehensible futuristic military space jargon.5/10",Ender's Game
76,adamscastlevania2,Solid family friendly sci-fi,6,17 October 2014,"(55%)A perfectly fine family sci-fi movie that has a degree more brains and attention to character/story than say the poor transformers movies; although its only real issue here is that it just feels a tad one note and joyless. I suspect the source of the lack of excitement comes from the fact that most of the movie is based around the training of the young section of the cast which by its own nature never feel like life or death situations. In fact they feel more like the practice section in a video game rather than the better main event. On a good plus side the effects throughout are really very good, the direction is solid, the ending is well done, and the good cast do elevate the movie. Younger sci-fi fans should give this a look, and their parents will probably get something out of it too.",Ender's Game

The camera feed of Mazer Rackham's destruction of a Formic civilization mother ship ends abruptly, going to black rather than static. The production design is uninspired, not nearly as interesting as that of ""Skyline"" or ""Lockout,"" which were a fraction of the cost. The weapons and weapons platforms are as anachronistic as ""Battlestar Galactica"" (2004), a considerably more profound project than ""Ender's Game"". What ""Ender's Game"" DOES have are great performances by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. In my opinion, this is Ford's best performance, as he gives a human face to a ""monster"". Asa Butterfield is flawless; I have never seen such an assured performance from such a young actor. Heck, many of the most-honored veterans could not pull off such a difficult role. Butterfield and director Gavin Hood manage to make ""Ender's Game"" a near-great, if not great film for the first two-thirds, despite its predictability and other shortcomings. However, when Ender reaches advanced military training the movie begins to fall apart. Director Hood, excellent with ensemble actors, is simply NOT an ""action director"". As producer, Hood should have recognized this and budgeted for John Woo, who proved his supreme worth in handling spectacle with ""Red Cliff"". Then,there is Ben Kingsley, who brings nothing extra to a underwritten role.The horrendous ""secret"" of Ender's Game is obvious from the beginning. Ender, who clearly regrets some of his choices, is disappointingly indifferent to his team, who share his guilt; and should, eventually, at least, feel the consequences. This is the fatal flaw in ""Ender's Game,"" almost profound, but a miss is still a miss.I give ""Ender's Game"" a week ""7,"" based entirely on the acting and message.",Ender's Game

79,MihaiSorinToma,A excellent space story,10,15 August 2017,"After Earth has barely managed to defeat an alien force who attacked by surprise, a recruitment committee was formed in search for brilliant kids who may one day lead our forces to victory. Ender, a highly intelligent teenager, is selected for the program and must prepare himself, working hard day by day, for an imminent war. It's a very exciting story of a boy which must evolve through work, commitment but also self control, in order to help Earth defeat the enemy who once tried to eradicate humankind. Through intense simulations, he will be able to understand the enemy and be all the time one step ahead, but the question remains how will he manage in the real life scenario. It's a film full of thrill and suspense, managing to transmit many emotions through Ender's superb character, which is, by the way, excellently played. We are made to feel and think that all is a game but the harsh conditions and difficult colleagues will prove to be another challenge for the young Ender which seems to have a solution for almost anything that could have been thrown at him. Besides the captivating plot, we are also faced with a completely unexpected finale, which brings much amazement to the viewer, while also leaving some space for a future sequel. The visuals are also top notch, bringing delight to the eye with every attempt.It's that type of movie which manages to create an unique atmosphere with the enormous help of one particular character (Ender's) which keeps you captivated throughout its entire length and provides an impressive and unexpected finale. It's an excellent movie overall which I cannot recommend enough.",Ender's Game
80,bryank-04844,'Ender's Game' will truly satisfy every sci-fi fan and will leave them clamoring for more. I know it did for me.,8,22 August 2015,"Gavin Hood's adaptation of Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game' is everything I wanted it to be and more. I'll admit, judging by the trailers to this film, I didn't quite see how this would work, and I even thought it didn't look the least bit good. But ten minutes into the film, I knew i was dead wrong. And not only wrong, but this might be one of my favorite films of the year, and might be one of the best sci-fi films ever made. I know, that's a strong statement to make, but I stand by it. This visually stunning film, along with its great performances and story have created one hell of a fine film, that I sure hope will make enough money to warrant a sequel. Because after watching this two hour sci-fi opus, I wanted more...immediately.'Ender's Game' takes place in an unidentified future Earth, where a short while ago, aliens showed up in the sky. Naturally, Earth attacked, and all things went to hell when the aliens swarmed Earth, almost destroying humankind. Luckily for us, a fighter pilot named Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley), figured out a way to get the aliens off our planet. But the governments became to scared and started preparing for the aliens to come back and retaliate.Now some fifty years after the aliens came and went from Earth, we meet Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin', the youngest of three in a world where population control is at an all-time high. However, at Ender's young age of ten, he has a rare gift that has him able to analyze any situation and successfully achieve the best outcome possible. It's like he's the best chess player in the world, but with real life, as we see him defeat his school bully, but then still brutally attacks him while he's on the ground, and then explains that he, ""wanted to win the fight, and all fights after that."" This is a trait Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) is looking for in his training network.Come to find out, the government now believes that children have better intuition and make better decisions than adults, and with their video game playing skills, they can fly ships and evade enemies easily. So now there is a giant space station that hovers above Earth where selected kids go to train to be fighters against these aliens. And Col. Graff thinks Ender might be the sole leader to lead the entire army to defeat these aliens. A lot of the film is set in a type of bootcamp in space and is very similar to 'Harry Potter', where kids are in a special school and divided into teams where they are constantly learning and competing against each other. They even have team colors and names. You can't say this stole from 'Harry Potter' though, as 'Ender's Game' was written a couple of decades before the magical world of Harry Potter.Not only do the higher ups in the army like Ender for his skills, but that he seems to possess certain traits equally that kept his brother Peter (the violent sociopath) and sister Valentine (the caring peaceful girl), played by Abigail Breslin out of this academy. And it's here that we see Ender (Asa Butterfield) struggle with the task he has been given, which is basically to commit genocide on an alien race. But as he says and has a unique gift for, he can always tell and knows what his enemies are thinking and believing, and when he finds this out, hate turns to love. Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), a girl in the academy he meets sticks by his side and helps him along the way.The epic climax and twist will blow you away, if you already haven't read the books, and the actors pull it off very well. There could have been so many moments in the film where situations could have been handled poorly, but instead were executed by talented people and garnered excellent reactions inside the theater. Harrison Ford has done the best acting job here than he's done in the past several years. He owns this role. Plus it's great to see him in space again. Butterfield does and amazing job of being a constant emotional wreck, but always steps up to the plate when he has to. Viola Davis, Steinfeld, Kingsley, and Breslin all turn in good performances as well.The special effects are stunning as well here. The picture is on an epic scale and is always beautiful, specifically the space station where the kids train. The music score is also impressive and always adds so much emotion and suspense to each scene. 'Ender's Game' will truly satisfy every sci-fi fan and will leave them clamoring for more.

The enemy may be real but they are so developmentally challenged that they keep fighting themselves.The ending was pretty disappointing and quite anticlimactic for an action film. I shouldn't be surprised as it is probably aimed at the PG-13 crowd but they initially establish it as anything but a family friendly film.

84,roedyg,very loosely based on the book,7,28 October 2014,"The Movie Enders Game is only loosely based on the book. The only similarity I could see was in a one line summary of the plot and the name of the protagonist. 10 year old Ender Wiggin in the book was a little bulldog of a kid, without remorse, introspection or personal relationships. Ender Wiggin in the movie is a skinny, delicate kid with a much more complex character, interested in strategy, seeing the world from the perspective of his opponents, flirting with any females nearby and cleverly assessing any possible advantages and disadvantages in any conflict. He is perhaps the most intelligent fighter in movies. The best parts of the movie are watching him deal with people attacking him. The actor Asa Butterfield is a little too delicate to be believable as Ender the fighter, but he projects the intelligence well. He has some of the magic of a superhero with an unusual power.The movie starts with typical military brainwashing, lots of saluting, push-ups, insulting sergeants, racing to line up... This part bored me to tears. It has been done a million times before. The only difference was some uniforms modelled on the sexy suits motor cycle racers wear.Ender, being younger and skinnier and bright, attracts some really vicious bullying. The administration encourages this. This is a school to learn mass murder after all. Ender deals with this with a combination of intelligence, philosophy and surprise. It is one of the more realistic depictions of bullying I have seen in movies.Then we have the zero-g acrobatics. For what seems an eternity we watch people dangling on wires zooming about in a dome, sometimes clinging to each other. These exercises to me seem completely pointless. These shots obviously took a lot of time and effort to get, and the editor was reluctant to cut them down to reasonable length.The movie is much more explicit than the book. The philosophical musings in the book are handled more with inference.The music was composed by a relative of the guy who did the score for Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments. It was syrupy and heavy handed. It made some otherwise exciting scenes come out silly.Much of the movie is spent watching CGI graphics. No matter how good they are, pictures of planets and space craft blowing up get pretty old pretty quickly.If I were the director, I don't know how I could make this feature film without introducing many more subplots. But I would do a lot of pruning. The director seems to think if seeing thing X is exciting, seeing thing X thrice is three times as exciting.It is a thoughtful movie, about the necessity for restraint in conflict, and becoming too sure you know what you opponent is thinking.I did not see this movie in the theatres, because I was boycotting Orson Scott Card and his anti-gay bigotry, which is not apparent in either the book or the film.",Ender's Game

This is a well acted story with great special effects, and a very deep moral agenda. There was not a single thing that I would fault on the handling of the battle scenes, all of the gestures, and animations were spot on from what I saw, and the sound was really well mixed into the scenes to amp up the battles. There is a bit too much tough little kids in a school playground sort of feeling most of the time before the story really gets going, but that is at least all acted very well. It takes a bully to make a man is a bit much on the psyche stuff, but it had to be used to build character right? I really Enjoyed this one, and would recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of scifi fantasy, and people who like stories to have the highest of moral values. ;)",Ender's Game
86,griffolyon12,A Surprise Worth Noting,10,3 November 2013,"Sometimes a film comes out and it's just right down my alley, and it takes more out of me to not like the film than it does to like it. In the case of Ender's Game, not only does it appeal to all of my sci-fi-leaned sensibilities, but it also happens to be more than just a film that didn't have to do much to win me over. Ender's Game winds up being a thoughtful, emotional film experience that deserves to be seen by any fan of science fiction.Based on Orson Scott Card's revered novel, Ender's Game takes place in the near future. In this future, Earth enlists kids to lead drones into battles against an evil alien race, the rationale being that kids are more in tune with technology and their minds can process more information than their adult counterparts. Asa Butterfield portrays Ender Wiggin, a teen genius, recruited to attend Battle School, an orbiting space station where these kids are trained in zero gravity. Could Ender be the Commander that the International Fleet has been looking for? Is he the one that will once and for all be able to lead the troops and destroy the alien homeworld? Well, you'll have to see the movie to find out, but what I can tell you is that Ender's Game is one of the more successful science fiction films I've seen in recent memory, and it is entirely grounded in reality.Everything in Ender's Game feels current. While the film deals with aliens and is set in the future, the thematic ideas of bullying, violence in video games, and drone warfare, are all so of the times, the film manages to feel real and lived in. This is not a slight on the film, it's a praise of it. These are all hot button issues, a few of which I don't even know on which side I come down on, but Ender's Game has got me thinking about them, and I think that, coupled with the emotional experience that this film offers, just solidifies why I go to movies.Ender's Game has moments of awe and wonder, there are laughs to be had, there are moments where you'll probably want to cheer, and yet, in the end, you realize that this film was never meant to be frivolous popcorn entertainment, but an involving conversation with the audience. Director Gavin Hood manages to hit all of the beats, and lends Ender's Game a voice through his smart realizations of things that must have seemed impossible to realize when reading it on the page of Card's novel, such as the Battle Room, where the kids float around in zero-G, fighting mock battles. Of course, a large part of what makes Hood's work so phenomenal and beautifully realized, is the stellar work done behind the scenes.The film's special effects are seamless in their integration, which is a rarity nowadays. The production design is never showy, but feels authentic. Then there is Steve Jablonsky's music, which is the genuine surprise of the film for me. Jablonsky never implements a memorable theme that you will be humming for days on end, but his smart use of strings and how he orchestrated it, makes this a film score that I find hard to stop thinking about, because it's just so technically well done and is effective when it needs to be in the context of the film. However, you cannot have a film without those in front of the camera, and the actors all manage to deliver phenomenal performances.Butterfield plays Ender like an open book. When Ender is conflicted between his leanings towards violence and empathy, we can tell what he is thinking or feeling through his facial expressions, and it works. While this type of acting is very raw and unrefined, its immediacy gives more potency to situations. Personally, I prefer performances such as this, rather than things being so internalized that we never get any facial reaction whatsoever. As for the rest of the cast, while Ender is obviously the meatiest role, there are a few key supporting roles where the actors really stand out.Harrison Ford is in tip top shape as Colonel Graff, the head of the Battle School. I would argue he hasn't been this charming and dedicated in a role in years. Then there is Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis, both delivering their usual strong performances, even if they're nothing to write home about. After that, the rest of the cast are mostly children, or at least actors under the age of 18. Abigail Breslin makes the most out of her small, yet crucial role as Ender's older sister, Valentine, who acts as Ender's conscience. Rounding out the kids of note are Hailee Steinfeld and Moises Arias as fellow Battle School students. While Steinfeld does not have as much to do as a young actress of her caliber deserves, she manages to deliver everything with the same likability she had in True Grit. Then, there is Arias, who is having quite a year, showing his range in films like this and The Kings of Summer, with two drastically different, and equally solid performances, he is truly an actor to look out for.Truly, if there is a drawback to Ender's Game, it is that the film is so heavy on the sci-fi jargon, without spoon feeding any of it to the audience, that I'm doubtful as to whether or not the film will have much reach beyond science fiction fans. Then, there is the fact that the film winds up favoring thought and emotion over action, and I truly wonder as to what type of box office it can have, but as a rabid science fiction fan myself, I find Ender's Game a surprise worth noting. This is one of those films that fellow sci-fi fans need to see.I give Ender's Game a 10 out of 10!",Ender's Game
87,jlthornb51,"If You Loved the Silly Book, Enjoy!",3,23 April 2015,"Bad writing is bad writing and the screenplay has even more flaws than the novel. It's a mystery how that was accomplished. A film based on a very overrated book can sometimes be an improvement on the source material. That's not the case here. This is a pretty pedestrian space opera with juvenile lead Asa Butterfield giving what must be the performance of his lifetime, which is sad when you think about it. Don't let yourself think too much about that or anything else regarding this movie, though. The story doesn't allow for thought. He actually is most likely doing the best he can and it's clearly a monumental effort. The director seems to be trying as hard as he can as well. At least to please the fan boys. Because no one else is going to admire much of what's in this third rate movie. However, no movie is a complete disaster when it offers the chance to see Harrison Ford aging before your very eyes and another opportunity to ask, ""what the heck is Ben Kingsley doing in this mess?""",Ender's Game
88,billygoat1071,The Easy Way,7,5 December 2013,"Ender's Game was one of those books that has influenced generations, mostly modern young adult novels; a special kid who is chosen to save the day but has to go on a special school or place to apply what he is destined for. A film adaptation is pretty obvious and how it ended up is as intriguing as it gets. It's immediately gripping at the very start. Even though the film is able to introduce its concept cleverly, the film suffers for lacking enough interest in fleshing out the rest of its universe. But again, it works better at delivering its style. Ender's Game is a solidly made film that has plenty of ways to covered up some of the flaws and instead make the overall film inevitably entertaining.To be honest, the plot is well told. The real danger rather focuses on what the kids would end up after the military training than what the aliens would do to Earth. It's basic personal stuff towards Ender, which makes it quite gripping. While it decently follows its meat, the exposition moves too easy. The narratives may be straightforward and all, but there is a little sense of subtlety to the journey. At times it also feels cold. That's probably the result for not spending enough time developing Ender's relationship to the people around him. The film should have prioritized characterization as well to at least made some of its points compelling.And so the humanity of the characters are somewhat now relied on the actors. Asa Butterfield has a built for a hero, but other than the witty side, he is able to express the character's angst quite well to be relatable. Harrison Ford, Viola Davis, and Ben Kingsley did what they had to do, and it's good enough for the roles. Most of the credit goes to the direction. Gavin Hood displays sorts of gorgeous shots around its Sci-Fi aesthetics. Following the camera easily brings a large adventurous experience along the way, providing vertigo and excitement. The visual effects obviously helps heightening things up. It's just great to look at and it's appropriately satisfying as a standard action blockbuster.Ender's Game deserves to flesh things out more within the heart and the characters, but it's still a decently crafted movie. There's a sheer sense of adventure by the filmmaking. The world is already intriguing anyway, but there is definitely more interesting things that it might've developed to make it a lot more engaging. Again, it was the style that helped the audience thoroughly connect to the story. Ender's Game may not be as sensational as some other YA films out there, but it gets its job done well to keep it away from the worse ones.",Ender's Game
89,bheadher,A Surprisingly Good Adaptation of a book...,8,26 January 2016,"I'll say it again...this isn't a book review site folks, but I do understand your inner turmoil...Unlike Starship Troopers, which didn't even try to reflect the book (see my review of THAT one), the producers of Enders Game really worked at respecting the Authors story line. I suspect screen play writers and directors cringe when being signed on to a book based movie. It's only natural that something in the original story must be left behind, otherwise you'd have 4 hour movies all the time. I have to applaud these movie crafters however, they really went the extra mile to remain within the original vision. Without giving out too many spoilers, Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley did rather well as the Colonel and Earths greatest hero Mazer. After seeing Harrison in that stink bomb Cowboys vs Aliens I was disillusioned, but he came through on this one. SciFi movies are but a sideline for Ben, but he really went out of the way to make his character totally believable (especially going through the uncomfortable makeup sessions to make him an all out Maori warrior, head to toe!). You gotta love an actor who gives his all to the character, heh heh...While it won't ever grab Oscars, this outing was very pleasing to a book reader who only picked up Enders Game as an after thought.Nooo, this isn't a rehash of the book...but it does a respectable job of simulating the book, so lighten up a bit...",Ender's Game
90,TheSquiss,Passable entertainment for those who didn't read the novel.,5,28 October 2013,"I had no intention of watching Ender's Game. The trailer didn't excite me beyond a cursory fascination and it was only on the insistence of my companion for the screening, Bag, that I relented. In the event, I enjoyed it more than he.Part of the trouble is that Bag read, listened to and loved the Orson Scott Card sci-fi novels, whereas I haven't. Part of the trouble is that Gavin Hood's (Tsotsi, Rendition) adaptation isn't very good, it isn't terribly true to the source novel and there's a reasonable amount ropy acting on screen.Seventy years after Earth has been twice ransacked by an alien race, The Buggers, and foiled by the now-mythical hero fighter pilot, Mazer Rackham, humankind has turned to a new breed of fighting machine: Children. Children have a unique way of viewing the stress and challenges of warfare and are able to approach it in an entirely fresher and superior way to stubborn, caught-in-the-ruts adults. Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield, Hugo Cabret in Hugo) is one such child and is removed from his family and transported to the International Military's academy deep in space where he is trained and subjected to all manner of harsh emotional tests in the hope that he just might thwart the Bugger's next attack and be the savior of mankind.Ender's Game rolls along easily enough. There's plenty to interest the eye and the weightlessness is handled well, though not in the same class as that of Gravity. It will please the kids and pass a couple of hours without too much regret but, by the sound of it, it will really cheese off those who read the novel. Too much has been changed: the parentage of Ben Kingsley's character inexplicably switched, characters in the finale who have long since gone in the novel, and, worst of all for Bag, ""the entire point"" of the ending and Ender's journey is lost in favour of a more palatable end that will allow for a more filmable sequel than the second novel. Take it from me, he was not best pleased.I can't comment, only advise, on that matter. The performances, however, are fair game.Butterfield, excellent in Hugo, has lost his mojo. He might be able to turn on the tears but he sure as hell can't run convincingly. It's a passable performance from a lad carrying the weight of a film but lacks the depth and maturity that he displayed in Scorsese's Oscar-winning delight.But Butterfield is a positive Laurence Olivier next to Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Dap. We haven't seen ham as overcooked as this on screen since Gerard Butler in Olympus Has Fallen. His performance is not just poor, it's embarrassing.Viola Davis gives solid support as Major Gwen Anderson but is barely given the time to have an impact. Likewise, Abigail Breslin as Ender's sister, Valentine, makes her self known adequately without coming close to the standard she displayed in this year's The Call.Thank goodness for Harrison Ford! There's nothing startling about his performance, but it's the Ford of old. He's reliable, entirely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. He dominates every scene he's in and makes for an imposing officer. He has to; by the looks of it, there are only four in the entire academy, and one of those is Dap.Ender's Game is passable entertainment for those who have no knowledge of the novels, but don't expect a life-changing event or anything particularly memorable.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Ender's Game
91,RevRonster,Emotional story? Bah! We have cool effects!,4,2 February 2014,"Who needs an interesting story when you have cool spaceships!!! I think that was the mantra that Gavin Hood and the production of ""Ender's Game"" had when they made the film. While basically a big budget popcorn action sci-fi film, ""Ender's Game"" (the novel) has always had a reputation of not only being written by a complete lunatic who thinks 9/11 was a good thing for the country and that homosexuals are really, REALLY bad but has offered up interesting ideas about war, genocide and desensitizing children to the horrors of violence and battles. The film doesn't offer any of these ideas up or they just cover them and push them aside in order to celebrate how good they made the special effects look.The film has tremendous performances but the story lacks any real spark and is almost completely devoid of any drama, tension or thrills thanks to director Gavin Hood being more worried about you seeing that the special effects look really, REALLY good and thinks actually seeing reactions from his actors when reaction shots are kinda important for the scene are just optional. This ended up just making the film boring and forgettable for me.""Ender's Game"" could have been a great or even just a decent sci-fi tale but with an overall sense that CG was better than character, spirit or emotion, the film just feels pointless.Hi!

These movies are made for adolescent boys and adults will have no interest in them. Ender's Game about a gifted strategist teen is about as interesting as any XBox video game. All have plastic characters that move predictably to a predictably dumb ending. I wonder if the writers of these movies realize that the dialog gives the characters nothing to do but recite lines in order. I felt really sorry for Viola Davis for being in the movie because she was the only one that gave her lines some life and emotion. For the first time since Harrison Fords' worst movie, Six day seven nights, I could barely stand to watch him on screen. The character Bonzo was the only other one who brought some real tension to this slow and boring movie. Yes like Gravity this movie is cinematically pretty but I am so tired of movies that just look good but don't feel good, sound good or make you want to see more.

It is great to follow all the different characters and see them evolve, especially Ender Wiggin played by Asa Butterfield has a very hard personality, but it is captured very well and nicely supported by the other characters as they see Ender evolve, so do they.This is sci-fi all the way, there have been many films in this genre the past year, but this is definitely of the better, it has a good story, great characters, ups and downs and it just all works very well together.

95,richieandsam,Not bad but not great.,6,28 July 2014,"ENDERS GAMEI don't know what it is about sci fi films, but I love them. I love the idea of being in space, other planets, the idea of life in the universe. It is the perfect escapism for me.Ender Wiggin is a very smart kid who is believed to be the chosen one to end a war between the human race and aliens that want to wipe us out.The story is quite good, but I just thought that a film about a child being trained in killing aliens could have been a lot better. Ender just wasn't very convincing as a character. There were a few characters in this film that I thought were not very convincing. I didn't believe that this kid was as smart as he was made out to be. Then the bully character was just laughable. I think the casting and probably the story just didn't add up.The film has some pretty big stars in it. Harrison Ford makes his way back to science fiction films after a long period away... And seeing as he has signed up for the next instalment of the eagerly anticipated Star Wars saga, it seems he is hanging around sci fi for a while. You never know... That rumour of a sequel to Blade Runner might actually come. Harrison was probably the best actor in the film, but he should have been in it more in my opinion. The film also has Ben Kingsley in it... Ben has a relatively small role, but he is memorable in it. The main cast were Asa Butterfield﻿, Hailee Steinfeld﻿ & Abigail Breslin. Asa was not great. I thought in some scenes he was OK, but generally he did not pull this character off. Hailee did a good job. I thought she was he best actress in the film (next to Harrison and Ben).The thing I loved about this film the most was the visuals. It was an amazing looking movie. I loved the scenery and the effects. It was all done brilliantly. It made me feel that I wanted to be up there. It looked beautiful.The ending was really good. I thought it was really well done and I did not expect the ending like that.

96,Al_The_Strange,Ender's Game review,8,4 November 2013,"It seems as though all the great sci-fi takes forever to become films. It took over seventy years to give John Carter his big-screen debut. I had a copy of L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth that claimed that it would become a motion picture soon, but that never happened until almost twenty years later (and many would probably argue that it should not have been made). Ender's Game is another one of the best sci-fi novels I've read, and a film for it has been in development for something like ten years. So, in 2013, I couldn't have been more excited.Ender's Game is kinda like The Hunger Games set in outer space, only more aggressive, more fantastic, and more original. EG has its fair share of special-effects-laden spectacle, with massive swarms of spaceships and incredible planetscapes filling up the screen. Fortunately, it's not all just action for the sake of action, it is all a direct consequence of the story. When the space battles aren't breaking out, the film still moves very fast with loads of character-driven conflicts.The film still maintains most of its focus on telling the story, and it does hit up all the necessary plot points that were in the original novel. Some major subplots get cut out, the training/battle scenes are truncated, and various other liberties are taken, but for a two-hour movie, the filmmakers did their best to cover the entire plot, right up to its bizarre ending. A lot of scenes are exactly as I pictured them from reading the book (even the fantasy CGI mindgame scenes, which I always fancied should be animated Pixar style, and it turns out they were!), and the dark aggression of the book is mostly translated well into the film. Best of all, the book's biggest twists still bear some decent weight in the movie's narrative.Unfortunately, some things are lost in translation. Just as it is with The Hunger Games, the specific nuances of the characters, their relationships, their emotions, and their overall pathos is better conveyed in the narrative of the book than it is on film. Ender's relationships with his friends (and even his enemies) are left at the surface level, and never really reaches the same depths as the novel. Some things remain unexplained or glossed over. Deeper themes are never fully explored. Although one can't expect every single thing in the book to make it into the film, EG falls just a little short in immersing the audience in the characters. It may be easy to root for Ender when he stands up to his bullies and commands a whole fleet, but the film won't leave that much of a lasting impression.As a film, it looks pretty slick and stylish, with solid photography and editing. Acting can be rather mixed: I think all of the child actors did their jobs really well. Harrison Ford gets the most grief for his role, for he pretty much phones it in, but I still didn't think he was as terrible as other reviewers make him out to be. Ben Kingsley plays it kinda creepily in his role, and Viola Davis is pretty much herself. Writing in this film is okay, but has a rather bad penchant for exposition. This production has some good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score is not bad either.As usual, the book is better than the movie, but I think the movie still does a good job as an adaptation. I expect that average audiences unfamiliar with the book will think this movie is okay, but might miss out on certain nuances. Book fans might gripe that the film doesn't do justice to certain things. In any case, I think the movie is worth a rent to all dedicated sci-fi fans.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Ender's Game
97,blackmamba99971,Put a sling into it,8,20 January 2014,"A very surprising film, about a boy genius who has the adaptability to see within the carnage of war and carry out impossible tactics to win. Armed with a few misfits of his own, he carries on a tradition in his family to becoming the most prominent commander of earth's force fleets. Yet within his training, in his spare time he plays a game board to quell his continuing rage from losing.However, not all is what it seems in his training academy. Ender (Asa Butterfield) realizes that after his last simulation he finds out that all he has done since his inception to the facility is command actual fleets in war. With the final war being the destruction of the enemy's planet.With his last promise made to a drone of his enemy he decides to take the only queen in existence to a remote planet where she can be born in an environment suited to her needs. This was also after his promotion to admiral, making him the youngest flight officer in earth's history.I thought this was a good film, what threw me off was the constant simulations in every station Ender landed on. This was a clue to giving me the answer that his constant training, was actual battle scenarios carried out by him, and his team. A good twist.What was kind of disappointing, was seeing the Formics last drone talking to ender, the least the makers could have done, was to have them speak telepathically. At even the most minute level to give the ambiance a little more depth. Although the drone's planet was destroyed, it could have told ender what the plan really was. This way some resolve could have been issued even though ender did manage to figure it out himself on a basic level.I thought the music was good, and the acting. With Harrison Ford any role he plays is always remarkable. Even playing the sadistic colonel for ender, and his squad. What was a bit of a pickup was Ben Kingsley. I hate to say this, but every time I see him in any role, is I can only think about his most famous role. That which was Gandhi. I can never get used to seeing him in any other part.I give it eight out of ten stars, it was original, fresh, and above all entertaining.

98,p-jonsson,A bit disappointed actually,5,7 March 2014,"First I have to mention that I have not read the book. It has been on my maybe-to-read list for quite a while but I have never gotten around to read it. Thus I cannot say how well the movie interprets the book but if the book is close to this movie I do not think I will bother reading the book.The entire concept, kids being trained to do the job of experiences commanders, is of course a wee bit ludicrous from the start but the way the movie was implemented did not really help. This should be the school of kids that was picked because they were geniuses but the only one that displayed any intellect to speak about was Ender himself. Worse, the school was filled with bullies that really had no clue and which were not only screwing themselves due to their overinflated egos but was prepared to screw humanity by beating up on Ender when they themselves lost. That utter dickhead, Commander Bonzo, just made me want to wring his filthy little neck from the first scene when he made his appearance.There were some cool scenery in the movie. That has to be said. The weightless combat was not too bad and the battle footage, both the ""archive"" footage and the battle scenes at the end were quite cool.Speaking of the end. What the f? These aliens had apparently come to Earth with the intent of conquering us. Wiping us out for all intents and purposes. I did not really see anything in the movie that said otherwise. However, once it is clear that we (Ender) repaid the favor a bit more successfully it is all boohoo, sob sob. Not only that but he runs outside, finds an egg and goes on some pilgrimage to repopulate a world with Formics. That was just ridiculous.This movie was not what I hoped it would be. I was hoping for some real training at the battle school instead of this nonsensical game then followed by some heroics and suspense with the humans fighting off the big bad aliens. I fail to see what floating around weightlessly taking potshots at each other have to do with commanding carriers, battleships and fighter squadrons? Combine that with a silly ending that tries to make us fighting back be a fault and what could have been a good movie just turned into a disappointment as far as I am concerned.",Ender's Game
99,buckikris,Game Over,1,16 August 2014,"I watched this last night and was shocked by how horrible it was. This was one of the worst movies I had seen with Harrison Ford in it since the Mosquito Coast. I realize it starts out in the future, but a school for kids with perfect behavioral skills, superior intelligence, and the ability to save the world. It just doesn't get it for me. I am a sci-fi fan, total Star Wars fanatic, but this film doesn't compare to some of the sci-fi movies I have seen. I thought the acting was wooden, Harrison Ford looked like he just wanted a pay check. I watched this movie from beginning to end hoping it would get better, waiting for the plot to come in, and found myself very disappointed. The only thing that made me happy was the fact I got this movie for free at Redbox. For all sci-fi fans pass this one up, and get a classic sci-fi movie like The Martian Chronicles. I believe you will find this movie better, more entertaining, but make time for it. The Martian Chronicles is in three parts, but it's classic that shouldn't be past up.Kris L.

100,shawneofthedead,"It looks like Ender's Game, kind of, but really isn't.",3,18 January 2014,"Every time a beloved novel makes its way to the silver screen, there will be accompanying moans and grumbling from fans of the book. The adaptation lacks the soul, the wit, the weight of the novel, some will fret, while others will yearn for more details or complain about the way in which certain elements and/or characters have been excised/altered for cinematic purposes.Sometimes, those criticisms feel unfair. After all, nuance and subtlety will almost always be lost in the process of adaptation. Novels have an unlimited budget bound only by the imagination; movies must fit roughly the same narrative into a couple of hours, with monetary concerns dictating the ebb and flow of plot and special effects. Nevertheless, despite extensive changes to the author's text, there have been literary adaptations that have enjoyed great success on both the critical and commercial fronts - The Lord Of The Rings, for example, and more recently, The Hunger Games.So there's room for hope yet with the apparently resolutely unadaptable Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic about the rage and ruin of war. Even if some of its depth and profundity must be sacrificed in changing the medium of story-telling, surely there's a way to do justice to the heartbreaking brutality and rich political dynamics of Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin's rise through the ranks of Battle School.Sadly, Gavin Hood's over-rushed effort is not the film that will do that. On its own merits, this incarnation of Ender's Game feels simultaneously bloated and loose, the plot tumbling desperately over itself as it tells a story almost completely severed from its philosophical moorings. As an adaptation, it is mostly abysmal: it hits some of the right marks, but is almost completely lacking in the novel's spirit and depth.Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is a preternaturally gifted young man who, like the rest of the children in his post-space-war Earth, has been monitored all his life to determine if he is eligible to attend the prestigious Battle School. Unlike most of his peers, including his violent brother Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) and empathetic sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin), Ender makes the cut, and he is swiftly drafted into the military academy under the gruff tutelage of Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford). Once there, Ender must figure out the system of internal battles that pass for training, gaining enemies and allies even as he's groomed to lead an army that might prove to be humanity's last hope.Taken purely as a film, Ender's Game can't help but feel hollow and clumsily rushed. Without the benefit of narration from Ender's point of view, the character lurches purposefully through Battle School with very little of his unique brilliance or insight into warfare on display. His rise through the ranks seems almost too easy, before it dissolves into a final-act twist that seems preposterous in the cinema but was hard-won, inevitable and shatteringly brilliant in the novel.In moving from page to screen, Ender's Game has altered in ways big and small - some of these changes are arguably necessary, like the aging-up of the characters. In the novel, Ender is six years old when he starts climbing the ranks of the army; there's no practical way this would work on screen or on set, and approximately 8-10 years have been added to the characters' ages. It's possible, too, to mourn the excision of an entire subplot in the book - it involved Peter and Valentine establishing online personas who wind up dominating political discourse back on Earth - while understanding that it would genuinely be too much for the movie to feasibly handle.But many of the other changes add up to a hugely disappointing adaptation. The weight and wear of Ender's time at Battle School hardly seem to affect him at all, largely because everything is compressed. In the novel, Ender's crushingly lonely journey unfolds over a few years; it seems to take place in a few weeks in the film. Relationships and characters are sliced and diced, then re-assembled, to frustrating effect: Bean (Aramis Knight), for example, is no longer Ender's successor but his compatriot. Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) has her role in the film beefed up at the expense of the tragic, dramatic heart of the same character in the book.Of course, it would be foolish to expect a film to delve into and portray Ender's inner thoughts and concerns as effectively as can be done in the novel. But the shiny gravity-defying space battles that unfold on screen in Ender's Game look great but come off as silly, rushed and cheap without the undercurrent of loneliness, self-doubt and misery that runs so clearly through Ender's mind and soul.Casting-wise, Ender's Game does well enough. Butterfield is a curiously blank presence in the film, which is appropriate as an interpretation of the character in the book, but makes for an occasionally frustrating lead in a feature film. Ford is suitably dour and determined, with only a hint of Graff's depths shining through his grim façade. Adding Viola Davis to the cast as Major Anderson - a disembodied voice in the novel who's clearly male - adds a welcome (if slightly stereotypical) feminine touch to Battle School.If you've read the book and treasured its words, ideas and characters (whatever you might think of Card's reprehensible politics and beliefs), it's probably a good idea for you to steer clear of Ender's Game. Ostensibly, it's the same story; actually, it's not. Those who've never read the book might find something to enjoy in the rush and tumble of Battle School, but don't be surprised if you, too, feel that something is missing in the film. It hints at big, important ideas - certainly more so than your generic sci-fi epic might - but, ultimately, fails to really get them across.",Ender's Game
101,renegadeviking-271-528568,Ender's Game review,7,22 February 2020,"Do the ends ever justify the means? Is it ever acceptable to do something wrong if it helps bring about a cause that is noble? Is it ethical to require a few to make painful sacrifices for the good of the majority?These are questions all societies must ask during times of war, and the answers to these questions are rarely easy or clear-cut. ""Ender's Game,"" a new movie based on a popular 1985 sci-fi book, explores some of these issues, as well the fall-out for those who have to make these difficult decisions.In the future, the planet Earth is almost destroyed by an insect-like race of aliens known as Formics. To prepare for what humanity assumes will be the inevitable second invasion, the military begins training children to serve as commanders of the space fleet that will be used to fight the Formics. One of these children is Ender Wiggin. Lonely and bullied - but also a tactical genius - Ender is singled out as humanity's best hope for defending Earth from the Formics.He is sent to ""battle school"" on a space station, where he is pushed through seemingly endless rounds of physical and psychological testing. The training will prepare him to lead Earth's forces, but how much of his innocence and humanity will he be required to give up?One of the most fascinating things about ""Ender's Game"" is that the book feels perhaps even more relevant than when it was released in 1985. At first, it does takes a bit of a leap for viewers to buy into the fact the military would actually put children in command. However, the story's futuristic form of warfare is controlled in a way that's eerily similar to modern videogames, which today's children have grown up playing - and they are, admittedly, better at these games than many adults. As the film's voiceover states, children have quicker reflexes and haven't learned to be afraid to make risky, out-of-the-box tactical decisions.Although the film has solid supporting actors - including Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley - the stars of the movie are its young (and refreshingly diverse) cast. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who is able to make the character both vulnerable and impenetrable. His icy blue eyes are intense and infinitely sad. He intentionally remains a bit of a puzzle, to both his adult trainers and the audience.Hollywood long considered the book to be unfilmable, but I think the director Gavin Hood managed to pull it off. The film falls just a bit short of ""epic,"" and I wish just a little more time would have been devoted to character development, to help us make a deeper emotional connection to the characters. However, it's still an intriguing, thought-provoking film, and the special effects - particularly the scenes with the glass-enclosed, zero-g battle room in space - are stunning. ""Ender's Game"" forces us to think about the choices we make during war, and what those choices cost us in the long run",Ender's Game
102,kermitkid,ignore the controversy,9,30 March 2020,"This is one of the best sci-fi movies you'll see this year! Ignore all the trolls on IMDB who are ""boycotting"" this film because of Orson Scott Card's political views, as the film (and the book it's based on, which I highly recommend) have literally nothing to do with them. If you live near an IMAX you should definitely see it in that format. (It's worth the price despite not being in 3D) The scenes in the Battle Room, the space battles, and every scene on the ship cannot be seen in their entirety without IMAX. (Meaning you don't see the whole set in a regular format. IMAX has wider view.) The battles among the kids are just amazing, the inner conflict with Ender is well written, and the ending has a great message that will unfortunately leave you hanging and waiting for the sequel. Asa Butterfield personally would not have been my choice for Ender, but he did pretty well. And if you think Harisson Ford and Ben Kingsley are too old to act, think again! Overall, Ender's Game is just absolutely brilliant filmmaking. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",Ender's Game
103,ayoreinf,"Asa Butterfield, is the movie, the rest doesn't get in his way",9,3 November 2013,"I liked Asa Butterfield in Hugo, but there he played a child, a special child, true, but still a child. He was acting and reacting to things that exist in our world, some more fantastic than others but at the base they were all things that one can find in the world. Ender Wiggin is nothing like anyone he could encounter. A kid, a genius, a master of strategy, an intellectual grownup trapped in the body of a child with compassion and understanding far surpassing his tender age. And he pulls this one off superbly. As he's now Asa Butterfield is one of the finest actors around. The rest of the film is not important, it is a shallowing down of the book, but it does keep the core plot intact. It does some stupid Hollywood changes like hinting a budding romance between Ender and Petra, and since the child employment laws force the age of the actors a few years above the age of the characters in the story, it almost makes sense to shift the prepubescent friendships of the book with a post pubescent budding romance. Luckily they didn't lay to much story lines on this change, and didn't push it too far. I guess the Orson Scott Card masterpiece is such a classic by now that even Hollywood scriptwriters didn't dare tinkering with it too much. Visually the film is of a very high class, despite not using the 3D trick that could be easily justified in this case they still made me feel slightly disorientated more than once when entering the weightless battle room. The bottom line is a long one in this case, it's not the masterpiece the book is, but it treats the story with due respect; it eliminates some of the brightest aspect of the book like forecasting the internet and social networks as early as 1985 and understanding their implications before they were there to see. And still the lead character of Ender is so strong and its portrayal by Asa Butterfield is so amazing that everything else pales into insignificance, which makes this movie worth seeing even as a prelude to reading the book itself.",Ender's Game
104,whatch-17931,Impressive depiction of technology,7,1 November 2020,"I have not read the book, but I knew the basic plot of kids being trained and how it ended.I found it pretty involving. The acting was top notch.There is a segment in the middle, where Ender unintentionally nearly kills Bonzo and he quits and goes back to Earth. His sister is brought to talk him into going back, and she basically tells him he's a coward. This seems incredibly convenient logic, because Ender is quite clearly suffering an emotional breakdown, and it has nothing to do with cowardice. This is far deeper than that, but it does at least presage things to come.The FX were quite solid, but I really liked the way technology was depicted. Specifically, in the final battle, the way Ender uses his hands to control a massive monitor is impressive and feels very real.As an acting nitpick- late in the film, Ender breaks down crying, which is fine, but the way Butterfield's voice cracks on the line ""you lied""... yes he's a kid, but that's really going to rub males the wrong way. Males, being like 80%+ of the target market for this.",Ender's Game
105,ExpendableMan,"Gorgeous to look at, but ultimately disappointing",6,27 October 2013,"There's no escaping it, Ender's Game is a fantastically pretty movie. From the opening shots of fighter jets engaging in dogfights with swarms of alien craft, to the ethereal sequences of teenagers in spacesuits drifting through zero gravity gaming arenas, this is one movie that's a veritable feast for the eyes. It's also deeply engaging on a moral and ethical level, raising a great many questions about the ethics of the military, the morality of leadership and whether war can ever be a tool to prevent war. It's a treat for the brain and one that will leave you grappling with philosophical ideas of what civilisation loses when it does what it can to survive.The trouble though, is it doesn't make for an exciting movie. Why? Well because despite all those eye-popping, bombastic space battles that cropped up in the trailer, there's very little war or danger to be found. And despite being just shy of two hours, it also ends in a rather abrupt and unsatisfying way, leaving Enders Game as a very frustrating cinema experience. Set in the distant future, it sees humanity as a mighty galactic power with bases on far flung planets and capable of dispatching vast war fleets in the blink of an eye. But it's a power that's consumed by paranoia. See, there's another race in the galaxy known as Formics who once came dangerously close to exterminating us. Convinced that another attack is imminent, the Earth military led by Colonel Graff (a perpetually scowling Harrison Ford) sets about recruiting large numbers of teenagers to direct their war craft. Because, teenagers are good at Command And Conquer right? There's no holes in that plan, shut up.Best of the bunch is Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield - excellent), a child prodigy being groomed as Julius Caesar for the lightspeed era. When we first meet him, he's beating a bully at a video game, then minutes later beating the living daylights out of him in a biology classroom. Soon, he's being shipped into orbit to complete some intense training and get shouted at by Xaro Xhoan Daxos. And this is where the film ends. Well, not really. It goes on for a good hour and forty minutes longer, but the training never finishes. No matter how many futuristic-paintball games and war simulators he gets into, the war itself never really kicks off. Sure, all the scenes of spaceships bursting into flame, drones zipping through asteroids and lasers bursting through ice look incredible, but they're just war-simulations. And videogames are only exciting when you play them yourself, there's more tension and danger in Ender's shower room brawl with a rival student than in any of the intergalactic battle scenes. ***BIG SPOILER WARNING***Consequently, you spend the entire film waiting for a war that never properly starts. Except surprise! He was fighting it for real all along! From the comfort of a war room. Then comes one incredibly contrived ending with a conveniently-easy-to-find alien and before Ender can even draw breath after finishing the closing monologue, the credits are rolling. Uh...great. All of which makes for an infuriating end to what was a deeply promising film. Given the complexity of the issues it raises, it's even more annoying. This had the possibility of being Starship Troopers for kids but with an intellectual depth beyond that of the average Hollywood movie. Instead it turns out like a two hour version of the Kobayashi Maru sequence from the first Star Trek movie where somebody points out that they've blown up a real Klingon Bird of Prey at the end.",Ender's Game
106,Jerghal,Needs an extended version,8,2 February 2014,"The box-office failure of big budget (110m$) book adaptation 'Ender's Game' doesn't bode well for the future of my favorite movie genre. Writer Orson Scott Card has had many offers since the book release in 1985 to turn it into a film. He rejected many of them because of creative differences and because most Studios insisted on making Ender older (in the book he's 6 to 10 years old). There were plans in 2003 by Warner Brothers to let Wolfgang Petersen have a go at it with a script written by Card himself. Card's script was a fusion of 'Ender's Game' and 'Ender's Shadow'. In 2010 Gavin Hood got attached as director and screenwriter and the script became based on the first book again with plans to make it into a franchise or a TV series if successful. Unfortunately EG made only 112m$ worldwide (although it opened first place in the US with 27m$) so all future plans have been put on ice. It's really a shame because as far as science fiction flicks go this really is one of the better ones. The VFX were done by Digital Domain who also co-financed the film and they look absolutely stunning. This film will a good 4K showcase Blu-ray when they finalize the format at the end of 2014. The film follows the book quite closely but because of the time constraints of the film medium a lot of events had to be compressed and some subplots where eliminated. 113 mins really is too short, an extra 40 mins or so would have let more room to expand on Ender's training etc. Altogether I think most fans of the book will be happy with the end result but it it just lacks the depth the book had to offer. So hopefully they make a 3 hour extended version (depending on how much material they shot) on BD to give the story more time to breathe.",Ender's Game
107,Maleplatypus,Great novel visualization,9,24 November 2013,"It's not easy to ""bring to life"" something you red in a novel but apparently this movie succeeds. For someone who is not familiar with ""life and deeds"" of Ender Wiggin, this movie would not make much sense. Still, it's a beautifully pictured (important) part of the Ender ""saga"", that has excellent prequels and sequels (especially ""Speaker for the dead""), written by a master.So, my suggestion would be: read the novel (the whole series, as a matter of fact) on Ender and then watch this movie. Then and only then it shall be excellent to you as it was for me. Otherwise, it will just be a nice action SF, which would be pointless. Why? There are rarely movies that can picture all the layers of messages and thoughts from a story. There have been several more or worse successful attempts. This one tries to compress something that should last hours into a 100+ minute movie, extracting only the crucial point of the story. Don't miss it but, once again, read the book first.",Ender's Game

Well, this should also have, but no one older than 12 years should watch this. Imagine a combination of Star Wars and Star Trek. Sounds good? Add a bit of Independence Day, a lot of children, a lot of crap, a little trash and get wonderful nonsense that you will regret. After this film Phantom Menace is a material for multiple Oscars.

Most of the film involves boot camp for starship troopers. Still, as a film it is engaging through a good performance from Asa Butterfield.The film's messages heads towards the idea that there always will be an adversary trying to destroy human (or American) civilization. If this is the idea, while there may be some validity to this, it's a bit of a stretch.The climax or anti climax, was rather evident ahead of time and the ending seems like the writers ran out of of ideas as I have for this review. Its worth a watch but more quickly forgettable than Gravity.",Ender's Game
110,Bruce722,Not perfect but still great.,8,1 November 2013,"I will start by saying that Ender's Game was a really good movie, maybe even great. The acting, especially by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford, was flawless and the supporting cast, however underutilized, were phenomenal as well. The special effects were incredible and the story, supported by a fantastic score, was very well told. Honestly, this is truly one of those rare stories that both children and adults alike could really appreciate. There were some things I thought could've been improved on. There were some areas where time passed very quickly and if I hadn't read the book, I think I wouldn't been a bit confused. I think using some cinematic tricks for time lapsing quickly could've been used to create a better flow and make certain elements seem more genuine. To be honest though, as a stand alone film, that's all I really feel was flawed. Obviously it wasn't exactly like the book, nor did I expect it to be. It's just about impossible to condense an 8+ hour novel into a 2 hour movie. However, there were also some things that they altered from the source material that I didn't care for, I'll explain here:***SPOILERS*** As I said, they had to cut some things out and most of it was fine. They eliminated some of the minor characters (like Shen and Crazy Tom and a few others) and also some of the development of the Battle School dynamic. Those cuts came across perfectly fine. They also skipped some of his progress in said school and to do so they altered the way he developed the Dragon Army. Again, this was done really well and stayed true to the spirit of the source material. This trend continued throughout the story arc. However, there were a few changes that I didn't like. The biggest thing (in terms of creating a void from the book) was the entire Valentine and Peter dynamic with Demosthenes and Locke. While I didn't expect that to have been included in detail, I would've liked some sort of mention of the goings on. Maybe she could've mentioned it briefly during their conversation at the lake. It didn't have to be explained much but it was a very critical element, not to the book necessarily but to the story later on. I think they could've found a way to touch on it. While on Valentine, the most glaring of the changes was the ending (again, this is a SPOILER). In the end, Ender sends Val a message saying he's left to explore the universe. There are a few issues with this. For one, Val is supposed to be with him. She is an integral part in the entire saga so if they plan on making this into a franchise, which supposedly they do, how are they going to get them back together? Also, his abrupt departure creates somewhat of a plot hole. Where is Ender going? In the book, he doesn't leave for over a decade, which allows for other colonies to begin on other planets. In the movie, however, no other planet is colonized, so again, where is he going? What they should've done was develop his relationship with Petra a bit less in order to include more development of his love for his sister, Val. Then he could've written her a letter stating that he planned on leaving at some point but still had some things to take care of where he was at, you know, politics. This would give time for her to write back telling him she's going to meet him there and they could then leave together whenever he was ready. It wouldn't have taken almost any additional time and it would've fixed two glaring issues. The others problems I had weren't as major but still bugged me a bit. The second to last battle at Command School was a failed mission in the movie, however, Ender NEVER loses in the book. He comes close during that mission but he does NOT lose. His genius feels somewhat affected by them making him lose that mission. Lastly, they changed Graff's character quite a bit. In the book, he is stern with Ender and at times a jerk but he truly loves the kid and would do anything for him. In the movie, they almost made Anderson the kind one and Graff a horrible person. I didn't care for that change at all.Nonetheless, the movie was still great and I highly suggest anyone who enjoys science fiction, or just great movies in general, to check it out. In my opinion, it's definitely worth the price of entry.",Ender's Game

I definitely recommend this movie. Bon Appetit",Ender's Game
112,solojere,Fun Sci-Fi Flick,7,21 September 2021,"Ender's Game is a fun little Sci-Fi flick about a child prodigy who is constantly being tested to see if he is the right fit to lead humanity against an army of alien bugs. In the past, these bugs invaded earth, but humanity was able to drive them away, and now humanity wants to take the fight to them (Starship Troopers any anyone?). Except for this time, humanity is looking to children to lead the way. The film never really states why they are using these kids. My only guess is because it would make it easier to market the film to kids. I won't spoil anything, but I thought that it was a fun movie all in all. And I must admit I haven't read the books, which could be why the film drags in a few places.But all in all, it's an okay film. For the most part, the casting is excellent. Harrison Ford has proven he can play any role, and I think this is a good addition to his resume. It is similar to some of his other roles but different enough to be unique. A young Hailee Steinfeld also shines as the girl who becomes Ender's right-hand woman and his only friend. She isn't in the movie's first half, but once she shows up, she steals every scene she is in. And I know a lot of fans of the book would probably hate this idea, but I think she would have made a great protagonist had they decided to do a gender swap and had Hailee play Ender. However, I thought the kid who played Ender did a good job.At times the film dragged a bit. The training and the games they play are a lot the same, and it kind of gets repetitive. However, my main problem with this film is the ending. The film feels like it is meant to be part of a trilogy. However, those other films were never made, and the result feels a little bland and is kind of depressing in a way. Eight years have passed so it seems unlikely that any other films will be made now. I mean Hailee Steinfeld and the kid who played Ender are all grown up now. But with that said its still a fun little movie to watch every now and again.",Ender's Game
113,ivko,A good book and movie with occasionally outdated concepts,7,2 May 2018,"I'm going to discuss some plot points that could be considered spoilers, although I won't be giving away the (whole) ending.The book this movie was based upon has long been a favorite of mine. I probably read it a good five or six times over the last few decades before I ever saw the movie, and I recommend the book as well as the movie. The story is an examination of the human relationship with violence. The way it effects us and our society, the ugliness of it as well as the necessity and seductiveness of it. The book also examines warfare strategy in some detail, although the movie spends less time on that aspect. The central premise isn't exactly novel: in the future humans encounter a hostile alien species and engage in a war for survival, with a focus on the rise of a brilliant child named Ender as humanities best hope for survival. What is more unique is the exploration of the idea that defeating a powerful enemy requires such intimate knowledge of them; their tactics, their society, and their perspective, so that eventually you come to empathize with them to some degree. In other words, victory should be derived from the complete comprehension of an enemy civilization and the necessary application of force required to achieve peaceful coexistence, but with a cognizance that your enemy is thinking and feeling and their society has value even if circumstance pits you against one another. It doesn't proffer the idea that war is completely evil or unjust, despite admitting the potentially horrific consequences of it, but rather that it shouldn't be entered into lightly or with the naive belief that it can be humane and glorious (i.e. 'just war' may not be an oxymoron, but 'humane warfare' is). These ideas are explored in both the movie and the book, although the book goes into much greater detail using allusions to the founding fathers of the United States via a series of opinion letters published under a pseudonym by his siblings.Setting aside the stories quasi-acceptance of violence, which is a deeper question not suited for this forum, the book/movie has several conceits that are a little outdated, to my thinking. The first is the idea of children as military leaders. This plot point is inspired by the fact that children have a very high capacity for learning. There are a host of biological reasons for this, but I think that drawing the idea out to this extent is more dramatic and gimmicky than realistic. While it's true that children can learn certain skills such as languages and mathematics faster than adults, there are distinct limits to this. First of all, knowledge without experience can't be wielded very effectively. Part of the process of a maturing mind is discovering how information fits together and can be creatively recombined to face new challenges. The evidence for this is all around; there have been many child prodigies who went to some Ivy league school at 12 and completed one or more doctorates before leaving their teens, but if you look at the record of great literature or mathematical or scientific achievements, you won't find many references to great works by teenagers. I'm not trying to downplay the incredible potential, only pointing out that the creative spark that fuses raw knowledge into meaningful insight tends to come later in life, with a little perspective. So you might be able to stuff young minds made powerful by incredible neuroplasticity full of strategic theory and physics, but I have serious doubts that the product would be a 14-year-old Hannibal.The second problem I have always had with this is the application of the ""everything genius"". This is one of the most over-used tropes concerning intelligence, because it seems intuitive even though it is wrong. The basic idea is if someone is a genius at one thing, then they must be a genius at everything. So a math prodigy can also play any musical instrument simply by hearing a piece played once or write great novels or become super warriors by calculating the angle of blows or whatever. The truth is this just isn't how genius works. A math prodigy might have trouble tying their shoes or be unable to comprehend grammar or some such. Because while genius is still a mystery, there is some evidence that it is basically a hyper-specialization of the mind. And hyper-specialization in one area means some other areas might not get the attention that even an average intellect would give them. The story explains that Ender was selected because he is a genius, and then shows him excelling at hand to hand combat, physics, mathematics, strategy, etc. Basically, he becomes the perfect human being, and the explanation, insufficiently, is that he's a genius.My third issue is with the requirement for a gifted human commander to lead the troops. The story presents the idea that humanity needs this commander to handle the enormously difficult task of guiding the armada during battle while executing optimal battle strategy, etc. Every scene in both the book and the movie shows him acting as a battlefield commander only. There is no long-term strategy planning, he just shows up as the battle is about to start and has to see it thru to victory or defeat. The thing is, the story is set at some point in humanities future. Technological development has proceeded to the point where Ender uses a computer with a smooth brain-computer interface and the government is capable of installing a probe that literally see thru the main characters eyes. So my point is, there is no reason to expect that their computers aren't at least as good as ours, but in this day and age we can already see a near-future where that battlefield commander job would almost certainly be performed more capably by a computer than a human.Chess, long held as the strategists proof of skills, fell first. When it happened it was a huge shock; people had long held the belief that no computer could ever truly be as good as the best human players. I remember reading many reasonable sounding arguments for why humans would always have the upper hand in chess, and once it was clear that not only could computers match the best human players but were now in fact pulling ahead to a degree that we were unlikely to ever catch up, those same arguments switched to the game of Go. And, of course, now computers have pulled ahead in that as well. The fact is that companies like Microsoft now claim their systems have superhuman language comprehension (they understand the spoken word better than we do), have pulled even in language to language translation capability, and are drawing in on image recognition as well. All of which is to say that in future warfare, the control and direction of battlefield units will almost certainly be AI driven. It may be scary, but this is just an area where the machines outpace us. So Ender would not have been necessary, unless E.N.D.E.R. was some acronym like Efficient Neuro Data Event Responder or something.And finally my biggest problem with the story. The entire war is eventually revealed *SPOILER ALERT* to be the result of an inability to establish communication between the humans and aliens. Ok, I can see that. But then there is a subplot where a mind-controlled game (which exists in the story to facilitate communication with the aliens and to keep us wondering about Ender's true nature) mysteriously includes images of the aliens and alien worlds. It turns out that the aliens hacked the game and placed these in it in a desperate attempt to communicate with Ender. Here is where I call BS. There is simply no way you could understand human technology to the degree you could hack into a mind controlled program and alter the content and not be capable of at least basic communication. It simply requires too much knowledge of us and thus the way we think and communicate. Computer programming may seem like symbolic nonsense to a non-tech, but it is actually deeply rooted in language and math , and of course a machine that can directly interpret our thoughts to drive its activity must almost by definition include a road map of how we communicate. How else would such a computer interpret commands?All in all though I'm nitpicking. Some of the ideas may be outdated or force conditions convenient to the plot (the straw-man bullies Ender fights that cap each section of his training during his rise to commander are another example of this), but the movie manages to retain the underlying ideas of the book very faithfully and the visuals are excellent. So is the acting and editing; the movie moves very smoothly and maintains your attention well. I liked it enough to buy it for my movie collection and would recommend it to others.",Ender's Game
114,JohnWelles,Engaging Science Fiction,9,30 October 2013,"""Ender's Game"" (2013), directed by the South African Gavin Hood, is a military science fiction film based on Orson Scott Card's cult novel of the same name from 1985. It's a film that is more complex than it initially appears, the exposition-leaden opening thankfully not an indicator of what is to come, with Hood using cinematic techniques to tell the story rather than using any trite narrative clutches such as voice-over. Instead, the script (also written by Hood), introduces the figure of Ender, played by a marvellously cold Asa Butterfield, and his submergence into a future world of complex military strategy. The presence of many other child actors, even the Oscar-nominated Hailee Steinfeld and Abigail Breslin fail to make much impact. Yet this isn't a downside as much as it appears; Ender is supposed to be isolated and withdrawn, and it is appropriate for a film seen through his eyes that we scarcely get to known anything more than the broad strokes of personality from his compatriots in ""Command School"".The older members of the cast though, disappointingly, don't register as much as they need to. Harrison Ford's Colonel Graff is rather one-note, only Ben Kinsley's unconventional character Mazer Rackham being memorable. The script fairly abandons them all to the sidelines and favours Ender above all else; thankfully, Butterfield is more than capable to meet that challenge, delivering an excellent child performance for a none too likable character. He's the film's strongest point.The direction is good, even exhilarating in the scenes of stimulated zero gravity battle. The $110 million budget has been well used, credibly creating orbiting space stations and ships. The future imagined isn't so far from are our world, the suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience not so great. It follows the path of films as diverse as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""Minority Report"" (2002) that realised the future is made more plausible by having ties to the present.Unfortunately, the ingenious twist ending, which probably works better on the page than it does on the screen, has, by necessity, almost to mould the movie in reverse leaving a curious sense of distance and lack of tension to the climax, while the epilogue goes into a bizarre realm which feels out of tone with the rest of the film.The film is still an enjoyable science fiction movie, professional and well-made, but it suffers from the feeling it may have even been better had it been braver in adapting the source novel and not felt so obliged to try and translate aspects of it that don't work on the silver screen.",Ender's Game
115,Mike-DD,Don't watch with pre-conceived notions of how it should be done,7,21 March 2014,"I've never read the books, only the Wikipedia article, so I watched this with little preconceived notions of how it should have been done. And I thought, as a movie, that it acquitted itself quite well amidst all the news and hype surrounding it.I found the movie story told well enough - children recruited for war and the dilemmas it posed, a colonel with a win-at-all-costs attitude and his independent protégé who disagreed. I read some comments which reviled the movie's pace, but I think it was meant to be that way, keeping in mind that the creator of Ender's Game resisted a film adaptation until he had control of the script. I conclude that the movie must have at least compared well enough with his vision for it.The visuals were well done, even if I had some problems with some of the exaggerated gestures used that distracted me from the battle screens. The battle scenes and views of the fleet were done epic-style, but I did wish there were more of it. I also wished the battle and fight scenes were longer - the rush didn't have much time grow before you're forced to the climax.The standout actors have to be Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Ford is excellent in his portrayal of Colonel Graff - the no-nonsense commander who has seemingly no compassion, whose only goal is to win at any and all costs. Butterfield acquitted himself well in the role, but his emotions seem forced - you couldn't really see the battles in his mind unless they were spoken out loud. This may be a fault of the script - there isn't really a lot of time for character development considering the fast tempo of the film. What time was spent for development wasn't used effectively enough.The other actors in the movie performed a good job. The majority of the main cast are child actors, and they did well in roles which did not allow them to be children.If you don't come watching this hoping to see a 100% faithful adaptation of the book, you will be able to enjoy the movie for its story, its visuals and the acting.",Ender's Game

Harrison Ford, Ben Kinsley and Viola Davis were brilliant as was Asa Butterfield.The story was another part; it was pretty much instantly captivating and had me completely absorbed and hanging on every thread.

Nonetheless, I very much liked the film and am kind of sad they are not making anymore movies off the series. So at the start, we are introduced to Ender, a young boy who seems to be just one step ahead of everybody around him. His quick wit and ability to assess the best solutions make him a perfect candidate to lead an attack on an enemy alien force, at least in the eyes of Colonel Graff, who trains him to be the best leader possible. But can Ender manage this difficult responsibility? Overall I was pleased with the story and the performances. Asa Butterfield is a great lead actor in this movie and brings a lot of energy to the film, along with the likes of Abigail Breslin and Hailee Steinfeld. The seasoned actors such as Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley balance the cast quite well and the result is very satisfactory. In the end, I guess if you're looking for a nice adventure filled, family film, Ender's Game might just do fine as the choice.Rating: 8/10",Ender's Game
119,deacon_blues-3,Better than the novel!,7,19 December 2014,"Personally, I found the O.S. Card novel that forms the basis for this film cluttered with tedious subplots and superfluous details. The seemingly unending zero-G battles became a bore, and especially the political manipulation of the earth's population over the net by Peter and Valentine were all so over-explained and unrealistic so as to be rather nauseating. I loved how the film stuck right to the main points of the story without muddling it up with a lot of syfy decorations that added nothing dramatically to the main story. There were many points in the story that were actually obscured by Card's overblown prose in the book, but were perfectly, clearly expressed by the film because it stayed on point and did not wander aimlessly through the landscape of Card's rather amateurish attempt at creating a viable world.Acting was quite good for a syfy movie, especially Asa Butterfield's Ender.The set design was especially good, with the zero-G battles staged clearly and efficiently just the way I imagined them. The final battle effects were particularly impressive, and also clearly related the battle situations and strategies for the audience. I was able to grasp much more of the essential story information from this film than I ever did from the novel, which left me coldly apathetic toward both Ender and the plight of the Formics.Thanks, Gavin Hood, for making Card's muddle-headed writing make sense!",Ender's Game
120,craig-hopton,Just average,6,17 November 2015,"I do like Sci-Fi movies that test the boundaries of our morality by imagining extreme future scenarios. Ender's Game is certainly one of those - it imagines a world when we deliberately turn children into soldiers to fight an enemy which threatens our very existence. Unfortunately, it treats this grave subject with kid gloves.The children who are sent to fight the alien Formics are treated to a series of war 'games', simulations that progressively get more and more complex. The problem is that these games are always one step removed from the actual enemy.So all we really see is a group of school kids with all their usual petty disagreements, who just happen to play video games. It never really feels like training child soldiers is a particularly unusual or worrisome endeavour.The movie is somewhat rescued by the excellent Asa Butterfield, who plays Ender, the child commander of Earth's forces. He is a genuinely complex and interesting character, and Butterfield is the only actor in this movie of real talent (even Harrison Ford was mediocre in comparison).I did enjoy watching Ender's Game but I am struggling to rate it as any more than just average.",Ender's Game
121,Laight,Awful doesn't begin to describe this movie,1,21 September 2014,"Every once in a while Hollywood churns out a movie where you can just imagine the meetings that went beforehand. Here's a book that many people love, someone said. Let's make a film! We won't bother to add acting (the presence of Harrison Ford will assure that). We won't bother to hire someone who can direct. We won't bother with characterization, we don't deal with dialog, we don't even need a script! We have a book and we have special effects! What can possibly go wrong? The answer: Ender's Game. One of the worst science fiction movies in memory. Do yourself a favor. Watch 2001: A Space Odyssey again. Watch a Star Wars Movie. Watch ET. Watch anything but this sad piece of wasted money.",Ender's Game
122,trans_mauro,Boot camp for nerds!,1,28 January 2014,"This is one of those coma-inducing films. As tedious as watching C-Span...People should stop calling this garbage science fiction. What we have in this film is a bunch of boring kids trying to survive some sort of military school or a futuristic boot camp. They sprinkle the garbage with some special effects, a little of technobabble, some run-of-the-mill evil alien monsters, add heavy weight actors such as Ford and Kingsley and wrap the final product with a juvenile love story and, bang, we have Ender's Game.This a story that has been told million of times before (the superation, the fish out-of-water, the leader in the making, etc.), in different settings, eras, countries, etc... There is nothing new here. It is another eye-candy type of film that is totally forgettable.It was not worth the price of the admission ticket",Ender's Game
123,toqtaqiya2,A good attempt to adapt a complicated science fiction novel that features thrilling action and impressive visuals.,6,11 November 2013,"I noticed a trend in Hollywood recently. More science fiction films are being released. That's a very good thing because people like science fiction and a representation of a progressive future. In the future of Ender's Game Andrew Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to win the next great war between the human race and an alien species called the Formics. Wiggin is a brilliant misfit with the right balance of killer instincts and compassion. Butterfield delivers a good performance but, most importantly, makes his character sympathetic. His performance gives the film some much needed soul. He had also done admirable work when he played Hugo Cabret in Hugo (2011). Hailee Steinfeld, playing Petra Arkanian, is another standout in the cast. Her scenes with Butterfield in Battle School are exciting. The simulated war games in an impressive zero-gravity training room could have dragged, but director Gavin Hood managed to make these scenes some of the most entertaining in the film. Hood should also be commended for making an efficient film from a weak screenplay. The film isn't really inspired but with a $110 million budget and a good cast it works surprisingly well. The generally excellent special effects create a visually interesting future world both in space and on Earth. Wiggin's scenes with his sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) are handled well too. It's in the performances of the adult actors where the screenplay clearly shows its weakness. Viola Davis, playing Gwen Anderson, has little to do except look worried while Wiggin deals with one challenge after another. Harrison Ford, playing Hyrum Graff, brings his usual authority to his role but awkwardly alternates between caring and uncaring. Still, the film wins in terms of adapting the very complicated novel by Orson Scott Card. It doesn't have the same emotional impact as the novel though. Ender's Game isn't only for a young audience because it doesn't whitewash politics and war. Adults will enjoy this futuristic action film too. I recommend it.",Ender's Game
124,tinovalkki,Visually stunning with great story to tell,8,5 December 2013,"http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/enders-game-2013/ Ender's Game is smart sci-fi movie. Little bit like Starship Trooopers or Blade Runner. Beneath a beautiful skin there is a strong social criticism story. You may notice it or you may watch the whole movie as a beautiful sci-fi story. You may see the story as a criticism against USA:s policy to defend itself with prevention strike against anyone if they think to be threatened. In the movie almost fascist like society has tame their youth to make prevention strike without any criticism. They defend strikes justification for their youth just because enemy will strike if they don't strike first. Young Ender's dares to rise against authority and mistrusts that. Ender's Game has a great story to tell, but it is also beautiful to watch. It feels like 3D movie despite it is not. Space landscapes and -fights are gorgeous. It is always a risk to put a child to a leading role at a movie, but Asa Butterfield is a great choice for Ender's role. There is enough of sensitivity, yet enough character in his role. Harrison Ford is great as a General Graff. It is hard to believe that he is over 70 years old. Only thing which bother here is that movie feels to end too soon. It feels like it is a big budget Television show pilot movie. We will see if Ender's Game gets enough audience for a sequel. That really is needed. The great story may just to be a little too clever to its target audience. Visually stunning movie, which is have to watch from a big screen.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/enders-game-2013/",Ender's Game
125,cnycitylady,Flatline,6,23 February 2014,"Ender's Game is a prime example of a screenplay adaptation failing to complement the book through lack of story. Now, I don't mean to sound harsh, we all know that a book to movie translation is hard work and never as good as we expect, but here there was absolutely no tension. The story is about a young boy trained to lead an army against the alien race that threatens earth, and save the world, you would expect some nerve wracking, blood pumping anxiety to splash the screen occasionally through character interaction and emotion, but there is nothing. It was critically missing that X-factor that would've breathed life into the tale.The actors are all well seasoned and can deliver a line but the emotion in this film was lackadaisical. They didn't ever truly get stirred up. And the script was written in a way that went out of their way to explain things that really didn't need an explanation. Also, it was cheesy the way they gave back-story or explained things to other characters. You could tell it was more for the audience than the characters.The age bump was necessary for the screen but it took away from the innocence of the characters. They came across as wimpy or whiny when they were just supposed to be young and inexperienced. And not to mention the lack of the character Valentine. (Ender's Sister for those of you who are not to sure who I'm talking about) She played a big role in shaping who Ender was and what he did, but in the movie you see her in three short scenes and it fails to portray the bond the two siblings shared.The movie just came across as dead to me for the most part, and borderline boring but it wasn't all bad; The graphics were amazing and the actors were (for the most part) in tune with their character. And the story, as basic as it was, was entertaining. It didn't push the boundaries of movie making or character development but you won't walk away halfway through. I give Ender's Game 5.8/10 for stunning visuals and an all star cast but no more for lack of usage of such valuable assets.",Ender's Game
126,bravesfanc,One of the better book to film adaptations,7,14 November 2013,"As a fan of the book, I had some expectations going into this and it didn't disappoint. The first scene sets the tone of what Ender is capable of. His teachers see it in him to be a great leader and do certain things to see how he reacts. This is to determine if he's the one to lead the humans against the alien race.I wasn't able to see it in 3D but I feel like maybe it would've been even more enjoyable. The cinematography was beautiful to look at including the match arena. The matches themselves were also a joy to watch and Ender is given his own team and he dominates the competition.They didn't have everything in the movie that was in the book but that's expected and the parts that were cut didn't take away from the story. One small problem I had was the casting of Moises Arias, maybe it's because of what I've seen him in but I didn't buy him being this tough guy, even though in the book the description fits his body type.Bottom line, if you enjoyed the book you will enjoy the film.",Ender's Game

It more of an illustrated storyline than an all out Sc-fi action adventure film but because of the flaws in this film for me it fall below what IMDb rates this film.sorry but this film from the trailer looked like it had potential but it falls short of being a perfect Sc-fi because of the flaws.It should of been a lot more action than the way this film was filmed, hardly any action & to much story just doesn't make for a interesting story its what lets this film down really. With the film being slightly slow as well there just wasn't enough to keep me interested in saying this was a fantastic film.",Ender's Game
128,ksj870,At what price victory?,8,8 November 2013,"The heading for this review could easily be the tagline for the new science fiction film based on a popular young adult novel by author Orson Scott Card. Though definitely a great action/adventure film, ENDER'S GAME is more concerned with ideas and values than flashy special effects.Not that there aren't quite a few visual treats, of course. ENDER'S GAME is an alien invasion film—sort of—and a series of short but powerful flashbacks tell the story of a nearly-successful colonization of Earth by an insect-like species known as the Formics. Nearly wiped out, the people have Earth have lived in constant fear of a second invasion in the decades since. Human technology has advanced considerably in the interim, and our space fleet has set up a perimeter around the Formic homeworld, waiting for the inevitable second war.As that war seems to draw ever closer, the veteran officer Colonel Graff eyes a young boy named Ender Wiggins. Ender displays a special military genius in the computerized wargames that are used to train potential new leaders, children being especially targeted as their younger brains adapt to new information more quickly. Graff is convinced that Ender is the key to defeating the Formic forces once and for all, and sets about meticulously orchestrating Ender's development so that the boy can ultimately fulfill his destiny.But what about Ender? How does he feel about this destiny? Is he as gifted as Graff thinks he is? And even if he is, is the life of a soldier really what he wants? Does what he wants even matter? The question of freedom is a big part of ENDER'S GAME, as the characters constantly struggle with the reality of living under the shadow of possible extermination at the hands of a merciless and literally inhuman adversary while nonetheless retaining basic human needs for liberty, personal satisfaction, and family, all of which are often at odds with the martial demands of a culture consumed with battle readiness. Moreover, the script deftly addresses our human tendency to de-humanize the enemy by basing Ender's special talent for strategy upon an apparent contradiction. As Ender himself says, ""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him."" ENDER'S GAME is well-produced, paced, acted and directed. Colonel Graff is played by the great Harrison Ford with chilling authority, while Asa Butterfield brings Ender to life with an expert performance which belies his young years. An all-round excellent science fiction that combines thrills and adventure with a rare thoughtfulness and insight, ENDER'S GAME is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.",Ender's Game
129,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,3 November 2013,"Ender's Game is a movie based on the novel of the same name, written in 1985 by Orson Scott Card, which is supposed to be extremely popular, but I hadn't heard of it until I saw the trailer for the movie – and therefore, I didn't manage to read the novel. Many say the movie is awful, in comparison to the novel, and are also boycotting it because of Orson Scott Card's opposition to gay marriage, and homosexuality in general. I didn't know about this controversy either, but it's obviously a difficult issue to resolve: can we separate the author from its work? And since the movie isn't exactly/only Card's work, should we boycott it? And since nobody seems to have boycotted the books, wouldn't boycotting the movie be hypocritical? Finally, since the movie doesn't deal with homosexuality at all, wouldn't the boycott be pointless? I'm absolutely for gay rights and marriage, but I don't think it's reasonable to boycott this movie.In the future, Earth was attacked by an alien race known as Formics, and it was saved only thanks to the International Fleet Commander, Mazer Rackham's sacrifice during battle. After the aliens were driven away, the International Military started training the best children on the planet for the (supposed) next Formic attack. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited, one evening, by the prestigious Battle School, where he starts training with other children and young adults, under the ever-watching eyes of Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis), a gentle soul who seems to be the only person to consider the recruits what they are – just children.I should start by saying that the trailer for this movie is one of the worst ever: it makes you want to just skip this movie, and it makes the movie itself look awful and boring. The only positive thing it does to you is that, when you actually see the movie, you're pleasantly surprised. Ender's Game deals with tough topics, like violence, relationships among people, war and human psychology. Ender doesn't think it makes any sense to attack the Formics if they are not attacking Earth, and yet keeps on kicking people after he's won the fight with them and they are just lying on the floor – 'to prevent them from attacking again'. He's constantly reminded of this contradiction by the ruthless Colonel Graff and often fights him because of his views on war. The movie has managed to explore this topic in a very good way, which should be praised: it's not just another pointless Sci-Fi, and it's not for children (only).The main character is played by Asa Butterfield, whom you might remember as the character Hugo in the extremely successful movie of the same name. Here, he delivers another great performance and carries the whole story masterfully. Harrison Ford is a very good sometimes-antagonist, and can be truly difficult to take sides when his and Asa's characters fight. It's also interesting to get Viola Davis' character's view on the whole thing – as I said before, she sees the recruits as just children who can't psychologically take the war, and often confronts Colonel Graff about this. The CGI is excellent in this movie, but the thing that I liked the most is that the movie isn't CGI-focused. Most of it happens inside a space ship, and the few views of space and Earth that we get are wonderful. The only downside of the movie happens in the end, but there's no point in spoiling that. All in all, Ender's Game is a movie that will satisfy your need for a smart Sci-Fi, if you decide to see it.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Ender's Game

I mean, it doesn't come anywhere close to including all the depth and complexity of the novel.. There are definitely many things that get glossed over (like the Valentine/Peter stuff), but at the same time i don't think you could realistically cram ALL of that into one film. But i felt like it did a decent job of giving a cliff-notes version of the tale of Ender in a fairly satisfying format. The ending is a bit rushed, i think they could have done with some more characterization of what Ender was really trying to do, becoming Speaker for the Dead, but... Otherwise.. It did a decent job of realizing the settings of the Battle School and the Ansible battles pretty well.",Ender's Game

The DVD was not too expensive so reading what's on the cover and considering the actors i expected a good movie. I was wrong. Nothing original, this movie looks like it was made from parts of old films. seems like the creator of this movie took parts from 3 or 4 old films, 1 really forgotten (i am not sure that i can put the name here) and just created a salad. Small cast, mostly cg graphics, no logical explanation how a nation of ants can create amazing weapons and why they do what they do. ridiculous makeup for Mr. Kingsley, where is the connection between his make up and the plot? he says meaningless sentences.

132,evan_harvey,Almost great,6,5 December 2013,"Just watched Ender's Game. It was almost a great film. Almost. Here's why: The director (who also wrote the screenplay) obviously didn't read the book. Or if he did, he didn't understand it. It's been a long time since I read the book, but from memory here's the main problem with the film.At some point in the original story, Ender is told that the Buggers are a hive mind. They attacked earth, thinking that humans were non-sentient. When they realised that the humans were actually individual sentient creatures, it was too late to reverse their mistake. That's why the Buggers never returned to earth again to fight. The film hints at this a couple of times, but it never says why.This is a glaring omission from the film. Why is it so important? Because it makes everything Ender achieved worthless. The Buggers were never going to return to attack Earth, so the human pursuit to the Bugger homeworld was unnecessary. Ender, though thinking his part of the war was just a simulation, is responsible for the death of what was ultimately a peaceful civilisation. That is the great tragedy of Ender's game; all that death was unnecessary, and Ender was the unwitting architect of it.By completely failing to understand this, the director made a film that is largely pointless. Yes, Ender was tricked into thinking the ""command school"" battles were just a simulation, but the full extent of the horror he inflicted on the Buggers is unsaid, and that demeans the whole story.Poor, poor effort, Gavin Hood.",Ender's Game
133,sjarja,"good, but could have been much better",7,19 September 2015,"This movie kind of reminds me on the first Harry Potter movie. No, not for its story of course - but for its pacing. It feels like a rather disconnected series of scenes that were considered to be ""key"" scenes - and that can only really be connected with the lore and meta-knowledge of the book.Characters in the movie are well acted - but lack depths and development. But not so much to be annoying. So it is a slight disappointment for such a big movie.I have to agree with some reviewers on the fact that this movie should have been split into two or maybe even 3 parts of 2 or 2.5 hours each. At no point did i become greatly immersed or did i start to care much about the characters - because all i got was flickers of their progression.Story-wise it reminded me on the TV series ""space above and beyond"" - especially the ending. But the series did a better job getting immersed (of course, because it had so much more time to develop the characters) The movie is good - but one cannot shake the feeling that it could have been great ... if it had been more detailed and focused on the characters.",Ender's Game
134,coljam21,A little boring.,5,1 November 2013,"I was a little bored. The graphics were awesome along with the costumes and all the sets etc. but I still found the movie a little boring. I guess they spent too much time on nothing-ness. I have never read the book so I was not sure what to expect but I was expecting a little more action and excitement.The movie was almost 2 hours long, but the first hour and 45 minutes was of all the kids in the classroom training and trying to figure out who they are and their purpose on the ship. I guess considering they are children one can't really expect much in the way of action but still I felt there was something missing.The last 5 minutes of the movie was the best part. The twist in the end made a lot of sense. It sort of brought all the loose ends throughout the movie together.

135,StonedMagician,Good: 7.0,7,28 July 2019,"The novel this film adapted is seen a classic, considered by some to be the greatest science fiction novel of all time. The last time I read it, I was too young to really understand what was going on, so when the movie was announced, I thought it would be a good opportunity to look into the story again. Though the film is no classic, it's held up by solid writing and performances. While Hailee Steinfeld is a bit disappointing (never thought I'd say that), Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford remain eminently watchable, both bringing the appropriate amount of charisma to their respective roles. It's also well directed, and you can see director Gavin Hood invisibly manipulating the sometimes dozens of characters and objects on screen with a delicate deftness. While Card's story shines through, the transition from pages to the screen feels a bit haphazard. The plot is rushed along, hurrying through dialog in order to reach the occasionally drawn-out action sequences. It's by no means incoherent, but more focus on the characters (and perhaps a longer run time) could have gone a long way.",Ender's Game
136,albrechtcm,Zzzzzzzzz.,2,11 February 2014,"Only one way to describe this five hour movie: Boring! Okay, it just seemed like five hours. A good substitute for Sominex. In all fairness, sci-fi flicks like this have a following among kids and maybe a lot of them liked it. I thought we hit bottom with After Earth, but Hollywood wasn't done by a long shot. Ender's Game is another kid show with a name adult in the background just to give it the appearance of quality. The man who used to be Harrison Ford either desperately needs any money he can get, or he's just so hungry to keep working that he'll take what he can get. Next I expect him to be guesting on the type of show that features the likes of Tonya Harding and Danny Bonaduce. And Ben Kingsley is right behind him. Hey, at one time their name on a flick meant something. What's this about? Okay, it's another alien invasion flick combined with kids who learn war with video games à la The Last Starfighter (the kid from a trailer court), and yet another of those tried and true attempts where a self-doubting person is drafted to take a bunch of losers and turn them into winners. The special effects were pretty good, but that doesn't make up for lack of a good story and people you care about. Nobody in this film moved me.

But to be honest, even those are very lackluster.This appears to be a cut rate shoot-em-up which calls itself Ender's Game as a gimmick. Another gimmick was the casting of Harrison Ford, who brings nothing to his role as senior military commander.There is no musical theme, just the ubiquitous constant thumping which is all too common nowadays, and presumably cheaper to produce.I didn't see any blatant product placement, but I wasn't looking out for it.

138,nodlimax,Poor representation of the book,3,17 October 2020,Recently I got myself the audio book for Ender's Game and really enjoyed it. I wanted to see how it was translated to the big screen. Unfortunately it wasn't done well.A lot of characters were miscast - especially Ender. In the book Ender was younger than the rest. He was thrown into the school at the age of 6 where the usual starting age was 8. So just because of this alone there would've been size differences. Bonzo was considered a threat to Ender even in a 1on1 fight because he was bigger and stronger. In general this was also a theme within the book - the weak overcoming terrible odds.The next problem is that the story has been cut way to much. 90 minutes is not enough time to properly translate the book. They would've needed at least a 2 hour movie extending the first half of the movie.Ender as a character in the movie is not likable and there is no reason why he would've gotten the support of the other kids. In addition the other characters are extremely underdeveloped. By the end of the movie you don't really know anything about the supporting characters. And the worst is that you probably won't care about Ender neither.Also where the first half of the movie presents basically 2/3 of the book in a very condensed and modified version the second half of the movie makes drastic changes to the finale of the book regarding location and execution. It simply kills the story as a whole.The visual effects look good. However a movie can't stand on visuals alone.,Ender's Game

A buddy of mine loves the novel and has been looking forward to the film adaptation for some time, and I am aware of the recent press the author Card has had with his public praise for male/female marriage, which I admire. Other than that I only knew of what I have heard. I predicted this based on what I knew to be more of a mind games thing than it was. After talking to my friend who read the novel testified to and is the case for many novels, there are many interesting details not present in the film adaptation that greatly fleshed out the characters.There was apparently many more mental warfare scenarios in the novel that are a bit difficult to put together on the big screen. But what's here is pretty good. The character development is decent, although empathy may be a stretch in some scenarios of this science fiction universe, the viewer is probably on Ender's side a majority of the time, especially with the odds stacked against him and many other cadets and bullies out to get him. It's also entertaining to watch Ender succeed in almost every adversarial situation. There is apparently more explanation as to how Ender dissects his opponents in the novel and that isn't explained in the movie. Sometimes it seems far fetched for a lanky boy to maneuver and get out of the situations he does without the explanation of his mental acuity.",Ender's Game
140,georgecoffeynewyorker,Misunderstood Plot,5,6 November 2013,"I enjoyed this film immensely. However I found the film to be of completely different plot to what I had expected. I had expected that the team were fighting the aliens who were trying to take over the humans in real life however the whole film concentrated on one thing TRAINING. This really bothered me or as Father Ted ""Frankly it bored the arse off me"" - hahaha. If the director is to get this going Harry Potter financially, it'd better do a bit more than training. Im glad thou the twist was a give away ie the main character Ender is going to save the alien's baby or something like that. It was very touching when Ender realised that the Aliens planet was blown up completely and this really upset him, he all alone thought it was a Test before the final, but unfortunately it was all so real. I was really touched that Enders really cared at the end. ALien's mightned speak our language or mightned be our friend, but at the end of the day, they are there for a reason.

I liked it so much I purchased the book and quite a few other Card efforts. Over the years I re-read it many times, enjoying it just as much as the first. Imagine my surprise two years ago and found it rated as the favorite SF novel of all time. And then to hear a film was in the works! After seeing the previews I thought I'd be disappointed; it just seemed wrong. However, on viewing the film I must say the persons involved did a credible version of the book. I was able to set aside my expectations and just enjoy it.My only real complaints were two-fold. First, I thought the presence of big stars was distracting. Relative unknowns should have played the adults more convincingly. Second, and this has some bearing on the first, too much was spent on the sets and effects and adult cast members. It looks like the film will be a gigantic financial flop. The book is not a visual shoot-em-up but actually pretty small and claustrophobic. Big names, big sets and big effects may be what the kiddies want but this is supposed to be both more and less than that. The battle room was the only major set necessary and even that could have been much smaller.Overall a valiant effort that got a bit out of control.",Ender's Game

It wouldn't surprise me if they reused the set from Xenon: Girl of the Twenty First Century.And I feel bad for Harrison Ford.I don't like bandwagons. No matter who's piloting the rig, I try to avoid jumping on. But Harry's left me no choice.He doesn't record the lines for Lego Han Solo, and now this? To call his performance unconvincing would be generous.My opinion's never changed so dramatically halfway through a film.The first portion deserves a little less than three stars, but the second half is almost a fiver. Thereby positing this film just short of greatness.My main problem with Blender's Shame is the acting. The performances are almost all underwhelming.Some are bad. Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin doesn't deliver a poor performance, but it's nothing to shake a stick at. He's okay I guess. Perhaps that's a function of how his character is written. Fun the actor's name matches the greatness of his character's, though.The two best parts of this film (besides a certain reveal) are Nonso Anozie and Ben Kingsley. Both turn in solid performances as inventive compelling characters.What the film lacks in thespianism it makes up for in smart, original storytelling.During even the clunkiest of moments, the shining rays of intelligent narrative peek through the cringeworthy canopy.Finally, the CGI is exceptional. See this film if you're into this kind of thing, and can swallow some scoffs.Now onto some spoilers.At first, I thumbed my nose at the video of Mazer Rackham attacking the alien's mothership. Thought it was just a jet fighter versus organic extraterrestrial millennium falcons in a storm cloud.But boy was I wrong. And that's only one of two fantastic reveals.One thing I really liked was the humanistic nature of the future. So often in science fiction, the world is dystopian, or at least 'the man' is just as brutal as ever. The idea that Ender is able to go back to Earth to visit his sister, Valentine, feels right to me. When Petra asks if she can stay with Ender while he's unconscious, I appreciate Colonel Graff's response.(Perhaps that's why ol' Harry Ford doesn't work; maybe some menace would've done the trick.)There are painful moments in Ender's Game. Almost every greatness is ruined by the following odd character interaction, an off-putting acting performance or cliché.The Islamic reference is a complete non-sequitur; painful whether it was shoved into the film's plot or not.I find everything inside the zero-gravity playground dull, and never feel like there's anything at stake. I'm getting furious thinking about how poorly these scenes are executed. You have no concept of who is winning or losing, or the reasons why, at any point during the freeze pistol games.So nobody's tried that rope trick in the entire history of the floaty cube olympics? The last five seconds are good, but jarringly odd, and then that plot element is gone.For most of the movie, Ender actually sits by himself at lunch.When Ben Kingsley shows up, everything gets way better. And I love the time spent interacting with the 'mind game.'I would have loved if it ended, and everyone still shunned him at lunchtime.But in all seriousness, how about that ending? Duped into genocide? Good stuff!At that moment, I'm shackled to purchasing a ticket to the sequel.Pretty soon old men will lament the loss of sound content in narrative.""That another one of those conflabbed Hunger Endgames?""You crazy kids and your space gladiators.",Ender's Game
143,gdump,Excellent portrayal. Compares well to the original novelette,8,10 July 2014,"People who are complaining that this doesn't compare well to the book need to remember that the book was expanded from the earlier 1978 Hugo-nominated novelette of the same name. The movie appears to quite closely follow the original work -- as best as I can remember.It is never a good idea to compare a lengthy book to a movie as there is simply no way that you can ever cover the same details. The book is 384 pages and would take the average reader over 6 hours to read. It is simply common sense that no 2-hour movie can cover the same material.I found the overall feeling of the movie to be very good with just the right amount of desperation to the storyline. Ideas are presented without the director feeling the need to pound them into our heads. The SciFi purist will be offended by the seemingly unavoidable desire of directors to have noise in space, but we seem to be stuck with that despite the success of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The music is, unfortunately, overdone and intrusive and keeps me from rating it higher.",Ender's Game
144,o_s_k_r,rubbish!!!,1,15 February 2014,"I feel I must help bring the rating of this movie down to an appropriate level. This is some serious rubbish. The narrative stinks big time and the premise is utterly ridiculous.The story goes something like this: Earth was attacked by a bunch of alien spaceships. Earth destroyed the alien fleet. Fifty years has passed. No sign of the aliens since that time, in fact they seem to be living peacefully in their own solar system. No attempts have been made to communicate with them. Nonetheless the humans consider themselves at war. They build an enormous space fleet and for some unexplained reason they need children to pilot the ships. The kids are trained in a luxurious space station which astonishingly seems to have only three adults on board. The kids train by playing elaborate strategy games (this part feels very much like the Harry Potter movies).Even though there's no evidence to suggest the aliens are about to attack, the humans decide they must immediately and desperately assault the alien planet. Somehow we now have the technology to go pretty much instantly to foreign solar systems. The earth fleet attacks the alien planet in a battle that is incredibly brief and a huge anti-climax. The humans destroy the entire planet using some unbelievable super weapon (seems like the humans are the bad guys in this film). When the protagonist realises what he has been a part of he walks outside of the command headquarters (which is situated on some vague planet whose location is never really made clear). Incredibly only a few metres away from the human base is an alien, who has been hanging out in a ruined ship for fifty years without being noticed. The alien gives the protagonist an egg with the potential to rebirth the alien race. Despite being essentially a manipulated pawn, the protagonist is rewarded spectacularly for his role in the so-called war. He is given his own spaceship to search the galaxy for a suitable planet to hatch the egg.Harrison Ford must have lost his mind to get mixed up in such a truly ridiculous storyline.The only win here is the special effects.",Ender's Game

Don't worry, you get to play video games after that. Its like you never left your mom's basement.In what absurd universe do they let children lead armies, on purpose? Great life lessons, like kick people when they are down.Am I the only guy that thinks the black chick is a better actor than Harrison Ford? I like young fiction. I like sci-fi. I hated this.The only re-shoot save I can see is to have all the other kids be black. Every single one of them. Something about fast twitch muscles. And he is so lame all the other kids take pity on him. So each kid shows him their one special trick or cheat. By learning all of the tricks he becomes better than the other kids and saves the day. Plus you get those Oscar yappers off your back.Hey, it beats having some white guy play a Maori.PS: I shipped this before the movie ended.

146,Wirxaw,Spectacular.,8,20 February 2014,"Really a jewel among modern Sci-Fi. Great visuals, just enough to look good, but not enough to look abhorrent. Good acting - impressive actors, solid performance. Maybe nothing ""hardcore"", but they are kids. Ender is a kid. And that is a very good start. Fair music, noticeable right when needed. Could be better, but not all movies are grand movies. And most importantly... something that practically all modern movies totally lack... SENSE! This movie has sense(whether thanks for the original book or not). It has morale, logic, a deep thought about it. And it's not something on the level of Disney drool opera of Avatar scale. Nothing like a big flip off with the purpose of guessing of Promotheos. It's not about victory, it's about the reason for victory. Really something amiss in modern competitive gaming.What could be better? Perhaps a bit more story escalation. Of course, the whole movie is about the genius rising, but the plot looks too much placeholder. Maybe something else, but can't quite figure any other real issue.What's important, is that the movie fits it's motto - balance. Tactical, quality approach. It may not be a grand blockbuster, but it's not another stupid Sci-Fi that you will watch for lulz and soon forget. It's a movie that both entertains, becomes memorable and teaches. I give it 8, it may deserve more, it may call for less. But it should stand out above average low-quality designs.",Ender's Game
147,baumhenrik,Good idea but poorly executed,4,15 January 2020,"I like the overall idea and can imagine how entertaining the books be but the movie did two major mistakes in my opinion. First is the pacing. The movie feels like rushing from scene to scene without letting the seen sink in. Second the character development is very poorly executed. This might be because the movie tries to fit a very detailed book (just assuming) into a 2 hours movie for everybody. Besides ender no character seems to go through any development and even the protagonist is most of the time not really comprehensible.
So I rate this movie a
7/10 for the idea
3/10 for the actual movie",Ender's Game
148,samtimoney-79758,Complete let down and a disappointing ending,1,13 May 2018,Not only is there a small amount you learn about the characters but the main character is played by one of the worst actors I've seen. The ending is unexpected but not even in a good way but in a disappointing way,Ender's Game
149,DarthPaul85,"Not bad, but should've been two movies.",7,4 November 2013,"This was a decent movie- the acting was great (especially for kid actors), the script was sound, and the ending hits the right notes. That said, it was also a flawed movie, and I'm somewhat disappointed this film will settle for being ""good"" when the book was so great. This review is from the perspective of someone who read the book- those who haven't read it might feel differently, but here's what I thought.PRO's: The casting, the sets, and costumes. First and foremost, the casting and acting in this film are its best assets. Ender (Asa) is perfect, exactly how I wanted him to be. Gaff (Harrison) is also terrific. This is the most fun I've had watching Harrison Ford in a long time. That said, there were some scenes, some lines that I thought should have been more emphasized. Bean, Valentine, Bonzo, and Bernard are the others who will leave an good impression...even if they change some things from the book.Next, the sets and costumes- again, nearly perfect. Loved the school uniforms and the corridors. The battle room and spaceships are also very well realized- and more or less make the story feel real. The special effects in general are good, but it's so hard to create original special effects these days, so not much really stood out to me (except the zero gravity scenes).CON's: Rushed story, some unimpressive choreography.First my minor gripe- the space choreography and battle room scenes left me unimpressed. The battle room scenes especially kind of let me down- they seems a touch over-simplified, and don't show Ender's genius as well as they do in the book. Another minor gripe- didn't care much for how the aliens looked. It was another run-of-the-mill bug-alien design- seen it before, didn't leave an impression.My major gripe is that the movie moves WAY too fast. Things happen so quickly, they often feel ""too easy"" or insignificant. The whole video game subplot is done in about two scenes. Those scenes in the book are really stretched out, and we see how they torture Ender and wear him down there. But here it's over almost as soon as it begins. Similarly, Ender's progress through the school happens so quickly that we never feel like he's being pushed *that* hard. If Ender isn't really suffering, we don't really care. You could argue that the key events of the story are still there, and that's true- but the book is more about Ender as a person than the war going on in space. And of all the secondary characters, only Gaff and Bonzo are given decent development in the movie- everyone else is clearly there to fill a gap in the story progression (a real shame, since in the book everyone interacted with Ender organically, and nobody felt like a contrived ""device.""). Even Valentine, for all Abigale's effort, resorts to being a fairly simple character- not like the conflicted, emotional yet brilliant person she was in the book. And lastly, Peter is hardly in the movie at all. I suppose if it's from Ender's point of view that makes sense, but we don't get any sense of Peter's twisted genius here- a true loss.So in conclusion, if the same production values could have focused on two movies instead of one, we would have a true work of art here- a film on the level of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Instead, we get a rushed version of a great story- which results in a pretty good movie.",Ender's Game
150,jcallows,just for kids,3,5 September 2014,"How the mighty have fallen. How did Harrison Ford end up here? It's hard to take a movie about saving the world seriously when it depends on kids, especially kids that are good at video games. Sounds like a story written by a kid, doesn't it?Well, this film looked like a movie made for kids, by kids. I'm sure many have imagined their video game skills would be put into practical use someday. Since the reality isn't the case, they made a movie with a different reality.The kid, or chosen one, looked a lot like Jeremy Renner. The film would've been a lot better had it focused on the kid as an adult and used Jeremy Renner to play him. Instantly I would've taken the film more seriously and even overlooked the cartoonish-CGI, video game appearance of the it.",Ender's Game
151,kuuk3,Harry Potter in Space,3,26 October 2013,"I have not read the book, nor had I seen the trailer before watching this movie. But it doesn't take long to realise that this franchise is trying yet again to break into the teen fiction market, with yet another scenario change just enough to make it appear different. But swapping the halls of Hogwarts for a space station, the quiddich game for laser tag, Dumbledore for Harrison Ford, Voldermort for the bugs from Starship Troopers and Hermione, Ron & Harry for three other nameless children is all feel like Harry Potter in Space. The film is watchable, but I have no plans to buy the Blu Ray. The big twist ending even a blind monkey could predict. The child's problem solving skills were nothing any kid playing GTA couldn't have figured out. They were never a real test of ability and sending in a kid playing a computer game instead of a seasoned General with actual combat experience seemed silly at the end. Maybe it made more sense in the book, who knows. But here, if all they wanted to accomplish was win, send in a stealth nuke and be done with it. The plot made no sense as to why proved tested military weapons of today couldn't defeat them, or why the technology of the future allowed telescopes that could see absolutely everything, everywhere or why AI couldn't do the job better. The good news is what took Harry Potter eight films to accomplish, they did it in one. The effects were okay and the acting credible. The bad parts - the future looked very much like today. Its military based cadet school for 85% of it and full of young kids so you have to like your army films. Yet children are visibly killed which means you wouldn't really want to show it to your kids. I guess they weren't too sure who to aim the film at in regards to a target audience. Its okay, but i was hoping for so much more and would definitely liked to have seen more of the enemy and there attack on Earth so as to give us audience a reason to hate them and understand the humans motivation for doing what they did. Instead we felt sorry for the aliens and left the cinema on a bit if a downer, which is never good.",Ender's Game
152,verminhater,Fails to realise the book,4,26 March 2014,"First up, I'm a big scifi fan. I've read the book and wasn't a great fan of it. The basic premise was OK but I didn't like the writing style. The film is fairly true to the book but of necessity rushes some very basic parts - principally that Ender is driven to win in every contest he participates in. This is absolutely central to the plot and is skipped over in the film to it's detriment.The characters appear to come from ""my big book of film characters"" and have been seen many times. This is not something that Harrison Ford normally does so comes as a surprise. By failing to capture Ender's determination and ability to win under great adversarial conditions during training the film leaves you wondering why they are trusting the defence of the planet to some pre-pubescent kid and falls down accordingly.The effects are very average being primarily cgi and very obviously so. I honestly expected this film to fall flat and wasn't shocked to find my expectations fulfilled. It's not a horrendous effort but is firmly on my list of films not to watch twice.",Ender's Game

It's your normal bleeding heart Hollywood theme, save the planet but make sure you also save your enemy. With this said, I really enjoyed it. I found it very entertaining, and the all around acting was very good. I wouldn't change a thing except, I would make sure that not one enemy that tried to destroy humanity stayed alive.

Gavin hood sucked after wolverine. the acting is so immature, nothing to be impressed. graphics - average, dialogues - below average, The story is somewhat okay that it wont get bored with the emotional melodrama and lag.

155,majic-5,A gorgeous adaptation of a classic of sci-fi,8,31 October 2013,"If this movie had attempted to portray the entirety of the 384-page book on which it was based, it would have been a six-hour film. With a running length of 1:54, the writers and directors were forced to create a gorgeous highlights reel and depend on the audience's familiarity with and love for the book. Those fans, me among them, have been waiting nearly 30 years for a movie that the author approved of, and we can fill in the gaps.The visual effects were awesome, and I use that word in the traditional sense. The scenes in the battle room of the Battle School and the Command School simulation rooms were as finely wrought as any FX I've seen and took my breath away. The sense of fear, tumult, and finally horror in the final battle scene is something visceral that no description can truly convey.What time there was for emotionality at the end was well played by Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. For a newcomer, Butterfield nailed the impact that responsibility for genocide would have on an 11-year-old. Ender's Game may not win any converts to the sci-fi genre or to Card's quintet of books about Ender's universe, but it will win the hearts of those who've read his works and waited for a movie to do justice to the first one in the series.",Ender's Game
156,supatube,Shocking,2,31 March 2014,"I think it is safe to say a film will never take off if the script is a pile of bull... but somehow this film got some air beneath its wings in order to be made, alas for all involved it should rather have not been. It's just weak and from the beginning asks you to completely abandon all logic, and yes its a Sci- Fi but its not the over convoluted story that is hard to fathom but the basic human emotions that are somehow not basic nor believable. The story is long, and boring.I personally feel if they started with the ending it somehow could have turned into a compelling story, unfortunately we are left watching a simulation that is not a simulation. and the irony, you will ask yourself through the movie "" When will we get to the real war?"" and when you discover the truth it has an even more deflating effect that the entire story.This film isn't even so bad to garner a viewing to see just how bad, it's a plain old waste of time.",Ender's Game
157,brian_m_hass,Excellent Adaptation of the Novel,10,30 October 2016,"This science-fiction film tells the story of the formative years of a boy named Ender Wiggin. When an alien species threatens to extinguish the human race, the brightest children are recruited for military training. Ender is trained to lead the battle against the alien threat.It is necessary to mention the fact that this is a very dark movie. Even though most of the characters in this film are children, people should not go into this film with the expectation that this movie is going to be light-hearted. There are disturbing aspects to Ender Wiggin's home life; and, the children at the military school are often psychologically manipulated as a part of their conditioning. The movie also includes depictions of violence.This movie was an excellent adaptation of Orson Scott Card's novel of the same name. When I first read the novel many years ago, I thought that the story would make a great movie. I had to wait two decades for that to eventually happen; but, this film was well worth the wait. The movie was well cast. Even before the characters names were mentioned, I could easily identify who they were on screen. Much of what was depicted in the film was exactly as I had imagined it after having read the novel.The movie depicts acts of desperation under very difficult circumstances. The military school sacrifices the innocence of children in an effort to turn those children into the best hope for the survival of the human race. Members of the audience cannot help but to feel empathy for the child characters in this film.The movie was based on the first book in series of science-fiction novels about the character, Ender Wiggin. Fans of Orson Scott Card's novels will enjoy this film. The movie is highly recommended.",Ender's Game
158,thomas-w15,"Good film, great entertainment!!!",6,23 January 2015,"Ender's Game 6/10- I am not a huge fan of Asa Butterfield or Gavin Hood's films, but this is the best film I have seen by both of them. Don't get me wrong I loved Hugo, but it had nothing to do with Asa Butterfield. Ender's Game though was Asa's best work by far. The movie somewhat grabs your attention at the beginning with interesting concepts, and the story gets much better throughout the film. The movie had very good action sequences that surprised me and everyone in the theater. The zero gravity battles in particular were the highlights of the movie for me and everyone that I have talked too. The movie does a good job of not just putting action in the movie for the sake of action. They follow a good concise plot with the action only adding on to it. The design was pretty good all around, even though it was set in the future, it all seemed believable. I have not read the books, but from all I have heard about them, the movie stays in line with the key plot points. The movie focuses on Ender's training process more than anything else. The movie does not have any clichés during the training either like a love relationship or a bully that continually torments him like most teenage-centered action films. Ender's ability to analyze situations and take the necessary course of action is brilliantly displayed. Asa Butterfield particular displays this type of the character flawlessly with everyone believing that he is a Steven Hawking type. The only part of Asa Butterfield's performance that is weak is when he has to show true powerful emotions, but thankfully the movie did not have much of that. Harrison Ford's character was one that I have never seen him play before, but he made it look like he has been doing that type of aggressive, emotionless character his whole life. The other performances all did a decent job because the casting department did a chose each of them masterfully. There are some flaws that you will notice that particularly do not fit into the plot well and the director just put those in the movie hoping no one will notice because they were still key to the plot, but sadly there was no build up. I do not want to go into detail because I do not want to spoil it, but they seem like rookie mistakes. Other than those, Gavin hood did a solid directing job that is a huge step up from X-men: Origins Wolverine. The movie sadly does not contain much humor and it deserves the movie to have barely any comedy during the film. The movie finishes fairly well, but it seemed a little rushed like the endings of the transformers movies. If the movie gave the ending more time, I think it would have improved the film much more and given the audience a more solid feeling at the end of the movie. Still, the ending is better than most sci-fi movies. All in all, the movie delivers decent enough action with good performances from Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford. The film is entertaining enough that makes the viewing experience enjoyable. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Ender's Game
159,Gin-ster,Good but misses slightly,7,23 February 2014,"First, a caveat - people who don't care for science fiction should not bother with this film. It does not have ""cross-genre"" appeal.With that out of the way - I am a fan of the book, so it is difficult for me to assess how people who haven't read it will respond to it. I asked my husband, who'd not read the book, what he thought and generally he liked it but thought it was a bit draggy in spots relating to Ender's military training. He did add, however, that that was necessary to show how SPOILER Ender went from a disrespected ""wimpy kid"" to a commanding presence. Apart from that he liked it a lot.As to my own assessment ... I did like it and am giving it a thumbs up; it was well cast, the special effects were terrific, and the SPOILER devastating point made at the end impacts as it should. But I do have a criticism relating to content that was omitted from the book. SPOILER Readers of the book will know that Ender kept seeing strange images in his video games (or whatever the electronic devices were called) and could not figure out what they really were - unsuccessful attempts by the aliens to communicate - until too late to SPOILER stop the unjustified annihilation of an entire species. This made it all the more tragic when he realized they were wiped out without justification.The movie includes a couple of instances of this attempt at communication but did not include it as a recurring theme. So at the end after the devastation and Ender realizes that that is what the strange video game events were really about, it seems a bit tacked on. My guess is the film makers figured more instances of physical fighting would appeal to audiences more than more instances of strange video-game encounters. This is counter to the book and is unnecessary since, after all, SPOILER, physical fighting was ""beside the point"" in winning the war against the aliens; rather, computer-game skill was they key. This is the reason I am not giving it a higher score, but would nevertheless, recommend it.",Ender's Game
160,n-m-bertin,A lot of good potential wasted,6,2 February 2014,"Ender's Game is one of those movies that have been utterly destroyed during editing. If you've read the book you know what I'm talking about. In the book, Peter is much more developed and both Ender's siblings are as smart as him, just less or more empathic than him. In the movie, it's skipped to gain time. Peter is shown as a brainless bully, which is totally wrong.In the same way, the Battle School isn't developed enough. One game and that's it ? He moves to real battles ? In the book he stays in school until he finishes first of all the teams, with a great development of skill, both from him and his lieutenants... In the movie you see none of that, and of course you wonder how those newbies make it as Ender's seconds in command, it just doesn't seem right...The last one is the Mind Game obviously. Same thing, in the book it's way more developed. Ender had to struggle before deciding to kill the giant, he had to struggle to find the best way to deal with the serpent. In the same struggle of Ender's feelings, the first boy he kicks is actually dead in the book, they don't even mention it here, it added much more drama to the mix.That's a shame because otherwise the casting is good, directing is good, special effects are good... I don't know if it's the producers' fault, who wanted a movie under 2 hours for maximum profit (it happens so often...) or if the director's vision was wrong, but all those problems were so easy to fix... Ender's Game isn't supposed to be an action movie. It's supposed to be a Sci-Fi drama, about the psychological state of mind of a growing boy. Instead they made it too much into an action movie, and that's the wrong direction. Same thing happened with Blade Runner by the way, the producers were afraid that the audience wouldn't understand everything, wanting a happy end etc... Well in the same way, maybe we'll have a good Director's Cut for Ender's Game, and it'll gain popularity as the years go by...Oh and the last piece : why the hell did they remove the near-speed of light space travel ? Who can believe that a near destroyed Earth can have an orbital space training station for kids and a giant invasion fleet with the little Doctor only 50 years after fighting with obsolete fighter jets ? In the book it's hundreds of years apart, there are no fighter jets, and Mazer Rackham was kept in fast space travel so he wouldn't age and be ready to train his successor. Without that they basically shot themselves in the foot for all the potential sequels to the movie, as relative time and relative aging is a huge component of the story. It's weird, it's like some aspect are well preserved or adapted from paper to film by a competent team, and amongst all this somebody is trying really hard to jeopardize everything...",Ender's Game
161,John K.-2,The most thought-provoking film I've seen for a long time.,9,25 October 2013,"I really liked the film, because it's different. At first you think it's going to be another wimpy-kid-coming-of-age story, though set in space. But it isn't. Then you think it's a smart-kid-can't-unlock-the-key-secret-until-he-understands-himself, but it isn't that. Maybe it'll be another Hunger Games, teenager-uses-skills-to-survive-and-then-to-beat-the-system? No, not that either.In the end, it's a film about the rights and wrongs of war, and of training for war. And I do mean rights and wrongs, plural: this is one of the best films for a long time for making you think about more than one side of a complex issue. It also takes a hefty (though mitigated) swipe at video-game culture; but if you think that's a modern politically correct message, remember that the book was written in 1985. Its message is best summed up in one (sligh mis-)quote from the film: ""It's not what you do; it's why you do it."" It's one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen for a long time. If you come out of the film wanting to know more about the issues that the book raises, I recommend the excellent (if slightly academic) book ""On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society"" by Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Grossman. It doesn't tackle exactly the same issues that the film raises (which is good, because that means the book doesn't act as a spoiler for the film!) but it does address the wider issues.",Ender's Game

It wasn't great, but good. Harrison Ford still kicks, I couldn't help but think about Commander Han Solo during the screening, but that's beside the point. Ben Kinsley and Viola Davis are good too and it's great to see that Asa Butterfield is evolving as an actor, I remember him in Hugo and, wow, the boy did grow fast!I don't really know what's the ruckus about the harsh criticism to this movie, I personally think that Gavin Hood, despite being director for hire, made up pretty well here after his disastrous Wolverine movie. The story is good, thanks for writer Orson Scott Card who wrote the original book series, I don't really know if it's in the book, but during the Ender and Bonzo fight in the bathroom I couldn't help but think on Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket for some reason. The final twist is kinda predictable, but it brings good development and more depth to Asa's character. The only major mistake here you ask? Well, director Gavin Hood just left a hint for a possible sequel in the end of the movie.Pffffffff... where do I start?...It's a flaw because you never know if your movie will earn a sequel, so you have to make the thing stand on it's own. Now they have a film that, because of a weak box office may not continue its story and the story of the movie may never get to a resolution. That's lame. People involved in movie productions should've learned this lesson long ago, but no, they keep making the same mistakes, over and over again. They never consider the possibility of major failure. Expect the best, prepare for the worst, that's a lesson to learn! And if you refer to franchises like Lord of the Rings, well, that's different! Gavin Hood is a mediocre director at best. You don't take that kind of risk with mediocre talents, you have to play safe.Hell, even Christopher freakin' Nolan, who is one of the top directors today was wise enough to make every single chapter of his Batman trilogy stand on it's own. He didn't do that unpurposedly, he considered the possibility of something going really wrong during the first film because he wasn't famous enough. I guess that settles for a lot of things.Overall, not a bad movie, but not a great one either, it has interesting ideas (probably not as interesting as the books) but let's see what will they accomplish from this point on.",Ender's Game
163,theprogs,good acting,7,29 December 2020,"I gave this movie 7 out of 10 only for the boy's amazing acting, I really liked his character and how he is speaking and acting, but I think the dialogue is for older boy, the story is also not logical.",Ender's Game
164,dreamdemon-1,Misses the best parts,6,2 November 2013,"I find it very hard to review this movie after seeing. First of all, I'm not a person to say a movie is bad because it takes shortcuts through the book. The only condition I ask of a book-based movie is to keep its consistence in the universe it describes. That's it.First things first: the visuals are stunning. All the digital work that went in the movie paid off by creating a beautiful rendition of space, of lack of gravity, of aliens and their worlds as well as of Earth. The soundtrack complements the visuals nicely. It's not perfect, some tracks (especially those before battles) feel cheap and pushy towards forcing a certain state of mind that doesn't necessarily go together with the ways battles are depicted.Then, we have the cast. The young actors (more or less known) do their job nicely, while Harrison Ford is the perfect colonel Graff. My only (mild) objections are Kingsley as Rackham and Pinchak as Peter. Pinchak only gets a minute to convey Peter to the audience and what we see is not particularly convincing. Kingsley starts of well but falls short towards the end and never conveys the character: a man who was kept mostly isolated in space, kept alive by relativity, something that took a toll on sanity.With the good things out of the way, let's see what's not so right. In this category, what we have is the story. ALthough I would have never expected that the script would include everything in the book, the way the story was rushed left me with a bitter feeling. Peter merely hints at being a bully, so far from the psycho prone to violence that he is said to be. Ender's ascension is given absolutely no justification. When did he turn from a shy kid into a commander? Exactly how does he become a leader? We see him as a rookie getting introduced to the two games (the battles and the Mind Game), then he learns to shoot and based on one initiative in a solitary battle he gets his command in which he wins one battle. How come even Bernard is respecting Ender? Why is Petra, a more experienced fighter, following him? Speaking of Petra, I absolutely dread the way she is somehow pushed as romantic interest while more important characters such as Dink and Alai are barely there.Due to rushing, Ender's reaction at the end, when he lashes at Graff for being tricked into performing xenocide feel forced and cheap. Yes, we are told that when he understands an enemy well enough to completely defeat it he starts to love them but he's never seen actually spending time studying the Formics, learning about them.In the book, a major point is that while most students follow Graff's advice and learn from Mazer Rackham's strategy (via battle movies), Ender spends his time studying the strategy of the Formics. This is mentioned specifically as the point where he opens his mind and becomes receptive enough to allow the Queen to communicate via the Mind Game. Thus he understands their civilization and finds them as beautiful creatures which he must eventually protect from extinction.Also, in school, while Petra does teach him to shoot, he learns strategy from Dink and he expands that strategy with the rookies, gaining their respect.A particularly annoying scene takes place when Ender returns to Earth and meets Valentine. He mentions that he wins battles in school by understanding his enemy, although he is never shown studying strategy, mentioning something about how his opponents think or winning more than a single battle.But in the movie these essential points are lost. Other questions that are never answered: What is the Strategos? What/who is the Hegemon? What the hell is an Asible? Overall, the movie does follow the story but misses the substance almost entirely. As such, it is definitely entertaining and worth watching but as there is nothing of substance to the story, I don't see myself watching it more than once.",Ender's Game
165,aew-10,Boring film,4,29 November 2014,"I was really looking forward to seeing this; I was anticipating a good science fiction film, and no, I have not read any of the books in the Ender series. What a boring film – the usual Hollywood cliché-driven fare. Examples of stock scenes:Ender and bullies in school Ender sent home, bully of an elder brother Ender sent to fight school, bully of a platoon leader Fight in showers with said leader Fat kid.I could not sympathize with any of the characters including Ender who is an irritating, weedy little brat.",Ender's Game

Yes it's not as good as the book but what films are?The film could have been longer and missed out lots of details about enders relationship with his brother and how bad that really is. I would have liked to see a bit more of ender background before he goes off, more of his family life and more about his brother and sister and his emotional relationships with them. Peter does play a big part in the ender books.I feel the film has been adapted well though, it was just a bit too short, and lacked a lot of the depth that the book has. It still has some great battle scenes and I enjoyed the battle raining scenes.Got to say as well the casting of this movie was great, the guy who plays ender is spot on and exactly how i envisaged him.YES it's not as good as the book but it doesn't take away the fact this is a good sci-fi movie and I hope they re-make the whole series.",Ender's Game
167,koen_smit,Too fast in pace but nonetheless entertaining.,7,28 January 2014,"Ender Wiggin is a boy who – at the start of the movie – is already in a program to prepare for a training to fight against an alien race that almost invaded earth once before. Apparently we are now living in a future world where it is normal to make soldiers out of children. The colonel (Harrison Ford) is convinced Ender might be 'the one'. The pace of the movie is fast, maybe too fast. Before we know it Ender is actually at the school somewhere in space, and right after his first training already he is promoted and there is talk of him being a leader almost immediately. Maybe it is just a bad adaptation of the book, I don't know, I didn't read it, but you have the feeling the movie takes place in a few weeks, while there are actually long space travels (years of cryosleep) involved. The kids do not age at all, although Asa Butterfield (Ender) tries his best to do the coming off age development just. This said, I have to say it did not bother me too much and I really enjoyed the movie after some eyebrow lifting (especially halfway through the movie). The overall production design is really good. The zero gravity combat scenes, the mind game and the 'exams' are done pretty mind-blowing and are truly exciting to watch. Asa Butterfield is a promising actor, he is believable in his acting choices and switches emotions at the turn of a dime. I am looking forward to seeing him act in other movies. Harrison Ford gives Colonel Graff the body and motivation he needs. One of the smaller roles that really stood out was Viola Davis as Major Gwen Anderson. She was a great contra weight to the typical male Colonel Graff as she brought the depth and emotions of a woman who might be a mother herself and is questioning the military she works for, using children as soldiers. I would have liked to see a little bit more of her. Overall: the movie was too fast in pace but nonetheless entertaining.",Ender's Game
168,martijn-56,Enjoyable,7,17 November 2013,"Good acting, good special effects (albeit stolen from Independence Day and Starship Troopers) and in all, a science fiction movie I have not seen before. There are interesting themes, on the ethics of preparing kids for battle, and on whether a beautiful victory in war exists at all. What I did not like was the theme we got straight away: once you know or understand your enemy, you love him. That came back in the movie many times, when Ender had to fight his way to the top. But he was fighting humans, not bugs. And even then, yeah right, to take a cliché example, I don't think people in concentration camps would concur on loving the Nazis by understanding they did all that horrible stuff because they loved Goethe and Beethoven and just wanted to force their German culture on the world (as Thomas Mann 'explained' the reason for World War 2). There are always plenty of reasons and explanations to understand some wrong philosophy some population uses as a justification for taking over the world, but it never makes it right. Same for these bugs, they were overpopulated on their own planet, like us, and invaded our earth like we mistreat our own planet, but because they are essentially like us, we would understand and love each other? That is the same crap as Matrix 2, saying the synthesis between man and machine was not so bad after all. The reality is, if something like this would happen, you could never be sure if the bugs would not try again after a century or so (the Germans did after World War 1, to finish my cliché). Nevertheless, in the end Ender felt sorry for these poor bugs and, for some reason, was allowed by his superiors (o no, it was conveniently added in the last seconds he became admiral and could do whatever he wanted) to find a new home for the last alive queen to breed. So at least we can expect a sequel, when that queen decides to take over our planet once again after some years. And, by the way, how did those ants build spaceships?",Ender's Game
169,Fourstrawberries,Dreadful - easily as bad as Battleship,1,14 April 2014,"I'm sorry, but I am fed up with awful sci-fi movies from Hollywood. Formics? do me a favour. Un-original name derived from Formic ants. In the future we are not going to use children to fight. If the fate of humanity rests with one person shouting ""fire"" at the appropriate time, followed by ""I need more time"" ""shields are down"" or whatever, the we are doomed. Today, computers can defeat chess grand masters, jeopardy champions. Financial centres are run by machines trading faster and more accurately than humans. By the time we reach the technology of Enders Game humans going into battle will be a thing of the past. The actors best efforts to add some drama to a terrible script led to a randomly grimacing Harrison Ford and some terrible performances from the other actors. Space battles were done well, but done to death by Star Trek. It's time for Hollywood to stop aping Star Trek and Star Wars and come up with something original. It's not as if there is a shortage of good books to start with. How about ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Ringworld"", ""Have Spacesuit, will Travel"" and thousands more. I hated this movie from start to finish. Dreary, boring, utterly predictable.",Ender's Game
170,Randy_Dreammaker,"I expect a sequel or two, and that's potentially a good thing.",8,21 November 2013,"Ender's Game is right up there at the top for my 2013 movie picks.Casting was excellent, concept original and wonderful acting.It was nice seeing Harrison Ford co-starring in this film, as always Ford nailed his role.I found myself most intrigued by the main Character. a story that reminded me of King David in the Bible, a small runt, the last born who is chosen above his siblings to not only restore the honor of his family and nation, but world. A deep, complex and intricate character who in essence is an insecure little boy that when provoked draws upon an internal strength and instinctive desire not only to survive, but to dominate to the point that one battle is the only battle ever.I felt very much as though I were watching the birth of a new space sci-fi movie series similar to the new Star-Trek being born. I could easily see a sequel or two ahead for Ender's Game.The ending of this movie is astonishingly brilliant and was unanticipated, earning it an eight star rating in my assessment.Emder's Game is simply a fun, exciting and intense movie to watch.",Ender's Game
171,simonpcpearson,I enjoyed it,8,30 October 2013,"I'll begin by saying that I haven't read the book and had absolutely no idea what to expect. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by what is an exciting science fiction adventure.Harrison Ford is the reason I watched this, and he is first rate. It might be argued that Ford is playing to the gruff stereotype he has essayed in any number of recent films, but I like this performance.The younger members of the cast were unfamiliar to me, but they acquit themselves well. I was drawn into the story and the emoitional journey within.The visuals are stunning. Even the most cynical or jaded critic cannot deny the movie is beautiful to watch. Worth the cost of a movie ticket.",Ender's Game
172,pyx,"Lots of glitz, completely devoid of substance",5,26 April 2014,"The basic premise of the movie is an interesting one, and like Gravity, there's lots of spectacular camera work and effects, but once you get beyond that, you realise how little substance there is to the movie.Rather than skilfully building a movie by developing the plot and taking the characters on a journey, each character comes fully completed in his/her final form from the first second you see them on the screen. From start to finish, the movie is nothing but a series of feel-good snapshots, rather than a well developed story.The movie is nothing more than one stereotype after another, bound together by the most ridiculous logic from start to finish.The frustrating thing is, it had so much potential and the characters were mostly tremendously likable - not that they had much chance to be anything but.The movie feels like nothing but a series of set pieces, but lacks any meat. But for all that, thanks to spectacular use of technology, Ender's Game does manage to be extremely watchable, even if it leaves you feeling utterly cheated at the end.To be honest, it's a movie that had me asking WTF from start to finish, so to have a ridiculous, unrealistic ending in which the main character acts in a way (and allowed to act that way by his superiors) that defeats the entire purpose of the rest of the movie, is no less lazy than the rest of the film.An outstanding cast could have been given so much more to chew on.I'd like to read the book to see if Card did better, but since I discovered he's a bigot, I don't want to let him have any of my money.",Ender's Game
173,zzyzx000-124-271558,I'm glad I never read the books,9,21 January 2014,"Because after reading the bad reviews here, there seems to be a common complaint that it didn't follow the book closely enough. I've been disappointed by several movies lately so I'll review one I liked.Great CGI for starters. Next, it's great to see some clean shaved youths with hair on their heads and not on their faces. I loved Hugo last year and didn't make the connection that they both starred Asa Butterfield. I did make the connection between Asa and Pee Wee Herman. I'll admit I like Pee Wee, and even though Ender is nothing like him, they sure look alike.I despise Military movies where someone is always shouting stupid orders and abusing those under them. In Ender's game, you get that early on but even after being abused, when Ender get's to be in charge of others, he treats them with respect and caring. Refreshing. The twist near the end where the last war game was for real was clever. Harrison Ford was a perpetual frowner and as the movie progressed I accepted how that made him interesting. He was a troubled leader, short on time, and wanting to save mankind. Also interesting was labeling Ender as special from the beginning. It made it difficult for him to function with others until he wins their respect and friendship.Compare Ender's Game to ""12 Years a Slave"" which the Academy will probably give some awards to because it's an ""important"" movie. I don't need to see black people being whipped and mistreated 150 years ago. We all learned about that long ago and wish it never happened.

Since few movies live up to the book they relied upon, this was good for me and the wife.It is entertaining. It does not require you to overheat any brain cells. I suggest you relieve yourself before you go in and don't take the large drink in with you.The premise is well known. But you will pick up bits and pieces from other movies such as The Matrix, Happy Potter and the Whatever, The Last Star Fighter, Star Wars, Star Trek (the original TV series and The Next Generation), Independence Day, Full Metal Jacket, Stand By Me.....you get the point. Like all movies, there isn't anything new in it. But at least it isn't a complete rip off like any Quentin Tarrintino movies. It is packaged differently.I suggest that you could make a great game of picking out elements of earlier films.The wife did not like the end. I liked it because it is not Independence Day in regards to the ending. Like life, there are no good, tidy endings and all the characters are flawed (except the DI played almost cartoonishly).I am glad I saw it.

Without provocation big lard brained and shrimpy jerks alike must harass Ender. No reason provided. Second. Bad child acting. Always a danger when the subject is pre-teen heroes. I understand it is part of the beast, just bothers me.Third point is connected to the second. So I am supposed to believe a bunch of greasy pre-pubescent boys playing video simulations is Earth's only choice for victory? There aren't any qualified, war tested adults (20-30)? Odd. Good help is hard to find I guess...Fourth point. The kiddies spend hours playing glorified laser tag when ultimately they are being counted on to dispatch fleets of starships and direct them in battle remotely. It's like training for a marathon by taking karate.Final point. I like the nuggets of wisdom and philosophy on war but at times it felt like I was at a Chinese restaurant opening up fortune cookies.

176,punishable-by-death,Better than all the other sci-fi rubbish of 2013,8,2 April 2014,"First off, I am not a fan of CGI. There is a very short list of movies that I thoroughly enjoyed that had a lot of CGI.This film, however, is easily the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen with a lot of CGI. And I mean a lot.I thought this movie was as visually great as Gravity, if not better, as the cinematography added a lot to the CGI, especially the 2001-like circular shots. The CGI also works because this is a fantasy world. It makes more sense in this situation, whereas in GRAVITY it was supposed to look real.I still cannot get over how brilliant that combination of cinematography and CGI turned out. I have not seen it before or since, including GRAVITY. It was a visual feast.Of course, there is more to this movie than the great CGI. The battle-games, while they seemed random and irrelevant, at first, were again brilliantly captured by moving shots as the kids floated around.The acting and dialogue was solid, from Harrison Ford and Viola Davis to the young Asa. What was especially great was the confrontations between this triangle of characters, and the lack of repetition within these confrontations.Each time they felt tense, because it was tense in the movie. Every time, an argument or confrontation had a point. Add this to the grit that Asa somehow put into his performance despite his baby-face like features. This came to the fore when he is confronted by fellow cadets who don't take a liking to him. It was a strong combination of solid acting, from all the cast.Another big plus was the lack of a meaningless, distracting 'love-interest'. Perhaps that is because it is based on a novel, but it certainly does the movie a favour.The ending was also meaningful, it was thought-provoking while not being a silly 'Sixth Sense' twist, and its emotional strength stands this movie above most others, especially regarding sci-fi.This was a very solid film, better than all the other sci-fi rubbish that hit the screens in 2013, by a stupendous margin.Fantastic!",Ender's Game
177,sean-curtin-517-748378,Here's hoping there's a sequel,10,19 November 2014,"The easiest review I've ever written.Simply brilliant.This movie has it all, great story, great characters, great special effects and terrific simulations of zero gravity.There are some individuals griping about how it doesn't do justice to the book, but I strongly disagree with that. What they were hoping for was an entire visual representation of the book or something even more demanding and honestly, Enders Game is not a book you could ever do in 2 hours. The creators of the movie have done an amazing job in having that merge of story cutting versus having a complete movie. Sure it would be terrific if the entire book could be adapted but anyone who's read Enders Game must be realistic. Could you pull it off in 2 hours? I don't think so. The only way you could even hope of achieving that is with a trilogy of movies that went for 3 hours plus(like Lord Of The Rings for example, even 'The Hobbit' required a trilogy to do the entire story in detail and that's not even half the size of Enders Game.(Let alone the scope, subject matter and thought provoking nature of the story).Instead of winging about what you don't have, just take a look at what you do have. That's a visual of what Ender looks like, the other race in striking detail and clarity, incredible starship, space station visuals. A picture of the alien world.I think Leonard Nimoy summed up a lot of the negative reviewers out there with a comment he had on some comments to another famous production: ""people who probably haven't even directed traffic are blathering about how it should have been and what it doesn't have etc etc"". That sums up those individuals. For goodness sake at least watch 'The Making Of' featurette(it's on the Bluray edition I just purchased to support the film, don't know about the DVD editions). That will give you a bit more appreciation for the pain the creators had in having to condense Enders Game into this film. In short they have done there best with the time they had.Finally Enders Game was not a commercial flop, it made it's budget plus 15 Million in profits just from ticket sales based on world wide ticket sales.Personally it should be supported for 3 main reasons 1. It's terrific and I was glad to have a visual movie to enhance the novel. 2. It seriously is a great adaptation and movie production companies are going to be shy of doing other great Science Fiction novels if fans are too critical and judgmental(thankfully Guardians Of The Galaxy did really well but seriously, I would declare Enders Game the better film). 3. I'd love to see a sequel and there has been talk of the next movie to continue Enders Story where Orson Scott Card is actually going to write new material to bridge the gap between the novels and I think most fans of the books would enjoy this because A) They no longer have anything to bitch about as it would all be new material and B) Add to the great story in a way the actual author would like to see happen.Don't listen to the nonsense, watch the movie and enjoy and most of all, buy the Bluray/DVD etc and support this stunning movie so that a sequel will be possible(at the end of the day, it's money that talks).Enders Game is EXCELLENT period, I simply can't fault it and despite what other reviewers may say, you can understand everything Ender is doing as it's implied and told through the action and the eventual unfolding of the movie. Watch it and enjoy this superb movie that doesn't deserve the ridiculous cynisism and nasty criticism that it's received so far.Way to go and 2 thumbs up to all the people involved in this incredible production.",Ender's Game

No matter how convincing the actors are(and Ender's actor is excellent), it still doesn't make for the huge amounts of plot and dialogue that are obviously and brutally shortened here.. they are crammed into very short scenes. And that just doesn't give you enough time to really get invested in the characters and plot and the result? when the final climax arrives you feel like it's there too soon! Now that's the weirdest feeling I ever got from a movie. Instead of feeling amazed I felt confused. The people who made this film could take a lesson from LOTR on how to truly explore a universe. You can't rush with this kind of deep, epic material. It's offensive to the storyline, the actors, and to us serious movie goers who want to be taken seriously and aren't in for a cartoon.

181,neacorp,Terrible,1,30 December 2013,"The reviewers were right – it's a movie without the original sole. I never even heard of the book until this film started coming out, but even I can see what a mess this is. In part, the original story might not have been great, but this cut makes it a disjointed mess.Most of the movie is just a terrible warschool cadet story, where obvious issues and problems happen. The fact that all the fights between the children are encouraged by the adults is just horrible to watch. Harrison Fords character even compares the kids to horses. And it goes for most of the movie.What I never got from the movie is a good enough explanation on what these kids can do so much better than the old experienced veterans. What was so necessary for this program of child soldiers to exist? Everything I saw in the movie could have been done better by the pro veterans. The plot is like watching very old people trying to use Windows Vista or 8 computers, and then bugging their kids to do it for them.The concealment of the tattooed hero, who stopped the fist invasion, is stupid. Why classify it? It just makes learning enemy weaknesses harder. Do the bugs plan to spy on the humans for their unfixable logistics weakness?The final big plot twist, that the exam simulation was an actual final war battle Ugh. So the plan was to send in a fleet of manned battleships and drone squadrons, which are all remotely controlled by a small group of kids, who didn't even have a plan or any intelligence data for the final fight. And it ended with them loosing all the ships and ramming the planet at full speed with the BFG. What was the point of the battleship manned crew again? There were thousands on board, last I remember. What did those people sign up for? A suicide ramming of the planet.It was like watching the second Gulf War commanded by the Korean StarCraft world champion. A better plan would have been to draw out the enemy, thin their finite forces and go in for the kill. There was no timer.So in the end it's a movie about stupid ""us or them"" propaganda, child soldiers, genocide and bullying, all crammed in to the point of disgusting.The book came out in 1985. StarCraft came out in 1998. Child prodigy strategists are no longer a novelty. And nobody wants to see kids recklessly command adults to their death as a game. This movie missed its big chance by a decade.",Ender's Game
182,RodMartinJr,A mind-blowing ride with depth,10,17 April 2014,"As a fan of the book, I knew some cherished details would have to be left out. A four-hour movie would've been too long.The team that put the movie together captured the heart of the story and stayed true to it. The visuals were stunning. The acting superb. And the pacing was riveting.This was everything I could've hoped for in a movie. It revealed the inner character of Ender. It showed his vulnerabilities and told us what he cared about. As with any story that means something to us, the protagonist learned and grew. He became more than he was at the start and his evolution was believable--well-grounded in the events that touched him.We owe a lot of this to the original author, but the screen writer could've botched it. Happily, he didn't.Leaving out details that were in the book seems to have worked in the movie's favor, because it helped us to feel the uncomfortable changes in Ender's life--fast, unpredictable and jarring. With finesse, ""Ender's Game"" could deliver these feelings without jarring us out of the story, in a fashion similar to that of ""Das Boot"" showing us the sailors' boredom without the film itself becoming boring, or like the sentimental nature of ""Casablanca"" conveyed with care without becoming sappy.I'm no fan of shallow entertainment and the fast-food, instant gratification junk that I'm seeing more and more of in so many film releases. But I'm no cynic, either. I don't have to have bigger, better, faster, louder. This film stands on its own. It provides a complete universe and a satisfying story arc.This is the kind of film I don't mind watching again and again. I don't often give a film the highest rating.

A friend did and watched movie with me, and said he was impressed by how similar it was to the book, albeit missing a lot of details which is fully understandable given the time constraints.I was interested the whole time. So the pacing is good. Dialog is pretty good. CGI graphics very well done. Acting better than normal in sci-fi movies, I can't fault it. Actor who played Ender was very good.I recommend this to anyone especially sci-fi fans.I could think of two complaints. One, the movie could explain some details better because I was left with questions I was told the book answered. Questions I thought were importantThe other complaint is, some of the plot seemed similar enough to Star Ship Troopers which led to a feeling of been there done that. It's not a fault of the movie, but made me wonder which came first? Card or Heinlein with some of the movie's ideas. Having elite humans, so to speak, fighting a war reminded me of the Forever War, but only a bit.",Ender's Game
184,bm2759,Good and entertaining,7,28 October 2013,"Knowing nothing about this book I was lead to believe this film was going to be action orientated. It is not but that's not a bad thing because it's a character and story focused film. It doesn't go for too long, you aren't bored, and want to see how it ends. I was satisfied.The visuals of this film are great. I particularly enjoyed the zero G room used for the launchies' training exercises. In the future I suggest this be made available for recreation as it looks like a lot of fun. Also worth praising is how battles are shown from the holographic screens which zoom, tilt and pan to give ender the best view possible. It's almost like a video game except I asked 'how can he view battles like this'. Because surely in the heat of battle any drone cameras would be destroyed. But this is a minor grievance of how realistic viewing battles this way would be.All the cast suited their roles except for Ben Kingsley. The could've chosen Temuera Morrison who is a Maori and looks like a soldier for example. But he was in the new star wars trilogy which is why I think he was overlooked. Furthermore his character claims to be ender's enemy during training however he is actually another mentor of Ender's. A mismatch in dialogue and execution I think.At the end I had questions and got locked into discussion all the way home. I thought about events and occurrences not making sense or weren't explained properly. I thought about what I would do in Ender's situation. I thought about what was real and what wasn't. I lastly thought about the last scene and saying 'that isn't believable'. I thought and talking about a lot, but my friends and I agreed; this is a good but not great film yet entertaining nonetheless.I went we read the book and the second book Speaker for the Dead. If Ender's Game was not filmable then Speaker of the Dead is as likely as pigs flying. I also read the author does not want it made into a film.",Ender's Game
185,myvallli,GOOD MOVIE FROM A BOOK,7,1 March 2018,"Also, Ender's Game, Gavin Hood directed it and made the script from the book. I can say many good things about the film, so and I can say negative, which after all didn't destroyed everything.
GOOD:
The movie doesn't want to follow strictly the book. This gives extra thrill and feeling.
Also, all the cast is doing great in their roles, although some places the direction could've been different for more emotion.
The sounds, the Visual Effects and the perspective were on really good level.
Also, they were and small good details, which are awesome.
NEGATIVE: 
Some of the choices made for the movie, I think, were bad, and took some parts of the emotion and feeling.
I am giving examples:
1) Bean meeting Ender in the spaceship
2) There had to be more confindent clarification of the plans of the International Fleet and Graff. This would give us a little bit more emotional seeing of the situation.
3) The dialogs in the hall, where Ender comands (without knowing) the fleet. They were little bit... not well.Nevertheless the movie was good, with thrill, which of course had to be there!",Ender's Game

The iflm is shoving how a person can gain trust fom others by his doing.

That was really bad and the worst thing is the kid doesn't even know until it was over and everything is destroyed and the whole planet was vanished.",Ender's Game
188,motezart,So disappointed with this interpretation,6,7 November 2013,"For any film fanatic that also happens to be an Orson Scott Card fan, Ender's Game was the type of film that warranted the hanging of a calendar on the wall and blacking out the days until the film's November 1st release date. I was this excited for months about the film, and yes, I saw it opening night. But after having seen it, I say with dismay that although the admission may not have been a total waste of money, it may have been better spent on a few drinks at a bar, or on a Shake Shack dinner (for the non- drinkers). I was just so unexpectedly un-enthralled that I'm still in shock.The film opens with Ender Wiggin as his parent's third child in a world where thirds are not highly regarded, yet a prestigious military school's administrators monitor Ender's life via hidden cameras, and through this observation witness the potential genius within Ender. But whatever they notice, it is not shown to the audience.Nonetheless Ender leaves his family behind to study at this elite training school where plans are secretly being made; Ender will train to become the next great commander of the Earth fleet. While at battle school Ender meets the legendary Mazer Rackham, a famous Maori warrior whom singlehandedly defeated the aliens previously, when they attacked Earth. Rackham's job now is to mentor Ender, to prepare him for the greatest battle of his life.Director Hood's rendition of Ender's Game does just adequate justice to the original plot of the book. I pined for a grittier, R-rated Prometheus or District 9-ish kind of rendition, and instead I got something related more to Will Smith's Independence Day.There were no gaps left in the time line of the film, gaps necessary to explain how Ender could possibly have become a fleet commander at all. As Director Hood portrays it, the audience sees Ender go from cadet to commander overnight, almost literally. No human past, present, or future, (not even Ender) could pull that off.Blasé scenes are followed by descriptions of grandeur that made me wonder if I had just watched the same scene as the military commanders. In front of a group of new recruits Ender is praised by Officer Graff (Harrison Ford) for his intelligence, a set-up for later peer torment? But the intelligence Ender shows here is hardly praiseworthy. It's just a smart-alecky remark about zero gravity. Later, when Ender is confronted by a gang of boys, whom he ends up defeating, the fight is not convincing, yet again, administrators swoon. This type of device, apathetic scene followed by glorious praise occurs over and over throughout the film. Descriptions of awe are purveyed when no actual awe has taken place.Asa Butterfield as Ender is largely responsible for the film's failure. He is not a convincing Ender, and so all his examples of greatness seem staged. Every time Ender does something ""miraculous"" and is praised for it, it's reminiscent of the medieval age; a king's steward dolloping out praise at every instance to keep his majesty satisfied. Harrison Ford is also pretty terrible. Come to think of it, pretty much all the acting, except Ben Kinglsey's is bad.Ender spends significant amounts of time whining about the administration blocking his email account. What does this have to do with the plot? Nothing. Since when do starships send and receive email? They don't. There's ansible technology in this world people! (machines capable of instantaneous or superluminal communication) Starships are way past ""email."" Overall, I'd say Ender's Game was only kind of bad, but it so totally not awesome.Read more reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",Ender's Game
189,starcraftbw88,From child to starship trooper in a week,2,17 March 2014,"I haven't read the book, but you don't need to in order to see this kid's movie is a joke. I guess in this universe, the most logical thing to do is to train kids to fight a war because all the adults like to sit behind glass screens. And yet, they, for whatever reason, the fate of humanity relies on selecting a random white kid to be commander in a few days because he's a snarky douche/""the one""/""the third"" that comes up with the brilliantly genius notion that an alien species might be able to communicate. Nothing in this movie is ever explained.The acting sucks, the dialogue is pathetic, there is no emotional attachment to anything; the movie is surprisingly boring and stupid for how cool it looked. I'm not sure if this or Pacific Rim was worse. Maybe if I was 10, I'd think it were a good movie instead of pure garbage.",Ender's Game
190,ericzillazillo,Repetitive but enjoyable,8,21 December 2014,"Plot: Young Eminem (played by Asa Butterfield) is bullied, but he is awesome and bullies the bullies and that is why he is training to become a military commander and kill the alien threat! Look at these cool graphics! I haven't read the book, but I think I understand most of the concepts presented in the film, perhaps because the film doesn't hesitate to repeat itself over and over again. Throughout the film you will clearly see several themes that seem to be repeated for the same number of times, you notice a clear pattern in the bully scenes, and it becomes kinda redundant to show what is essentially the same scene twice. My main problem is that I don't feel any real character development in Ender: It's not like Ender learns something mid-film to help him repel the bullies - he is already fairly adept at strategizing and defending himself and gaining respect, the film doesn't show him really learning anything except in the end when he becomes a hippie, but that was a twist you could spot a mile away. At one point in the film, a bunch of kids band together to form a rag tag instant success story - again, under Ender's perfect command, these supposed losers just win their first battle effortlessly. I mean, I suppose Ender was more or less the ""perfect"" character, and at the end of the film he gets a whole armada to play with as a reward for his perfectness, but again an example of a lack of character development. If there's one thing I could change about the film, it's more ""bling"" and less preaching. Harrison Ford's lack of humanity is made super obvious, some scenes were not only boring but also unnecessary such as the explanation of face-paint guy's face-paint, nobody cares! That said, the special effects are decent, the initial earth defense scene was cool because I like fighter jets, spaceship physics are somewhat ""realistic"" and there's some really intriguing zero-G scenes, so despite all the film's flaws I think that this film ranks right up there with the classics, and all their flaws.",Ender's Game
191,kinwingwu,A Brave Scifi movie that refuses to follow mainstream Hollywood storyline,10,10 November 2013,"This film was nothing like Harry Potter and Star Wars but is a totally different entity that punches you in the gut with surprise twists that makes you question a troubling premise of manipulating children for drone warfare. Similar to the ending in, Barry Levinson's 'Toys' 1992 with the evil military General played by Michael Gambon who goes to play Dumbledor in HP. This time the fatherly figure is a Colonel played by Harrison Ford who is key manipulator in controlling Wiggins destiny exploiting his child genius as a Star Killer regardless of the emotional damage.A thought Provoking film that echoes in your mind as you are dazzled by the great effects and the idea of giving so much destructive power to a single child genius whose emotional tug of war shares his sisters kind heart and his brothers violent nature resulting in an imaginative tactical brilliance is so controversial.",Ender's Game
192,thenekassyni,Kid movie,5,18 January 2014,"This is a movie for kids. I could not stop laughing through the movie. The acting reminded me of Air Bender by M. Night although not as bad. Characters are stiff in their acting I find it hard to relate or even care about any of the characters. Actually, I pity the kids and the way the script was written.CG's are for the most part good but there are some scenes that are just bad and they are obvious. If you've read the book you'll maybe like the movie a little better than I did. To me this is nothing more than a middle school movie shot in space.It's also a mix bag of kids trying to be adults or acting like them. Sure it's military training but it's corny.",Ender's Game
193,cubsckc,Cheese,4,14 November 2013,"Plot and acting were pathetic. Its a film that does make you cringe over the fate of humanity and then makes you question it. The amount of responsibility they show they can give children makes me sick and the authors and directors are pretty gay for doing that. I rate things on how I would react to them when they come on Starz and I have an opportunity to see them again. Was there something about this movie that would be cool to see again? Well.. it wasn't ""horrible..."" however, there isn't much I'd like to see again, especially if you consider the most exciting parts of the movie are a bunch of children playing laser tag and being jerks.

Definitely that goes for The Hunger Games the books were so much better. This is not normally the top of movie I would watch but Ender's Game is worthy of watching more than one time it is a good movie with a good message. I do think the movie would have been better had it been longer and more developed but considering people don't have the patience to sit that long it's definitely an underrated movie. Watch and enjoy. It took me two viewings to really get what was going on since I had not read the book.",Ender's Game
195,gawarof,I'm pretty sure the book were better,4,7 February 2021,"I've not read the books, but its very easy to see Ender's game fails at everything a movie format demands. Pacing, time depth, pause.. music is good, cgi is alright but the story is layed out in a very weak wayIt has this weird identity where all scenes look like they end way too quickly without gravitas while the movie still feels dragged out (probably because the books had a lot to offer story wise)I can't rate this in terms of story, but as for everything a movie has to achieve, only the music is saving grace",Ender's Game
196,hurricane_san,"Kind of enjoyable, but feels rushed.",8,16 April 2017,"I've read the books years ago (and should have stopped at the first one, but that's beside the point.) The movie managed to show most of the key points of the story. The parts that, in my opinion, are the steps marking an evolution to the next level. This is impressive given the movie is not even two hours long, but of course there is a cost. The biggest reproach I have is the lack of build-up. Everything feels rushed. The genius of the book, beside the twist(s), is the psychological development of Ender, the manipulations he is the subject of, the monstrosity of the adults and of the other children and ultimately his own. Where is the cold revelation of a few hidden deaths ? Where are the mysteries surrounding a weird trainer, and the very smart reason this Mr Mysterious, once revealed, is not too old? All gone.On its purely technical qualities, the acting was good. Harrison Ford of course but also the children that I didn't find annoying like I usually do. The image and special effects were good and measured and the music from Steve Jablonsky was very enjoyable.In my opinion, the movie is probably not very good for whoever didn't read the book first. But for me, when all is said and done, it was a kind of lazy trip through the memory lane of one of the best book I've ever read.",Ender's Game
197,isabelle-frater,Still not getting the hype,5,8 March 2014,"I didn't watch this movie at a theater because I don't want to financially support the author. I'm against his homophobic views. I still didn't pay for it. The reason why I watched it, was because a lot of people love the story. I hated the book, it was very boring. The whole training was repetitive and ridiculous. I was hoping on screen it would be better.At the beginning they hammered in the whole ""we barely survived last time, but for the hero commander"" thing too much. The battle game rules weren't explained. It's been a while since I've read it, so I was confused at times. Mercifully, the Battle school part was a lot shorter than it was in the book. That was where I gave up, so I was glad. However, the part after that feels a bit hurried, and it's over before you know it. The story of the movie was fine. It wasn't great, though the ending was a bit moving. What was missing was connecting with the characters. It felt shallow. It occurred to me that maybe it was that no character was on screen very long aside from Ender, and he was a hard character to connect to. However, in The Hunger Games we barely got to know Rue, but I was still crying in the theater. Though I believe this problem was also present in the book, and contributed to my not finishing it. The focus was too much on Ender, whom I couldn't manage to like, because I found him a conceited little snot. The other people were just there for Ender, but more like paper cut-outs, than real people.The actors were fine. I don't think that the lack of connection was due to their acting. They tried to amp it up with Harrison Ford, and he was okay. Asa Butterfield did a good job of playing the creepy kid, even if I didn't like the character he was playing. Though he had experience in being the weird child, because he played the young Mordred in the TV series Merlin.The visuals were top notch, though I felt that they were overdoing the space station orbiting Earth picture. Like it cost a lot, so they were milking it for all the seconds they could get out of it. The Battle dome I imagined a bit differently, but this looked much cooler.Overall, a watchable movie. It still didn't solve me the riddle of why some people are so in love with the book, but that could just be me. I really put aside my bias towards the author while watching. However, I still can't give it more than 5 stars, though I almost gave it 3.",Ender's Game

That being said, I'm usually very forgiving with the movie adaptations of my favorite books. I realize that fitting a 300 page book accurately into a 2 hour time slot and making everyone happy is near impossible. Still, this movie just didn't cut it for me. I heard that a lot of other people loved it, and more power to you if you did. It really isn't a bad movie. The effects are well done, the acting was decent, and the storyline, though much different from the book, was not terrible. Still, I found myself disappointed. Perhaps this is what happens when you wait 30 years before making a film adaptation. So, if you've never read the book and don't intend to, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you want the better version, at least in my opinion, I suggest you skip the movie and read the book. It will be well worth your time.",Ender's Game

200,Rob-A,A great couple of hours' entertainment,7,17 January 2014,"There's quite a bit of noise on associated threads about the lack of depth in this movie; the passing over of what Scott-Card fans deem to be material that should have been included, not enough focus on this, too much on that.. yadda yadda.Yes, this film is based on a novel. Adaptations usually get a kicking from some minorities. I don't how how good an adaptation, because I haven't read the book. What I can say is, from my unread point of view this film is really very slick and well acted. And the CGI is superb.Asa Butterfield apparently grew two inches while filming; I'm not surprised. He's hardly recognisable from the charmingly gawky 14-year-old in the excellent Hugo. In fact it wasn't until some way through this movie I realised they were one and the same; Butterfield is at that age where his height has outraced his filling out, and it shows on occasion. But his acting range certainly has filled out.Harrison Ford plays the perfect foil to Ender's fragile genius. As the old school military veteran, ready to sacrifice everything to ""prevent all future wars"", Ford still brings humanity and depth to a part that could easily have been much less.The twist, I have to say, I didn't see coming. Perhaps that's because I watched this movie with no particular expectation, and so was pleasantly surprised. I suggest you do the same.I for one will watch it again in a few months.Perhaps I might even read the book..Worth a couple of hours of your time, definitely.",Ender's Game

Each actor brought his or her own interpretation of the character, which for those who did read the book would very helpful.There is nothing wrong with a kid commanding an entire armada, especially if the character held his conviction 'til the very end. His expressions are phenomenal and believable.There is no hiding behind ridiculous costumes that mask how lame the story is and misinterpreted social cues that fool the audience into thinking that killing is OK.",Ender's Game
202,WheelzFourReelz,"This is a really cool sci-fi, but it doesn't match up to the book.",7,2 March 2014,"Ender's Game is a movie based on the book by Orson Scott Card. It's about a boy named Ender who is brought into this military academy to destroy an alien race. It's been a while since I read the book, but when I read it, I enjoyed it. It had a great story, interesting characters, and it was well written. When I saw the trailer, I got pretty excited. Was it as good as the book? No, it wasn't. Let me get that out of the way. However, I still enjoyed it. Let me start out with the acting. It was very good. Harrison Ford did great, Ben Kingsley did great; Asa Butterfield did a surprisingly fantastic job. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heck, all of the kids were awesome in this movie. Usually when there are child actors in a movie, they're usually terrible (Don't believe me? Watch The Last Airbender. You'll understand). Not this movie. There are a lot of terrific kid actors in their! A couple of them were hit and miss, but a good majority of them were great. The story of this movie is still the same as the book and it's still really good. It has heart, it has moral dilemmas, it has conflict. It has everything you want in a good sci-fi movie. What I like about this movie is that they kept a good chunk of it similar to the movie. I'm glad they didn't drastically change the story. I am very grateful. However, some of these changes come at a cost. One of those costs is Ender's backstory with his family. In the book, he had a long backstory about how he was distant from everybody except from his sister and the military was changing that to make him distant from everybody in general. The back story, in my opinion, was one of the best parts of the book because you really cared about Ender. In the movie, the backstory felt one-dimensional. The connection between his family didn't feel believable and there was no character development with his brother or his sister, which happened in the book. That kind of disappointed me. Now, there was a certain point in this movie where I thought, ""Okay, this movie is starting to drag on. Let's get to something interesting."" Yeah, it gets really slow at a point. The book has the same slowness, but it balances story development with training perfectly. This seemed to have more training sequences than it should have. I feel that they could've shortened some of those scenes to make them not as slow and more interesting. Just my opinion. Overall, Ender's Game is a solid movie adaptation of a book. It's well acted, the story is great, the CGI is awesome, and it's well shot. However, Ender's thin backstory and the moments of slow pacing bog the movie down from being amazing. Is this the sci-fi movie of the year? No, I don't think so. That award goes to Gravity, in my books. But, you should still go watch Ender's Game. It's very enjoyable and very cool.",Ender's Game
203,Dukes_Sheep,Not bad in every way possible,4,4 November 2013,"but it tries.I went into the movie with high expectations having read no reviews or any feedback on the film. Loved the book ""Ender's Game"" but didn't really care for any of the sequels.Had my drink and popcorn and was set. Then with the previews/trailers it all started to go bad. Great movies coming out shortly and we get to see none of the trailers for them. Instead we get 4-5 trailers that I could not tell you one of now.Then the movie starts and it gets worse. The draw of the book was the character development of Ender Wiggens and the battle school. Both were almost completely left out of the movie. Ender's character might have had less screen time than Harrison Ford. I'd have to sit through it again with a stop watch to make sure but its an even bet. So no empathy developed for the character as he remains 2-diminsional at best.Then battle school and the ""Dragon Army."" 1 battle, 1, yes, ONE, not two, not two or three, one. So one test battle is supposed to demonstrated Ender's drive and brilliance for tactics. Of course it did.It could have been a decent movie but this drivel is not worth watching. I'd expect it to drop out of the top 5 on the box office list next weekend and then nose dive from there. The fans of the book have seen the movie and they are not happy.Skip it and see Thor 2x.

204,ajping,Pretty good movie that would have been better had it stuck closer to the book,6,18 February 2014,"This movie is well-acted but suffers from poor writing/production choices. The movie skips important sequences that are critical to the development of the characters and wastes time in areas that are not. For example, there is a video game sequence with Ender as a rat that should have been entirely excluded in favor of more scenes in the battle-room. Also, the movie makes it seem that the initial Formic attack happened in Earth's atmosphere, which is a ridiculous perversion of the novel and basic science. There is also the weird Sergeant character played by Anozie - a meaningless character who doesn't belong as the children are supposed to be largely managing themselves. On the plus side, Harrison Ford is a pleasure to watch and Butterfield performs well. Not a bad film but very disappointing because it had so much potential to be great.",Ender's Game

206,CheeseburgerRandy,Wasted potential,1,5 August 2015,"Everyone knows that its very rare for a movie to surpass its book. I was very hesitant to see the movie since I'm such a huge fan of the book/series, but I caved and (not surprisingly) was very disappointed! The book gives the movie a lot of material to work with, but the entire thing felt (and was) rushed and skipped over a lot (or briefly touched on the subject). Here's the list: 1. Casting..All of the soldiers/students are in their teenage years! If ""I Declare War"" can cast kids in a military-esque movie, why couldn't this movie!? Ender is supposed to be physically less than everyone else. It takes away the sympathy you feel for him in the book. This immediately takes you out of the world that Orson Scott Card created. Major Anderson is played by Viola Davis, a woman. This is a very minor detail, but I don't see the big deal in casting a male, since the source material is a man. His brother, Peter and his sister Valentine are pretty much non-players in the movie (more on this later). Pretty much everyone was miscast besides Colonel Graff (played by Harrison Ford) and I'm neutral about Mazer Rackham (played by Ben Kingsley) and Petra (played by Hallie Standfeld, I know that's not her last name spelled correctly) Even the Bonzo character makes Ender look enormous! 2. Story/Pacing..as I mentioned, the whole movie seemed like a rushed and compressed version of the book. Ideally, they could've made this into a 2-part series, with the ending of 1, when he graduates. Battle School, his relationships w/Peter (especially), Graff, Valentine, Bonzo, his army and friends, other armies/students are all short lived when a huge chunk of the story is exactly about those relationships. Ender is very gifted, but an outcast, physically and mentally bullied by others. Even his interaction with The Game is hit/miss.This could've been a great movie that squandered the source material (for whatever reason(s)). I just hope future movies will take note when dealing with such a highly loved source material.",Ender's Game
207,jhalcollege,It does it's best,6,6 June 2018,"The novel Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, may just be the best work of fiction ever produced. The motion picture on the other hand, does what it can do to translate a nearly unflimable movie.A lot of the other reviews do accurately capture the quality of the movie. The adaptation does remain very faithful to the book, unlike examples. (such as World War Z, The Bourne Identity, V for Vendetta). The things that they do change make a good deal of sense. Omitting Locke and Demosthenes, making all the characters older, and combining other characters (Crazy Tom, Fly Molo, and those guys are absorbed by Alai and Bernard) were all good decisions. The visuals do a heck of a job, and most of the performances are up to standard.However, while greatly capturing the plot, the film falls short in recreating the heart, but this is consequence of the nature of the novel itself. You see, the main character isn't so much Ender Wiggin as it is the mind of Ender Wiggin. The movie just isn't able to make the complete translation, and can be somewhat stale (somewhat analogous to Watchmen). In addition, iconic lines, such as ""The enemies gate is down"", are delivered with a certain staleness, and only seem to be there just to be there. The movie is indeed too short, and it would have been nice if they showed the passing of time (respects to other reviewers).If you've read the book, then this movie will be a decent 100 minutes of your time, and will bring back lots of great memories.

I have read many a sci fi book but enders game is one book i have never got round to reading, So i can not compare this film to a book i have never read This film is outright brilliant, in many areas with next to none in shortcomings Lets begin with the story, Brilliantly wrote story of a boy having to deal with isolation and eventually acceptance by and for others, With some amazing emotional elements and very well wrote characters and character development in all aspects.The soundtrack is amazing and sends chills and creates scintillating dramatic themes throughout the film with some very key music placed exactly where it is needed.The acting in this movie is resplendent, I watched this film for the only establish actor Harrison ford, but in the long run found the entire cast enjoyable to watch. They all showed their acting talents in this film, and I'm hoping to see a lot more from these actors and actresses in the near future.A graphically beautiful movie with some of the most spectacular CGI i have seen in a movie ever, The only downfall to the effects in this movie is lack of practical effects which could of been used in the film in key areas Overall i found this a extremely enjoyable film with action emotion and an overwhelming soundtrack 8 out of 10 Damian Hockey",Ender's Game

210,Threepwood_Lives,Technically good but emotionally disappointing,6,8 March 2014,"Reviews Of Unusual Size:Re: A young boy is recruited to be a young soldier, training to enter the battle against a space menace called The Buggers.Outstanding: Great special effects. The designers found the right balance between alien and realistic and there were some subtle touches I really liked. Asa Butterfield was really great in this. Intense and smart yet small and vulnerable.Unacceptable: Technically speaking, there wasn't anything to complain about. The acting was strong and the story followed the book well. Coupled with the special effects it should have been a great flick.Summary: However, there was never really the sense of overwhelming responsibility I'd always gotten from the novel. It had always had a mix of duty and kids playing games and this movie never quite pulled off either of those. Overall, while watchable, I don't think Ender's Game ever gelled the way it could have.3/5",Ender's Game
211,ahassan-12342,Amenable sci-fi adventure,6,11 March 2016,"This is an efficient sci-fi film about an interplanetary war between Earth and bug-like aliens called the Formics. The film focuses on Earth's fascistic methods in rearing child soldiers for the impending war.I applaud the film for its bravery and its nihilistic final act- which it tries to pull back on slightly at the end. Asa Butterfield is fantastic as Ender and Harrison Ford plays the gruff, ruthless military leader role well. Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley continues his worldwide tour of accents.While some scenes and occasional bits of dialogue descend into Disney Channel movie territory, it is an interesting film on how in an attempt to save the human race, we lose our humanity in the process.",Ender's Game
212,paulwaidelich,The Movie Makes No Sense Unless You Have Read The Book,7,30 January 2014,"I wrote my original review a year and a half ago. You can see it below. What's different? My daughter gave me a copy of the book. This movie never made any sense until I read the book. If you are a sci-fi fan, maybe you are familiar with Dune. That was another great book made into a good (not great) movie. If you saw the movie Dune without reading the book, all the nuance was gone. Same with Ender's Game. If you like sci-fi, read the book by Orson Scott Card first. The movie doesn't work unless you've read the book. Otherwise, I stand by my review below. I ignored the bad reviews. How bad could a movie starring Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley be? The answer is...barely watchable.I haven't read the books. However, if you are going to have young children star in a movie with violence, you need more adult supervision. I hope this isn't a spoiler, but by putting kids in total control of a planetary defense system during an intergalactic war you strain the boundaries of credibility. The kids are all interesting, but not that much. There are literally dozens of moments that don't feel right, are unbelievable or insult your intelligence so much that you cannot give yourself to the storyline. Harry Potter always had adults guiding him. They didn't make Harry the headmaster of Hogwarts when he was 11 years old.The special effects are good. There are many plot devices that almost work. Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley are outstanding as always. You keep hoping that the movie will become intelligent and redeem itself. Unfortunately, the ending goes in the opposite direction. How many good movies end with the audience thinking ""Bullshit!""? You'll end up wondering why they spent $110,000,000 without putting it in front of a focus group.If you can watch it for free and lower your expectations to ground level, there are many good moments in this film. Just prepare to be disappointed at the end.",Ender's Game
213,demetriocoffman,No adults allowed. A future teen space academy reality show put me to sleep.,2,9 November 2013,"I expected allot more from this flick but was left with the understanding that its truly meant for kids to watch not adults. I went with my 22 year old son who enjoyed it. He liked the maturing of Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) and how he grew from shy student to a leader in the academy. But I guess if watching a bunch of teens studying, playing, fighting and working at a futuristic space academy is cool, then enjoy yourself. Harrison Ford is like the Star Wars leftover guardian of the teens and the token ""old person"" in the movie. I did recognize Ender's sister Valentine who was played by Abigail Breslin from her role as the young girl in Little Miss Sunshine. Other big named stars are Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis and they just hung out with Ford.",Ender's Game
214,Palidan400,Solid and spectacular - Ender's game,8,1 November 2013,"Seeing Ender's Game on the big screen was definitely a great experience, a film worth paying for for the sake of the theater setting. I have not read the books myself, but friends who have told me of the differences throughout. Overall, the film provides a smooth and engaging ride for viewers of all ages.The story is fast-paced - apparently skipping/condensing parts of the book which is no surprise - and will keep you interested the whole time. There is a nice blend of scenes with great and intense action and emotional drama. This comes from of course the solid writing and the performances from the cast, all of whom did excellently. It was a treat to see Harrison Ford in space again and the children held their own even with the adults (though Moises Arias as Bonzo was a bit amusing). I'm not sure how I feel about Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham either.It's also not a surprise though that the special effects in this film are fantastic, which is a given with a space and war film. At times, the action may get a bit cluttered with the battle scenes, but if you can keep up, it's quite exciting.Towards the end of the film, it becomes obvious the film's set-up for sequels, and I personally would welcome a franchise. The film stands solidly throughout which is how I would best describe it - it's not the best that it can be, and listening to those who have read the books, it seems to sometimes fall short from the themes and heart of the originals. Regardless, Ender's Game is a good start, and I recommend seeing this for a 2 hours of enjoyment.",Ender's Game
215,peterfaure,It could have been much better,6,5 November 2013,"First of all let me mention that I read the book, people who haven't might get a different impression.So, having said that, I will give this movie a six only because of the acting and decent visuals. Overall, unfortunately, it falls well short of the high standards set by the book.The pacing is uneven throughout, random snippets from the novel appear without any real context to give them any emotional resonance, and important moments are rushed, or poorly thought out. The direction is pretty much mailed in, a stodgy, discouraged, trite affair despite the overall stylishness of the designs and palettes (the few positives) Honestly, it goes by pretty fast, the visuals are pleasant, the story it's based on is interesting, so not a total waste of time if you just want to chill in a theater for a little while....However, if you are movie buff and expect a little more than average Hollywood fare than don't bother, this movie feels patchy, artificial, staged, it has no flow and no it has no real depth.Kudos to the actors for giving this hodge-podge of themes never fully explored at least a vague semblance of heart, but a pretty mediocre effort all considered, definitely below mediocrity in terms of script and direction.Once again, it could have been so much better.",Ender's Game

It's amazing (if you read the novel - which is pretty authentic) how sometimes directors and producers turn literally anything, even most original idea, into chewable cinematographic copypaste.I understand difficulty of finding 8-year old actor, but movie authors didn't even attempt to struggle.Forget this movie slag, really!

I enjoyed watching the zero-G scenes, pristine views of Earth, the alien planet landscapes and the battle graphics towards the end (not something I'm really into, so they did a pretty good job there)! Good performances all around.An uplifting, moral message at the end really makes the film. I hope a sequel is in the works!",Ender's Game
218,brickmoviereviews,Ender's Game: Take a Step Into the Future,7,10 November 2013,"Enders Game is a sci-fi movie about a genetically modified kid, Ender, who is the last hope in man's war with an alien race. Ender is a child who is sent into a program that breeds young minds to become the ultimate human being who can then protect the earth from the aliens.Throughout this movie you see how smart, strong, and tactical Ender, the main protagonist, is. With the techniques from the program, Ender proves is mind surpasses his appearance. He is a great leader to his crew, and makes everyone feel as though they contribute while also being a total badass. With the aliens on their way to attack the human race, Ender keeps his crew under control and ready for an epic battle.Personally I enjoyed the movie.

219,benisof,Interesting but flawed,5,4 March 2014,"I was entertained by the movie, overall, but in the end I felt like it wasn't finished, and had almost nothing to transmit apart of the fact that it is wrong to eradicate a species.I didn't feel what was the climax of the movie. The final battle, for me was just like a simulation and I remember wondering how could the ""real"" battle fit in the remaining space till the end of the movie? Of what use were those training games between teams, and how would that aid with ship fighting? The only connection with the final fight is that drones dig a hole through the enemy and the blast passed through...Ender was going to give up after he injured the other kid in the bathroom, but his sister managed to convince him to go back with just 2-3 phrases. And the final argument was that if he doesn't try, he will not succeed. What had that to do with the injured kid and the guilt he felt? What strategist would leave the Earth defensless and go light-years away to fight the enemy with his best ships? What if the enemy was already close to Earth, and launched an attack? The whole idea to use kids because they have better minds is ridiculuos. No one in his right mind would do that. What did they need to process, anyway? That the enemy was swarming and coming to fight them? The end is bizarre. How could a queen be so close to the human base and they didn't find it? The special effects and the acting weren't bad, but the story is not plausible.",Ender's Game

Its a very captivating and well constructed plot and direction that will satisfy young minds. Ender's Game may be the quintessential SCI FI of growing would be kids and pre adolescents.

221,avidnewbie,Books Are Great but So Are Movies,7,22 August 2015,"Yes I have read the book Ender's Game. I also have read other great books by Orson Scott Card such as Wyrms, The Worthing Saga, The Memory of Earth and the Folks of the Fringe. They are all great reads and very entertaining. Books rely on the imagination of the reader to fill in the blanks and draw comparisons and in doing so they provide a more intimate, insightful and personal experience. Imagining what an alien looks like is probably more personal than seeing how someone else had imagined it would look. Yet movie adaptations can deliver an experience that written word cannot. They are separate accounts of the same story. One promotes interest in the other. I like both and I am glad to have finally been given a cinematic rendition of Cards original vision. Ender's Game is a very good movie. It's not Oscar worthy nor was it intended to be. It is ,however, entertaining and well acted with state of the art sfx, sets and costumes. Maybe they should start giving science fiction movies their own awards much like they do with the books which have the Hugo and the Nebula awards. Why shouldn't genre films be recognized for individual excellence? You wouldn't want a vegetarian trying to critique your wing sauce would you? No? Well, neither do I want high-brows ranking my science fiction.",Ender's Game
222,dane-92,"Disappointing to readers of the book, less so to people who haven't read it",8,4 January 2015,"Based on the reviews I've read, the understandable reaction of the fans of the book series is that the movie doesn't come close to representing the complete storyline. But then, how could it? I agree the story does feel rushed as you watch it. The kid climbs the ladder of success at a dizzying pace, and the amount of plot required to even touch the original story forces the viewer through what, at times, feels like a breakneck sequence of scenes and events. All of that is a nod to the detractors. Now, let me tell you why I liked this movie.Ender's Game has heart. There is a warmth to the characters that nicely counterbalances the coldness of war, space, and technology. You feel with, and for Ender as he tries to adapt to the pain of alienation, loss of connection with loved ones, and the incredible pressure and challenges he faces.The atmosphere of the movie is enveloping. The acting, colors, and melancholy music underscore the dire nature of what's going on . Ender's plight, and at times his character, is reminiscent of Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings, another character plucked from obscurity, at times unwillingly, and shouldered with the weight of the world.I also appreciated the lack of vulgarity and bad language. This movie proves you don't need it to tell a fascinating story.The ending was an interesting and surprising twist, and even Ender's reaction to the ""twist"" was interesting. So, yeah, I can understand the reaction of fans of the book, but for someone who was coming into it without any previous frame of reference, I thought the movie was great.",Ender's Game

But still I got the feeling something was missing.All through the first three quarters of the movie, I found myself wondering what happened from scene to scene. It all seemed so disconnected, so like the jagged edge of a saw and although the special effects were spectacular at times, it could not capture my full attention.After reading some of the reviews, I understood why. There was indeed something missing. Only those parts of the book that could be converted to movie were used, the rest was skipped or deleted, and that was exactly what I experienced watching the movie.That doesn't mean, however, that this was a bad movie. On the contrary, a great performance of Asa Butterfield and the last quarter of the movie made more than up for it. On the whole it was barely satisfactory, so 5.5 out of 10.",Ender's Game

225,jkling-1,We liked it but they could have been truer to the book in a few places,7,1 November 2013,"SPOILERS AHEAD - skip now if that's an issue for you. The beginning was very strong, establishing that the children were all potential recruits. This was nicely done. I wish they could have done more with Valentine and Peter but there was only so much time so I get that. The scene on the lake with the raft was a missed opportunity to really see Ender's inner struggle with what he must do to survive. They made an attempt at it but to me, it fell short of how he wrestles with his inner demons - his inner Peter. The battle room was way cool. Very nicely done. I wish there could have been more exploration of that as a vehicle but there is only so much time and no doubt that stuff must have been pretty expensive to pull off. Where I was definitely unhappy was the one time where Graff is in his office and they show the real fleet approaching the detection zone of the Formics. It was just under 30 days out, and to me, this hinders the suspension of disbelief that the war is ""soon but not quite when"". Sure I've read the book many times over the last 20 years so I KNOW what's going to happen but there is no need to make it so Blatant that soon is NOW, not ... in a few years. The stress of the timeline was best conveyed in the urgency of the dialog between Graff, Ender, Major Anderson, Rackam, and a few others. The confrontation between Ender and Bonzo could have been REALLY good but clearly someone in Hollywood didn't want a child viciously taking out another on screen. It is tragic that they made Enders defeat of Bonzo into an accident. The whole notion of Ender is that he is forced to rely only on himself, that no adult will EVER come to his aid. And he MUST destroy, and not merely defeat his enemies, to make sure they can never ever hurt him. Someone really wimped out and oh gosh ... Bonzo hit his head when he fell - instead of Ender being shown to smash him ... and then - rightly so - being torn and tormented by his own brutality. This fear of becoming Peter ... becoming the killer could then have been played out much better in the lake scene with Valentine. Then we have the final confrontation ... and it's ""game over"" ... and the kids are like ""yeah"" and the adults in the observation booth are anything but ecstatic that he has done it and the world is safe. They played it a different way and it worked for what it was. But the way that it should have been was as written ... the kids exhausted at their months-long ordeal, finally over for now .... knowing that they'll be fighting it for real in the next few years .... and confused by the adults who are hugging, laughing and crying that it's over. Another missed opportunity, at least to me, was near the ending, where Ender is on the forward outpost after the final conflict, and he meets the dying Queen. This would have been a great chance for Ender to have a monologue, expressing how sorry he was, and understanding that the Queen was also tormented by the murder that they had committed - not knowing then that each person was an individual and the sanctity of life. And that she forgave the humans. They really could have tied that into the notion that Ender would become a speaker for the dead ... as Mazer indicated in their interaction earlier. Anyway ... it was good but not great. Ford was just outstanding as was Viola Davis. Asa Butterfield did a really nice job as Ender, a nice blend of cold calculation and empathy.",Ender's Game
226,silverdragon4,Enders end game a surprise.,9,17 July 2014,"Will admit from the start that I never read the book. So, I won't be one of those ""Oh I read the book, here are all the differences that ruined the film"". Instead this will be about the film itself. No spoilers.When I first heard of this film I thought it would be another one of those ""Underdog"" films. And it was. They don't always work, but this one got it right. Enders (Asa Butterfield) was a great choice. His acting will surly give him a decent future. The main reason for me watching this was of course, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford). An uptight, ridged ""bleep"" whose only thought is of his planet. No possibly or maybe. Black and white do or die attitude. Ball Breaker. Different role that I am used to seeing him in, but great none the less. Even the short role by Ben Kingsley was good. Most of the other cast was young and relatively unknown, but every one of them added to the movie is a good way.The training scenes were brilliant, just like you would imagine a military school to be like, except in space. The battle scenes, although few, were great. I can't actually fault the film. The end was surprising, not how I expected it to go. The very end though...not sure if it was left open for a sequel or a bit of a let down. Which is why it didn't get a 10. Overall though, very good film.",Ender's Game
227,FugitiveAmoeba,Entertaining enough,7,10 January 2014,"""Ender's Game"" is a yet another attempt by film studios to fill the void left by the Harry Potter franchise, but when looked at in a less cynical fashion, the film is fairly entertaining on its own merit.Asa Butterfield's Ender Wiggin is likable and his travails in the futuristic military school is engaging enough to fill out a 2hr long film. He's ably supported by a cast of Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. While it is not always clear as to why so much responsibility is thrust upon the children or the vague nature of the enemy, the film still manages to come together in a coherent fashion, especially in the final act - which is pleasantly surprising, to say the least.The film, while not breaking any new ground serves as an agreeable beginning for a sci-fi franchise with some promise.

I expected some tron 2 type action special effects movie and received a mediocre at best live video game. Harrison fords character was boring and dull. Oh wait it must be the kids performance that deserves an Oscar? Earth gets all the special genius kids together just so one of them can press a button? This movie had no action no drama no suspense no nothing. If you want to watch a video game in play at least go play it yourself. This was clearly one of Harrison fords flops, worse than cowboys and aliens. If you want to see a real sci fi movie with Harrison ford wait for the new Star Wars. This one wont be worth watching it on red box for $1. I never read the book but from reading the reviews from people that did, I would have been livid and disappointed even more.

By now, we've all seen enough special FX spectaculars, no? Are we still knocked out by video game movies? Not if it has nothing else to offer. The star kid was on acting par with Jaden Smith. He had one expression, intensely furrowed brow. Or was that everyone? As a matter of fact, I gather smiling and laughing was pretty much banned in this future; parents, leaders, relatives, friends -- either angsty, sad or angry. The music was a horrible minor key drone from beginning to end. It made me angsty, sad, and angry. All I recall are lots of round doors which when opened revealed lots of big triangles, where kids played bouncy house laser tag. Did Ender show Harrison Ford the enemy egg at the end or hide it under his shirt when he walked back from the nearby cave? And then Our Hero becomes an admiral, so they give him a spaceship and an apparently infinite amount of fuel in order to zoom about the universe. Alone. No co-pilot, flight engineer, med-tech, navigator or Robby the Robot to talk to. But maybe he'll have a pal if the egg hatches. Or maybe the creature will eat him.

231,gloshpit,What was the Editor's Game?,5,27 October 2013,"Unfilmable, he said. OSC said that his ""Pre-teen Sociopath Commits Genocide On Unfortunately Named Space Ants In Space"" novel was unable to be filmed simply because the majority of the content takes place in Ender's head. His feelings, the complexity of dealing with his siblings, his resentment and burden of duty. So what best way to apply this cerebral sci-fi to celluloid?Just ignore the thinky bits.Ender's Game, The Movie certainly cracks along at quite a pace, you're not left looking at your watching and wondering how long before things wrap up. And the acting is solid enough, complaints there. What doesn't work is the adaptation itself, and the editing.Anyone who's read the books before going into the cinema will recognise the framework of the story, but will wonder where all of the plot went. Peter appears for all of one scene, solely to show that, yes, he's a violent dick. Valentine appears more often, but mostly as a plot device more than anything character driven. Valentine is nice, Ender likes Valentine, Ender misses Valentine. Locke and Demosthenes? Never heard of them, they don't exist in this version of events. The Mind Game, the one that Ender plays throughout EGTB and mirrors his mental state and thought process? Reduced to a two minute Flash game on an iPad and a sequence of foreshadowing for later in the movie. The series of battle games between the armies that slowly erode Ender's resolve as Graff systematically changes the rules to break Ender down? One 2 v 1 match. Characters are blurred together and virtually written out (notably, neither of the kids Ender beats the hell out of die, assumedly to garner audience empathy - and all the characters are at about twice the age of the ones in the novels, maybe to stop people having to see a 6 year old boy murder another kid in the showers...) and the end result is very different to the novels.And the editing. It's all over the place - when watching this movie you will feel that it's an edited for TV version and that someone cut out the wrong scenes. The first battle room scene ends abruptly, with not even a discussion of what happened in it. Ender goes from being in Salamander army to being given the name of a new army, to having a whole new army who almost instantly respect him. Worst of all is Ender wanting to quit the program, whereas in EGTB it took place over time and was caused by Graff's increasingly gruelling changing of rules, in EGTM it happens after one game, and the sudden jumps in narrative make Ender look at best like a petulant child and at worst like a schizophrenic:Graff: ""Wake them up early for a game!"" Ender: ""It's 3am, we're playing a game!"" Ender's Army: ""It's 2 v 1!"" Ender: ""Graff's changing the rules! We can still do this, follow my instructions."" Ender's Army: ""We won using a combination of sacrifice and improbable formations that probably won't foreshadow anything later in the movie at all, hooray!"" Ender: ""Everything is awesome!"" Bonzo: ""I am named after a dog and therefore hate you, let me beat you up."" Ender: ""Oh no, I fought back and hurt him, but he is DEFINITELY still alive. I hate you, Graff, everything is terrible and I'm running away to Earth!""Although the film as a whole moves quickly, the story itself lurches in patches of ten minute sequences, followed by jumps to the next patch. Perhaps due to the nature of the novel, if you take out the internal narrative and subplots this is what you get, but it seems strange that on one hand the movie would take such liberties with the source material, but on the other hand follow the set pieces so slavishly that it would disrupt the flow of the story.As a sci-fi film in a vacuum, it's competent - for some reason it reminded me of Stargate, with elements of The Hunger Games - but flawed in places and has a very uneven and badly edited narrative flow. As an adaptation of EGTB... it's a bit of a Bugger.",Ender's Game
232,delzog,A complete bastardization of a great novel,3,7 April 2017,"Okay, I gave this movie a 3 for the simple reason that some of the CGI was cool and added a bit of depth for visualizing the novel into a contemporary theme. I had hopes that the movie might hold up at least as an interesting sci-fi on it's own merits. Much like the newer release of Star Trek, all far removed from the original story, but good if not compared to the original cast and stories. It does NOT.The pacing is ridiculous, the story too contrived, and the characters two-dimensional. I understand the constraints of the film and time and therefore must conclude that it was a foolish mistake to make a movie out of the book. It would have been better to make a mini-series, with a less known cast, over a longer period of time on a fraction of the budget for the simple reason that ""Ender's Game"" lends itself ideally to that type of cinema. Perhaps, if I'd never read the book, I could have like the movie enough to give it another star or two, but I doubt it.

Basically what you see is the training of a kid to go to war and kill legions of enemies without asking who they are, why they are here, and basically just killing them, as if it was through a video game. The whole film I was thinking that is not right. If he was an Arab and training in with a A-47 in the hand that would be unbearable, like looking 2 hours of rapes in a row, but here, it sounds acceptable. There is no blood, nobody cries, it is only machines, spaceships fighting. But the weird feeling was sticky through all the movie, with its cold look, with too many CGI and not enough good acting. Harrison Ford is not doing good in this movie, and his end of career goes to the opposite way someone like Clint Eastwood for example. Most actors were OK, and the main character was doing a good job at being close to crying all the time. The whole movie it totally depressing. Should I mention that the end does not have any sense and is the most ridiculous ending I have ever seen? The director does not know where he stands... what is the message? It seems that this movie is a propaganda command from the US army to plug into our head that having our kids learning how to kill with a joystick at school is acceptable?

But, after reading the summary of the novel, I think this is a quite successful movie adaptation.Good storyline, good acting from the casts, good costumes & props, and cool visual effects too. Asa Butterfield successfully portrayed a child who is genius but quiet and misfitted. Abigail Breslin was lovely as a sister. Harrison Ford was suitable as a kindhearted commander.There is only one thing to feel sorry about though. The ending, which was supposed to be a good twist but it did not feel kicking!

It follows the usual formulaic tale of a person with a destiny goes on a journey faces adversary and blah blah to the end. But it does it brilliantly, the tale is a ripping yarn, it's just a great story, with a great cast and dazzling effects.

237,abryan,I tried to like this movie. Honest.,4,14 March 2014,"I'm a big fan of SciFi. So much so that I will be quite forgiving when viewing scifi movies. I'll be honest and say I'd never read or even heard of the book. But after seeing the trailers I was looking forward to this film. Good points first. The look of the film and the special effects are pretty good, if a little confusing in some places. Some of the space battles are a little overly complex, and therefore tend to loose their impact and drive. Bad points. The acting was painful. Very hammy, and laughable in places. Even veterans like Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley looked almost embarrassed in places. I think this was mostly down to the terrible dialogue of the script, forcing the cast to deliver some pretty terrible lines. Not good. The story was OK, I guess, as thin as it was. You couldn't help drawing similarities between this and The Hunger Games. The ending however was appalling. I found myself shouting at the screen, ""REALLY....!!!!"". It just seemed so abrupt and almost like an after- thought. All in all I was very disappointed in this movie, and no matter how much of a sci fi fan I am, I just couldn't forgive it for being such a stinker. Sorry.",Ender's Game

239,rshyleshnair,"Shoulda, coulda, woulda been a great-er movie",7,28 December 2013,"I am not sure how I feel about this movie. The story line was great and so chock-full of so much potential for development of the central character. The story line just seemed to move at inconsistent paces for me-turbo speed in some sections and snail slow in what seemed to be irrelevant. I am not sure if it was a direction issue or screen play development issue. I wanted so much to champion Ender as a character and in the end couldn't quite figure out if his character was left decimated by the ultimate consequence of his actions that he was left to ponder and pick up the pieces. Asa Butterfield was such a good actor who could have been directed into a greater role. Harrison Ford's and Viola Davis's role felt one-dimensional and repressed with lines that were too predictable. Some of the scenes felt like it had no context set for viewers who had never read the book. Ben Kingsley's role as the colonel who trail-blazed was reduced to looking like a comical wild-man gone nuts and with maori markings on his face for the hell of it. There is so much I could say- the interactions between the children and the different troops felt too rehearsed and not organic enough. The combat scenes felt more like a video game club taking themselves too seriously. Now I wish I had read the book instead. I just was left wanting more depth, more development of the central characters, more exposition of the background on the alien ant-like creatures who invaded earth (I think?) The backgrounds and backdrops looked cheap in some of the scenes and left needing more. In the end, I walked away wishing for more of this and more of that....sigh!",Ender's Game
240,hairy_buddah,"Ruined the message of Ender's Game, just like Starship Troopers",9,21 November 2013,"I enjoyed the movie. The visuals were amazing. I particularly enjoyed the giant's game sequence. It was great to see one of my favorite books brought to light. But Hollywood just couldn't help itself with the progressive agenda crap.In the movie it was claimed that the Formics wanted our water. Dumb, dumb, dumb, standard green message. Water is incredibly common in space. No need to mine it from a gravity well. Water is not a precious jewel that we must preserve because we are our own aliens stealing from our own planet. The book simply had the Formics expanding and founding colonies so their race could grow. Good for them.Then the movie claimed that the Formics civilization had ""unsustainable growth, just like ours"". -sigh- Once you get to the asteroids and the moon, and can extract mineral wealth from them, you can grow MUCH more than was shown in either the book or the movie. So Earth (and Formic) civilization is NOT ""unsustainable"".And then, of course, the Humans Are Bad meme. Just as in the book Starship Troopers where the aliens were bad guys who attacked us because they wanted to colonize our planet for their race, so too the Formic's of Ender's Game were looking for growing room. So naturally Hollywood had to show humans as bad, and said that both sets of bugs were just misunderstood, and that WE were the bad guys. Attacking them and wiping them out through sheer military misguidedness. Because war is bad, and it is always our fault. We can ALWAYS avoid war just by trying to talk a little more.I had wondered why they shipped Ender off to the Formic home planet to fight them in the movie. In the book he stayed in our solar system and fought all of his battles at a training base through a faster than light communications technology. Well, the answer was simple. To make the humans the bad guys. In the book, the battles with the Formics took place at many planets over a longer period of time. In the movie the Formics were ONLY on their home world, and just waiting for us. Not attacking us. Once they understood we were intelligent beings, just different from them, the movie would have you believe they just needed an invitation to tea.And of COURSE our military KNEW that the Formics weren't acting aggressively. Bad military. Bad. Evil humans. Evil.I am just so BORED with that meme. And frustrated with the way the positive message of great science fiction books, particularly military sci-fi, is always corrupted by Hollywood.Hairy",Ender's Game

This is the story of Ender Wiggin, a young boy (age 11?) to train for a fight against the Formics, an Alien race. The storyline is OK but the whole story is a bit childish - the first hour is almost like kindergarten in space - you wonder if the kid ever grows up. The biggest joke is that Ender becomes the leader of a children's army. That's fine for a children's movie but why is this then rated PG-13? With all the stuff kids can see today, PG would be perfectly appropriate. It's not even very SciFi-realistic. The Aliens, huge floppy insects, can not only communicate properly - how can they operate space ships? The whole story is difficult to believe. It's not even clear why children are playing those roles. Declare this as a kid's movie and it may be fine. 11 year olds saving the world? That's a joke in a PG-13-rated movie.",Ender's Game

I felt there were some important parts that were eclipsed along the movie that eventually just get mentioned, I wish those parts were there but I fear it could have made the movie too long. Maybe if this big story had been separated in 2 or 3 movies, elements that were excluded could have been developed more, but it's hard to say, I really love this movie the way it is and I really wanted to see more titles, the story is very good and the characters' ideals are very well portrayed.",Ender's Game
245,thegene-2,99 Percent Great - 1% Very Bad,8,18 February 2014,"First off, there is not a spoiler alert that will say any details about the movie that gives away much of anything. At 71 years old, and having watched SCI-FY movies starting at age 8 and am not only a huge fan, but though I have watched tons and tons of other types of movies, all of them added together would not equal the number of SCI-FY ones I have watched. I love, love, love SCI-FY.When I discuss a movie with someone, I like to talk about the different elements such as special effects, story line, dialog, cinematic photography and so on. But I also like to talk about how I feel things should have been done different, and possible better choice of certain actors, and other details and normally the reviews do not cover. As with many good movies there is so much to talk about that to even begin to cover things would require more time than the movie. This is for sure one of those cases so I won't even start.The movie is a superb SCI-FY movie. I have no problems with the characters, or the special effects, or the acting, or dialog or almost all other components/elements of the film. Thus for one very small part of about 4 minutes of film to drop my ratting to an 8 is very unique and very rare. In fact, very, very rare.When one watches SCI-FY they have to open their mind to the point of believing that almost anything in the future is possible. Granted there are some things that seem almost impossible. That sometimes becomes a real problem for many for us that love SCI-FY, even super love the genre. A problem in this for sure is how the aliens could do what they did - but I won't get into that as that little problem is nothing compared to the much bigger problem. I know you are expecting to see what that problem is here, but that would be too much of a spoiler. I will say that for those that read this, they may well figure out how to identify the problem before they see the movie, but I would advise them to see the movie anyway. One hundred and ten minutes of the movie is excellent. So 4 minutes is not all that much for bad, but was enough to drop my rating down to an 8 (probably would have given it a 10 otherwise). I see that almost 75,000 have already voted on IMDb and it has a rating of 6.9. I can't help wonder if the 4 minutes were not there or were changed significantly, the ratting might not be an 8 or higher.",Ender's Game

Having that said, the makers has done a great job to select what parts that should be in the film. It's a total blast of effects that truly does the books descriptions justice.

247,bain0038,Better than a lot of the reviews,8,4 November 2013,"It's odd to me that ""Ender's Game"" is getting a bad wrap overall from the reviewers and ""Gravity"" is just so ""wonderful"". That's because Ender's Game is a much more engaging and visceral story with better character development, while Gravity relies on special effects and characters about as complicated as those in ""Transformers"".This film gets off on the right foot. The protagonist is a lanky tween, (played by Aas Butterfield, who is established quickly. He's a prodigy, sensitive, an underdog who must balance personal issues with a greater responsibility. He's selected to lead against an alien race who once threatened our existence. You might ask where have we seen this before? Hey, at least it's not a prequel, sequel, or remake. And let me tell you something else, you haven't seen earth threatened quite like this.I will say that along the way it gets a little silly. Ender goes into training and the developments seem generic and the games they play for training are pretty confusing. Some of the better moments are borrowed from ""A Dirty Dozen"" and some others seem tailored for children.. That said, this isn't a film for kids. The overall themes here are harsh, even cynical; however, this lends to a more interesting formula than your standard good guy, bad guy, movie.Harrison Ford is powerful as a the captain of this mission to save humanity at any cost. His philosophy is cold, direct, and dangerous. By contrast, our hero is different, innocent, talented, and closer to the delicacy of life. And so there is a gigantic contrast between the two characters and a greater one with the final solution. Despite looking forward to this movie, I almost didn't see this with negative reviews piling in and the recent homophobic rant by the author. However, I was glad I gave it the benefit of the doubt. You might too.",Ender's Game

Visuals are stunning and everything appears as it should.It's a very enjoyable movie that anyone that likes sci-fi will probably love.

The book is incredibly well loved: All of my friends have been freaking out over it, so i decided to give it a whirl. This movie has a bunch of kernels of good ideas. Ender's conflict between pacifism and militarism, his siblings representing the downfalls of either extreme, genocide as a means to reach peace, when is it right to exploit a child?... All great discussions for a long movie, or ideally, a series of movies or 2 season TV show. As it stands, trying to cram all of this into a 2 hour movie cripples it. At one point, a man says ""I will never salute you"".. .and ten minutes later he salutes Ender... but why? As far as I could tell, all Asa Butterfield did in those 10 minutes was win at laser tag. Literally. This type of sped up character development is prevalent throughout the movie. There is a plot twist towards the end, and I was just as surprised at the characters. The implications of children in was and the morality of genocide is explored well enough. But again, i think those ideas would have benefited from being explored over a couple of seasons of a TV show to give you time to attach to characters. Again, with the pace of this movie, you're whipped from one place to the next so quickly you don't have time to care, with rare exception On the plus side I love the visual style of this movie. It's gorgeous to look at. If you read and enjoyed the books, you'll probably get a kick out of it like everyone else I know.

I caught it before I watch ex-machina tonight so was in a Sci Fi mood to be fair but for a film about teenagers it was very good. I sometimes turn from films like this because the teenagers annoy me (I've been one myself!) and I guess sometimes they irritate because they remind me of me. Besides all that the graphics for the games are beautifully done, the music good, the pace of the plot fast enough to keep you interested. I had worked out what was going to happen and couldn't remember if it was from the book or I'd worked it out myself. Probably both. Well it's a great story and beautifully crafted film.

As rich as the book is in all its philosophical concepts and thought provoking actions, the movie encapsulates some of that. Ender's character is a tactical genius, yet has the empathy and emotions of human. This causes a lot of internal conflicts between his actions and the morality behind it. In the movie, it captures this. He cries and his eyes get red after fights. But the scenes were subtle. The book on the other hand, had pages and pages of all his feeling and thoughts. I could relate to Ender in the book. I had a hard time connecting with him in the movie. In the end, it brought the book together as a complete movie. I just know the movie is supposed to be deeper.

260,Martianette,Does the impossible: captures an unfilmable book,9,6 December 2020,"I like 'Ender's Game' as a book, but I love what was done to convert it into a film.I almost think the adaptation should've been a tv series, as the film ellides over certain book plot points, and combines material, meaning some emotional beats and logical connections don't get fully developed, but on my second viewing I can't help but think Hood as screenwriter and director achieved the impossible.Much of that is through a brilliant understanding of the themes of the book: empathy for the true alien other (a problem we humans really fundamentally have in 2020!), compassion, control of our violent tendencies, patience and tolerance, and most importantly, communication (boiling down to a willingness to just wait and listen to those we assume not at all like us), but another factor is the cast.Just about every actor is either utterly skilled, or directed with care for the overarcing trajectory of the film, or the footage has been so cleverly edited with such insight and nuance. Ford and Butterfield, and the compellingly problematic relationship between their characters, are real standouts. I've never seen Ford this good in anything, apart from 'Witness', and I love him in everything I've seen him in. But it's that he's toe-to-toe with Butterfield: you can just sense the respect, the teamwork between them - it's just magic to watch. Though (as a Kiwi) I baulk at the use of tau moko on Kingsley, I can only assume it was sanctioned and approved of by Maori experts (I would LOVE to see the specific meaning of Rackham's ta moko: every line has import and relevance), and (as a Kiwi) I loved his Noo Zeelund accent. I would've loved to have seen more of Davis's Anderson, but I'm like that about her in everything she appears in! Steinfeld's Petra is also a standout, as is the magnetic Valentine from Breslin. And a cast of wonderful diversity, reflecting humanity's inevitable future: a range of cultures, ethnicities, creeds and disbeliefs is how we look now, and how we'll look very soon from now.On release, the last section of the film made me cry like a drain - some 'thing' so computer generated has never really had that effect on me - but on my second screening now, seven years later, those scenes still get to me. Kudos to all involved - you should be proud that this production will stand the test of time, and will 'get to' thoughtful kids just like Ender when they discover your gorgeous film.",Ender's Game

The whole movie centers around Ender, a young boy who's lack of emotions is disturbing. He fights his way up the ranks and the movie follows his path to glory. Enders goal is to protect earth against an unknown enemy, but they could easily have been replaced Nazis's or Americans for that matter. It's a nameless and almost faceless enemy and I didn't really care much about them at all. Instead, Ender does. Which is strange, because he's depicted as a stone cold killer with only a hint of compassion in his body. Yes, I know, he has some trouble with bullies, seems to care about a dude who gets hurt because of his actions and he seems to love his sister, but the acting didn't convince me of that at all. To me, Ender is too one dimensional, a boy who lacks emotion and compassion. In the movie he's a cold and calculating boy and I didn't really care about him. And that is the main problem with this movie. It's almost impossible to picture yourself in the footsteps of the main characters. That makes this a movie I don't care about. At all.",Ender's Game

I think the whole series could be done as a cartoon or some other digital method. It does not need to be done with live people. I hope someone does that someday.",Ender's Game
265,blagomeni,sci-fi at its best,8,26 May 2014,"It does not happen often that a movie adaptation of a novel does the novel justice. This is fortunately the case with the movie adaptation of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. I have had the pleasure of reading the book before I saw the movie. After a few scenes into the it I realized that the depiction off the story, places and characters is very similar to what I had imagined when I read the book. No one can expect that a book of a couple of hundred pages can be squeezed into two hours of a movie. The director, fortunately, had no such intention. Still, the most important aspects of the story are present. Even though occasionally shown out of the sequence of the novel, in order to make up for the omitted sections of the book, they still tell a convincing story that flows smoothly and without any obvious gaps. I wholeheartedly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. The intimate knowledge of the story would make it possible to follow the movie with far better understanding. It would also make the movie more entertaining. Nevertheless, even as a stand-alone this movie is a very entertaining feature. This movie is a story of humanity and the loss of it. It is also a story of socialization of the young people and personal growth. But most of all, it is a story of how far would one go to defend their family, their group, the species. The main characters are shown faithfully in comparison to the characters from the book. The young actor, Asa Butterfield, who was cast in the role of Ender is a very good choice. Barely seventeen, he took his role seriously, convincingly bringing the character of Ender to life. The supporting cast beautifully complemented the main character. Apart from a couple of seasoned actors, the rest of the team comprises of very young people. Regardless, they were up to the task and they performed their roles in coordinated concert. I saw the movie at a pre-opening screening. The CGI was impressive and I can only imagine how it may look in the iMAX version. This film is definitely a must see for the sci-fi enthusiasts. Those who are not much interested in the genre would also be entertained. I am looking forward to seeing the iMAX version. I can comfortably recommend this movie. It will not disappoint you.",Ender's Game
266,user-14351,One of the better ones ....,10,17 March 2018,"Watched it again after a year of 3 and still very impressed with the movie.
Starts out like a run of the mill ""youth growing up and saving the world"" 
You see 13 in a dozen of these with vartous themes. Enders Game floats above these. Brilliant special effects and much deeper caracters than the rest. 
Best is the total reverse of the movie after about 75 %. 
It turns into a dark and deep movie with a very very strong message.
Brillaiantly acted, lively caracters, great story and even Mr. Ford didn't look as a derivative of Han Solo.
Should be rated much higher than the IMDB rating and in my opinion a must see !! Highly recommended to all true SciFi fans.",Ender's Game

There are a few scenes that really are breath taking.Visuals aside, I found the storyline kept me interested ( for the most part). I have not read the novel upon which the movie is based but I was able to follow what was going on quite easily.The acting is good, given the youth of some of the performers I was impressed.There is a brief section in the middle that dragged a bit, but not enough to spoil my enjoyment of the movie.Its more than just the brainless shooter that I was afraid it might be.Its not going to change anyone's world view but its an entertaining evening out.Given the quality of the effects it might be worth seeing in IMAX.

268,droog57-704-79517,The Game is Over,2,12 November 2013,"I saw Ender's Game yesterday, and if you have not seen it yet, don't bother. If you know the books, you will hate it, it's the worst movie adaptation of a novel since ""Sum Of All Fears"" and almost (but not quite) as bad as the ""Dune"" movie. If you don't know the books, then you won't know what is going on.Worst case scenario. First, they decided that it would be good if this movie could be more like the Hunger Games or Twilight series, making it into a 50% chick flick, which the original story is definitely NOT. Lots of touchy feely hand wringing going on, particularly at the end, but without almost the entire story line regarding Ender's background or the reasoning and history behind drafting Children into the service, it all comes off as some lame plot line. And Peter has only 1 min of screen time, completely killing off that sub-plot and all of it's implications for the main story.The heavy lifting for the plot is done by narrative, Ender's letters to Valentine, which, while it gets some badly needed explanations across, is a totally weak story telling tool, and very much a cop-out. The Mind Game is also weakly handled, with only a few words of explanation regarding the Formic's influence on Ender through it.At least the special effects were up to current standards, no complaints there, but making this amazing story material into something not much better than Battleship or Pacific Rim, is not something that I would be proud of as a Director.They took a 700 page novel, made a 1hr 45min movie out of it somehow. They were forced to condense the first 600 pages into 3 or 4 spoken sentences of dialog between characters so that major (essential) plot points are at least mentioned (not that they help much). Then they take the last couple of chapters and go into more depth on that material, but by then, you don't care anymore. And if you have not read the book, at that point it will feel like some standard forgettable action flick. They go even further into the abyss by using material from the second novel to blatantly set up a sequel. It all feels so shabby and such a waste.I originally had high hopes for this one, Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley usually don't get involved in much crap, but they must have needed money or something because this one is crap. This will effectively kill Ender's Game for the rest of time, nobody has ever made a second version of a movie from a novel, which is what this would take to make things right. We can only hope that 75% of the movie was cut out in editing, and may be released as a Director's Cut or Extended Edition, but failing major changes in future release versions, the Game is Over.Very sad. Great Book(s)",Ender's Game
269,bobpike,Wtf!!!,1,1 February 2014,"I would give this ""0"" if I could. I had high hopes of this film and after I'd seen it, I thought that I'd been robbed. This film was dire, truly dreadful, it was even worse than Shyalaman's ""After Earth"" and that's saying something! Practically the whole film was taken up by a sullen, pouting little brat and his sulks and temper tantrums, a kind of future version of Justin Bieber. The way all the figures in authority, Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley et al, just indulge the child filled me with the urge to vomit. The whole point of the film, the fight for the survival of the human race, took a back seat to this child. What is the matter with the film industry? Are there no decent directors who can make a good film any more? Most Sci-Fi blockbusters of the last few years have been pure drivel. There have been many good stories written only to be hacked to pieces by very mediocre screen writers, whose end results bears no relation to the original stories.",Ender's Game
270,Hermitage171,not bad. totally worth seeing if you like the book.,7,8 December 2013,"This had some good points, and some bad points.The first few scenes were very promising. The stuff with the monitor.The 'drill sergeant' scenes with Dap are where the movie started to lose me. They were just too much of a cliché, and not very intelligent.The battle room visualization was pretty cool. Kind of beautiful, actually. Not much time was spent on strategy, but that was a little vague in the book also, to be honest.Strangely, Harrison Ford's Hyram Graff seemed like a bit of a weak link. Bad writing and direction, maybe. His speeches seem just a little too speechy and on the nose. He's also present just a little too much in the movie, whereas in the book it's driven home that he's a somewhat aloof top-level administrator, rather than someone whom the boys see around every single day.The relationships among the different Battle School cadets all got pretty garbled, but that's natural when you consider the challenge of condensing all that stuff into one movie.I don't know why they made Bonzo such a little guy. He was supposed to be big and scary in the book -- a lethal threat despite being unarmed.I like what they did with Ender's fantasy computer game. Maybe a plot hole here and there, but they condensed that whole plot line in sort of a neat, creative way.He's in the movie for like five minutes maybe, but Kingsley as Mazer Rackham was a fun bit of casting.The spaceship battle scenes are very pretty! Big payoff there.All in all, I'm not quite sure why this movie did so poorly. I can think of a few points where they could have made the dialogue a little less ridiculous, but I don't know if that's the real problem. The book is popular as heck, so I would have thought that would have driven box office receipts a little more. Obviously the studio made the same bet, and lost. Certainly the special effects were nice, but maybe it fell into a weird no man's land by being not sexy enough for some adult audiences, without being a particularly suitable movie for children, either.Anyway, I'm glad I managed to see it before it left the big screen altogether, which happened sooner than I might have expected.",Ender's Game
271,nilssonbst,"Great graphics, poor and loose storytelling",1,6 March 2016,"This movie... is so dumb.The first part of the movie tells a copy cat story of the ending of Independence Day and then the movie is basically the plot for Independece Day 2 ""50 years later""...Enter our main character. If it wasn't for that his name is in the title I would forget his name. A couple of great actors are in this movie and all their talent is wasted - even Harisson Ford and Abigail Beslin.The main character is such a wet blanket on par with Bella in Twilight. He is supposed to be a cool commander, but he is a skinny dork. Then they spend half the movie playing Space Quidditch, and then they go on to training for battle. This ""Space Quidditch"" has NOTHING to do with the actual job at hand - it is just DUMB.The Aliens they are supposed to fight we know nothing about, and we really never see them or understand what their intentions are. The Aliens in Independence Day are underdeveloped, but still classical. These are just dumber versions of the Arachnids in Starship Troopers.And then there is THE HORRIBLE ENDING!!!!!My God, the ending is SO BAD! All of a sudden the kid has a connection to the poor little aliens that he ends up completely murdering and he wants to make amends. This story relates nothing to anything.This movie is just a bunch of loose ends. It is like watching 6 different stories in the same universe with different main characters.

272,edroberts417,Ender's Game,3,4 November 2013,"Are you ready for this? ""Ender's Game,"" written and directed by Gavin Hood, and based on a 1985 novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card (incidentally, a self-professed and obnoxiously vocal pillar of general intolerance of any person not like himself, and homosexuals especially), is set in a future when humanity comes under attack by an ant-like race of aliens and the solution is to draft a bunch of prepubescent kids (all boys and a single token girl, by the way) to use their gaming skills to command the fleet that will ultimately save nothing less than humanity itself. How's that for a storyline? There's really not much good to say about ""Ender's Game,"" unless you're a 14 year old boy whose greatest fantasy is to live in a video game, and there are, apparently and unfortunately, enough of those out there to make it worth spending hundreds of millions of dollars on an epic piece of crap like Ender's Game."" Your average comic book has better character development and plot.Over the past decade more and more ""blockbusters"" have been little more than CGI porn fests and that has come to be accepted, but Ender's game takes it to a new level (and the CGI isn't even that good) by way of a scene in which the main character actually becomes a character in a video game—as in there is no real life actor, the main character himself being a product of CGI. Talk about turning it up to eleven.Ender Wiggin is played by Asa Butterfield, a particularly wooden young actor who has apparently mastered the ability to make his eyes water at will, a fact of which Director Hood makes great use in a failed attempt to imbue his main character with some semblance of life. Young Wiggin's greatest talent seems to be spouting such insights egarding conflict and enemy management as to humble even Sun Tzu. In between dropping these profound pearls he manages to lead to victory a team of completely interchangeable characters in a type of zero gravity, three dimensional billiards table batle ground A feat which so impresses the commander of ""battle""school, one Colonel Hyrum Graff(Harrison Ford), that Wiggin is given command of the entire fleet. Ford's character is a standard issue military hard ass, yet a noble one, who has sacrificed his own humanity for the greater good, understanding that in war there must be an acceptance of collateral damage not limited to loss of life, but including loss of innocence as well. Sound familiar? Ford tries to play Graff as gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic, but comes off as Harrison Ford trying to play gruff and ruthlessly pragmatic. For some unfathomable reason Ben Kingsley makes an appearance as a Maori warrior complete with facial tattoos and the whole bit. It's hard to know what he needed more, the money or a new agent. If he keeps doing things like this, he just may have his knighthood revoked.",Ender's Game
273,KobeCryant,Wouldn't recommend,5,2 November 2014,"This Film was rather boring and I didn't see no good plot in this, I went to see it in the theater about a year ago and kept falling asleep through it, I could see what the movie makers were trying to do but it was made in a way that wasn't enjoyable or entertaining. Not the worst film and not one of the best it's just in between. In my opinion the movie got boring after about 40 minutes into it because I was hooked on it in the beginning but it just went downfall after awhile into it. Even if they remake it I don't see this Plot or Story going into a Film and become popular among critics. I never read the book but I do see people that read it complaining that it wasn't similar to the Book, but this is just my personal opinion, I know some people find this movie good. I'm just not one of them.",Ender's Game

Not good enough to recommend to a friend who just wants entertainment for 2 hours.I haven't read the book or any other Orson Scott Card works.The movie doesn't waste time in pulling you into the story, but even then it's obvious 2 hours isn't enough to give the story justice. Many subplots/relationships in the story aren't given enough exposure/time to give emotional effect. This makes significant parts of the movie feel weird/rushed. Many questions are unanswered and we're left to assume/suspend our disbelief ourselves to move the story forward. The main plotline is executed well though and the questions/holes in the story apply more to the subplots instead of the main plot, so they did a pretty good job.Asa Butterfield did a very good job as Ender. I hope he doesn't become another casualty of fame because he has a bright future as an actor if he keeps performing like this. Ford, Davis, and Kingsley all also gave good performances. There are some bad performances from the other casts, but nothing so significant they give a lasting bad taste.",Ender's Game
275,legutsa,"Movie and book: Close match, one review",8,9 February 2014,"I found the books --Ender's Game ""EG"" and Shadow ""ES""-- and the movie alluring and interesting. The movies is mainly based on EG, but it also takes a lot from ES. I would rate the books 4/5 and the movie 8/10. It is good and entertaining science fiction. The plot is good. I would suggest reading Ender's Game before watching the film.The movie is well directed, the acting is top-notch, although perhaps the character Bonzo could have been better played by a more believable Latin bully. The special effects are excellent.The books are well written and easy to read. Ender's Game is most about Ender and his thoughts. Ender's Shadow is more factual, describing both alien invasions. The reader quickly becomes immersed in the story. However, there were some issues that could have been better dealt (This is for you Orson):1) It is difficult to believe that six year-old could think and talk like Ender and his colleagues, no matter how bright they are. They simply lack the life experience. 2) In the book (EG), the parallel plot of Ender's brother and sister is an unnecessary distraction, the book would have been a lot better without Peter and Valentine trying to take over the world. An alternative is that Ender in his Earth visit confronts Peter and defeats him, and Valentine joins the academy. 3) Also in the book (EG), the political rivalries on earth are infantile. It is unthinkable that nation-states or political-economic blocks would prevail after a) two alien invasions and near extinction of the human race, and b) be tremendous advance in technology and communications. 4) I liked the ending of the movie better than the wishy-washy ending of the book (EG).None of the other books of the Ender saga, except ES, is at the same level of Ender's game; in fact, none really follows closely and logically the story of EG & ES. I don't think there is going to be a successful movie sequel, unless Scott Card writes one in a linear manner from the movie ending and not allow himself going sideways.Overall good stuff, although I think he needs to rewrite and streamline Ender's Game taking into consideration 3 or 5 future movie sequels.",Ender's Game

277,maxaira,It's all right ... but ...,5,31 January 2014,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this film as the trailer had much in it that would appeal to anyone seeking a film with a lot of CGI effects and action sequences. From this standpoint it was very good and through most of what we see we are not disappointed. From a story point of view, however, it leaves much to be desired. Drama has never been a really strong point with Harrison Ford, though what he did with ""Regarding Henry"" was exceptional. Ford needs actions flicks to really shine. Here there was action but he wasn't a part of it. He played to it and as a result he appeared a weak character. No, the action was all on the part of the young people that were involved and while they were into it, sort of, even here things fell a little flat. Of course the plot centred on Ender and from the moment he was recruited to be a ""warrior"" it seemed as if he knew what he was and was to be about. We were never, until moments from the end, given to understand that he merely looked at the whole of his role as a mere ""game"" though the title should have told us otherwise. Yet when the end rolled around, and that happened far too fast, suddenly we see a young man filled with seeming righteous indignation that he should have been used to wipe out an entire ""species"" of life. Yet this is precisely why he was recruited in the first place. Why did he feel this way? We have no idea but suddenly he's off into the nether reaches of space as a peace ambassador. And why? I doubt we'll ever know.",Ender's Game
278,wolfeE-leet,"An attempt, but falls flat",3,19 March 2014,"Warning, Spoilers ahead! I remember being bought Ender's Game (the book) when I was around 12 years old in the early 2000s. I thoroughly enjoyed it although it isn't really my ""preferred"" style of sci-fi I thought the book was slightly above average.I remember the bulk of the book is Ender at battle school. It's interesting to note that Napoleon Bonaparte was an outcast while in the revered French Military Academy, and earned peoples respect by being the best. The same is true for Ender in the book. In the book, Bean becomes Ender's sort of second in command go-to guy. Think of Commander William T Riker and Jean-Luc Picard, they work great together and share a deep connection and understanding, but you wouldn't quite call it ""Friends"".While barely following the book, the feature film Ender's Game reminded me that even the book is meant for someone in their teens. The whole premise is simply impractical.Young children go through an intense psychological and mental test, and if they are found to possess aptitude for military leadership they are in essence forced from their parents and sent to training centers to become super-generals.Except for one factor: This movie made me realize all the older, adult commanders during Ender's Game are complete buffoons.At the end when Ender surrounds the Laser Weapon (I refuse to call it by its ridiculous name ""Little Doctor"", a painfully obvious throwback to ""Fat Man"") with drone ships in order to pierce through and destroy the homeworld, I just lost all hope for the movie.I have no experience with military command whatsoever, but have read The Art of War, studied Alexander the Greats campaigns, Napoleon's Campaigns, Hannibal Barca's campaigns, the US Revolutionary War Strategy and countless other prime examples of excellence in military leadership. It is simply so irreversibly impractical to think nobody at the top brass of the military leadership of ALL OF HUMANS didn't think to use the Laser Weapon on the homeworld. Someone, at some meeting, would have suggested it and devised a plan to make it happen. Using the drones as a shield is not surprising or a revolutionary idea.Given the same resources and weeks to ponder on it, I'm sure I could have come up with the same thing.Don't even get me started on the other unbelievable parts.. such as: -How was Ender able to leave a top secret military installation right next to the Alien homeworld without encountering any guards, resistance or even spotted by security camera? -After taking the queen egg, by that time base authorities would have noticed Petra and questioned her. She would have told them Ender ran off. How did Ender sneak the Egg into the base without being searched or even questioned? -Ender blasts off into space to find a new home planet. He leaves in a small shuttlecraft. How will he survive? I guess in 50 years humanity went from fighter jets to galaxy-faring shuttles traveling at light speed free from the need of fuel.Besides the command staff at the end behind the glass, the military installations of the future are surprisingly bare. I could have sworn I thought throughout most of the movie that the entire military of earth's leadership was Harrison Ford & Big Black Guy.Anyways I'm just ranting now. Movie barely follows the book except for the main plot twist. Book or not the whole premise of the movie is made for the naive person or the very young. I consider myself a realist so when presented with something so unreal I find hard to enjoy it as entertainment.",Ender's Game

I hope there is a sequel!!The action sequences were fantastic, the special effects were mind blowing.However the back story of Enders relationship with his brother was glossed over too quickly.

281,pyrolaptop,My thoughts of how the film was,8,14 March 2014,"WARNING AGAIN: !Spoilers!Since I like action packed science-fiction films I like the film. But it really only depends on the viewer. I prefer to watch films than read the books, so I can't really compare story in the book with the film.This film is a bit immoral by using teenagers to decide what happens in war. But isn't that really what the present day is like. Since most the games teenagers play are action packed. Such as call of duty and battlefield. If aliens were to invade, would the government use teenagers and say it is a game. Although that would be a good way but if you tell them it will probably cause them to go mental. Now the overall quality of the film is good. However the scene where the camera goes past ender when he is looking out of the window. The window didn't blend in that well with the CGI.In the evaluation game. Since the viewer was told at the same time as the teenagers. The impact was more intense. I was surprised that at first they were happy that they killed them but still they thought it was a game. When the connection gets restored, the characters were staring at the screen which again adds more impact. To be honest I felt like I was gonna cry when they said it wasn't a game.How the film finished where he found the alien on the planet was abit strange, since wouldn't the people that are at the base check the surrounding buildings. When the alien touched enders face with its nail, i thought that the the screen would show how the alien lives and show its children. This would of given more of an impact. The last scene when ender takes a ship and has the alien egg with him. I was thinking isn't he gonna run out of food? Is the egg gonna hatch and eat him? I would like there to be another film but it might just be him on a planet and building a place for the aliens. His crew could come but the aliens might think that is a attack. Then again they could make a mini- TV series instead, ender and the alien is on a planet, using a gadget from the ship to create a building, then his old crew come and visit with supplies and building materials. It could be about 2 years in the future.",Ender's Game

Performance of Asa Butterfield is incredible and what's more is that the scenario is perfectly adapted, I think.

283,wagneryael,Go. Not a reproduction of the book.,8,2 November 2013,"Rating a book-based movie is always tinted with one's feelings about the book. In my case, reading the first nine books indicates my bias. And yet, leaving the movie theatre, I wasn't disappointed, didn't feel misled or cheated. The essence of the story, the challenges Ender faces, are all there. If anything, moral dilemmas that are only hovered above in the book are in the forefront in the movie, easily triggering a good post movie moral discussion. It's a solid 8 movie, maybe 8.5. Why not more? I have a nagging suspicion that unless you read the book prior to the movie, Ender, Bernard, even Peter and Valentine's characters are flat, not really given an opportunity to show who they are. In Bernard's case, his character is practically rewritten, and it feels as if it was prompted by ""let's send an optimistic message about bullies."" I don't like it. This feeling was reinforced by the complete omission of the character of Rose the Nose, maybe for fear of an anti-Semitism/racism cry. With more than enough voices calling to boycott the movie as a protest against Orson Scott Card's views, this may have been a reasonable decision. For me, however, there was no chance for a boycott. I love the cast, truly. Viola Davis delivers a strong character I can only admire, respect, and wish her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Trying to compare the interaction between Hugo and Georges Méliès to the one between Ender and Mazer Rackham led me to nothing. Wonder if there is any interview in which they talk about it. As for Asa Butterfield, this is his third movie that leaves me impressed beyond praises, the other two being Hugo and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. Asa's delivery of Ender's character is, coming to think about it, better than the literal Ender. And I don't think I ever felt this way about any other character. With as many appearances as he has, it is surprising that his only win was the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for youth in film. Maybe it's time it changed. GO!!!",Ender's Game

This movie had done well, but there were some mistakes that should have been solved before the movie production started such as the age of actors/characters and more character development from everyone else, not just Ender.This movie just does only 1/5 of the books. it would have been much better if it was a serie that followed the books to the end. Two hours was not enough and did not do it justice. But still a good movie if disappointing after the end.",Ender's Game

290,markc14,Nearly 25 Years in the Making: A Remarkably Different Sci-Fi Film,8,30 October 2013,"Saw this at a preview screening last night and enjoyed it tremendously. Unlike viewers who had already read the novel by the same name after its release almost 25 years ago, I saw the film without any preconceived notions. Taken on its own terms, this is a well crafted movie that superficially appears to be a remake of The Last Starfighter, but is MUCH more complex. The U.S. Army recommends its officers read the novel as a treatise on leadership and morality in war. I encourage viewers to be patient while we are walked through the obligatory training sequences of fresh-faced recruits. There are encounters with nasty young officers, tough NCOs, and progressively more difficult tactical challenges. Of course Ender Wiggins rises to the top through mentorship by his commander, played by Harrison Ford. The twist here is that these recruits are so young. There is a pivotal exchange between Ender and his commander about the ends justifying the means and how our conduct while waging war is a reflection of society itself. We are clearly being asked to look beyond the rhetoric about the frighteningly powerful, ""evil,"" inhuman enemy and think about the millions of children pressed into service in present day earthly conflicts. The director has done a fine job of breathing life into this multilayered story. It moves quickly and all its actors give fine performances - although I was shocked to see that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was given so little to do. Even so, his subtle performance and perfect New Zealand accent were a standout. This isn't an effects driven movie, but there are lots of explosions, cool technology and brilliant visuals for those seeking such things. I saw the film in IMAX format and thought it was a distraction rather than being immersive. Seeing it in a regular theater is likely to be a more rewarding experience. The movie's climactic battle scene is breathtaking - not only for its ferocity but as the foundation for a surprise ending that literally changes the entire context of the film up to that point. The author of Ender's Game stubbornly resisted previous attempts to translate his book to film. He co-authored the screenplay and produced this fine project. There were several other novels in this series and I hope we can look forward to equally excellent sequels. Highly recommended as a thinking man's alternative to big budget blow-em up Hollywood blockbusters.",Ender's Game

292,amamka,Demonstrative example of American anti-intellectualism,1,15 February 2014,I was expecting a lot from this movie which definitely have disappointed me and most of sci-fi lovers. It makes an impression that scenario was written by Susan Collins or Stephenie Meyer. Such authors as Arthur Clarke or Lois Bujold most probably was horrified by this movie as demonstrative example of tendencies that incipient in Hollywood sci-fi screenings. If culmination of film can be perceived a little bit seriously then first part (Ender's preparation) shows worst samples of predictability weaving with illogicality and absurd reflections of characters. Simply put manner of narration is more suitable for fairy tale than to sci-fi with psychological component as it positioned. Can hardly believe that this boring story can be interested even to children who older then 10 years.,Ender's Game
293,blockypotatoes,Needed a Sequel,7,3 May 2019,"I personally thought the movie was a bit slow. The acting was wonderful and believable, and the storyline was very enticing and didn't disappoint. But, the ending seemed like it was pointing to a possible sequel.

Then narrow selection of the smartest kids turns to group of very stupid people again. If this is the best we should have in the future than it is better for those creatures to win ;-)It is out of any battlefield experience that unskilled young is given so much power without any controls. There is no government, no people representatives, only one officer with some unstable psychologist and groups of teenagers who train to shoot at each other in no gravity field but they are fighting the aliens with drones...I didn't understand the last pictures after the fight - that the best boy the humanity has is going to cry after the match because he killed all enemies?

295,hyperspaced,Underrated movie,7,10 March 2014,"It's one of those movies some people love it and some people hate it. Apart from the excellent visual effects and the decent sound engineering, this blockbuster movie actually has a story: aliens attack Earth, humans prepare to fight back. And by humans meaning 12 year-olds. Although I do not subscribe to the notion of children being used as instruments of war, in reality this happens on a wide scale. Be it children who are behind the gun or in front of it. So that shouldn't cause any 'morality-crises' to any self-aware individual. As it appears, in the future (where the movie takes place) things haven't changed much on this aspect.I liked Asa's performance. He's a kid and he managed to pull through a difficult role. Harrison Ford's role on the other hand was quite one- dimensional. That's a clear waste of talent.I would have liked the movie to develop more the weak/human side of the protagonist, to let us understand that he's a kid after all who is asked to become a hero in a few days. It would be also nice to have an introduction on the situation of future Earth and the alien home planet. And most importantly: why diplomacy failed in the first place.Anyway, I think it's a decent movie that pulls you in the more you watch it. 7.5 / 10",Ender's Game

I even enjoy (as stupid as it may be) the Resident Evil franchise. But this film had me falling asleep. I have been having issues with being able to fall asleep for WEEKS, but I may have found the cure! This film takes you on a journey of boredom and self-hate (because you spent any sort of money to see it). Do I know the ending? Nope, never got that far. Now, granted, I watched two other movies tonight. I saw American Hustle and Saving Mr. Banks....then I saw Ender's Game. Honestly, I should have stopped at the first two...they were great. There was absolutely nothing memorable about Ender's game. Thankfully, the author of the book is a douche bag, homophobic that instigated a boycott of the film AND the film sucked on levels that even HOOVER envies, so there shall not be a sequel that is thrust upon the unintelligent public.

Excellent special affects and the story carries itself well, it went by very quickly. My oldest now 16 read the book last year and was completely enthralled by the twist in the final battle scene. He read parts of the book to me and I loved it, we could not wait for the movie release. There are so many lessons for adolescents to pick up from this movie, how life can be difficult, how there are individuals that may want to lead and impose their will on you even though you may be more talented and capable and how they will try to shut you down, but you must shine through and believe in yourself. The strength in friends, in team work, in recognizing others accomplishments and abilities and not just your own. The strength of a leader to recognize the talent and strength of even those that initially opposed them and tried to humiliate them, but latter gained their respect, gain someone's respect, but don't be like them and turn and try to demoralize them as they did you, be the better man. Understand the horrors and sometimes necessity of war, but the importance to first try to establish peace through communication.

300,saieash,Don't watch for people who have read the book,1,3 July 2014,"I have read the book and absolutely loved it. This movie is the exact opposite - and I strongly believe it will be the same for anyone else who has read the book. Even if you haven't read the book, you probably won't like it anyway. There was just way too many plot points that were cut out, rearranged, raced through and mashed together to make it fit into a movie length. In my opinion, they would need at least 2 movies to cover the book properly - and I think that is the main problem here. The film felt like they only read every 10th page of the book and then occasionally they would skip a chapter or two. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has read the books and is a major disappointment. I know I am comparing heavily to the book, but I think most people watching this film would have read the book. If you are one of the few who haven't, I recommend you don't watch this - the book is on another completely different level and you time and money is better spent reading the book.",Ender's Game
301,relativitydrive,A book-to-film success. Expect nothing and get the book!,10,28 October 2013,"So, if you've read other reviews and thought this will just be someone who's read the book trying to dissuade you from their opinions, it is not so.Yes, I have read the book. Yes, this is a story aimed at children but it was modified after its initial success to be more adult. If you have time the whole 4 books are a rather superb tetralogy and stand as the best-of-the-best of Sci-Fi.As a film of a book you have to understand the truth of it: you can't put all of a book in a film unless you have 8hrs or more. Who would possibly want 8hr films?So, almost all of the meaning and feeling of the book gets to the film. The adult-ish version of the story drives the film and leaves it where the book left it - ready for further exploration of the central point (I'm not going to spoil it) of the film and more.I accepted the child actors without trouble unlike, for example, the appalling Harry Potter characterisations. The rest of the cast came over well and nobody drove it from a 'famous' perspective leaving the film to again stand on its own as about the story. All the details you need to understand clearly what was going on were there and done so with the same subtlety as the original.The CGI was good, clear and didn't take over. It was used to propel the story and add to it.Overall I couldn't fault the work. I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to further attempts at the following books which will be entirely adult in story and emotion.Don't expect more than it can give you or be prejudiced by reviews and you'll hopefully see what I did in it: a story about our world, the politics of real life, a SciFi fantasy and some emotional discovery.",Ender's Game
302,antcasq,"The book, the movie and a video game",7,12 November 2013,"When I watched the Ender's Game trailer for the 1st time browsing the IMDb and I though: Here's a Sci Fi movie that I will probably see. My life went on and a few months later I saw the trailer again mentioned in a space video game called Skyjacker (Skyjacker - Starship Constructor update 20 in August). I got curious enough and decided to read the book first and watch the movie in November. Then I discover that there wasn't only one book, but a bunch of them. The Ender's Game saga!I'm a bit lazy when it comes to reading, so I decided to listen to the audio books instead :) I got lucky, since from the author's point of view this is the ideal medium for enjoying the story. The author also had some concerns about making a movie since:1- In the book the narrator is inside the character head. Making a movie with 3rd person speaking the thought of another one all the time would not work very well for the viewer.2- The kids must be very young about 6 to 12 years old and it's very hard to find outstanding actor at that age that can give the required dramatic performance.3- There should not be a love story and Hollywood tends to take advantage of the teenager feelings to do thatI was skeptical about the movie and unfortunately I was right. However they were able to do somethings right:Amazing special effects;Amazing final battle;Cut the Locke and Demosthenes characters from the movie, since it was impossible to develop them in a 2 hours movie, along side the main story;Give a plausible explanation about the bugger motive to attack Earth;Create some doubt about the bugger intentions.What's wrong with the movie then?Almost everything happens too fast in the Battle School;-- The training should take years, not days-- Ender's ascension to power is not credible. He fought too few battles to be promoted to commanderBonzo supposed to be BIG!Bean supposed to be tinyThey should have taken special attention to the cast. If the Bonzo character supposed to be funny, I assure you that none of the Ender's Game books fan laugh when saw him!The movie should have been split into two parts, in order to develop the Ender Wiggin personality and make is ascension on the Battle School credible. Also since they had Bean from the beginning why not develop him too? With a 2 parts movie everybody would have won. The producer would sell 2 movies for the price of producing 1. After the 1st movie the book would sell as hell and people would still be interested to see the 2nd part of the movie.Last, but not least, I must say that Human fleet looks good, although compared to the Skyjacker video game fleet it just feels shortTaking all into account I gave this movie a generous 7, when it had the potential to be a 9 or 10, if the had done it right!",Ender's Game
303,timothyisathome,premise was great,5,25 February 2014,"the cinematography was great, special effects were quite seamless for most of the movie and some of the acting is very good. Asa Butterfield was quite captivating in his lead role and Hailee Steinfeld was perfect in hers, but Harrison Ford was about as subtle as a kick in the groin. it kind of ruined the movie for me.most people wont even think about Ford's role in running this film off mark, but as a filmoholic I cant get past his giving the story away so early because of his inability to nuance this characters part in the red thread of the movie.other than that it was a great watch and a movie I enjoyed. just think it could have been better if the lead role didn't give the whole read thread of the movie twist away so early in the movie.Sir Ben Kingsley had an odd role which I also found a little odd, but at least he stayed within his character and thus didn't distract from the entirety of the production.all of the younger players made this a great movie. I'd suggest for scifi peeps to give this movie a once through.",Ender's Game
304,Scene13,What A Relief!,8,11 November 2013,"I have been a fan of the Ender's Game (and the rest of the Ender Saga) for over 10 years. So I was extremely nervous about the release of this film. Enders game is a story focused around characters, this is put first over action, I was concerned that Hollywood would destroy the essence of the novel and of ""Ender"" for a quick action packed space film aimed at kids. I was wrong to be concerned this was a great adaptation. It stayed true to the novel and kept all of the major plot points and themes. Firstly, Enders Game the film is not just for book fans. I took my partner who hasn't read the book and she told me ""it was good and understandable"" and she didn't feel that she was missing any details due to the fact she hadn't read the books. So like a good book adaption it works well as a standalone edition of the story. Secondly, I hope you can forgive me for referring to the book occasionally throughout this review. In addition please don't interpret my comments as a ""whinging Fanboy"" upset about how the film changed things in the book. I fully understand that a film adaption is exactly that, an adaption, and parts must be adapted to work on the big screen. In fact, I felt they could have pushed the boundaries further and made more dramatic changes.Likes:1) Visual Effects - The visual effects throughout Enders Game were fantastic. (Spoiler) The Formics, the space crafts, the Battle Room and the Command School and the war scenarios looked awesome. (End Spoiler).2) Brutality - If you needed any convincing that Enders Game was not a kids film (which it is not), then I think the sheer brutality shown by Ender in the opening scenes will convince you. Enders Game is a film about kids but it isn't a kid's film. I was really happy that they kept this (and another) brutal scene in the movie because these are key moments that develop Ender and provide his major internal conflicts. 3) Battle Room –The Battle Room in this movie was true to the book and looked realistic and very visually impressive. It was great to see it on the big screen.4) Plot – On the whole the plot was great. It was fast paced, exciting and full of action but also the more important emotional/character development scenes as well. Ender's Game provides a good middle ground between a movie focused on action and a movie focused on the characters story. 5) Acting - I was really torn with the acting in this film. I thought Asa Butterfield (Ender), Harrison Ford (Graff), Ben Kingsley (Rackham), Viola Davis (Anderson) and Moises Arias (Bonzo) were brilliant and had strong performances, but I found myself indifferent towards the others. To name and shame, I especially thought this was true of Aramis Knight (BEAN), who I found to be very unbelievable.6) Dap and Anderson – Those who have read the book will instantly notice that Dap and Anderson are portrayed completely different in the film. This was an adaption I really liked. It was great. It added a new dimension to the characters and even lightened the mood of the film..7) Valentine and Peter – In the book, Ender maybe the focus of the main plot, but there is a subplot focused around Peter and Valentine on Earth. This would have taken the focus away from the main plot, adding confusion and length, I am therefore glad to see this was omitted in the film adaption.Dislikes:1) Bean and Alai – Bean and Alai have very little screen time. Both characters seemed two dimensional and their conversations with Ender seemed strange because of this. For example (SPOILER) When Ender is promoted, Alai who we have seen little of so far in the film, comes out and shares a special word with Ender ""Salaam"", in the film this affection seems misplaced and strange, in the novel Ender and Alai have a ""special"" relationship, it is almost homo-erotic and this is why this scene is so crucial, I didn't feel this came across in the film. In the film Bean strengths as characters don't come through he, like Alai, is two dimensional the fact he appears earlier than in the book weakens Ender and Alais relationship. (SPOILER END) I therefore feel it would have been better if they had swapped Alai for Bean allowing for a single more dimensional character rather than bringing Bean in earlier and splitting Enders time between them both.2) Plot Speed - At times it felt like Enders Game, the Highlights. (SPOILER) I would have loved to have seen more battles in the battle room, at least a montage of battles being won, it almost felt like Ender won one battle in charge of Dragon Army and that was it off to command school. (SPOILER END)3) Enders Breaking Bonzo's Rule - (SPOILER) In the book this is a defining moment when Ender creates a new attacking strategy and on his own decimates the opposing army, showing his strategic genius. The book changes this completely making Ender disobey Bonzo for emotional reasons and then allowing Petra to tells Ender what tactics to use to decimate the opposing army which makes it seem like Petra is in fact Earths last chance. (SPOILER END)To conclude, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was great seeing my favourite book on the big screen. I can truly say that this is probably as good a film as they could've made without extending the screen time.",Ender's Game
305,zeusandtomshow,"Great movie, but...",8,16 November 2013,"OK...I must preface this with simply saying that I am a huge fan of the book. That being said, this movie was not produced for me. It was produced for those who have not read the book. This is not necessarily a bad thing. It was an extremely well done movie and will most certainly gain new readers of what I consider one the best books I have ever read. It hit on many of the major concepts that were in the book, but left out others that were part of why I loved it so much. I do not want to spoil this movie, so I will not get into what those things were. I will simply say that true fans of the book will notice them rather quickly. The things that it does stay true to are extraordinary and took my breath away, like the battle room scenes, which were truly inspired and a treat to look at. I also liked getting a look at the ""buggers"" for the first time. The acting was spot on. Get used to Asa Butterfield. He is going to be around for a very long time. I would not be surprised if he gets an Oscar nod. He captured Ender exquisitely. Harrison Fords Graff was better than I had hoped for. I had always pictured Michael Ironside or Robert Duvall in the role, when I was reading it. The cinematography was a real treat and did not disappoint in any way. I strongly recommend this movie for fans of the series, but I feel like people who didn't read it might actually enjoy it more. Again, Great movie, but...Please listen to ""The Zeus and Tom Show"" for a deeper look into this movie as well as our other reviews and inane banter. You can find us on Facebook and I-tunes as well.

306,littlebearyeah,Blah Blah Blah,3,10 December 2013,"Hmph. If I said this move was dull it would be a complete understatement. It was nearly as bad as Battlefield Earth and that was pretty dreadful (mind you, the book of Battlefield Earth is great). Luckily I went on half price day at the local cinema.Anyway, I'm a Sci-fi movie veteran and sadly Enders Game will be shuffled to the back of my list of memorable Sci-Fi movies. Not right at the back but very close. It reminded me of 1984 movie 'The Last Starfighter' that as I recall was much more entertaining. Now, I'll be the first to admit that I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford. But why he's in this move I have no idea. What a waste of his talent. He is rumoured for Star Wars 7 and if so, I hope they make him less grumpy in that. I can only liken to his scripted portrayal of recruiting Officer Colonel Graff to Victor Meldrew.in space (if you don't know who that is then look it up). Yet again we see Enders Game relying on the recent and now predictable familiar Hollywood sci-fi movie making format. Basically same ol' same ol' story and loads of special effects. What's worse, nothing new appears to be on the horizon that will mix true science fiction story with today's 1st rate special effects. It appears only The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has really delivered there. Then again that's mythology but then againit's a great story! Saying thatThe Hobbit in 3 movies? I don't think so.Honestly readers, there are hundreds of fabulous Sci-Fi books written by fabulous authors dating right back to at least the 50's. If some of these were sensitively made, they would be so much more entertaining than the dull Enders Game.Conclusion:Some books should remain books forever and never make it to the silver screen. I'm afraid that Enders Game is one of them.",Ender's Game
307,andymharris,Terrible adaptation of the book,3,20 January 2014,"I'm a big fan of the book and I know it is often disappointing when they turn great books into terrible movies (thinking of I am Legend as another example) but come on!! It is clear that the person who wrote the screen play for this has either never read the book or has totally failed to understand the key points of it. It has a real bubblegum feel to it.The story is only true to the book at a superficial level. They made some very strange casting choices. Couple of examples, Firstly, Ender is supposed to start off being a little boy (age 6) and end up age 12/13 at the end. They clearly decided to drop the idea that Ender stays at the battle school for a long time. Secondly, Bonzo Madrid is depicted as this sniveling runt with clear ""small man's syndrome""! He is a foot shorter than Ender and that is quite comical. Following the book, it should be the other way around and this an important plot point to the psychology between the ""boys"" (a sort of Lord of the Flies situation). I could go on!Why are the ""aliens"" not called ""The Buggers"" as they are in the book? Would ""bugger"" offend the yanks or something?? It is a slang derogatory derivation of ""bug"" as the aliens are insect/ant like creatures. Then there is Command School and that it is near the Bugger's home world????? When I saw that I thought ""ok, they have decided to drop the Ansible device"" but no, it is still mentioned so the change to this planet makes no sense. Incidentally the Command School is on Eros (huge asteroid in our solar system) in the book.The M.D. device has also been completely misrepresented from it's description in the book but by that time I had lost most of my energy to be disappointed further and had left the ""anger"" phase of my ""grief"" and reached the ""acceptance"" phase. Acceptance that it wasn't going to get any better!I could rant on for hours but basically you get the idea. If you are a fan of the book(s) then you will likely hate this movie.",Ender's Game
308,dfrohlich-913-885160,It could of been better.,5,2 February 2014,"I love Sci-Fi films because it allows the writers and film makers creative juices to over flow. But with this film I was disappointed, not having read the book I take it from others who have commented that the film has not done it any favours? You have seen this film before with the gruff sergeant major giving the new trainees a hard time, the trainees jogging and chanting together etc etc, the sergeant major who will not salute the raw recruit, but the raw recruit comes through and makes it to become a officer the then said sergeant salutes the new officer, (you can almost hear the American national anthem in the background) Oh pleaseeeeeeeee.Then you have this advanced alien race who look like ants? how they have managed to become advanced and build space craft etc is baffling.Any way the basics is that the human race's chances to survive come down to the teenager with anger management issues wiping out another race of creatures, does it matter if it was a simulation or otherwise? there's obviously a deep thinking issue here.I was surprised to see Mr Ford in this film, I can only assume that job offers were thin on the ground when he was asked to star in this film, I think that this could of been a much better film, it's certainly not the worst I've seen but there are better sci-fi films out there.",Ender's Game
309,nyk2000my,It is NOT Gravity,7,11 November 2013,"Here's a few things I will say about this one.1. It is not Gravity. Which meant, it's probably not FILM OF THE YEAR, National Film Registry (Hollywood Hall of Fame) future inductee materials, it is not LIFE OF PI (inspirational EPIC), also Ender's Game didn't have the luxury to have Tarantino to direct the show (so NOT a cool type movie), it will not blow yr mind or inspire you to change yr life etc, but...2. It is a solid sci-fi thriller, well done, good acting, OKish special effect (again, gentle reminder, NOT GRAVITY), lack of depth in story, a long winded like Peter Jackson would probably produce a more detail and added more EPICness into this great material. Personally, kind of feel like it was too rush, probably a longer director cut will do the film more justice. Well, it work for THE ABYSS, not sure bout this one.3. DO NOT READ ANY SPOILER / WIKIPEDIA PAGE about the story line. Pls don't do it, I regretted this a lot, take away an important plot twist which kind of ruined the fun at the end.4. Why Ben Kingsley has an Oscar while Ford has none, well watch this film and you will know why. Old BEN has like a 5 minutes cameo and yet stole every scene possible. Butterfield kid was good, not Harley Joel Osment's Six Sense good, just quite good. The rest kind of fall flat. This is a waste to a list of talented cast, due to the rushness. A 180 minutes run time would probably better to showcase this wonderful scifi tale. Just IMO, didn't ask you to like it.5. Get to know that the director (Hood) from South Africa too. Kind of worry he will shake his camera like his fellow country men did in Elysium, luckily he didn't, which was good. It can be quite violent at time, not for kid, especially when children saw what Ender did to his foe. Take this as a warning.Thanks for reading, enjoy the film.",Ender's Game
310,alexander-khalkho,Ender of my faith in sci-fi movies,3,7 November 2013,"I like Sci-Fi movies. I like the explosions, action, vehicles, environments etc. I get really hyped up when I see a good trailer for a movie especially with good veteran actors. In this case Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley. The trailer for Ender's Game had all the elements I like. And a kid in middle of all, seemed like a good concept. I am also not a good reader. I wait for Hollywood to make good movies from books so I don't have to read them. I did that with Harry Potter, currently doing with Hunger Games. So I had no idea what the story was going to be, neither the trailer gave much. So, why did I gave this movie 3 rating only? Because, When I went to see this movie blank headed and found out that the movie is just an extension of the trailer. There is no extra explosion, action, etc. Nothing extra that could excite me. The movie turned out to be like one of M. Night Shyamalan, trying to have a big twist in the end. That could have worked also but the climax was also expected. every body in the hall had guessed it, and joking about the poor boy.Moral: Never go by the trailer. Listen to your friend who is a big movie buff than you are. And the most Important of all, Read books.",Ender's Game

Overall fantastic Visuals, Acting, Music and directing! Very entertaining! If you are a sci-fi fan and have not read the book...I highly recommend this movie! There is a wonderful message in the story of this whole film...see if you can find it! Even though the concept of this story has been told, (Aliens attack and kill humans) the concept of what is used to lead the war has not been used to my knowledge. Harrison Ford delivers, Ben Kingsley drives it, Asa Butterfield, brings it home! If I do read the book, to me it's just another version of the story and wont spoil the main concept.",Ender's Game
312,jakelawvideo,A Movie Worth Watching Again and Again,9,6 November 2013,"I am not sure how I want to phrase this review because some of the things I find as flaws are also some of the best parts of the movie. For example, the fact that they had to shorten it so greatly! This 350 page wonder of a book could have turned out a 10 hour movie easily! So I guess the two and a half hour movie we got was satisfactory. Speaking of relation to the book. It was VERY specific. While It didn't follow the book entirely (as no movie ever should) it displayed and gave us every key component to the story we needed....until the end. The end would have easily put another hour on the film alone so I see why they would take it out. Even though I found that all the most important events were in the film. I feel like it missed just one, the relationship building between the characters. Almost all of them were whisked into his life and back out almost immediately. Enough that if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have remembered their names very well at all. And I especially missed Valentine's and Peter's story as they were without ended on earth. But their story could be almost a whole movie on its own... The relationships between Bean, Alia, and Petra were very missed. Because near the end they would do anything for their commander and we are not quite sure why. But that kind of character development would take hours and hours more on the film so I can completely understand why they would want to cut it short. All I all, this movie was one of the best movies based on a book I have ever seen. It is a great movie for those who have read and haven't read the book!!! I can tell that a LOT of money was spent on this movie and I hope they intend to make the second one. But I am worried that they might have missed some key components from the second book which I haven't read yet.I wanted to talk about technical aspects but time is cut short and the story is worth it.

313,b1038752,A rushed sound-bite movie - a disappointment,5,27 October 2013,"I have no problem with movies based on books if they are done well.For me, doing them badly involves quoting a couple of pages near verbatim then tearing out and ignoring the next twenty. In my view, this is what has been done in adapting Ender's Game, the remnants have been stacked together as a bunch of sound-bites and run at fast forward speed, leaving no time for character progression and the growth of friendships that is the mainstay to the original story.It may be that, like Philip Pullman's Dark Materials Trilogy, this was an unmakeable film so we should perhaps thank them for their brave effort that didn't quite make it.In failing, the film is a testament to the writing of Card that he could cram so much story into just 350 paperback pages that it couldn't been captured in 2 hours on the screen.And finally, Ben Kingsley's performance, what a shocker! Think we'll see more of Asa Butterfield though.",Ender's Game

I've read the book and seen the movie, and enjoyed both. The story wasn't too convoluted, and the performances were great. Ben Kingsley was awesome as always, Asa Butterfield was a surprisingly good child actor, and Harrison Ford was a stern but entertaining military leader. The special effects were marvelous and the movie looked beautiful. On the downside, this movie starts off very slow, and doesn't pick up pace until close to the end. The ending is also slightly convoluted. Overall, this movie is enjoyable and I recommend for fans of Orson Scott Card and general Science Fiction fans.",Ender's Game
315,shark-jaw-1989,An okay movie - From a sci-fiction fan who read the whole ender's series,8,8 March 2014,"You know what? Ppl will nvr be satisfied for movies that are casted based on a famous novel/game etc. The thing is that for a movie that lasts for only 2 hours, of course it can only deliver 5% of the book. You want a movie that follows the book exactly, it takes, idk, maybe 60 hours. It's just impossible.Still, unlike some ppl who like to complain, I'm quite delighted that the most of the key scenes are covered in the movie, altho many details are neglected. But again, some details can only be delivered by words, especially thoughts of the characters. Still, the movie realized some of the imaginations when I read the book about 11 years ago successfully, and for that I am truly grateful.For fans of Ender's series, remember, if you don't expect anything, you will nvr be disappointed. If you expect that movie covers everything in the book, maybe you should pick up the dusted book from the bookshelf and read it again.",Ender's Game
316,sifter42,Really Well Done!,9,1 November 2013,"If I sound critical at all, please note that I did really like the movie. My issues with it are more ""nitpicky"" - looking for small things to improve when the overall movie was well done. Off the top I'll give it a 9/10. No spoilers here, no worries about that! ;) For the sake of context, I went to see the movie with a group of 5 friends, 2 of which had not read the book.The visuals and action were spectacular. The book was published back in 1985, so they also made some needed ""upgrades"" to the technology shown in the movie. They did a really good job of re-imagining how everything would function, and making it easier for a person to follow visually. The acting was really well done as well. From what I understand they did have to make the younger characters older in the movie vs. the book. This was apparently done so that the actors were more mature and able to handle the script and the events that happen during the movie storyline. The ""age change"" didn't take anything away from the movie experience though. Since the movie didn't change the overall plot, the storyline itself was as great as I remembered it was (in the book).In the movie, they obviously left out a lot of the details from the book. Even with the movie being over 2 hours long, to me it still felt rushed. According to the two people who hadn't read the books, they didn't feel that way at all. I'm guessing it felt rushed to me simply because they had to incorporate such a large number of events into the movie for the sake of viewing time. Some of my favorite parts in the book were left out, but all in all it seemed like the major plot points carried through loud and clear. The movie basically goes from step to step so quickly that the ""action"" so to speak never really stops. Most of the slower parts of the book were sped up quite a bit (which makes sense of course).The character development was also very very summarized. You don't learn nearly as much about the characters in the movie. For example, some of the characters like Bean have such a good back story and viewpoint that the author went back years later and re-wrote the entire time frame from Bean's perspective (in a new completely separate book). A lot of the friendships between the kids are missed too. The movie focuses heavily on Ender's relationship with one character, and the really important friendships with two of the other main characters are minimalized. Again, I totally understand that they had to limit how much time is spent on character relationships within a 2 hour movie.There were a few script changes between the movie and the book, but nothing major. There was no huge difference to get upset about, and all in all I think they covered their bases well. This makes sense since the book's author also co-produced the movie. I did notice a few things were made ""nicer"" in the movie vs. the books, but with movie ratings and intended audience nowadays - it made sense to me. I won't go into any specifics on the changes between the book and the movie here, simply to avoid spoiling the movie (or book) for anyone. Just rest assured that the movie in no way ""ruins"" the original plot or purpose compared to the book.My only two ""big"" negatives about the movie were the timeline and the characters. For the timeline, I mean to say that it felt like they could have made 3 separate movies instead of just 1. I'm guessing if they had more optimistic expectations of how well the movie would do in the box office - we would had a trilogy instead. I'm not saying I wasn't happy with the movie... I'm just saying that they could have done a more complete job of it if they had 4 more hours to do it with. ;) Hypothetically if they *had* made this book into a movie trilogy, you had better believe that I'd be at opening night for every one of them! As for the character issues, again that was more of a ""we only have 2 hours for this movie"" kind of thing. There could have been a ton more character development; if only they had the time to do it. The other big issue is that a movie can't really convey what a character is thinking (aside form cheesy voice overs in some other movies). An overwhelming majority of the book takes place within Ender's thoughts. The book has so many interesting viewpoints, thought processes, feelings, etc. regarding what Ender thinks about and does. There is a lot of background information and motivations that make Ender follow the paths that he follows in the story. You get some of it due to clever script writing, but a lot of that understanding and character appeal is missed. Like I said I don't really see a way around this. There is a reason why this concept is always mentioned when people say ""the book is better than the movie"".All in all though, I thought they did a great job with the Enders Game movie. It's worth watching no matter if you have read the book or not - it's that good. 9/10, enough said. ;)",Ender's Game

318,jamesharris0,worth seeing on the big screen,8,1 November 2013,"Ender's Game is based on the first of a series of science fiction tales, and this movie serves as the introduction for what is presumably expected to be a series of films.The film inevitably misses a lot of the book - it could scarcely be expected to include everything- but the story is still told in an entertaining and understandable fashion.Asa Butterfield is outstanding as the title character. It is no mean feat for an actor of his age to carry a blockbuster film.The rest of the cast are very good. I didn't particularly warm to ben Kingsley's character but that was because of the writing rather than the acting.Visuals are excellent and I really enjoyed the score.

320,CaptainxBumout,A mess,3,23 May 2014,"I have no problem with movies that take liberty with the original source material if it makes a good movie. I don't care who the real First Class was in X-Men, it was a good movie. The Hunger Games was better than the book and it was a faithful adaptation. That said this movie is also very faithful to the book. Unfortunately this makes for a poor movie.I've read the book by Orson Scott Card and I wasn't really impressed. It was fine but it didn't leave me wanting to read any of the sequels. The book was mainly about a boy and his ability to lead. I guess the movie is the same but it's done horribly. First of all more than half of the book is about Ender in battle school. It's about how he's being mistreated and despite it all he makes friends and persevere through tactical fortitude and good will. There is a bit of that but none of it is fleshed out. None of the characters besides Ender is actually a character. I can't even remember a single one of them except Bean because he was cool in the book. They're all one dimensional and when they all come together at the end, it doesn't have any impact since we barely saw any struggle for Ender to begin with aside from one other kid who comes across as a psychopath.I watched this with others who have never read the book and they kind of had no idea what the hell was going on. Blatant exposition scenes didn't help much and there was a lot of random shots on the battle school floating around for no apparent reason. The ending sets up a sequel that no one wants to see and the whole movie is just a mess. The special effects are well done but that's about the only thing done well in the whole movie.",Ender's Game
321,prosinger,VERY well done (IMHO),9,14 December 2013,"I read the book way back when, but the details are now a bit fuzzy. I suppose that helps, because I'm not in a position to be disappointed by everything that's not filmed ""exactly like it was in the book"" or is left out/added to the story. On the other hand, I did remember enough of the story that I wasn't going to be confused by the course of events or any ""big surprises"", so that could be a potential detractor in one sense.Admittedly, I also had my qualms about seeing the movie to further line the pockets of an author who reportedly has some very homophobic traits (unknown to me at the time I read all of the books in the series).All that aside, I decided in the end that I just had to see the movie, and I most certainly was NOT disappointed. I am not an expert reviewer, but I am very particular (some would say downright picky) about the movies I see, and often disappointed by movies others rave about.In this case, I thought the movie's pace was absolutely appropriate, the narration/exposition was not rushed or super-condensed, the concentration on the preparation of the children also absolutely fitting (given the importance and the role this played in the book) and interesting, the effects subtle enough to not be ""in your face"" the whole time and yet fantastic enough on occasion to nearly give me vertigo (I was smiling like a kid on a roller coaster).What's more, my significant other, who has not read the book and was fairly unaware of the storyline, went with me to see the movie, and he also felt the movie was very well done. We sometimes make comments to each other during movies (as couples are wont to do), and I think this was the ""quietest"" we've been at the movies in a long time. He understood everything going on (contrary to some of the reviews that we read later) and I daresay he found it quite fascinating.I do NOT share the opinion of some of the reviews I've skimmed through elsewhere that this was some kind of ""tween"" movie, that it was dumbed down, that it was ""too much information packed into too little time (that lasted too long)"", that anything about it was flat or boring or incomprehensible, or that the acting or directing was lacking in any way.As a matter of fact, I was quite positively surprised that the writer(s) and director were able to make such good use of the time allotted to tell what is at its heart a deeply nuanced story and at the same time make it so interesting on so many levels.To my mind, this was one of the most successful book adaptations I've ever seen (but I do reserve the right to take my opinion down a notch or two if/when I re-read the book and refresh my memory in re the details ;-) ).",Ender's Game
322,felixtherat,One of the most appallingly lazy scripts I've seen in years,1,20 January 2014,"Visually stunning, well performed, but my oh my. As a small example, Ender's emails home to his sister, with whom he has a string emotional rapport and which he reads aloud, read like a dry, cold shopping list of what's just happened and what's about to happen. Like so much of the dialogue, they serve the purpose of informing the audience, and *no effort whatsoever* has been made to make it fit in with the story. It's so unbelievably appalling it actually makes you feel like the makers have a personal grudge against their audience. What's more, the movie is brimmed with premises that make no sense - and it relies heavily on these to function. For example, the essential premise that the Formic's ""can't talk"" and so humanity has never attempted communication - yet they a have huge, industrial-sized and highly technical army, that invades far-off planets - so it's clear to everyone from the start that unless they spontaneously do the same thing at the same time, then it's obvious they communicate with one another, and have done so for thousands of years. I'm not kidding - the notion that they communicate *at all* only occurs to Ender right at the end of the movie, in a somewhat forced scene that was thrown in to make the end make sense - and this fact, or the failure of mankind to realise it, is absolutely pivotal to the plot! His commander even denies out loud that it's possible for Formics to communicate - fifty years *after* they launched an invasion on planet earth!Equally bizarrely, the Formics' motivation for invading Earth is that they are about to ""breed themselves into extinction"" (sic). I can barely imagine how lazy and ignorant you have to be to surmise that because overpopulation = bad, therefore overpopulation = extinction. Give it half a moment's thought, heck, even do a little cursory research - it's just not a bright conclusion to reach, is it?Throw in some really uncomfortable lines - you know the ones - establish a strong character for Ben Kingsley (he always shines at these, I think rather he established it for himself) , then give him some throwaway line that serves no purpose except to inform the audience what's going on (again)... oh God, stop it, it hurts!As the final image faded to credits, I actually muttered ""f*** you"" under my breath, because that's truly how I felt.

I have to write 10 lines for this review, and I realize you may not appreciate my comments, but I paid good money to see this. I'm still watching and I have to submit more lines, so let me add that Harrison Ford looks (and acts) like he died last month. Ooh, a teen boy just said ""ten hut."" Sir, yes sir!! Girl still likes hero boy. Whew! They have really cool iPads to play their games on that you'll have in the future. I hope the graphics then aren't as cheesy as they are here. The movie set, by the way, is about as original and sophisticated as the original TV Star Trek set. ""Dragon Army"" -- gimme a break. Now looks kinda like computer graphics from Disney's TRON from decades ago. Boys fighting in the shower just like middle school. Acting-- ""wooden"" is the kindest description. Now teen hero is being stubborn and recalcitrant, sort of like Harry Potter, but he must accept his burden to save the world. Good grief, Ben Kingsley just showed up as tattooed as Queequeg and wise as Yoda. I'm gonna bail here.

324,djc123-612-319888,5 things that would have made this movie better,1,17 January 2014,"When I first heard this film was coming out, I decided to read the two books on which the movie was based (Enders Game & Enders Shadow). I really enjoyed the books and was confident that with a bit of thought they could make a decent screenplay that would be true to the story in the books as well as being entertaining to watch. Like many others, I was incredibly disappointed with the movie. Here are 5 things that would have improved it greatly: 1) Show the passage of time: Whilst I understand that it would be tricky to show the 5 years or so Ender is in battle school, having him writing an email saying 'we have been studying for months' doesn't really cut it. Everything moves so fast that you get the impression he has only been there a few weeks. This prevented something essential to most movies, character development. 2) Show Battle School as a school: Much of the book is about how the battle room games shape and define Enders character as a person and (eventually) a leader/commander. This is barely touched on the movie with the few battle room scenes being very disappointing and Ender becoming both an expert in the battle room and leader of an army within what seems like a week! Also, in the books there are a few hundred children at battle school, a lot more than the sparse 50 or so we see in the movie. Even classic Star Trek gave the impression of a large crew on the Enterprise by having extras walking in the corridors, how hard can it be to copy that?3) Show that Ender is truly on his own: In the book, Ender doesn't have any friends as such, he has to earn respect by becoming the best in the battles, then people start to follow him. When Ender arrives, Graff says that Ender has to feel alone, but from then on he always has someone to help him or be his friend. 4) More Bean, less Petra: Petra is a great character in the books, because she is a bit of a b**ch! Yes, she helps Ender with shooting practise but she is fairly ambivalent towards him the rest of the time. Bean is the person who Ender eventually trusts the most, and even confides in. In the movie, far too much emphasis was put on Petra's relationship with Ender (she didn't even seem like the 'real' Petra to me) whereas Bean is just a face in the crowd. 5) Show Ender getting tired: Even if they failed in all the other areas, they could at least have made Ender look tired from all the battle games! His exhaustion is what drives him to 'quit', again this doesn't come across at all in the movie. How hard could it be to show that? I could write more, but in summary this movie was an epic fail with very few redeeming qualities. The sad thing is, it could have been one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, but instead they traded the 'soul' of the book for a few flashy effects and a lightweight story. Somewhere in the process the real Ender's Game got lost.",Ender's Game

So I'm puzzled about how it has a rating of 7.2; that's almost a full point more than ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"".

328,atedmon2,Little Ender's Game Review,7,8 January 2014,"I'm one of those nineties kids who grew up with this book and it's as nostalgic a piece of my childhood as the Harry Potter series. As fan of the book unfortunately I was disappointed that the movie wasn't the ground breaking blockbuster hit that I'd wanted. That being said I still personally enjoyed this film immensely. Most reviewers had mixed feelings about Ender's Game; one side found it flat out boring and callous while the other side thought it was just okay. I think part of this you can blame on the source material. One of the massive issues with turning Ender's Game into a movie was how much of the story really takes place in Ender's head. Orson Scott Card's writing is very psychologically. He mentioned in an interview himself that if you aren't privy to Ender's strategic thought processing than he comes across as just a violent kid. Personally for me, the aspect of the film that suckered me into it the most was the duality of Ender's character and how smartly written he is. The balance that he's trying to find between compassion and aggression while finding ways to beat his enemies is what makes Ender endlessly more interesting than other characters in this kind of genre for me. You want to see how he's going to react to every new challenge set in front of him because every choice he makes is sharply calculated.",Ender's Game

330,purrshaped,Great film until the last fifteen minutes,4,25 October 2013,"Ender's game is the story of a child genius forced to become the hero the earth needs due to attacks by ""buggers"" an alien ant-life form that nearly destroyed us. The paradox is we need a thinking reasoning empathetic psychopath, hard to find, so one needs to be created or tricked.It'sdifficult in the film to ascertain why Ender is the one being thought of as the saviour compared to other side characters in the film apart from the fact that he had shown aggressive tendencies at a young age or will argue with a senior officer.The film mostly follows the book to the crescendo but then jars discordantly and illogically from the book and reality, Ender has just destroyed a threat (unwittingly) that has killed hundreds of millions of humans but we are led to believe that the Generals watching this final battle against insurmountable odds are more concerned that he has exterminated an alien race rather than him saving humanity from their threat? Ridiculous. They would be on their knees,crying, grabbing his feet, puking in relief etc. Same again all the kids battling with him suddenly knowing that they have saved humanity from this threat. In the book Ender is the only person that feels this way, in the film we'd rather have not destroyed them and Ender has gone too far.

333,junkstuff-7,Battle Room is great but otherwise streamlined for plot,7,2 November 2013,"Ender's Game attempts to take Orson Scott Card's revered novel and move it to the big screen. While the big plot points are shown, some of the underlying pieces that also made the novel so fun are left off. Additionally, the movie draws upon the sequels for some of its scenes - notably the epilogue.This doesn't necessarily detract from the movie, however. The movie generally flows. While it easily could have been lengthened to incorporate some of the more subtle points, there is already a popular book currently being lengthened beyond reason. Removing some of the points, however, does make the movie a bit darker.For example, none of the interplay between the Battle School teams are shown. That interplay was key in making the school seem like a specialized high school. Instead, a serious tone is taken with a constant reminder and fear of the Buggers (who are never called as such in the movie).Fans of the book, however, will be able to enjoy the Battle Room scenes. These are absolutely stellar! The advancement in depicting Zero-G is really coming forth this year and Ender's Game is an excellent example of doing that.Those viewers who are unfamiliar with the novels, should be able to follow the story. At its core, its fairly simplistic. The Earth is training highly intelligent children to be the commander of the next fleet that will launch a pre-emptive attack on an alien race that previously invaded Earth.Other more complex themes, however, such as the use of children for this role, are barely touched. Nor are the happenings on Earth, depicted in the novel through the words of Ender's siblings, ever shown. Such societal commentary is left off to focus on the plot.Fans of the book should not hesitate to see it but should be prepared to feel that something is missing. Viewers utterly unfamiliar with the book can still enjoy the movie but it does not come close to being what it could be.",Ender's Game
334,paulortiz12,"Pleasantly surprising, but ends in the wrong place...",7,27 January 2014,"I have a bit of an aversion towards films with kid-heavy casts. It has the potential to go so wrong, and I'll admit for the first third of the film I had a hard time getting into it. I mean they all acted pretty well - better than the limited adult cast I'd say - but I guess there's just something unsettling/uncanny about seeing children expressing adult emotions.Anyway, with all of that said I found myself starting to enjoy watching Ender grow and use his diplomatic and tactical skills in dealing with some of the other commanders in training, and some of the space battle simulator sequences were really impressive (I'm a fan of Homeworld so...ya know...).Now, what really irked me about this film was the way it began to weave together a more complex sub-plot about the nature of the alien threat, and some kind of psychic connection, and just as the film starts to build up a nice pace and we feel like it's all going to come together...Ender sets off into the endless void of space and the credits roll. I've seen this in a number of films recently; it's like the writers don't quite know how to finish the film, or they run out of time to develop a final act, OR they're under pressure to leave the movie open for potential sequels. Whatever the case may be, it's annoying. There's a fine line between leaving a little to the viewers imagination to keep them thinking after the movie finishes, and just robbing them of an ending. I feel that's what happened here, at least partly.All of that said, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. And the message it delivers - about understanding your enemy, perhaps even coming to sympathise with them - is a really important one that loses some of its impact due to the slightly limp ending.",Ender's Game
335,clark44,Very enjoyable movie that doesn't do justice to the book,8,1 November 2013,"As a fan of the book, I really wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie. Great books hardly ever adapt into good films. But my friend wanted to see it, so I agreed to tag along on opening night. I have to say, as a movie, it is genuinely enjoyable. The visuals are starkly entrancing without being distracting. The casting is pitch-perfect - Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield, in particular, do a great job. The ending is particularly well done (don't worry - it wasn't really spoiled by the trailer). The problem is, it's really just a caricature of the book. The drama in Battle School moves too quickly, the characters of Peter and Valentine are almost completely absent, and even Ender's video game is sadly underdone. I'm not usually a fan of splitting books into multiple movies, but this is one where two films would have done it justice. Also, the kids are just too old - there's an ironic moment in the movie where two officers talk about how conscripting kids under 15 ""used to be illegal"", yet all the actors playing the kids look 15 or older!Still, it's a fun ride, and if you hadn't read the book these flaws really wouldn't be apparent. Definitely see it in the theater if you can - the battle room scenes are best on a big screen.",Ender's Game
336,Belgiumania,Disastrous,2,29 December 2014,Ender's Game is a poorly executed mess of a film. If you have not read the book beforehand do not bother watching it as I suspect it will make almost no sense. Those who have read the book will find themselves confused at the decision making which went into this movie and will likely regret seeing it as I do.The entire first 60 minutes of the film feel like a throw away where the director tried to cram in too many scenes but did not bother or did not have the skill to flesh them out properly. They end up being a series of disjointed and unfinished scenes which would be near incomprehensible in context if you had not read the book. Character development is non-existent even for Ender and Peter may as well have been left out of this production for all his brief appearances added.What were the writers thinking by changing minor details of the story from the book when they add nothing to the film - why is Bean in Ender's launch? Why bring up gender relations at the Battle School (and why change them from the book)? Why on Earth would Bernard be one of Ender's toon leaders? And why leave out the scene where Ender breaks Bernard's arm? None of these changes do anything to help the story work as a film.Half way through the film upon arrival at Fleet School the story begins to work a bit better and we actually get a bit of the atmosphere of the book and Ender's internal struggles. Unfortunately the only adult actor in this film who seemed to put forth any effort was Kingsley and his character was neutered and completely devoid of any backstory or character development. The omission of all conversation between Ender and Rackham concerning the social structure and communication abilities of the Formics results in a hollow relationship and no connection to the story for the viewer. They don't even bother to explain why or how the ships have arrived at the Formic's homeworld so the deception game between Ender and the commanders during the final battles falls flat. All of this combines so that the climax scene comes and goes with a whimper with little context or meaning. The final scenes of the film where Ender retrieves the Queen larvae should have been cut entirely and the run time used to flesh out the story in the first half of the film as it makes no sense in the context of the film due to the decision to not explain how the Formics work as a society.Ultimately this film is not worth watching. I struggle to see how this script made it to production with such a massive budget.,Ender's Game
337,lazaro275,So close yet so far.,6,21 July 2020,As usual the book was way better than the movie. The only thing I can say is that this is a very difficult book to translate to the big screen.,Ender's Game
338,Matrix555,Enders Game is made for children 8-14 years old and adults that want to see a movie with children,6,12 May 2014,"Ender's Game(2013) + Some beautiful scenes of space, earth and planets. + Harrison Ford actor. + The final combat simulation was interesting. + Fairly beautiful girl actor. - I waited FOREVER that the characters would grow older. These are kids! - BORING long scenes reminds me of Oblivion - If you expect epic long lasting war you will be disappointed. - Training, training and training. - Sometimes low budget effects and you can see it is filmed inside a studio and not outside in the real world. My vote: 6.5/10 OK/good movie.That said if you watch this movie with children 8-14 years old they might love it since all actors are either older generation Harrison Ford or kids.8 and 9 years old can watch this movie IF they are together with adults(usually parents or other relatives). 10+ age and they can watch this movie without adults I would say. There is even a cute computer/console game in this movie that seems like a good game for children.",Ender's Game
339,tt-nuda,good but...,5,7 November 2013,"The cast is PREFECT! Pretty much walked out of the book, that you don't see everyday. My experience was that ... well how do I put this. I felt like watching discretion of the book being on screen. But I don't think the writing in script tell people who have never read the book much. There is not enough said in the movie. Not enough emotion connection shown on screen. Ender tears up too much (I would put this one on director...not actor) CG is AMAZING! LOveeee that. I am not sure if I like the last few scene as I should have. And I'm not sure if thats because I read the book or something is a bit off... I did like it over all tho and I want sequel LOL",Ender's Game

But from the opening scenes right to the climactic finale I was glued to the screen. Asa B and Harry F both give outstanding performances backed up by the totally brilliant supporting cast with a special mention to Sir Ben K big nose and everything. I loved the score, sfx and script all top drawer and a massive improvement on the directors (Gavin Hood) previous effort wolverine. I have read about the original authors controversial views and could not see anything that pollutes the film in anyway. Its also a good exercise for Harry F to get his space legs back in preparation for episode 7.

341,sb-901-395404,Killing is child's play - and fun!,6,30 July 2014,"This movie has achieved a high rating but possibly due to all the wrong reasons. Scanning the reviews here the allegory of this film appears to have been missed despite the message being simple: those indoctrinated into today's contemporary US military complex, running the military machine; the generals, admirals, NSA/CIA commanders, are nothing more than naive children. These ""children"" are controlled by the ""adults"" who know best. And who do the story's adults represent? The American mega rich elite. These elite are incapable of achieving anything on their own (as matters are much too complex) but must depend upon the skillful ""children"" (society's workers) to maintain and extend their power.How are the ""children"" controlled? Through deception. It's ironic that the books upon which this film is based are apparently recommended/required reading at US military training centres; despite the clear indictment of the US imperialistic state system, military recruits are encouraged to read the text - showing just how blinded the US (and British, Australian, etc.) population is to the indoctrination they have received since birth.Another important aspect of the film is the use of games. This is analogous to the use and purpose of sports in the training in jingoism, and the ease with which the skills and aggression developed in sport are transferred to warfare; the US (and other ultra right wing Western countries subservient to the US) obsession with sports, is important to all states as a vanguard of fascism (or nationalism generally) with its veneration of strength and youthfulness. Thus, we can see the importance of contemporary violent video games and films in nurturing violence required by the state. This is common to all states, not just the US. Also an important value of sport/games is the in-group/out-group mentality that is encouraged, shown by research to enhance feelings of competition against the out-group and preference for the in-group - essential values to instil in those being prepared for war. Imagine if you will, an Olympic games in which the nationality of participants was unknown, and the goal for each participant (as opposed to competitor) was cooperation - to maximize the performance of all.Democracy or anarchism will not be tolerated. When Ender is asked about his abhorrence in being subjugated by orders/others, the ""adult"" presents the solution/reward; domination of others (given power to order others around). So we see cooperation is neither encourage within the institution or without (i.e., with the ""enemy""). Here we see veneration of the totalitarian structures that form the bedrock of ""capitalist"" society (ignoring for the moment that espousing institutions are ""too big to fail"" denies capitalism, as only the strong are supposed to survive in a truly capitalistic system) - individuals within corporations/governments fight each other as they fight ""the enemy"". There are no friends, Ender must be made to ""feel"" alone (another lie, he is not alone; people naturally wish to help and receive help, when left to their own devices). Analogous to the learned helplessness of today's citizens as unions and governments fail them, as corporations reduce them to ""individual atoms of consumption"" - the only solution is to use Nietzche's ""will-to-power"".Who are the ""bugs""? The US elite's ""enemies"", properly dehumanised. Just as the Nazi propaganda machine paired images of cockroaches with that of Jews, in order to dehumanise those that are to be exterminated (in order to minimise otherwise natural feelings of compassion with one's fellow humans), so too are the film's contrived ""enemies"" portrayed as insects. This can be seen in the comments of today's US drone pilots that describe their murder of innocent civilians and ""suspects"", as ""bug splats"".Throughout the film Ender struggles with his emotions that are constantly being manipulated by the ""adults"", as well as the constant doubt as to the ethics of his actions. Underlying the ""adults' "" motivations is their fear of the ""enemy"", that need complete annihilation in a pre-emptive strike - otherwise the US elite might have to share their wealth with the rest of society and the world. Also important is the film's portrayal of the lack of any threat posed by the ""enemy"" (indeed, all they wanted was to share the Earth and to continue to live, as any sentient being would) and the desire of the ""adults"" to nevertheless obliterate any chance of being subservient to (or attacked by) them. This echoes the US elite propaganda that portrays targeted groups/countries as ""enemies"" engaging in unprovoked aggression towards their ""children"" (by only offering government/corporate censored/doctored accounts of events) - the elite invariably portray themselves as mere peace-lovers engaged in self-defense.This is not a movie about children, but it would serve them well to watch it, with instruction, to break free of the the lies around them, much in the same way as Edward Snowden / Ender Wiggin did. However, given the US military use of the books, the chance of lifting the fog of lies appears slim.",Ender's Game
342,gregu,"Love the book, dislike the movie",1,23 May 2019,"If you liked the book as much as I did, you will most probably feel disappointed by the movie. The script has flattened the story so much, it is barely understandable for those that did not read the book, and even if then only in the most important parts. The rest is just Sci-Fi showmanship or gibberish.The book spends a lot of time on Ender's character development, his relationship within the family and the dynamics of his relations with multiple Battle School characters. The movie shows you only a very small part of it, and usually badly. The casting was not really fortunate: book's Ender was 6 when he joined Battle School, here he is a teenage boy from start; Bonzo Madrid was several years senior and much more developed physically, while in the movie he is a foot shorter... These are only examples. Nowhere you can see the immense work put by Orson Scott Card into describing the way Ender developed his Dragon Army, what kind of a leader he's been, why was he respected by his soldiers, etc. Col. Graff's character is flat, although very nicely played by Harrison Ford.There is a limit to artistic liberty in interpretation of acclaimed works. This film is way beyond that limit. Watch it at your own risk. You may very well like it, but if you liked the book, this is not very probable.",Ender's Game

It's 2 am, yet so many people here.. Still fresh from watching Ender's Game, so I decided to write this review before I sleep.Enough with the introduction, here's my review in tldr : Ender's Game is a great movie! Even though I have not yet read the novel, but I think it was a great novel. Let's find some free time to read it.Basically, the story reminded me of my past military training with Kopassus. There are many scenes of habits in military environment, such as wake up in early morning, preparation in 5 minutes, minding the languages, competition, etc.It also tell us the character development from cadet into commander. Starting from only a simulation in the tablet, then into real life with zero gravity, until the final simulation to battle with Formics. I think James Kirk should have training like this before he become the captain of Enterprise :PThe battling simulation scene in zero gravity reminds me of last month hot movie: Gravity. Although Gravity wins everything from Ender's Game, but it still fun to watch, especially when Ender's team show us some brilliant tactical strategy ever.However, the most twisted moment is near the end of the movie, and you will know why the title is Ender's Game. I will not spoil anything here, so just watch the movie if you want more.Overall, great movie! Although the acting for other characters is a so so, but Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield shines throughout the movie.",Ender's Game
344,Ajaymib,Good enjoyable movie - you can watch with kids,7,1 June 2019,"Nice movie. Wiggins displays remarkable decision making abilities which shows that straight thinking does not always help and many a times lateral thinking is required, especially in wartime. One more quality he displayed is empathy towards the enemy which was unusual but I guess some leaders could be having this. Overall what I appreciated in this movie is the qualities displayed by the protagonist as a budding leader and his maverick approach which comes in handy in his dealing with tough situations. Worth watching family and kids' movie.",Ender's Game
345,uqueia,Not bad... not terribly great either...Read on...!!!,6,1 November 2013,"Ender's Game: The MovieI have read the book before the movie.The movie was disappointing.If you have never read the book the movie may appear shallow. The movie is not a bad movie, it just isn't a terribly great movie either. The movie was shallow as it only highlighted the very best key-points out of the whole book and left you wondering what was going on The character development was sorely lacking. The battle-room fights were not very long There is very little character and team development with only small bits of dialogue. No team relationship except allegiance. The lack of character development, felt like a hit and run on to the next key point which is sad considering the book was so good. The battle scenes in the book were a long drawn out scenario with the command room near the end. The movie is close to 2 hours so for the sake of storyline I can see why the trimmed it. Asa was okay as Ender. At the beginning of the movie the narrator says that valentine was too emotional, Peter was too prone to violence and that Ender needed to master an even balance between both. Ender leaned heavily on the Valentine side and very little on Peter. Ender doesn't kill Bonzo directly, it was indirect with Ender sad about the event. Overall the key points were well scripted. The storyline is interesting but not intriguing. If you're not an Ender's game fan, it may be too shallow and fast paced to really get involved. The key-points of the story again are interesting but not enough to really care about any of the characters. If you're an Ender's Game fan watch it; but don't go in with high expectations.",Ender's Game

And the power of visuals, performance of actors, adaption and of course some very catchy dialogues..they just made me forget about the dumb concept..and at this point, i really started enjoying this movie. I am really waiting eagerly for the sequel as well. it is certainly good watch but not for everyone. Still it is a very entertaining movie once you get attached to it.my rating is 8/10",Ender's Game

348,DrCornetto,Another of those movies you better skip,4,3 February 2014,"I did not read the book so I wont bother that the movie crushes through a story that may be much deeper and detailed than what is possible to realize in a short movie.The major problem with the movie is that it basically deals with strategically not very convincing tiny training-battles in a simulated environment. There is no story - ZERO. Several small but well presented conflicts between scholars that essentially do not contribute to the story are the most you can get out of the movie.My perception is that the movie should either be about the conflict between aliens and humans or focus on the conflicts of the protagonist. However, this movie delivers neither of these story lines. Instead it focuses on the training sessions and tries to make us believe that Ender is an incredibly gifted strategist. It is very hard to believe that. Personally I have the impression that the training sessions were the only part of the movie where it was possible to cramp in tons of action scenes to keep an undemanding and modest spectator excited.If you are into CGI and effects, well there is a lot of well done scenes. My 4/10 is 3 for CGI and 1 for the fact that the end of the movie at least gave me hope for 10 minutes before it ended abruptly.Overall the movie is boring and fails to develop any sort of compelling story line. It is mainly concerned to bombard with CGI effects to impress for the moment. Clearly, another movie that could have been inspiring and unique but finally turns out to be not more than another plot we have seen over and over again...except for the last 2 dialogues at the end it is a forgettable movie.",Ender's Game

Harrison Ford is at his gruff best, Viola Davis puts in on a fine performance, and Sir Ben Kingsley is at his snooty best! My only complaint is the short running time of less than two hours makes you walk away wanting more. Asa Butterflied is decent as the title character but if there is a sequel,and I hope there is, I'm sure he will get better and better. While this may look to some as a sci-fi entry to fill the void the Harry Potter series left, it is not.and you will be pleasantry surprised.

Then the movie ends in a way that is entirely unsatisfying.If you are going to tell everyone that the main character is some kind of genius or prodigy, it helps to show us signs of that genius. None are shown that are convincing.If you are going to show a character going thru training, it helps to show us that the character is actually advancing in the training. But how can he? He's a genius and a prodigy. (Compare to The Matrix, where Neo may or may not be The One).If you are going to put a character at the center of a movie, please make sure he has some degree of empathy and isn't a dramatic lightweight. Here, Ender is unsympathetic and I never cared one way or the other what happened to him or anyone else (since everyone else is equally non empathetic).The great Ben Kingsley is wasted. Harrison Ford looks bored.You know a movie is in trouble when critics hesitatingly credit it for being 'intelligent' and 'full of ideas' yet still largely give it negative reviews. This is because, as the case here, the movie fails as a movie--as a dramatic, engaging experience. Instead some vague ideas are tossed around and an ending tossed on that feels entirely undeserved.

351,siriusdude666,Too much fat trimmed = poor box office results = No sequels = Morons should be fired,6,8 November 2013,"Why, why, why did they trim off so many terrific aspects to the story? annnnd NOW look: The box office is poor compared to what it could have been. There's strong talk of NO sequel and NO follow up TV series. Nothing. At the point they were at, what's another million dollars per minute if the word of mouth and the critical reviews would created a much larger ROI. Seriously? What's another 20 million in production footage to create a more cohesive story, that would have created sooo much more profit and set up for a legitimate sequel that people would actually be very excited to see. See below on plot points. You morons screwed yourselves out of a lot of money and status as an all time classic. You could have easily added another 25 minutes of run time (not to mention the final 5-8 minutes is credits 99% of people don't watch anyway so why count it?), and no one would have cared b/c the pace of the movie along with the action would have made it felt like 10 minutes had passed. As it was the movie felt like an hour long anyway. Besides, its a WAR MOVIE. Those are typically accepted as being longer movies anyway because of the acceptance of pain, anguish, trenches, never ending battle mindset,etc...all parts of war movies. I read this book and part of the enjoyment was the satisfaction of overcoming the grueling and hellish experience of the protagonist. Here's where you screwed up.1. Poorly established relationship of Ender with his elder sibling Peter. It was so brief it might as well not have happened at all and just use the sister. You could have just ""talked"" about how vicious the brother was (as you did in some scenes). 1a. You could have better explained the big deal with population controls and being a ""third"". Could have done it in less than 60 more seconds of dialogue or imagery. 2. The battle school progression. Again you could have AND SHOULD HAVE shown more of the improvement in tactics and ability and development of ancillary ""toon"" characters to show how Ender achieved great heights. Not just 2 fricken battles, an intro, and a private room practice. Stupid, and cheap. 3a. The mind meld with the formics and the online game. TERRIBLY executed. You never established a legitimate connection between Ender and the formics and the game as the medium for their communication. Had I not already known the story in detail I would have struggled mightily to understand that he was being contacted throughout his training. 3b. You had Ender do ALL the talking when he finally came in contact with the formic creature at the end. WHYYYYY? How effin hard is it to create some ghostly / 4th dimension sounding voice (in ender's head that we and he could hear) ACTUALLY speaking to him. It's been done before in other movies...so not difficult people! Complete screw up. Total cool points lost forever. 4. Small gripe but why couldn't you let him fight back against mazor rackham on their initial meeting and show more of the aggression and strategy as was highlighted in the book? You had time, plenty of time.5. Why did you show sooo few of the battle scenes at command school? Why did you NOT show how Ender was going through hell? and passing out? and losing his mind? etc...and more of the mistakes? you had time.6. Virtually no explanation of the phelotic / ansible communication that humans and formics used. You could have explained that in conjunction with the formic queen contacting Ender through the game and throughout the movie.. YOU HAD TIME (and plenty of budget)7. This is really section 3b. Why couldn't you better show how Ender felt immense guilt for his actions. Had you set it up better to begin with, the culmination of his internal struggles, the pain, stress, etc... would have bubbled over nicely during this / these scenes. Total missed opportunity to connect with the audience, and up this movie to all time classic status.I enjoyed this movie b/c like so many I'm happy it got made but it kills me to know you could have made so much more money on this film, which would have opened doors to future films, and now it's most likely not going to happen. This movie is a C+/ B- at best. The 6 out of 10 is generous and if it wasn't such an amazing story, the movie adaptation really deserved a D+/C-",Ender's Game
352,dickmacgurn,Underrated Epic Sci-Fi Mind Blower!,10,13 November 2013,"It's a shame that Orson Scott Card (OSC) is homophobic as per his religion (LDS) because if not for that this movie would be getting all the praise it deserves. I cannot condone his immoral attitude towards gays, but I also cannot let his personal flaws influence my love of this fantastic movie. Clearly, no expense was spared in bringing his vision to fruition, and I applaud his patience in finding the right team to do so 28 years after being written.Don't be surprised that Cirque du Soleil was responsible for the flawless depiction of weightlessness in the battle training room. The choreography and filming of those war games was no less than exquisite as were the actual battles that followed.My daughter Ashlay (who read the books) and I both saw it at IMAX and then later in a regular theater. As usual, the IMAX experience was well worth the extra money. I do recommend bringing an OSC reader with you to better understand the minutia of the plot.The acting was much better than I expected going in. That kid Butterfield (Ender) had me convinced he was the best choice for that very demanding role. If not for OSC's political problems I'd expect the kid to get an Academy Award Nomination at the least, and who knows, maybe he will anyways? Harrison Ford was flawless, I don't get the critics who said otherwise. The girl from True Grit was perfect for her role as his best friend. The other kids were excellent and Kingsly was amazing as always as the legendary Mazer Rackham.**Spoilers** As an admitted movie snob I'm always looking for flaws in the plot, the acting, the science, everything, even the costumes and the music. Example: I think the main reason Star Wars episodes I, II, & III sucked compared to IV, V, & VI was because they were shot in DV and they used too much CGI instead of models & puppets. In Ender's Game (EG) the CGI and cinematography was par excellence! One brilliant thing was the use of cartoony CGI characters for the game he discovered in which parts of it later turned out to be an alien queen ""thinking to him"". It was even more enjoyable aesthetically than just about any CGI cartoon I've ever seen including Shrek, The Incredibles, or Toy Story which all scored a 10/10 by me. Cartoon Valentine was even prettier than she is in real life which in itself is a feat.I asked my daughter why there was no ""ping"" (delay between command and execution) during the battle sequences. She replied that this is explained by OSC's invention of ""ansible"" which is a machine capable of instantaneous or ""superluminal"" communication. I thought for sure I had discovered scientific implausibility. They do actually mention it even if they don't fully explain it. I also suspected a flaw in that there is a complete lack of diplomacy towards the aliens which is also Ender's big complaint in the end. That is explained away with the fact that this species is on the one hand extremely sophisticated and yet tragically simplistic in nature much like the ants that it very intentionally resembles. It may possibly be the greatest tragedy that the queens are incredibly intelligent and yet have no easy way of communicating with a species as overtly communicative as we humans who also turn out to be overtly destructive. Ender is sobbing when he realizes that they've tricked him into annihilating an entire race at the same moment that he falls in love with them. In his own infamous and prophetic words: ""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him."" Although I wasn't able to empathize with the aliens, Ender's reaction to the event rang as true as the epic tragedy that it was. Clearly OSC wanted to convey that Ender's greatest virtue is his ability to empathize despite every effort by his teachers to make him behave otherwise. While Mazer Rackham only wished to speak for the dead of his own race, Ender is clearly more interested in speaking for the victims of what he believed ""need not have happened"" including the billions if not trillions of alien creatures he wiped out and one thousand or so humans that died in the final battle. As a devoted vegan myself, I do empathize more with animals than I ever did before, and yet I didn't feel a thing when the aliens were wiped out, but Ender sure did, which exposes possibly the most important flaw in human society at large: ""In their behavior toward creatures, all men are Nazis. Human beings see oppression vividly when they're the victims. Otherwise they victimize blindly and without a thought."" - Isaac Singer.In this movie, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is successfully portrayed as an epic hero with the best qualities of Gandhi, Darth Vader, Einstein, and Abraham Lincoln combined. He is an immeasurably gifted genius like Einstein with the empathy and compassion of a Gandhi or a Lincoln but also the ability to fearlessly and skillfully lead a vast army and kill his enemy in the manner of Darth Vader. One of the other tragedies is that he does so at the tender age of only 14.I haven't seen a sci-fi movie this good since Avatar and before that I have to go all the way back to the original Star Wars. I rank this movie in the top 5 of all time sci-fi at position #3 ahead of Aliens and The Terminator. I can't wait for the next 4 movies to come out, and judging by OSC's patience, I don't expect that to happen soon.",Ender's Game
353,gopal4320,Epilogue to novel added,8,3 November 2013,Follows the main plot and details of the book fairly closely. Some of the nuances of the novel didn't make it into the film but the movie does justice to the book. There is a PC dimension in the movie that was not in the book. The novel is a favorite of mine having read it twice. The book plot focuses more on the character's sadness than the movie but the movie gets it. This is decent film but I found the novel more satisfying.The name of the main character represents an interesting comment on the main objective of the movie's plot. Ender is in training to end a potential threat to the entire population of Earth. Is he able to pass all the tests? Is he up to the task? He is pushed to his limits at a very young age. One of the significant questions in the movie that was not in the novel is whether our perception of the enemy correct? You decide.The conclusion is the same except for an epilogue that adds a wrinkle to the story line that I like and allows for a sequel. The graphics are good.,Ender's Game
354,GenerationSilverScreen,Highly Recommend,9,1 November 2013,"I went into this movie with pretty low expectations- but I was very pleasantly surprised.Firstly, it probably helps that I love both the sci-if and action genres. Don't go see this movie unless you like space and battles, preferably together. But you also shouldn't see this movie if you want space and battles for mindless entertainment; this movie tries to delve much further than that, and for the most part, I believe it really succeeded.Visually, Ender's Game is pretty spectacular. There's a lot to love about the visual effects, and kudos to the team that put them all together. It made for great viewing due to that aspect alone. The soundtrack was very fitting, and I enjoyed it all the way through. I gotta love me some epic soundtrack music, and this score really delivered in that department!But of course, it's the story that plays the biggest role here, since it's a book-to-screen adaptation. That alone made me hesitant to see it, since I've been disappointed by many book-to-screen adaptations before. Here, I found nothing I could really hate; the movie feels rushed at times, but in the grand scheme of things, there is far more that I liked than I didn't. I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, and no single mistake changed my viewing experience for the worse.I'll be letting my friends know that this is worth a watch, and I'd be more than happy to watch it again. I'd also highly recommend this to fans of the genre, books, and just good movies in general. While I left the movie feeling like I'd just seen something awesome, the movie left me thinking deep and interesting thoughts. Now that's a good movie right there.",Ender's Game
355,chelsea-taylor-110,What I thought of Enders game.,10,26 October 2013,"I thought that the sci-fi called Ender's game was really good. I liked the way That Asa used the most powerful quotes in the book, in the film because it made the film more interesting if you have read the book. Although they did miss a few i think vital parts out from the book but otherwise i think it was as close to the book as you are aloud to get.In terms of the casting i reckon that they were all really well thought out. Having Haillee Steinfeld as Petra made the film better as in my opinion she is an amazing actress. also having Moises Arias as Bonzo was amazing as he really caught the violence personality that Bonzo has in the book. Overall it was a film to definitely see i strongly recommend it.",Ender's Game
356,Khim1,"Not perfect, but much much better than I could have ever expected",9,13 August 2016,"I have always assumed Ender's Game to be impossible to convert into a good movie, while at the same time longing to see it come to life on the screen. Somehow I assumed that it would be done sooner or later, and that it would inevitably fail, because the director wouldn't understand what the book is about.Orson Scott Card (regardless of what views he holds) is an amazing storyteller. The book is full of long narrative passages and detailed, verbose dialogue, neither of which would lend themselves to be easily converted to a movie script. The book is also relatively long and contains several different subplots and subthemes.As it turns out, the movie lacks one of my favourite subplots, and it overcomes the wordy dialogue and the narration by moving things around, and by condensing the ideas and concepts into much shorter lines, told by suitable characters whenever possible. This may sound like a recipe for failure, but for me it works just fine.While I need to include a few caveats, like that the movie should have been at least six hours long, that the missing subplot should have been left in, and that I'll concede it might not work so well for anyone who hasn't read the book a few times, to me this movie is as good as I could have ever hoped, and significantly better than I expected.Most importantly, everyone involved seems to have understood what the book tried to say.",Ender's Game
357,filmoman,Trailer is the essence,6,8 November 2013,"If you saw only the trailer is more than enough. The rest of the story is just a filler done with military training clichés which don't fit at all when the subjects are children, even if teenagers. It just didn't feel right for me and I wasn't convinced at all. The supposedly smart moments and training scenes to justify Enders so called super qualities to make him ""the one"" are average at most if not trivial. The only aspect where this movie shines are the CGI special effects, which you can see in... the trailer. I am a SF and special effects fan but I will give this one just an average overall with a 6/10.",Ender's Game
358,jar-889-447239,Superb,10,4 January 2014,"I just saw Ender's Game tonight. I loved the book, and the movie did not disappoint. It is easily one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen. Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford are excellent, with a very good supporting cast. The special effects were well done. The story was very faithfully adapted from the book, with differences of course, but without any obnoxiously unnecessary perversions. This is a very clean family-friendly movie, which I would have rated PG, not PG-13. I hope they do a sequel, although if you've read Card's sequels, especially the ones that feature Ender, they are much more philosophical with less action, so they would probably be harder to make into a movie.",Ender's Game
359,KiberJustina,Film for under 13 years old kids,4,31 January 2014,"I am the sci-fi fan and the rating of this film was high so I decided to see it and to say shortly, in my opinion, if you are older than 13 years old, do not waste your time on this film. There is a lot of things wrong with this film, but the most I was disappointed in, is really poor acting especially of main actor who played Ender. The casting crew really made some bad choices on actors, once again just proving how it is important to get the right person. It is just a pity that the rating is so high because it confuses viewers. This film is more for young children, though I think there are better films for youngsters than this one.",Ender's Game
360,robinmuerkoester,Poor and flawed beyond redemption,1,1 February 2014,"I could not recommend this movie to anyone.Usually I feel very strongly about not giving movies minimum marks since every movie usually has something to redeem other areas that are lackluster however this movie has none.The plot is disjointed, the casting is poor, the messages are tackily plastered on and the concept is poorly thought out.Every second of this movie you will have the urge to skip ahead in hopes that the CGI space fights will redeem it. When you finally reach them their flawed execution will only aggravate you further.If there was the option to give a zero this movie truly would deserve it. In fact this movie warrants the adaptation of the rating system so that zero is a score you can give.As a closing note: as someone who has played computer games (or as they call it in the movie simulations) No you cannot control spaceships light years away in real time ever heard of ping. No you cannot control that many units and hope to win the scenario with 10 actions per minute. I wished that the writers had actually done any research into gaming and professional gaming. They would quickly have noted that ping above a few seconds usually renders one hopeless and helpless i.e.: GGWP and that to compete merely controlling a small army on a map possibly 1/100th the scale of the mentioned battlefield one usually needs approximately 300 actions per minute.To the writers: n00bs uninstall.",Ender's Game

Time and time again you watch Hollywood butcher something you love, and it ends up leaving you rolling your eyes every time you see a trailer for a book you loved instead of getting excited.. This was my reaction to the Ender's Game trailer. I refused to watch this movie for the longest time. I thought the trailer looked ridiculous, and was positive there was no way to take that book and make it into a movie.Welp, Hollywood you got me this time.Speaking to fans of the book, you have to understand there is no way to take a book and make a movie that is 100% true to the book. It will always be disappointing waiting for something you loved in the book to come across on the screen and that moment never come, and yeah, there are plenty of things that got cut. Unfortunately 2 hours isn't enough time to touch on the character development, or each story that you loved and gripped you so tightly while reading.. but all things considered, I thought the movie was a fantastic portrayal of the book.Speaking to somebody who never read the book, you have nothing to lose in this movie. It is fantastic, and I almost envy the unbiased ability to enjoy this story for the first time in such a great movie.I've learned any book made movie is going to flop with critics, but I ask you to ignore the negativity and give this movie a chance. You'll be glad you did.",Ender's Game
362,seany-exton,Science fiction semi blockbuster,7,10 July 2014,I went into this movie with no preconceptions at all.The only thing i'd heard about this film was the title.I'm so glad i didn't read up on it first because i think this would have spoilt it for me.For the best part of the film its shot in space which credit where credits due is filmed fantastically what with the like of Gravity not long coming out and stealing all the limelight for its display of life in space and hands down it certainly deserves its merits.With that aside Enders Game is a marvel in itself.Great direction and production in this leaves you happy that you took the time out to watch this.A good cast of young actors who lead the movie very well and you can easily bond with these characters they portray.Iv'e given this movie only a 7 because with all its positive ingredients and an interesting plot line it still lacks something that i can't put my finger on.With that aside its still a must see for any science fiction fan.,Ender's Game

However that doesn't weigh down the fact that this movie's bad!!!!!(I'll get more in depth soon.) This movie star's Asa Butterfield, HARISON FREAKING FORD, Ben ''not doing good movies anymore'' Kingsley and Hailee Steinfeld. The plot is about a kid that randomly gets picked to command an army. Simple. Kinda ridiculous but simple.Now down to the gritty stuff: The plot twist is crap THE FREAKING GAME AT THE END WAS IRL. Well, that was a spoiler. That's not even an issue.The main issue is that it's boring really, really uninteresting. You never go to the edge of your chair ONCE.

The film...well, definitely the next ""Starship troopers"", and that is big, real big. A bit more childish, but it is perfect as it is. It makes you think about the true nature of our species and the way we evolve our complex society driven by a single goal. How we evolve as individuals, how do we process information to perform simple tasks and what critical point of complexity gives birth to feelings, ethics and morality. All of that has been put together in a very appealing way - visuals, sound and atmosphere. The cast made the perfect fit. One can't resist to love that galactic star fleet veteran Han Solo and the ever odd, wise and charming Ben Kingsley. Asa Butterfield is shaping the personality of an introspective, sharp and mindful actor and it looks like he has so much more to offer. I will keep an eye on him.",Ender's Game

Ender's triumphs in the room thru different tactics. his development with his 'toon and the others. all of that was truly lost in this movie. early on i wanted H.Ford to stop calling him Ender and instead call him Neo. there was no real character development or growth.and the ending was just horrible.",Ender's Game
367,SDH,Very well done!,10,1 November 2013,"Very well done! It was interesting to feel the weight of the outcome upon the characters during the movie, since I knew what was going to happen.For me this was similar to finally seeing Lord of the Rings on screen several years ago - great to see this story unfold visually after so much personal imagining.The Ender actor was nuanced and faithful to the expectations of the novel. Harrison Ford turned in a nice performance - love his voice and smirk! Sometimes the movie seemed to move a little fast - there was a lot of ""plot"" to fit into two hours.

The ""children"" were all 5-10 years too old for their roles. The greatest miss was the development of Dragon Army from nothing to the last game. It was also a shame that more was not made of Bean's contribution to the story from Ender's Shadow.

373,EdCT3440,Simply Phenomenal,10,31 October 2013,"First off the low IMDb rating and low Metascore are most likely because of the politics and ""controversy"" behind the scenes. This should be close to an 8+ overall rating and the 5.8 Metascore is a joke (that's that liberal media the Republicans rant on about). Asa Butterfield... brilliant. Harrison Ford... best role in awhile. Viola Davis... compelling.There were only two major holes in this movie (no spoilers really). The casting of Moises Arias was horrid. A four foot weasel trying to act like a tough guy was appalling, leaving me literally shaking my head and doing everything possible not to burst out laughing. I get that this character was meant to be hated but the performance was all wrong. Clearly one of his uncles must be the producer of the film. The second was a 15 second possible early reveal that could have given away the ending. Take this one scene out and it completely changes things.Other than that, within the framework of a film and only being able to explain so much in an allotted amount of time (leaving out most of the philosophical writing of two major characters for those that read the book) they did a great job with this. Given that most people said this was the unmake-able film, it delivered on all fronts and was well worth the IMAX ticket price.",Ender's Game

That's just slack, and insulting: ""It's somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, it'll do."" I sure- as-hell hope they weren't actually paying a dialogue coach to come up with that dog's breakfast of an accent.OK, that's that off my chest.At least it had a reasonable story behind it though (thanks mostly to the original novelist I suspect). Other multi-million dollar CG films tend to forget to hire someone to even write (or find) a story, so I guess the accent failure can be forgiven on this one.",Ender's Game
375,alex-george,"Good sci-fi action movie, terrible book-movie",7,28 October 2013,"Let me start off by saying that I'm giving it a 7 because Ender's Game is still a decent movie, I still enjoyed it however it does not do the book justice. Enders Game, the book was a sci-fi book but it showed an Earth put under an almost supreme dictatorial rule, we see this clearly through Ender's brother and sister, Peter and Valentine. They, especially Peter are cliffnotes in the film. In the book between them they create revolutionary ideas, writing behind the anonymous identities of Locke and Demosthenes (respectively), through them we see the complexities of war, the fact that you have a Cold War like situation, calmed only by the need for unity against the ""Buggers"". The Battle School / Fleet are the only things keeping the Earth at peace, and we see in later books that as soon as the threat is gone, war does break out.These are all things not even mentioned by the movie, however I think it would have been probably an ambitious goal, I personally think they should have released a 2 part movie like we've seen recently, with the 2 movies meant to be playing at the same time virtually but from different perspectives.Ender also isn't explained especially well, he's thought to be the ""saviour"" but apart from ruthlessness we don't really see why, although the actor playing Ender (and most of the kids actually) was well selected, and could have been the major flaw of the film.Now I know I'm sounding negative, but I did enjoy the film. The battle scenes especially were good, as were the scenes between Ender and Valentine / Petra and Graff. Graff and Anderson also worked together well.I felt they did a disservice to one of my favourite sci-fi books, but with all honesty I never felt it was a good book to bring to the big screen, a television show which had more depth and showed the events of Ender's Shadow and after would have been a much better way to go to be honest.Don't go into this expecting a true book to film conversion, don't go in expecting a fairly deep political / philosophical message (which OSC's books were, even if you didn't agree with the message), go in expecting an action flick and it'll be good. Go in expecting more and you'll be left wanting.",Ender's Game
376,jermaineprince747,No Words,4,3 November 2013,"I went in with higher expectations than i should. I didn't watch any trailers or talk to anyone that had already seen it; i wanted to view it fresh. I remember listening to Card say he had been given offers to make the Ender's Game movie but he had turned them down because they wanted to make too many changes so i was shocked to see a movie with ""elements"" of the story rather than a story with ""elements"" changed for film. Rather than introduce internal conflicts through actions and events they just cut to someone saying what took a third of the book to develop. The casting was terrible; how is it that a person described as twice the size of the main character is cast as half the size of the main character. If you're easily entertained you'll love this but if you have read the books you shouldn't. If you have any sense on the flow of movies you shouldn't either.

377,ivan-44-203537,How did Card agree to this?,3,19 January 2014,"I recently finished the audio book of Ender's Game and I thought it was really great. At the end of the book Card was talking about how they wanted to make a movie for a long time but the movie people kept changing Ender to a teenager (while in the book I think he is 6?) and trying to include a love story line, etc, making it a generic flick for the masses. He was talking about how he refused to agree to all these terms and how he was almost cheated into such an agreement with including contradictory clauses in the movie contract and so on. And now this? I don't get it. I'm pretty sure this is exactly the movie he didn't wanted Ender's Game to be. I had to explain to my wife what's going on, because the movie is so condensed and compressed that unless you read the book you will not know what's going on. If you read the book the movie is a pain to watch because it just doesn't work. Again a typical case of ""Hey, we don't really know what to do with the story so let's throw on a bunch of CGI stuff cause it looks good"". The story seems to take about 2-3 months all in all when in the book the story spans a few years.I wish AMC made a series out of it. Could have been so much better.",Ender's Game
378,TheHappyLemming,Disappointing movie adaptation of the book,6,30 May 2016,"Ender's Game is a movie adaptation of science fiction novel with same name by Orson Scott Card.The movie takes the main storyline from the book with the young boy Ender who goes to battle against the extraterrestrial species the formics which look like ants. They have attacked the earth 100 years before the story takes place and the international fleet selects specially gifted children to educate them in the future battle against the formics to prevent the formics attacking the earth again.In the book we follow Ender from his 6 year until he is a young adult around 12 years of age. He departs from his family when he is 6 and travels to a space station called the battle school. At the school he is leading an army of fellow students as their commander. The book describes his obsession with each and every game. These games are simulations of battles in space. The battles take place in the battle room where they fight mock battles in weightless condition. The movie does something similar except that Ender looks like he is around 13 instead of 6. So in the movie it seems he is up in the school for some months instead of many years. For me this makes it unrealistic that he learns all his skills and strategy in that short time. But that is just nitpicking Orson Scott Card has also written a parallel novel Ender's Shadow where one of Ender's fellow students, Bean is the main character. In an afterward to Ender's Game Orson Scott Card comments that the film would be an combination of these two novels. In the book he is the second in command in Ender's army. In addition Bean is small prodigy and even more smarter than Ender. As Bean was a very interesting character in Ender's Shadow, but also in Ender's Game, it was a great disappointment that Bean has a very small part in the film.In the movie a girl in battle school Petra takes the place of Bean (even though he is in the movie). Apparently the movie makers wants to make a love story between Petra and Ender. The trouble with this is that there is no such love story in the book. In actual fact, in the afterward of the book Orson Scott Card was totally against such a love story as it would be against the spirit of the book. That the film makers still tried to have the love story in the movie was a great disappointment. Except for these two negative points the film is worth seeing as long as you don't expect something out of the ordinary.What I liked the most about the movie was the good visual effects and the battle scenes. I really liked the computer game where Ender plays against the giant. I also thought that Asa Butterfield did descent job as Ender and Ben Kingsley as his instructor. Harisson Ford was OK as Colonel Graff.Ender's Game didn't do the book the justice, but it was entertaining.",Ender's Game
379,pilonen,Who doesn't like surprises?,9,3 April 2014,Great movie for almost all ages! Almost all Hollywood movies have really dumb scenes but this movie overlapped all does faults. The boy actor was really good. besides of that the design or what you call it was great. Effects and stuff like that was not overwhelming.I like all the surprisings in this movie. By surprises i mean scenes and actions the characters did and said things you didn't really expect. The last surprise was really cool when Ender founds out that the last game wasn't a game. And the game strategy it self was cool too even though it surly would not work in reality. I don't know really how to explain but I'll try. I like what actor the producers chose for the charters. Really good pairing! But when Admiral Chjamrajnagar started to talk the first time I thought he was going to read a bedtime story or something for the children :-) He's voice did not really fit in :) But its OK. I got used to it.Of course like all movies there stile was many things that was really predictable and made the movie a bit less better then it could been. For example the scene where the Sergeant dap told Ender about the gas tub. This kind of scenes spoil the flow of the movie. But on the other hand I cant really imagine how to do that scene in a deferent way. And there is some question marks about why Ender wouldn't report about Bonzo bullying him? Where was a couple of other things such as these that I made a note on but duo the lack of good memory I have forgot what they were about. :-) But Overall I really like this movie and I am usually kind of picky about what movies I like.

380,vibetribeweb,"If you AREN'T tired of this then, then I know WHO you are.",3,7 January 2015,"Well, this is the typical ""white male saves the universe"" movie premise. We see this movie theme MANY times EVERY year. If you are white, especially a white male, you most likely LOVE this theme so you will feel at home watching this garbage. We've got Harrison Ford here trying to make a weak white kid violent to serve his purposes(war, of course). Btw, Harrison(Han Solo) was good friends with ANOTHER white male that ""saved the universe "" in a few movies that you've also probably seen. LOL! The movie is full of white males(and white- LOOKING males) intimidating and dominating non-white males(""watch your mouth, Nick"", ""That's right, I'm the boss!"") and ALL of the females in one-on-one situations where they are equally armed/matched. Funny, but I don't see this too often in MY real life but it's an old, old, theme in American cinema. The script has damn near every Black male character picking on the ""smartest kid in the whole outfit"" to continue the practice of using MOVIES to instill fear and hate in whites towards minorities. They also have the Mexican kid picking on him for the SAME purpose and since you often can't tell the difference between a white person and a Latino, they make SURE to have him speak Spanish for a second. Of course, he is eventually defeated by the skinny white kid who we all know the FEMALE love interest would probably defeat in a fight. The ""hero"" goes from not being able to fire a weapon, to being a MARKSMAN after having ONE brief lesson from the beautiful female love interest, who of course, is all goo goo over this skinny nerd. Again, I don't see beautiful females attracted to skinny nerds too often in REAL life either!! LOL!! Later, they have him being promoted OVER a grown Black man who, of course, seems to have no problem taking orders from a KID since EVERYBODY knows that he's ""the One""! Sound familiar? LOL!! Every white male supremacist patterned movie MUST have SELL-OUT minorities, desperate to be celebrities, to play the part of the ""inferior"" characters and in this movie, the MAIN one is Viola Davis. One of the more insidious quotes in the movie is: ""Follow the rules and you lose, choose violence and you win."". The ONLY reason I gave this flick 3 stars is because I like the fact that the star REFUSES to follow orders that go AGAINST his value system REGARDLESS of the fact that a ""superior"" gave the order. I like THIS message just like I respect cops who report the unethical behavior of rogue cops in their department.I didn't write this review to start a debate with whites(or ""Uncle Ruckus""-type minorities) about white supremacist messages in the media. There IS no debating this and I WON'T engage in one. This review is for minorities and non-racist whites who are TIRED of watching these cheap Hollywood vehicles meant to SUBLIMINALLY program the public into their respective ""roles"". I watch a lot of foreign films too and they have WAY LESS white male supremacist/racist messages in their movies. Even though there is supposed to be freedom of speech in America, I'm sure that sooner or later, the elite white male power structure that is BEHIND this ancient ART OF WAR technique, will attempt to shut me down for EXPOSING the OVERT and COVERT white supremacist messages that we have FOREVER seen in American media. I've already read that IMDb reserves the right to choose the reviews that THEY want to choose. But until THEN, I will be the movie critic that you can depend on to call out white supremacist messages in the media. I will ALSO be calling out the minority actors that continue to ACCEPT and PLAY these degrading roles.",Ender's Game

I just couldn't believe they gave so much money to such a bad director, and the screenplay I really don't think Card was involved aside from credits. They mutilated the book with bad acting and lousy screenplay. Waste of time and money watching this movie. You can add one more Hoolywood fiasco with book adaptation. I would compare it with the first Wolwerine movie... bad on so many levels...Message of the story is. Read the book don't watch the movie and if you gonna do Enders Shadow movies... don't hire Gavin Hood... at all...",Ender's Game
382,rodeab-308-718216,I really enjoyed it!,10,31 October 2013,"True, it may need 20 more minutes and explain a few things for those who have not read the books and develop the characters, but that was mostly do to the fact that the director ended up writing the final script and not Card. However, they did an absolutely mind blowing job at recreating the world of Card. There were a few times I felt as if I was right there floating on the station. I am astounded that they were able to get that much in as the books are packed. It could have been two films, but well done for 2 hours. All in all it was a very enjoyable film which I will purchase. GO SEE THIS!!!",Ender's Game
383,dexfm,Disappointed,6,13 November 2013,"Spoilers. It should be about the Game, at least that is about in the book. The movie has no character development. The visuals are good, the acting was OK but, God where is the build up of the story, you know...the serious thing about his genius, about his ability to command. My girlfriend saw the movie with me and she did not red the books, she asked me what made him so good that he was promoted to squad commander in just 20 minutes of the movie. All is so rushed in the movie, nobody knows WHY they had monitors in the back of their head. The movie take another road, apart from the book with only one fleet sent on the Formics home planet, does not explain how they got there, when they were sent, instead they make us think that humans were in possession of fast light-years technology by sending Ender near the planet of the formic (what?). The movie fails to explain how the formic communicate in Universe. There are so many things unexplained in the movie that it made me think that some stupid director played with scissors and cut the tape to shorten the movie enough to fit the time frame.",Ender's Game
384,amy_arthur03,Excellent film -- a MUST see,10,2 November 2013,"Asa Butterfield did a brilliant job to portrait the inner turmoil of Ender's ethical dilemma: Defense vs. Offense; Peace vs. War; Survival vs. Annihilation; Right vs. Wrong! This movie also touch base on the topic of bullying and survival, which is prevalent now in this country's school. It's important to know that the only way to battle bullying is to stand up for it, not to be a bystander to watch bullying happening. I read this book long time ago, and I never could picture how the zero G battle room should look like. This film literally brought the book alive with excellent special effects, and great acting by Harrison Ford, Asa Butterfield and Viola Davis! And I love the humor from Bean. It's a great show for the entire family! Enjoy this new era of sci-fi movie!",Ender's Game
385,arne-bosma,"Enjoyable, but don't pay attention to the details",5,14 March 2014,"You can enjoy this movie, but if you want to you really shouldn't pay attention to the details. I have read some reviews here and most people probably explain it better than I could, but here is one example: Why does Harrison Ford follow the boy throughout the whole movie? I did not read the book, so I'm guessing it is just because it's based on that. But it is not realistic at all. First he is some kind of scout agent on that school... Then he suddenly is the boss on that next training base too, and at the end he is the high bossguy who sort of seems to be in command on that planet base too. I real life I don't think someone with that high a rank would bother to scout the new kids personally.Anyway, this is just a small example. There are a lot of other things that just don't seem right. From parts that feel rushed, to things that just don't seem realistic (like: they play that game in a sphere that is about as big as the whole rest of the space-station, but they have to yell at each-other to communicate...) It kind of bothered me.But again: don't pay too much attention to those things and the movie is enjoyable enough.",Ender's Game
386,Arni-Bjorgvinsson,Surprisingly good,8,20 April 2014,"Having loved the entire Ender's world for years, I was really hesitant to watch this movie. Too many times have movies made from good books failed to accurately portray said books, but likewise many such movies are very good on their own.Surprisingly, this movie actually fits the second description.It is no spoiler to tell fans of the books that the movie leaves many things out. That is a given with most any such movie, because it's simply impossible to fit everything from the book into such a ""short"" movie and still keep the audience engaged. The story IS rushed, and I can understand that some fans will find that annoying enough to talk the movie down.That being said, when I try to see the movie as a somewhat abridged version of the book and just a movie in it's own right, it actually turned out very well.Harrison Ford is good, the kids did very well, the score is fantastic, the cinematography brilliant and the CGI pretty much flawless.It does have flaws in the story which could and *should* have been fixed to maintain the original storyline, so I'll only give it an 8/10, but it's definitely a good movie.Very enjoyable!",Ender's Game
387,iceqbeic,Just love this one!,10,15 March 2014,"I've watched Ender's Game about three or four times now. And it still grows on me.It isn't just yet one more nice CGI sci-fi story although it's really fantastic as such.This movie tells us about us. About us as human kind. About our inhumanity and also about our humanity.So much of this movie is focused on the violence present in our lives, but also on love. Love for thine enemy. And the loathing of violence excessive.The story focuses on a gangling mid-teen boy after the near apocalypse and his way from cadet to something a lot more. It doesn't deal with his pains of growing up, because he isn't allowed to. It deals with his pains of realizing what monstrosities he is capable of and what he has been forced to become quite against his will. It deals with his capacity for love amidst mayhem and his loyalty with something more than what he has won.Let us all learn from the example Ender sets.",Ender's Game

This is the kind of movie where you want a edge of seat feeling. The movie starts off fast pace and immersed right into the beginning battle. From that point on it doesn't stop. The graphics are very top natch. The actors that play the characters did a wonderful job. If your a fan of Galactica,star craft, Eve,and yes even Star Trek this is the movie for you.

389,mike-puorro,A victim of social politics,10,13 February 2014,"Orson Scott Card wrote Ender's Game before same sex marriage was even on the table as a hot button social issue. There are no political messages regarding this subject in the book, or in the movie.The author is not preoccupied with forwarding an agenda. He simply made a few comments which amounted to him favoring traditional marriage, and suddenly he, every fan of his work, is labeled a bigot.What does any of that have to do with Ender Wiggin, and his struggle to save mankind while maintaining his humanity? I grew up with the science fiction and fantasy books of Orson Scott Card. This movie is a dynamic and imaginative revisit to one of the happier memories of my childhood.I'm not going to let social politics take this movie away from me.

390,astroman292002,Eh..,5,6 November 2013,"Despite what I might, personally, think of the author, he wrote a good series. Although my last reading of Ender's Game was about fifteen years back, I remember it fondly, especially the balance between character development, action and plot flow. The movie has little of that balance. I was left feeling like I had viewed an unedited version, with the transition and character development scenes yet to be added, and the ""catch phrases"" that focused the book, just crammed in, any place they might fit- irrespective of chronological logic or story. As I was pulled from one jagged scene to the next, there was little time to know or care about the characters or the plot (I didn't even care about the fate of the human race- which is a tough trick to pull off). I found myself wondering how anyone unfamiliar with the book could even get anything from the movie experience.Yes, adding another half hour for character and plot development might have helped, some; however, even more important would have been writing and directing that showed some understanding of what actually made the book worth reading. This just felt like a rushed mess.",Ender's Game
391,RedBearAK,Shockingly Un-Disappointing,9,6 November 2013,"Like many sci-fi fans who have read this book, and been severely disappointed by many horrible, half-baked book-to-film adaptations of many other excellent books of all genres (but especially sci-fi), I went into this film fully expecting to be at best mildly entertained, and at worst once again severely disappointed by a terrible film that looked great in previews. By the time it was halfway over I was already slack-jawed in amazement at what the director, writers, producers and actors had managed to accomplish. Not since the Lord of the Rings adaptations have I been this impressed with a movie based on a book. Many are saying, for some reason, that the acting is bad or nonexistent, and characters one-dimensional. I have said similar things about many, many other films, and bad acting is one of the things that ruins many movies for me, but that was not my impression of this film. To me, the acting here was precisely on point and precisely what was required to tell THIS STORY with THESE CHARACTERS. In fact, the lead actor in particular gave an extraordinary performance as far as I'm concerned. Subtle and precise. Even the bullies/villains were accurate and not over or underdone. It followed the essence of the book extremely well. Key word: essence. People are also saying that no one could possibly ""get"" this movie or follow the plot without reading the book. These are all people who have read the book, of course, and believe their understanding of the story is vastly superior simply because they've read the book. On the contrary, I believe it's quite easy to follow the plot, and I think it's best if you've either never read the book or read it so long ago that you've had time to forget some of the finer details. My wife has never read the book and is no particular fan of sci-fi or fantasy, but she was easily able to pick up on all the subtle psychological plot points and ethical concepts and character relationships that made the story so great, and found nothing confusing about the plot at all. The important parts are all there, unless you slept through half the movie. Will you have an even deeper understanding of the story if you read the book? Sure. But that will always be true with any book adaptation. If you've just recently read (or re-read) the book and you have a good imagination and expect this movie to perfectly match the ""movie"" you saw in your mind's eye when you read the book, well, I hate to tell you this but no movie will ever be able to match that. Any details that don't match your imagination will probably grate on your nerves. If however you have more reasonable expectations and have any idea how hard it is to bring together hundreds of people to create a film like this and have it turn out anywhere near this good and this true to the heart and soul of the source material, you will hopefully realize when you see it that you are privileged to witness something quite extraordinary. Gratifyingly, the filmmakers were able to restrain themselves from pulling any typical Hollywood idiocy and inserting some kind of maudlin teen romance that A) was not in the book and B) would be totally unnecessary to tell the story. My wife and I both thank them for that. After the film we were discussing how impressed we were that it was specifically NOT ruined in such a way, when it so easily could have been. So go see Ender's Game. And when the DVD comes out, buy it. In this particular case the filmmakers deserve to be richly rewarded. It may not qualify as a masterpiece for the ages but it is very, very, VERY good. And I can say with absolute certainty that you will never in your lifetime see a better adaptation of one of the best sci-fi novels ever written.",Ender's Game
392,oskar-ziaja,This and the book are not related,5,20 January 2014,"The book had so much richness connected to the plot and character psychology. You could really understand why things were happening and what the characters were feeling and thinking. Ender's brilliance was what made him the key role. The way he would deal with the sharpness that was constantly trying to slice into him. Major plot points were skipped. Ender moved on from scene to scene without much incite into his motives and what he had conquered on each step. Some decent visuals and effects, yet for a highly advanced future it seemed a bit plane. Lack of holograms and such. The holopad being just a tablet seemed too plane. Battle room scenes were quite nicely done. Making battle room scenes with 80 people would have been impossible anyway. I recommend to read the book. It's a work of art and this movie just doesn't measure up.",Ender's Game
393,uxulike,Too much like the book?,8,30 October 2013,"The book was written a long time ago. It's great, a real classic but it has a thoughtful vibe that probably suited the time more than it does now. If you read that book, and you no doubt enjoyed it you will feel that book in this movie in terms of tone, etc. That will be something great to experience and it's fun looking at how it was interpreted. (apart from mazer's terrible accent). Problem is you know the plot so... limited appeal. But if you're new to the whole thing you might well find this movie a bit ploddy in places, a bit old fashioned.... A bit... clunky. Yes the cgi is modern and yes the basic plot is still up there, but the enemy... nothing you haven't seen before now. But at the end of all that it's still almost brilliant, and well worth seeing. Just realise its inspiration is the cold war and back then Atari still made video games. Don't judge it and just enjoy the story, and you'll have a great time.",Ender's Game

The main character was so intelligent and a great thinker throughout the movie. His thought process blew my mind throughout the entire movie.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys action movies. It wasn't extremely violent or gory like most movies today.

The technology was good enough, using the drone at the first place but the commander tricks ender that the pilot was real and not a drone. Why not straighten the stories with the drone, and why the commander have to lied to Ender that is the real pilots that make sacrifices. Big question there, Enders said that ""after 50 years the alien was flew and never comeback"", fifty years?c'mon and still using pilots for the jets/plane?the US already using a drone dude. Now the stories, it just focused on one person ""Ender's"". there are so many psychological materials there. As example is when Ender's being tested with some bullies from his friends at the academy on earth, and the battle academy for the commander ranks. etc...there are so many messages that we can take, like controlling the anger/anger management.One more, why I was gave this rate, six points, because there are some nonsense alien. The alien was a cockroach or more like a mantis, and look at their legs because no arms. For examples like the queen, how can she hold a cup?even making a huge planes/ships?with laser on it? c'mon...it's make me laugh. The movies is little bit rush I think.

Asa Butterfield is principle as the mighty oak, with no depth in character and no warmth at all as the lead. Ben Kingsley (Pine) has in one film ruined his career. Harrison Ford (Douglas fir) is obviously after one more paycheck at the expense of any artistic integrity... I guess you can see how much I think the casting sucks.I read elsewhere that this is just Harry Potter in space and I inclined to agree with that statement. If your over 30 and have half a brain cell, you'll not like this one bit. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. This shows one of the great IMDb mysteries of how such an awful film has a 7.2 average.",Ender's Game

First impression: good. First reason casting is great, Harrisson Ford and the young actor are really good, especially the boy. Second reason, the (complex) story is quite well rendered. Overall experience is good, and as a fan of Scott card I really loved the movie. I was expecting more though, as many parts of the books are not well described. The beginning for example where Ender is very small, the terror of Peter, the long long boring fights in the military school, and of course the video game that Ender plays, all theses would have needed much more time, but it is a movie so you need to cut things  But definitely worth it!

398,ipyronigma,Have not read book (Minor Spoilers),5,14 February 2014,"I did not read the book, so I am not aware of how good of an adaptation it was. I have watched several movies and read several books where the characters are kids, but I have to say only in movies dialogues are bad. It does not appear real or at least to me; it just will not allow me to feel empathy for the protagonist. As we start the movie we are presented with a boy (very intelligent boy apparently... that is what they said) who gets bullied by schoolmates? recruits? I am not sure what they are but they hate him for some reason. It felt that the characters had rich background stories and great development but we knew nothing at all. GIVE ME SOMETHING D*MMIT. Near the middle to end some sort of respect appears out of nothing in everyone and suddenly Ender's got some kind of romantic interest with someone... though in the film they had just met. Then there is the annoying ""pendejo"", he seems to be a milestone in Ender's military career but: Hey, it doesn't matter 'cause you'll never see him again!

Funny how some reviewers found the movie too short, I was contemplating to leave after an hour. At the end they set it up for a sequel (as usual these days of course) but I will not fall again.Target audience is 10-14 teenage boys, if you're out of this bracket save your time and money and do something else.",Ender's Game
400,Seamus_Riley,Never Believe Book Fans..Judge Independently,9,13 January 2015,"A current average of 6.7 here on IMDb is the most unfair overall rating for anything I've watched in a very long time - so much so, that this is my first time commenting on IMDb.I've never read the book, so went in cold. Based on some of the reviews I read here, before watching it - I almost decided it was something for kids, people with no imagination and overall a poor film.Thankfully, I decided to ignore the majority who saw fault. I'm no film buff, and will not pretend to be. I can only be honest and say, that this was a very well acted and thought provoking film.Whilst it receives a 12 rating, much of the content regarding humanity and the implications of conflict/war are in fact very adult in nature - and presented as such, without a sense of flippancy.There was something else I felt throughout the film - and that was a correlation to the Battlestar Galactica genre. In a vague way admittedly, but mankind vs an alien race, where just who is the better of the two on balance, is unclear. Additionally the whole look of the film, the vessels, the training program for recruits..and a fair bit more - constantly had me thinking of the BSG universe..in a positive way.The acting I've mentioned, was excellent. For fans of pure action, this is NOT your thing. It was more about the dichotomy of what is the right thing to do, and how does a young boy with natural raw talents take on something as overwhelming as the challenges he's faced with as the film progresses.It's definitely one of those films where you have to look, acknowledge and appreciate the true scale of the challenges that the young hero has to contend with. Asa felt believable, tough (though compassionate), caring and disturbed throughout the film. Harrison played his part as the driven, almost tyrannical military leader who recruited him brilliantly.The film skips along at a quick pace, whilst not seeming like a blur of constant action, and certainly not one to watch if you don't give it 100% attention throughout.So that's my short and simple first review. If you ignore the overall rating as I did - and perhaps forget about the book if you've read it - then watch and judge this on it's own merits, because it really is a film that has a sublime brilliance to it and worth the time watching.",Ender's Game
401,Nevele,Stunning but Rushed,7,23 December 2013,"I won't make this a long review. Ender's game was a highly enjoyable movie to watch. The surroundings, the spaceships, the planets, all is absolutely stunning and great to see. The casting and acting are well done. The movie feels very rushed and chopped though. You're going through a great story with light speed, and none of us could shake the feeling that this movie could've done with at least half an hour more. The speed in which this story is told doesn't leave enough room to establish the characters, and certainly not to see their progress through the story.I will eagerly await the 3,5 hour during directors cut in a year or 2, hopefully.",Ender's Game

Just when you think that maybe, just maybe, it might get interesting, it ends.On top of that it felt like a bad Harry Potter carbon copy, only it was set in space and much more boring.

From beginning to end, you are left wondering where the story is going to take you, what is going on and you cannot help having mixed feelings for Harrison Ford's character. There are aliens, space, earth, family, friends, bullying, everything. You cannot guess what is going to happen and you are constantly wondering where the story is going to end up.

Solid visual effects (and I mean better than most movies of the kind), an entertaining story that doesn't get boring half way through the movie. But honestly that should all be expected! The question remains: How well does it recreate the books underlying battle between good and evil?In my opinion, very well. I am thoroughly impressed by this movie. It tries and succedes in bringing Ender's feelings, both good and evil, to the big screen (or for me my home cinema) in an entertaining fashion. It has been a long time (a very long time) so I hardly remembered anything from the book. The movie brought back everything, the end however still surprised me. I honestly didn't remember.I must however critique one point here and that is the beginning of the end. The end is good, the beginning of the end however felt a bit rushed. The movie could have spent a bit more time dwelling on Ender's feelings there.In closing, the movie is great, the music is good, visuals are fantastic just the end sticks out compared to the rest.
A solid 7/10 from me",Ender's Game
406,ilyak,"Masterful visuals, mediocre story",8,25 June 2014,"The film strongest point are its visuals. In short - it looks very nice indeed. Splendid colors, great views of foreign planet, nice choice of spacecraft design. The story is seriously dumbed down version of the book but it has its refining moments. At least it is not all cliché and is interesting to watch, there is nothing broken. Kids are very likable and play well. Adult roles are not particularly interesting or well-played, which is a shame, but the script did not give them much room anyway. All in all I could recommend viewing this... but only after reading the book, so the film would not spoil much better book for you.",Ender's Game
407,musesboy,Will probably work well for fans of the book,8,3 November 2013,"I'm a big reader of science fiction, and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series is probably my favorite. The only things that come close are Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. I've read Ender's Game more than 10 times, including two or three occasions on which I finished it in a single sitting. One of my college papers is based on the novel and is published on Card's website.Yes, I'm a fan.So, as you can imagine, I have been looking forward to an Ender's Game movie long before I ever thought it might happen. For me, it had the potential to be the best science fiction movie ever made, if done well. After assembling a strong cast, my expectations could not have been higher as I sat down to watch the IMAX version today.The basic premise is that an alien race, known as the Formics or Buggers, invaded Earth fifty years ago. The invading fleet was defeated, but another attack is expected. In order to be ready to face a species that learns from its mistakes, the International Fleet has come up with a strategy: A program was established to observe the behavior of young children, hoping that the best young geniuses of the time would be able to become the top military strategists by the time they were needed. Ender Wiggin was chosen as one of the trainees.The movie deviates considerably from the book, but it's necessary. I am not here to tell you why the book is better, I'm here to tell you whether Ender's Game works as a movie. However, I must explain some of the key differences. In the book, Ender begins his training at the age of six, while all of the trainees in the movie appear to be 15 or older. I understand that it would be impossible to find dozens of 6-year-old actors capable of carrying this story. Also, the sequence of events is different. Bean, who is a key character, meets Ender immediately, rather than a few years into his training. Ender's training is supposed to take around eight years, but it seems to happen in months.The biggest weakness of the movie is the way the battle training is condensed. Again, I realize that few people would want to watch four hours of training, but some of the suspense is missing because so little time is devoted to key events. Some events in the book seem unfair to Ender, but without the background information, anyone who hasn't read the book will miss the significance. Whenever I read Ender's Game, I become Ender Wiggin and experience the satisfaction of his achievements. I'm glad to say that I experienced similar feelings during the movie.IMDb claims that the movie is an action movie, but that's not the case. Don't go into this expecting battle sequences or laser fights. They do exist, but not in the form you might expect. I am actually impressed that Hollywood didn't ruin the movie by trying to include too much action.Ender's Game is essentially about leadership, and why individuals choose to follow certain people. Everyone in the school is a genius, but Ender is a good leader because he gains the trust, loyalty, and even love of his followers. The book is full of tactics, and we see Ender and his army discover and develop skills over the course of several years. The armies are comprised of 40 soldiers who are typically split into four Toons of 10 soldiers during battle. I doubt a casual viewer will come away from this movie even knowing what a Toon is. We certainly aren't shown how Ender's Dragon Army uses tactics that are completely new. On the plus side, the ending could not have been better, and I was excited to see an important scene present and handled well.So, does this movie work at all? As someone who knows all of the background to Ender's story, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it come alive on the big screen. The acting was good and the special effects spectacular, although my Kiwi friend reliably informs me that Ben Kingsley butchered the accent. Most of the key events in the book are touched upon, and a fan of the series will automatically catch the references and fill in the blanks. A complete newcomer to the story will probably have a good time, but come away wondering why Ender's Game is often regarded as the best science fiction book ever written.I hope that the movie will be successful enough to spawn a sequel. Speaker for the Dead is a much deeper story, and shows what happens to Ender after the war. However, with some people boycotting the movie due to their dislike of Card's politics, I'm not sure whether a sequel will be possible.I'll be adding Ender's Game to my collection as soon as it is released on Blu-ray, but it would be wrong of me to automatically give it 5/5 just because I love the books. That said, it's a good attempt to make a coherent story out of very difficult material. It's hard to show people thinking. If you do like the movie and haven't read the book, I urge you to do so.

409,daniellabrador_,Great sci-fi movie; lacks a bit of character development,10,11 October 2021,"The first time I watched the movie, I immediately loved the character. I never had heard of its book counterpart before. So I looked it up and also fell in love with the book.I understand why so much of the plot must be cut in order to fit the novel into a standard film length but I think the film could have done better if there were a bit less narration and more dialogue, focusing on the isolation, pressure and manipulation they put on Ender.",Ender's Game
410,ellie2u,OK movie but not Ender's game,6,28 May 2014,"A lot has been said already. The story of the movie is far from the book. The movie is quite alright if you look at it as a separate story. But if you love the book it isn't up to par.First of all I missed the evolution in time. If you see the movie you think it is a time span of a few weeks, maybe some months. In the book Ender grows up from a child to a teen. In that way the cruelty of the academy is even worse. By the time Ender is a teen, his childhood is long gone. In the book the mind-game is a true companion. He learns from it, he confronts himself trough it and it takes him further in the mind of the Buggers. The fact that he remains compassionate is short of a miracle.Second, what I miss in the movie is the build-up of the training sessions, first as a launcher, then under the Salamander army and later his own Dragon army. The way he and Alai started to experiment, the fact that he froze his legs to save the day and the way he gave Bean room to experiment on his own with a small squadron. Others joined him because he was good and had fresh ideas. Not because he made a message appear. Third, I missed the build-up of the battles he endures as a captain. They become more and more unfair. When he realizes they are giving him hell after hell he refuses to play. In the movie it seems as if he is giving up after one battle. This gives the impression he is weak.Fourth, fifth and sixth, I hated the way they handled everything after his meet and greet with Valentine. Because it deviates to much from the book. When he meets Mazor for the first time it takes longer to get the communication up to speed. Then Ender is put in isolation to lead his troops. First they do play simulations and it is only after a while that Mazor claims to create the simulation. Petra suffers a burn-out and doesn't like to take risks afterward. In the end he is forbidden to return to earth and he discovers the playground from his game and finds the egg. At no time does he meet a Bugger in the flesh.And last but not least I miss the storyline between Peter and Valentine. Demosthenes and Locke are instrumental to keep peace on earth. In conclusion I think they should have made a miniseries of the book not a simple movie. The book is multi-layered, complex and captivating. The movie is food for the masses, nice but hollow.",Ender's Game
411,ejvind76,Mindblowingly bad acting,1,29 January 2014,"I'm amazed by the positive reviews this movie is getting. I haven't read any of the books, so I sat down to watch it, without bias or expectations. Now 2 hours of violent eye-rolling, has left me with a headache.The unbelievably shallow characters coupled with the horrendously bad acting, made me resent the kids - from the sickeningly emotional and constantly teary-eyed Ender, to the laughably pathetic bully Gonzo, or whatever his name was.The movie's only impressive feat, is the production crew's ability to refrain from groaning loudly when forced to witness the cast's ""performances""!

The premise that children would be selected to lead a war machine because they can handle ""complex"" situations better than adults is so contradictory to common experience that it is insulting as well as ridiculous. Right, like anyone would want a 6-year-old or an 8-year-old to lead, um, *anything*. The major ""training"" activity, playing laser tag in zero-G, has absolutely no relevance to the skill set needed to achieve the goal of defeating the Formics. Might as well have had the children play a game of flag football or cut out paper dolls. Terrible movie. Even the nonstop, monotonous CGI looked cheap.",Ender's Game

The details differ enough that it won't feel like too much of a spoiler.If you have read the book first, the answer gets more complicated. You could still watch the movie, but if it matters to you how closely the movie follows the story ... you risk disappointment.

Action scenes where not too long to be boring. Special effect looked smooth. Ending looked well made. Would rush to cinema to see part 2, if ever made. I would watch it again, probably with people who don't normally watch these kind of movies. Adviced to all sci-fi fans who think 2001: A Space Odyssey is crap, who enjoy lighter side of sci-fi.

Some of the greatest movies ever made had less to work with and are forever on people's lists of favorites. I will even name a few of the greats. Alien. The original (Black and white) Godzilla.

I have not read any of the books so I went in head-first to a movie I knew nothing about, a move I would soon come to regret. Before I start with some spoilers (nothing too major, just some of the things that annoyed me the most but read at your own will, I'll give the warning beforehand) I must say that the graphics were awesome. But if graphics alone are what gives this movie such high ratings, then IMDb is nothing more than a shallow site full off shallow people only caring about good graphics, completely disregarding any lack of plot (or seriously nonsensical such).*THIS FOLLOWING TEXT CONTAINS SPOILERS*Don't get me wrong. I love the premises of the story. The beginning of the movie is superb. We have the brainy kid as our protagonist. The way he handles issues are inspiring. Even I wish I had some of that thinking process he has. But then we have the completely useless adults who must rely on kids to handle the ""complete annihilation of mankind"". And still, it is the adults that build these awesome spaceships. Are you kidding me? You mean to tell me that I have to believe that kids are our weapons, that adults are useless, EVEN WHILE the adults built those overly over-the-top spaceships but cannot come up with a single strategy to save their asses but have to rely on kids to their work? Like it took that much of a strategy to do what the kids did? Give me a break. A thousand words are not enough to describe how ridiculous the plot is. But all I can do is to try to sum it up in a couple of words: Ridiculous, drawn-out, nonsensical, stupid. It more or less feels like they put a couple of scripts together and added some nice graphics. 5/10 even feels like a bit too much, but the beginning was good.",Ender's Game
418,bellantoni1,Pretend you never read the book...,10,9 November 2013,"I haven't read the book, so I'm undisturbed by the ""flaws"" so many of the book's fans kvetch about. Book and film are such radically different mediums (or ""media,"" if you prefer) that a complete re-conception is required when adapting novel to screen. And no two people will ever agree on the way it should be done. Personally, I appreciated that the action scenes were kept brief and crucial to the story's development. The main characters had more room to breathe than in most action-oriented movies, where they have only about two hours to work with. I also appreciated that they avoided the deadly boring black-and-white contrivance of ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy"" (which utterly ruined Avatar, in my opinion). The ideas of empathy and ruthlessness, preemptive strike or diplomacy, fascism and individuality, winning and the cost of survival, were all interwoven and given authentic voices. The characters were about as nuanced as could possibly be expected in a sf alien battle movie. It's a shame so many people chose to make it about whining over Card's beliefs, which were consistently exaggerated when not outright misrepresented. The homosexual activists seem determined to silence those who conclude, based on reason and logic and not just ""faith,"" that homosexuality is disordered, and that marriage is not a right but an institution founded on human nature and the procreative function that deserves safeguarding from distortion and defiling. There's only one clear and compelling interest that the government has in marriage--the engendering and raising of subsequent generations. Which is impossible between two people of the same sex. Card is on the correct side of the argument, regardless of how unpopular it is with the strident, yowling liberals.",Ender's Game

Do you think a 2 hours long movie can highlight all the details and conversation if the book is really that great and there is so much in it? Do you want to see a sequel (or a prequel, according to others about the lack of background story in this movie). Leave the movie alone and try not to use the book as an weapon to put up against the movie itself, after all, they are two fields of art and they both deserve to uphold their way to tell a story.Ender's game the movie chosen both the right child actors and adult. There's no missing link even to an outsider of the story. The visual effect and graphic design outstanding a lot of Hollywood movies by giving meaning to a lot of scenes. There is not a single unnecessary shot in this movie, very smooth.

It might be enjoyable for a younger audience, especially teenagers.Unfortunately, for a movie that displays battle of wits at length, it offers a story so poor that having a brain is not required to follow it.The plus point is that CGI is decent and it has young actors.On the other hand what was intended to come out as witty dialogs just sounded unnatural sometimes even just a pathetic attempt. If you're into science-fiction and/or looking for an interesting movie, this is a poor excuse for the genre.Despite the fact that this movie had a considerable budget and some skilled people, it remains a very average movie.

The acting sucked, from both kids & adults (specially the drill sergeant, he was a joke). Everything just felt so... false and repetitive. Nothing special with the visual effects. There's a scene in which they are marching to training while ""singing"" at the same time, they must all be very good ventriloquists since you can clearly see their mouths closed but the voices still sound as if they where shouting, so lame to have those kind of mistakes in a movie with this type of budget.

I would love to see what the director could have done with another hour, as time was obviously a limiting factor. But the cuts to the story were surgical and precise, allowing what was left to have its maximum impact.The acting was superb, and made me miss some of the characters even more. But time constraints are time constraints and that's films for you.The special effects were so good that they stopped being special effects for me. Although I have to say some of the zero-G acting was a little off.The ending was slightly changed for reasons I don't really understand, and a big reveal was hinted at a little too much.

423,Max-Wri,"Gavin Hood's ""The Last Airbender""",6,5 November 2013,"Book to film adaptations are some of the hardest films to make and that statement certainly holds true for the modern, median-dystopian Orson Scott Card classic, ""Ender's Game."" The epic, about genius children being humanity's last military hope for salvation, falls far short of the multi-layered emotional and psychological story and depth of the literary source.From the very beginning of the film it becomes painfully apparent that even characters as key to the story as Peter and Valentine, Ender's older siblings, will be incredibly glossed over, getting screen time of perhaps just 3-4 minutes. Even characters like Bean (who spawns his own novel), Petra, and Ender's other friends and subordinates have, apparently, no importance in the story or apparent affect on any of the events that occur. Because of the deflation of characters the depth and backstory of the film suffers to an insurmountable degree.It can't be denied that the visuals and CG are awesome; the acting is great, good enough that it can't even be compared to 'child-acting;' the moody soundtrack is effective; it serves as a most valiant effort.However there is too much that's wrong to consider the film a worthy adaptation. Gavin Hood, director, has served the film on a platter, coddling the audience, grabbing their hand and tugging them along through the story with voice-overs and a dumbed down story. Hood has cut out so much character development from a story with as many psychological and emotional layers that it could be compared to a Kafkaesque Inception that it becomes increasingly obvious as the film plods along that more care was given for the appearance than for the story itself. It seems that the benefit of having original source material was taken for granted, apparently a common fault for film adaptations.Just as an example of the thoughtless of the story, let's take a look at the set-up of the computer simulations in Command School. In the book it seems that Ender, along with his subordinates, has a control console with which to directly command ships as well as view the battle as he'd like, meaning that Ender could manually command a single carrier ship or view the battle as a whole. In the film Ender is sans console, having something that is instead more of a command podium. Ender has no manual controls, only having hand controls in real space with which to alter the view of the simulation. By necessity, because of his lack of manual control, Ender cannot directly command a single vessel, but must, by definition of this set-up, delegate to his subordinates. Unfortunately Hood has the gall to leave in a scene following a failed mission where Graff berates Ender for focusing too heavily on singular ships, instructing him to delegate more to his toon leaders, whereas this mistaken director somehow has the nerve to reduce the size of a Battleschool army from 41 to 16, a massive oversight and huge depletion of possible development.While the film would no-doubt be a standalone film of notable entertainment and mediocre merit it utterly fails as an adaptation. The barely 110 minute film will eternally serve as Gavin Hood's ""The Last Airbender.""",Ender's Game

There were only a few instances of ... what the school leaders were doing to him. Some battles were skipped.

It is needed to be said in the review, because even with all the effort it is impossible for me to review the movie without influence of the book.Movie did actually better job than I expected. I liked the cast of the main characters, Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Both did very good job. A big positive surprise for me was the visual aspect of the movie, I liked it actually so much, it is the main reason, why I keep my rating for the movie so high despite the negatives.The biggest problem of the Ender's Game adaptation is the race against the time. The movie tries to squeeze huge amount of information in a short time and it just does not work. I cannot imagine, how I would feel without having any background information from the book. Even if we can discuss whether the ""Earth"" sideline with Ender's siblings has to or doesn't have to be in the movie (it does not), there is the main storyline describing Ender's time spend in Battle school and it is handled so shallowly and quickly, it hurts. This story just needs more space. Without it there is almost no character development. No emotions towards side characters, like Bean or Petra or all the others, barely recognizable for the viewer. Even the great ending is ripped of emotions partially because of it. I felt all the aspects of the movie are more handled as trailers to that aspect than actually diving into it.

But then I stepped back and looked at it as a whole.There was no risk, no intensity, you weren't worried about earths survival, you weren't worried about Ender. There was no stakes at all. Let's start with the crux of the story, is it worth the moral dilemma of stealing the youth of these amazingly brilliant children, breaking them down, and building them into soldiers. I didn't experience any hardship from Ender, or any of the other children. Nor did I see them training, or being pushed beyond there limits. Which means that we didn't see anything in Ender that would make us believe that his fellow students, would follow him, die for him, trust and respect him. They didn't show anything about his brilliance, although I think the argument with Dap and Gaff was supposed to show that, when all it showed was he was whiny. The game simulations, were so poorly done, I knew the purpose and even I didn't understand what they were doing.

I've watched it 3 times without the book to refer to and can't find anything wanting; not the excellent cast, direction, production design, or compelling story. It stands alongside Pacific Rim and Oblivion as one of the trio of overshadowed summer sci-fi films whose unexpected pleasures will make them favorites to the people who give them a chance on DVD. From the fan outcry I take it Ender's Game fails to deliver whatever fans found in the books and has been watered down on its way to the screen. We all know than adapting a book to a movie is a matter of translating one form to another in the same way that raw wheat needs to be processed if it is to become a cake. Different forms have different requirements and, taken on its own terms, Ender's Game is an excellent film which will have special meaning to young people who can identify with Ender's struggles, hardships, the isolation of school, the expectations of others, bullying, gaming and his own violent temper. Interestingly, other books which were changed in order to be filmed include Blade Runner, 2001:, The Hunger Games, all Harry Potter books, all Shakespeare's works, The Lord Of The Rings books, the James Bond series, Dune, 2000 Leagues Under The Sea, Pinocchio, The Wizard Of Oz, The DaVinci Code and thousands more - many of them became classics just as I predict Ender's Game The Movie will.

431,ash-x12,A butchered adaptation,5,24 May 2014,"I give this movie a generous 5 out of 10. To no extent should this movie ever be considered great or even good. As someone who is a fan of Scott- Cards writing, especially Enders Game, I expected nothing less than exceptional acting, and promising story conviction. The movie lacked in pretty much every aspect. The special-effects were less than impressive; seeing it was a science-fiction based novel/movie, I assumed they would bring out great(ER) effects, if not that, amazing cinematography, which they did not. The movie failed not only visually, but on a simplistic matter of story line. First off, there was no character development what so ever and the dialog was less than stimulating. Noting that I've read the book, I knew they would trail off a bit, but I didn't suspect that they would completely rewrite the story. Not only did they portray each character wrong, or add characters in when they weren't supposed to be there (BEAN) but they also left out the complex line of events from Valentine and Peter- whom in the end of the movie should have played a BIG role. As well as taking out significant parts in Enders life (deaths, fights, conversations)so the rating would be low enough for younger children to see. Personally, I think changing anything to get a different audience to watch is wrong, specifically when it's a film adaptation. Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the adaptation of one of the best science-fiction books I've ever read and as a student studying film and the history of film, I was let down by this sorry-excuse of a movie. It was more of a tragedy. In all, I give it a 5, only because I could recognize the effort that went into the film, but they didn't execute it in a way where I was expecting.

432,SkyLordPanglot,"False promises, bad dialogue, tons of clichés",2,8 December 2016,"I realize that maybe 2/10 is pretty low score for a movie that didn't look all that bad, but let me talk about this. One of the most important things in a story is viewer's (or reader's) hook. This is done by promises. Often time books have prologue that shows a bit of the world and says ""Here is what this world is about."" and then starts and zero ground building up to the climax promised. In some ways the trailers of the movies are similar. What I hated most of all things about this movie is that its trailers promised sci-fi, action and adventure. Instead the movie delivered huge amount of drama. I am not saying that drama is a bad genre, but the biggest problem with this movie is that it promises a different thing. The trailer will bring people who want action into drama movie and they will hate it, while people who like drama wont think of watching this. I was one of these people. I expected Star wars and it was instead The bold and the beautiful. Next thing I want to talk about is the characters. Most of the characters seemed like copy of the same person. Every person from the children to elderly were like majors in psychology with twenty years of field practice. The children were not acting for their age. The leaders weren't teaching future heroes, but were acting as if the kids were slaves. This is why all the dialogues were extremely fake. There were no real motivations behind the actions of most people. Bullies were like that for the sake of the plot. Harrison Ford was firm and didn't allow insubordination because of the plot. The pilot that simply crashed his plane into the mother ship was master tactician for the sake of the plot. Everything felt like Deus ex machina with tons of clichés and characters that were copies of each other. The effects weren't bad at all and the sound wasn't bad either. However a movie cant get away with a good mark just because of that. After all before everything there has to be a good story and fulfilled promises. 2 out of 10 is a vote that comes mostly from the misleading, trailer. If I was promised drama and I came to watch this it may have came up to 5 or 6, but I wasn't.",Ender's Game

The visual effects are top notch, but nothing less is acceptable anymore these days. I was also impressed by the acting from the younger actors throughout the film, I usually struggle to take child actors seriously, but these kids brought good acting chops to the table. (But I'm also a pretty bad judge of acting typically, unless it's incredibly sub par). I'm glad they managed to focus the movie on the children, I had fears that it would be more about Ford than anyone else, but he features just enough to be great in my books.

This was an astonishingly good adaptation. It managed to avoid becoming yet another action flick set in space, and didn't shy away from the deeper questions raised by the book.(A few scenes were softened: replacing 2 deaths with ""hospitalization"" - which I'm sure was done for the PG13 rating - and making video games deaths far less gruesome.) That being said, this is an adaptation. Film and literature are completely different media and have different strengths. While all the important scenes were touched on, the time frame was very condensed in the film. While in the novel, Ender is in battle school for years, the film gives the impression that this all takes place over a few months.One benefit to this condensation is that it makes the casting of Asa Butterfield far more reasonable. He (and the other actors) are MUCH too old for the characters in the beginning of the story, if one goes by the novel, but are a reasonable age for where they are by the end.I would have liked to see more of the mind game, and also more Peter. But all in all, a much better adaptation than I'd feared.Regarding the boycott: While Orson Scott Card's anti-gay politics are not portrayed in this movie, I will still be donating the price of my and my husband's ticket to the ACLU. I encourage any others who enjoy quality SF but to not support OSC's anti-gay agenda to make a similar donation to the LGBT or human rights organization of their choice.",Ender's Game
436,alex-xela-alex,"As a Fan of the Book, I Thought the Film Was Great: Also, Boycotting It Is Silly",9,16 November 2013,"It makes me awfully sad that a film like Pacific Rim has the same rating as Ender's Game. This is not just another stupid sci-fi cliché special FX-fest.I've loved the book for a long time. I had low expectations for the film as I'd expected the producers to turn it into a special FX stunt show with clichés about alien invasions. But no: overall, I was really pleasantly surprised and moved. I don't know: maybe I'm biased because of my affinity for the book, but I thought it was a really good adaptation. A whole plethora of scenes gave me nerd-thrills, and having read the book I could fill in the missing details.Yes, as you'd expect, the film skims over certain parts: some of my favourite parts of Ender's development are in his progression through Battle School, especially in turning the Dragon Team into the best team. The film slims this section down, not really showing Ender's strategic genius, but more suggesting it instead. Valentine is a bit of a plastic character. The entire bit about her web political writing is skipped. But it still manages to capture the essence of the book. It captures the disturbing nature of training little kids (who, by the way, are the some of the best kid-actors I've seen in a while). It captures the dilemma's Ender's put through, and the way Graff has to treat him. Also, it's beautiful! Well shot and fantastic visuals. Oh, and for those who are talking about boycotting the film for Orson's homophobic views: that's ridiculous. First off, Orson is hardly the only stakeholder in this film, there are so many other people who don't deserve a boycott. Besides which, economically boycotting someone is not the way to deal with views that you disagree with. You show that people's views are wrong by showing that they're wrong and bigoted, not by stifling their ability to express their views at all (not that boycotting the film would even accomplish that). Anyway, we're probably funding so many other corporate criminals and scumbags and bigots on a daily basis with every purchase. And finally: Orson himself might be a bigot but that doesn't mean this film doesn't send a message that is so much more thoughtful and sensitive than most other big-blockbuster sci-film about war and aliens. Watching his film will probably have a stronger moral effect than boycotting Orson will.If you're a fan of the book, watch the film and decide for yourself if you like: the reviews are all so mixed it's hard to tell.",Ender's Game

So many crucial parts were left out that take away from the story. The movie felt like a cliff notes version of the book that cut out too many important factors. The story could have easily been turned into a Trilogy and with all of the author's other books, they could have started a franchise.",Ender's Game
438,roman-chlebec,Honest adaptation,9,2 November 2013,"Saw Ender's game yesterday. Teenage dream come true. It's probably the reason why I had tears in my eyes 4 times during the movie. Yes, I counted. They made it, and it was not a total mess. It was watchable. It was short, yes. It was fast paced and lot of material probably ended on the cutting room floor, or never made into the script, but still. It is close to the Enders's game how I imagined it, and I love it! SPOILER ALERT: the ending and outcome of final battle is monumental, I wish this was the time where it should have ended, with Ender torn, only just with a small pinch of hope, that in the ruins there is a ""seed"" of destroyed race... that would make a huge finale of the movie. This way it went a bit down with *epicness* of the atmosphere and didn't leave much space for visitor to thing about after leaving the theater.SPOILERS END I don't expect this would earn much money in box office to start a movie franchise. Nor that there is possibility to adapt other books as easily as this one, but it's a honest adaptation of source material, and I applaud the creators for their achievement.",Ender's Game

The leadership training. Sweet special effects. The UI's used to control the battles were nicely done. Haven't read the book so I cant compare stories unfortunately. Acting was typical.

The CG effects usage in the entire film are nice, and not too much. While we can expect some decent acting skill from Asa Butterfield, a 16-year-old child. The movie actually teach us one thing, which I think something our world currently needs it. Despite its weak storyline, The ending didn't let me down though. I'd recommend Ender's Game for those who enjoy watching space stuff with some actions. However, this is not for those who expect a full scale intergalactic war movie, well, that's not its main stuff as you might expect from the trailer.",Ender's Game

My biggest issue was with the casting. It really chaps my hide when film-makers cast for popularity. Butterfield has done a few titles but he is no Ender. Ender is a kid who's been training and fighting all his life. So why would anyone cast the least athletic pre-teen on the planet to play him? Whenever he got into his fighting stance he reminded me of my kid sister when she was 6. Don't get me wrong, the Asa gave it a good try, but he never even came close to selling that he was the most tactical, motivating, brilliant leader all of earth had to offer.I give it a five simply because the fx were good and the overall story (regardless of its execution) was still entertaining...ish.",Ender's Game
443,alicexiaoyunshen,It's alright..,5,10 November 2013,"Cute actors and great acting, but the plot lacks a lot of work. Never have read the novel, however, I can guarantee it is better than the film. The film adaption seemed like it would need a lot more work since the obstacles that stood in the central character's way seemed very minimal.. As if everything was being spoon fed to him, all of what he encountered did not struck me as difficult. Born being the chosen one, made all of his qualities seem less impressive. The ending as well, was slightly disappointing. It was very sudden, and I simply cannot grasp around the idea that the entire defence department would bring a group of children to assisst another child who they believed to be a mastermind. Nevertheless, wonderful effects used in the movie, and great acting by Asa Butterfield and the others, I see bright futures in store for them all in the future.",Ender's Game
444,akash_106,Not for an adult audience.,5,3 February 2014,"I'm sorry to say this, some of the acting was terrible. I know they are children, but some of the characters did not fit the actors. Asa Butterfield and the other kids are very good actors, with a lot of potential. I don't think it is their fault. The producers probably wanted a cast that would sell tickets to an more juvenile audience. In that perspective they have succeeded in terms of box office success. As for the story; It had potential, but it felt rushed, incomplete and as if there were cutbacks. I haven't read the book, so i don't know if the story line is the same. If they ever decide to remake this movie, i think it should be rewritten with a different type of cast. The direction was actually pretty good. I really think this could have been a great movie, maybe even a very good trilogy. If i was 12 years old, id probably liked it. So maybe it is not my place to comment on this movie, cause it was never intended for me.",Ender's Game
445,steve_newby,Such a disappointment,5,14 January 2015,"I went into this film with high hopes. I have read most of the books in the Ender series and found them fascinating with numerous sub-plots taking place and really rich and well developed characters. Unfortunately in this film you get none of that. I understand that you can't always include everything that is in a book in a film due to time constraints but it basically misses out everything that was important in the story. You find yourself watching it and thinking again and again ""how could they miss that bit out"". It's basically a few action sequences pegged together. I think it either needed to be a longer film or maybe made into two films. I can't imagine Orson Scott Card would have been happy with what was turned out. I suppose if I had seen the film without reading the book that I might have a different opinion, but as it stands I got to the end and felt massively deflated. The anticipation of watching the film far exceeded the actual film itself!",Ender's Game

This movie has it all. I know the sequel will be coming out and will explain more about ender's siblings who I know have a role in sub plots, I just don't remember how.The way the movie describes the story, (maybe i like Harrison ford) its seems so surreal!

You will laugh throughout at how bad and assuming it is (which makes it worse). But I would certainly suggest not to watch it. I still have to write more lines, the system asks....oh well, the movie is shockingly boring, the children's characters are horrendous, copycat prison movie behaviors, but with children...the only highlight for me was to see Hailee Steinfeld again (the amazing girl from True Grit), which is such a lovely and talented actress.",Ender's Game

Some parts of the movie left you to think that this kid would not be able to do some of the things the movie showed and what do you know he came through and really brought the movie to a narrow view. I loved it and all of the action. Comparing this movie to gravity shows that they both take place in space but Enders game is way more in depth and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There were some parts to the movie where I actually had a tear in my eye and that doesn't normally happen. This movie is a perfect ten out of ten.

450,aheffren,How Gavin Hood Ruined Ender's Game,3,2 November 2013,"First off, let's get one thing straight. Ender's Game was a well done movie, with amazing graphics and great acting. But the film it's self did not closely follow the book. In fact, they completely demolished it. Some of the changes were understandable, but most completely ruined the mood that the book had.Now where do we start? Let's start with the Formic Wars. The first formic war took place on earth, and Mazer Rackham had nothing to do with it, let alone sacrifice himself. The second Formic War took place around the rings of Saturn in space to my knowledge, and that is the Formic war Rackham participated in.Then there's Stilson, in the movie ender simply kicked the crap out him. The book describes Ender kicking him until he had this dead look in his eyes, so that later this could be compared to his fight with Bonzo, in the book he also killed Stilson, and never used some science experiment to do it. Not the biggest of mistakes, but I felt the film was definitely lacking do to this.Then we come to launch of the shuttle, and the whole film goes downhill from there. In the book Ender walks aboard the shuttle with all of the other boys, he doesn't come in late, and he NEVER sat beside Bean. Bean was not even in his launch group. Bean and Ender were not supposed to become friends until Bean joined Dragon Army. So that unfortunately happens, and then the shuttle takes off. Now in the book, launchies were not allowed to eat for 24 hours prior to the launch, to avoid sickness. So please tell me why Alai puked his guts out when they got in space? Then Graff comes out to see the launchies, and when he does he comes out horizontally. In the book he comes in upside down and Ender laughs because it seems as if Graff were standing on his head. In the movie Ender laughs, and then explains publicly why your orientation can be any way in space.No we get Bernard. Most likely one of the biggest mistakes in the movie. In the book, Bernard was bothering Ender, and Ender proceeded to break his arm. This lead to a feud that lasted between them for a long time in battle school. And never was Bernard part of Ender's Jeesh. He was never that smart.Where did Shen go? Shen was one of Ender's first friends when he arrived to battle school, because Shen himself was also a misfit, singled out and picked on by Bernard for the way his butt moved when he walked. This lead to Ender hacking into the desks and posting about how Bernard is always watching your butts. A classic comedic moment of the book that never made it's way into the movie along with Shen.Now to the Battle room, why oh why were the walls glass? And why was there only one battle room?In the book there were 8 closed in rooms, and the lighting could be controlled to hinder the student's visibility. And when they arrived why were Bean and Ender experimenting with the guns? It was always Ender and Alai, and they never discussed the enemy's gate being down at that time. Oh and let's not forget the way the decided to merge two very defining battles in the book, just to save a little screen time.On the subject of the battle room, lets discuss armies. Why were they so small? In the movie I don't think I saw more than a dozen kids in each army. In the books there were forty soldiers and a commander in each army.What happened to Rat Army?? Why was Ender transferred from Salamander to Dragon, instead of Salamander to Rat. And I'm pretty sure that's where Ender meets Dink Meeker, and not in salamander.What happened to Bean's special ops force?? They completely got rid of that, leaving no explanation as to why bean was carrying rope.Bonzo. Pronounced Bon-so. I don't remember hearing that in the movie, even though it was very, very emphasized in the book. They managed to capture his personality pretty well, but his death scene was less than satisfactory. What was with the whole hitting his head on the ground and breaking his neck? It didn't bring out the intensity of the scene that the book portrayed. Ender was supposed to bash Bonzo's nose into his brain, and then kick him in the balls as he stands like a dead man before collapsing, and dying on the spot. There was no infirmary scene in the book, and Ender never to think that he might of killed him until after the league war.Then we arrive on Eros. Ender begins his training with Mazer, and when he walks into the simulator his entire Jeesh is in the room with 500 other kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give me a break, They only people in that room were Mazer and Ender, the rest of his Jeesh was in a different simulator, and they never explained the toll it took on Ender's Jeesh and how Petra broke down.The final battle was not that bad, but after his fight with Graff, the rest was crap. They completely threw out he book with the bathwater. They ignored the league war, and moved the last Formic larvae to eros. They then proceed to send Ender out into the Stars abandoning his sister on Earth, instead of leaving with his sister like in the books.Finally Throughout the Film they never elaborated on Demothenese and Locke. A key element to the story about Peter and Valantine that amounted to just about half the book.Overall Ender's Game should have been broken down into 2 movies, instead of cramming it all into Gavin Hood's 2 hours of Crap.",Ender's Game
451,passov_leo,Very disappointing,4,5 November 2013,"This is a comic strip entertainment version of a great book. The movie sadly does not come close to the book, not just in terms of the amount of detail, but most importantly in the development of Ender as a person. In fact, i think, most of the characters in the movie are flat, almost cartoonish. Even Harrison Ford does not get much opportunity to act. Overall directing is low average at best. Another important drawback is the fact that to the people who have never read the original, the movie will probably seem quite confusing and superficial. The Ender Saga is a rare kind of science fiction that draws upon amazing scientific ideas that are just glossed over in the film. The 4/10 rating that i give here is just for special effects.",Ender's Game
452,danmowry,Enders Game missed The Game,4,5 November 2013,"The movie missed it on its own title--Game.If you surveyed moviegoers that haven't read the book and asked them what The Game is I think that none would have hardly a clue.The computer device each launchy was given to use in free-time had programmed ""The Game"" and it was so central throughout the whole book. The Formics (from afar) hacked into the central computer system via the ansible. The Formics knew that the humans were going to attack and that the humans were developing a boy human genius to win the final battle. The Formics communicated with Ender Wiggin through this device's game yet he didn't fully realize it until the end of the story. The communication was two-way. Ender Wiggin learned to love his own life and the lives of other beings. Likewise the Formics learned to love Ender Wiggin and love other humans through the struggles in The Game computer interface.The movie barely mentioned this crucial interface--The Game.After reading the book at least ten times since 1986, for me, as I've grown older the appeal of different themes has evolved and kept me re-reading the book. For instance, the theme that the underdog can win (in the battle room) through cleverness and strategy. Or the theme that bullying (or bullies) have to be countered and confronted and not ignored especially by those who are thoughtful, shy and introverted.But the theme that has most often appealed to me is that the big picture of one's destiny is not necessarily framed by one's obvious immediate circumstance which often is full of pain and loss. Rather, the theme suggests a prophetic direction (provoked and guided by an unseen hand) that hardly can be altered. The final climax of this theme is achieved through The Game interface.And this was missed in the movie. I am so sorry it was.",Ender's Game
453,CAWaters,Entertaining but lacking the strength of the novel's main character,7,10 November 2013,"I remember ""Ender's Game"" making the rounds at the lunch table in my freshman year of high school. As each student in our clique of slightly Gothic and artistic individuals finished novels in the series, we passed them on to the next person. So, I eagerly awaited the release of this film after seeing the trailer during my last trip to the theater.The story about a young prodigy, chosen as a sole commander of the earth's battle forces, is presented in much a similar fashion as in the novel. Asa Butterfield is Ender, the protagonist, who trains to lead the earth forces. Harrison Ford is his, sometimes, none-too-gentle superior who steers him in this endeavor as General Graff. I feel that in the novel, Ender is a much stronger character than the one portrayed in this film version. However, I've come to like the slightly more subtle Ender that might contribute less to deluded feelings of grandeur or overestimating one's ability to succeed in real life. Admittedly, after watching two hours of Ender's Game, I came out of the theater feeling like I could stop traffic with my eyes closed while waving popcorn from the machine, whimsically, through the air, across the lobby, out through the door, and into my mouth. Some moments in the novel and the movie are just magical like that!I had three friends with me, and after getting a feel for their opinion afterward, I think this movie is best suited to us sci-fi, fantasy, and ""geeky"" types. I would have loved for all of my friends to have enjoyed Ender's Game as immensely as I did, but I suppose I can't turn them all. ;)",Ender's Game
454,darkfirebg,Sad they ruined a perfect book..,4,18 November 2013,"Let's start with the obvious. Story isn't what it used to be in the book. It's far more shiny, oriented toward Colonel Graff(Harrison Ford) instead of Ender, lot of the important things in the book are completely gone! Unfortunately, they just hollywooded it. Ender's game wasn't a book about shiny spaceships and space stations. It was about a terrible war against non-human enemy, and about our only hope - a guy like Ender! It was also about his genius brother and sister, which we almost didn't see in the entire movie! Also there was blood, a lot of it, and here everything was shiny and clean, and Ender wasn't shown as the genius in the book.. I got the feeling there only've been around 20-30 kids on the training camp instead of hundreds! Also too little attention to the Ender's game at the end - 2 battles and that's it? Pathetic! Way to short movie to picture the Ender's universe. All in all i felt completely betrayed by this cheap Hollywood movie. I know most movies aren't as good as the book, but this is completely different story, only the names of the characters are the same.. P.S. Sorry for my non native English.",Ender's Game
455,ejknowles26,I am shocked and appalled by the rating of this film.,1,28 November 2013,"Having read a few of the other reviews, all I can conclude is that people who have read the book are blind to how gosh darn AWFUL this film was. It was the first time I had been to the cinema in a good year, and it made me hate everything in the world. Highlights of the film 1. Harrison Fords love of windows 2. When that kid fell out of his bunk bed 3. When Ender insulting a classmate made all his peers join him for dinner 4. The acting was, in a word, poor 5.Everything was a cliché. Literally everything. Nothing was new, it was all just re-hashing with bright lights 6. We didn't even see an alien until the last 5 minutes, 7. 0-70mph with no character development 8.Was this whole film just some kid, who everyone SAID was a genius,(but actually just made decisions we all could have, given time) training to be some kind of super leader, and his tactic is kill all his men (even if they are drones) to commit genocide? Was that a moral? Within five minutes of this starting me and my friends were laughing, and the laughs didn't stop. I guess the best I can say is that this film was entertainingly awful (I do love Steven Segal), but I would never watch it again. If this is a close adaptation of the book then I am never going to read this book ever ever. I would rather go blind.",Ender's Game
456,peachybashan,Astounding special effects,9,8 June 2014,"Ender's Game is a 2013 science fiction film directed by Gavin Hood and based on Orson Scott Card's novel of the same name, starring young actor Asa Butterfield as Andrew Ender Wiggin and veteran actors Harrison Ford as Col. Graff and Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham. The supporting cast mostly comprises of many other young faces, including Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld, and Aramis Knight, which perhaps set it apart from other science-fiction films.The plot revolves around the experiences of Andrew Ender Wiggin in the military academy that trains young and smart students like Ender in the hope that they will be ready when it comes time to battle the Formics—an alien race previously encountered that is believed to be a threat to the human race. Ender's extraordinary strategic thinking skills differentiated him from his peers and elevated him as a potential leader of the entire military force.The movie starts out with a quote from the main character Ender: ""When I understand my enemy well enough to defeat him, then in that moment, I also love him."" The quote expresses Ender's dilemma in struggling between his violent tendencies and instinct to win and his compassionate side. This immediately allows the audience to understand and sympathize with Ender, and from that Ender is no longer just a character. The introductory quote will also serve as an explanation to the conclusion of the film. Although the characters are mostly young, the film is still easily relatable for adults because of the characters' grown up motivations and experiences; in one of the film's critical moments, Ender evaluates whether the manner in which one wins matters more than the fact of winning. If it is lacking in any way, it is probably in the fact that some characters are not given enough time to develop in order to be more understood by the audience, such as in the case of Peter Wiggin. Peter Wiggin is easily seen as evil and ruthless but further depth of character could be given through providing a reasonable cause to his actions; after all, a character with two sides is always more interesting and relatable. Astounding special effects were used throughout the film, from the recollection of the previous Formics invasion to the climactic space battle simulations. Seeing the space battle simulation, one can't help but remember the special effects of clashing spaceships, asteroids, and planets in Star Wars, wherein Harrison Ford also starred. The film score accompanying the special effects-filled scenes only contributed in making the scenes even more suspenseful and exciting. Some features of the film such as the Battle Room, military costumes, and the mind game, serve as unique additions to set the film apart.",Ender's Game
457,sdmpv,Could have lived without it...,3,2 February 2014,"Let's start with the positive aspects of Ender's Game. It is technically OK and the actors play their roles well. So this is no 'B' movie (or worse). The story on the other hand is a disaster from my point of view. Sci-Fi movies have to be of sufficient technical quality but also logically as error free as possible. The movie fails the latter one miserably. The number of illogical moves, unmotivated assumptions and unfinished sidelines is more or less uncountable. The story is pretty predictable. But the worst part is that it is build upon the role of child soldiers belittled to their actions in a video game without serious ethical reflection. Kids with remorse of adults in a world of conscienceless grown-ups? I do not buy it together with most of the rest of the story. SD",Ender's Game

I could see that they used every digital trick in the book. They probably did 95% of this film on a green screen or something. You'd have to enjoy space-related stuff to enjoy the graphics.As for the storyline, this film was ridiculous. I can understand that the director didn't make this up, but as an example, the game they played on the ISS near earth had nothing to do with the tasks they had to perform during the alien attack. The whole development of skills is just rushed to hell and back. Same goes for character development; I could not connected to any of the characters and there's hardly any development shown. It's a bunch of kids doing stuff they weren't supposed to do.The underlying message of ""if you strike back against the bully as revenge, you will become the bully"" is good, and provokes some thought.. Though this film just focuses way too much on fancy graphics and stupid hand-gestures, and way too little on getting its message across.Would not recommend anyone to watch this, waste of time.",Ender's Game
459,edwin-930-112356,General overview,6,22 February 2014,"This is a good movie and i would recommend watching it. The only thing i would say is that like with many films the ending wasn't the best. But i really do think this film portrays some of the bad sides of humanity and how unethical we can be. The action taken in the situation presented is definitely controversial which is one of the reasons i liked the film, the action taken leaves space for debate. Depending on your beliefs, the movie highlights a conspiratorial topic asking the question of what we would do as a collective when presented with this situation. There is also a question of morality making you question ones self as to what you would do in the situation. So overall a good movie with good things to debate over, only had a problem with the ending.",Ender's Game

How the hell this kid is so genius? just because he can play shooting games on his tablet?.. i mean the whole story is crap, kid's acting is crap, this skinny kid suddenly gets to be the leader of dragon team or whatever and he gets to command these huge space ships, and suddenly he destroys whole planet which he thought was a simulation, and adults do nothing but watch these kids actually go to war with aliens.. i mean common!! end is also crap, this kid randomly meets alien queen and carries her egg in his space ship, so he can find new planet for their race because he thinks he is responsible for their destruction.. what?",Ender's Game

462,mac-payne,The worst adaptation I've ever seen.,2,25 April 2014,"So, to begin, I've read Ender's Game. I have also read the sequel, and I'm working on the third one. I know this was released a while ago, but I can remember every error in this film vividly. First off, the pacing is terrible. I know the book is long, but so is Harry Potter. The acting was terrible. I absolutely love Asa Butterfield and I know he tried very hard, but he was not the Ender I know. Ender is not a child with a mind of an adult. He is a gifted child. Card wrote himself (I believe in his preface) that the people he's talking about are special, gifted children. They are not children with the minds of adults. I can guarantee you that is not what gifted is. Maybe I missed somewhere where Card says ""Ender is a child with the mind of an adult"" but I don't think he did. (I read the book a long time ago, so correct me if I'm wrong.)Also, Abigail Breslin and Moises Arias should not have been in this movie. I adore Hailee Steinfeld, although the training scene where she fights with Ender is kind of funny because Asa is so tiny.Now, of course, everyone has a different interpretation of a book. Maybe my interpretation was vastly different than the directors. The setting was good. I liked the way the battle rooms were portrayed. I would have been interested to see more of Ender's video game throughout the film, because that might have helped out with the crappy character development.Asa did an okay job. I know he was probably told to act like an adult. He just seemed really angry throughout the whole movie. When I read the book, I definitely imagined him as at first quiet, and someone who feels the need to keep their emotions under control, and eventually someone who has the level-headedness and creativity that's needed to be a leader. I would have liked to see Ender struggle with that more. Especially because his brother was so mean to him, and because he was a Third. Asa did okay with some aspects of that. Maybe Asa was just kind of a different actor than the one needed for Ender, because he just doesn't take on the intuitive and introspective attitude that I believe Ender had.So basically, the pacing was absolutely horrible; way too fast. The setting was okay. The acting was, say, 80% terrible. The character development was bad. I hope one day someone somehow remakes this movie, or something.Also, I know I emphasized that Ender is not an adult in a child's body, but in my opinion Ender's Game is a book for adults. Maybe I'm just being pretentious, but there are definitely parts of Ender that very young people, like the ones this movie seemed to be tailored to, wouldn't get.I'm sorry this review is so critical, but I was extremely disappointed in this movie.",Ender's Game
463,vickianand,Combination of a harry potter and some starship movie,8,15 August 2014,"This science fiction action film is the adaptation of the acclaimed novel of the same name by Orson Scott Card. I have not read the book but having watched the movie, I want to find some time to read the book.The plot of the movie is about an attack by some alien species called Formics. They attacked the earth and wiped out a lot of mankind and then there emerged this one brave commander who did sacrifice his life but managed to get into the central control ship of the Formics. Now for tackling such future invasions it has been decided to train the children into such brave commanders, who would lead in case of such wars in future. They have this view that its easier to make better soldiers out of children because children are like sponges who just soak everything up. Children are made to watch violent movies and play violent video games. For the most part of the movie, there are lots of children in this school, training for their combat with the aliens. Out of lot of those children, Harrison Ford and crew zeroes upon Ender as the last hope of the mankind.Ender is an awesome character, very smart and tactical. He always leads with a very positive energy, making his crew have belief in themselves. However there is this vulnerable and human side of Ender. His attachment with his very passionate sister, makes him feel weak at moments. While, there are times when he gets over infuriated and aggressive. This is the reflection of qualities because of which his elder brother was thrown out of this same training procedure.There are lots of this laser tag kind of game played at the space training center as training exercises. During these games Ender amazes everyone and outperforms even the much senior students. For some parts of the movie, it appears like a combination of a harry potter and some starship movie. Those looking for lots of wars in spaces and galaxies may go disappointed.Couple of scenes in the movie were a little rushed and some of the scenes were not as emotional as they should have been. On acting front most of them have done really well but the best part of the movie is its end. Towards the end of the movie, Ender is made the overall commander of the earth war crew. He is asked to practice on some war emulator. In subsequent practices the difficulty level of the enemy team increases. After losing one of these practice on emulator, he finally leads brilliantly to destroy the entire species of Formics from their 'emulated' planet in this last game. And then he is informed that it was not just a game on emulator but a real attack controlled remotely by him. Lately Ender had started to believe that there is no need to completely wipe out the Formics. He cries out that he will be remembered as a killer.Finally ender discovers that Formics had communicated to him through the mind game. He goes out on that strange planet and was able to locate the single remaining formic egg. The movie ends with Ender mentioning in a letter to her sister that he is heading to deep space with the egg, determined to colonize a new Formic world with that egg.",Ender's Game
464,Sonny-wright,Starship Troopers Teen Training Academy with heart and Han Solo,7,17 January 2015,"I was pleasantly surprised. I recall the previews and thinking that is was driven by a grumpy Han Solo. Harrison Ford actually did bring the right type of surly father figure action. Asa Butterfield the little pom who plays Ender was quite good. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) was a good support and only had one crying scene. The effects and overall look was very ""military space"" which I love. Starship Troopers and Aliens have these similar looks. Obviously Aliens being a bit darker. Without giving anything away. It is a great look at how responsibility is given to a younger generation based on their unique and fresh way of approaching war strategy. In the end their brilliance is also countered by the innocent outlook on life...all life. Even alien life that is always looked upon as hostile or evil in these type of movies. Of course there is a twist. I won't say. But it will make you all warm and fuzzy. Okay one spoiler....""Watch out it's Ben Kingsley in your room !!! 7 out of 10. Crank up the surround sound and watch it at night. Good Stuff.",Ender's Game
465,Sniffinclose,Hmmm!,3,26 February 2020,"I guess this movie was born to loose.
When not even Harrison Ford feels convincing it is going to be a hard task to pull this off. The movie somehow has got everything in it, but it is just put together wrong!
The typical example of a chain with too many faulty links that fails in the end.",Ender's Game
466,al_oxley,"Better than I thought it would be, but not as good as I'd hoped.",7,25 October 2013,"Having divided opinion so much before its release due to many people being offended by the authors outspoken beliefs, and due to the die hard fans of the novel's excited anticipation of the long awaited movie adaptation; Enders Game will continue to do so after its release for a far more fundamental reason: Viewers who have not read the book may find the plot difficult to follow due to it's fast pacing, while viewers who have read the book will probably find themselves wishing that more of it had been included. This is definitely a movie that needs an extended ""directors cut"". That said, despite the various omissions and short-cuts made by the film makers, there are many positive things to report. Firstly the casting is superb, with very few exceptions; most noticeably Dap and Anderson, who I feel were so different from their counterparts in the novel as to feel out of place. Secondly the film is visually stunning to look at with some truly great sets, costumes and special effects. The score and sound is also very good and sets the mood nicely. Thirdly the story itself is very good, not at all the ""Star Wars meets Harry Potter"" or ""Hunger Games in Space"" that is being touted, but a far more serious allegory about the effects of unreasonably high expectations of someone so young and the impact it can have on them. It is just a shame that the film seems to be in such a hurry to get to the finale that it rushes through so much of the early story: Not enough time is spent developing secondary characters such as Enders older brother Peter, who gets very little screen time, certainly not enough to demonstrate to the novice viewer why Ender is so afraid of becoming like him. Very little mention is made of Enders outcast status as a third child or why this is important. It's not explained why Ender must feel that no-one will ever come to his aid, just that they won't. All these aspects are present in the film, it's just that they are glossed over so briefly that someone with no prior knowledge of the story will either be forced to take them at face value or spend a lot of time thinking ""why?"". Far more serious are the more obvious omissions: The entire Locke/Demosthenes sub-plot is absent and Enders progression through battle school is alarmingly expedited, going directly from his promotion to Dragon army commander to their final battle together with no explanation as to how Ender takes a group of unseasoned ""launchies"" and defeats TWO armies (one of which has never lost) with them. Whilst I understand, and to a certain extent, agree with the first omission; I can't see why a simple 2-3 minute montage of Dragon army training together, winning battles and moving up the rankings couldn't have been included to exposit the latter. In short the whole of the film leading up to the finale feels hurried and confusing. That said the finale is excellently realised and genuinely moving, if you know the story or have managed to make sense of the film so far! I think more emphasis could have been placed on the twist at the end of tale before moving on to the epilogue, but it still plays out well. In conclusion this is a well acted and visualised film that is worth seeing. Just don't expect to understand it all if you haven't read the book, and expect to feel a little short changed if you have.",Ender's Game
467,eddie-dunn,Superb,9,26 December 2014,"First, I should say that I think the movie is undeserving of a lot of the negative criticism it has received.I have read the books so I knew about the twist in the end, but I really thoroughly felt Ender's pain when he realized he had committed genocide while thinking he was just playing a simulator game all along.It might be that the movie should just be viewed in the right state of mind, but to me, the fact that an interplanetary war is fought and genocide is committed because of misunderstanding and inability to communicate is bitterly depressing, and they movie conveyed this masterfully. I can honestly say that I was not nearly as moved when this was revealed in the book, even though that came as a surprise at that time while I was prepared for the revelation in the movie.Who knows, maybe the knowledge of what was happening, what Ender was more or less tricked into doing, made the movie better for me?All in all, I think the CGI was great, the acting (for the most part) really good, and the adaption of the book to movie -- with regard to props, sets, production and scenery -- was done as well as you could wish for.For me, the only real issue I have with the movie is that the ending, after Ender has realizes what he has done and wants to make amends, feels a bit rushed.Recommended.",Ender's Game

What grates me the most is how poorly Hollywood write script for a genius kid. Ender's dialog is barely appropriate for an above average kid much less the super genius who saves the world. He spends a lot of time whining and crying and puts is through and thoroughly insufferable internal stream of consciousness.

A genuine waste of time, steer clear.And now IMDb even requires me to pad the review up to ten lines in order to post it. But I cannot come up with more than that since the movie did not provide for anything more. I could dwell on the idiosyncrasy of using children instead of grown-ups to battle the formics, or the ill-conceived ""making-up"" in the end, just as in ""oh, sorry, we annihilated your species and now feel truly sorry"".

The novel addressed complex social and moral issues through the lens of sci-fi, much like Star Trek began to do in the 60's.I enjoyed the movie version quite a bit. Visually, the effects were pleasing and I enjoyed the designs. Asa Butterfield and Hailee Steinfeld both captured the essence of their characters from the books, I enjoyed their performances throughout.As is the case with many books made into movies, details from the novel were cut for time and spacing. As a result, some of the finer points get lost in translation such as Mazor Tam's full background and interactions with Ender. The relationship between Ender and his siblings, as well as the background events to Ender's story in the novel, are largely glossed over.In the end, the story remains true in concept to the novel and I think gives the audience something to contemplate by the end of it.

476,ethanolivey,Mediocre,5,13 March 2020,"I recently watched the movie ""Ender's Game"", based on the book by Orson Scott Card. I read the book before watching the movie, and the movie does a pretty good job capturing all the details from the book. I have to say I enjoyed the book more than the movie. Though the movie did capture as many details from the book as possible their casting didn't quite fit the descriptions from the book. Given that the movie is approximately one hour and forty five minutes, they did a good job of fitting as much as possible into a small time frame but it makes the movie a bit hard to keep up with. It moves too fast and should be given more time to focus on each scene a little bit more and make it more enjoyable to watch. The movie didn't live up to the book. There was no distinct climax or buildup. This was also affected by how fast the film was moving. It didn't give us enough time to fully process what was happening and build suspense. The movie could've also had a bit more foreshadowing. Everything was kind of a blur. The supposed climax was too late in the movie and it was very anticlimactic. I didn't realize that it was the climax until it was over. A little disappointing. Overall I'd give the film a rating of 5 out of 10.",Ender's Game

Yes definitely, but ideally at least read the short story first, it is posted on hatrack.com (the author's website) hidden a few menus deep.Fans of the book may share my puzzlement on some of the director's choices...I had anticipated much more attention on the ""game"" and it's wonderful premise of laser-tag in null-G. I had expected at least a half hour of battle scenes with colorful dramatizations of each of the commanders and an opportunity to see military tactics visualized in exciting action. I figured it would make kids want to run out and apply for Officer's Candidate School.I had expected to be so energized by battle that I would rush out and buy little action figure ""armies"" for Dragon, Rat, Griffon, etc and stage mock battles; maybe even in a ""battle room"" then sit there and practice all the tactics I had learned.I also thought that the ""simulator"" battle games would be so engaging as to make me salivate for the Xbox 360 version.I figured that the movie would revitalize laser tag centers around the world, inspiring them to redecorate to look like the Battleroom and host tons of kids wanting to relive the movie.Alas... almost none of the military and ""game"" aspects of the story. Instead we got a fairly ""standard"" sci-fi movie focusing on special effects and interpersonal drama. It's pretty good at doing that, and quite enjoyable; I just had hoped that the director would focus on the things that make Ender's Game unique.Note to fans! Ender's Game was also released this month as a 7-hour ""audio play"" (like old-time radio dramas.) See hatrack.com to link to getting it from Amazon or Audible. It is awesome!",Ender's Game
480,endermetal,"Good, but way too short",7,1 November 2013,"As you may have already guessed by my user name, I'm a fan of Ender's Game. When I first read the book at the age of 12, I immediately fell in love with it and it has remained my favorite novel of all time—nothing has come close to usurping its position in my mind as the greatest work of man ever conceived. Now that my obvious bias is out of the way, let's get on to the review.I had fairly high expectations for the movie, considering how I felt about the source material. I felt it would be a triumph, one of the sleeper hits of the year; my enthusiasm for the film stemmed mostly from the trailers and advertisements I had seen, as well as several of the positive reviews I had read. However, while I feel the movie deserves a mostly positive review, I must admit I am at least slightly disappointed.First, the good: The movie looks gorgeous; the CGI is flawless and the costumes, sets, and overall atmosphere are well realized. This is a polished production worthy of the Enderverse tag. I felt the acting was also quite good. I was worried Harrison Ford might come across as too gruff and wooden, but he actually delivers in one his best roles since well, forever. Asa Butterfield does a commendable job as Ender. And despite her limited screen time, Viola Davis is excellent as Major Anderson, providing a much needed counterbalance to Ford's Colonel Graff.The movie chugs along at an incredible pace; I did not feel bored once. I've read some reviews that described those having read the book being able to ""fill in the gaps"" about the back story when watching the movie. While I was certainly able to do this, I would have appreciated it more had I been able to see it on the screen.Now, the bad: The movie is much too short. An additional 30 to 45 minutes running time is sorely needed for character development and plot. The movie falls flat in delivering the psychological and emotional goods that made the book so amazing. For instance, the brilliance of Ender during the battle scenes is seriously understated in the movie, and during Ender's final test, the gathered crowd politely claps when they should be on their knees and bawling their eyes out.I don't agree with Orson Scott Card's political views, but that was a moot point when it came time for me to decide whether to see the movie or not. Here was my favorite book of all time being converted to the big screen and I absolutely had to see it. Besides, I've recently read OSC won't make any money from the movie, so all of you kids boycotting this film should see it for the cinematic piece of art it is.Those of you who have already read the book and enjoyed it will undoubtedly see it. Those of you who enjoy sci-fi should also go see it. To everyone else, it might be best to spend your money elsewhere.",Ender's Game

So, I was really excited anticipating the movie. The beginning was smooth - first 5 minutes. And then the discrepancy have started to grow. Till absolute nonsense and ravings of a madman. Years of training squeezed in days, disjointed pieces, infinite naivety. The overall feeling - they wanted to get easy money filming nothing...

482,juhi-dhr,Must watch! Fans of the book must watch it a 2nd time!,8,17 November 2013,"Without giving much away, the setup is pretty simple. Earth was attacked and near destroyed by an alien race, we beat them... barely. And now preparations have been ongoing for 50 years to fight the aliens. Genius children being easier to mold and manipulate as well as being able to process data at a level beyond that of adults are the chosen ones. And the one shining star among all those children is Ender (Asa Butterfield). This is his journey, the genius boy who with the weight of saving earth on his young shoulders, has to master being a soldier and commander in time to fight the battle for survival.Being a major fan of the book and the entire enderverse series of books I was biased (can't help that). So the first time I saw it, I was just picking up on all the places where the book differed, didn't live up etc etc. But on a second viewing (Yes I did go a second time, because I didn't hate the first screening and a few scenes intrigued me enough for a re-watch), I must say I enjoyed it more thoroughly. Turns out key was to get over ALL the things they didn't do from the books and actually enjoy what they did manage to get across in such a short time and from such a difficult-to-adapt book. So for people on the fence based on all the mixed reviews bear in mind most of the really negative feedback is from fans of the book (not all for sure, but most). As a movie it does hold its ground, CGI was fantastic, acting of the lead Ender (Asa Butterfield) is outstanding, seriously! Even fans of the book, once you get over that this Ender is so obviously much older than the one in the book, you learn to appreciate how brilliantly Asa portrayed him. Do watch it!

But I did not expect it to fail so spectacularly on every level.No character development. You get no sense of who any of the characters are. bean has no special part what so ever! like Ender's Shadow didn't happen!!! no one explains how ender got so much friends or all he had to go thru with Bernard (who's not even close to been a friend).The battle game is barely in the movie. Ender gets Dragon army, He says ""training begins now"" and then it just cuts to an image of Dragon moving up the leader board. They show none of the difficulty of a battle a day, how they're putting the odds against ender...the way he's giving up at the last game....really...At no point do they attempt to explain why Ender is chosen to be the commander of the entire Earth fleet. or how he develops his commander skills. They show none of his innovations, leadership ability, and he is downright unlikable at times. Everyone moves to his lunch table because he insults Bernard in class? What? That's why people will follow him to their death? Snark? Petra plays with dragon army? I've known for two years that they cast an Ender that's too old but I didn't expect him to be a FOOT TALLER than Bonzo Madrid. Ender kills Bonzo by a kick and at no time do he refuse to leave earth for him. They call Ender a Third several times but don't bother to explain what that means. Ender didn't have any communication with Valentine at all except for a letter and the meting on earth.The acting is awful (especially Ender, WE DID IT!!), the dialogue is pathetic.

I felt frustrated and disappointed that such a good story was wasted. I felt they tried to cram too much into the first movie. Imagine if you took all of the highlights of the first few books and then allowed 3 minutes max for each highlight. No time for character development or connecting each highlight so it flowed logically. Everything felt incredibly rushed and disjointed. I can't imagine how confusing it might be for someone who is unfamiliar with the story. I wanted to love this movie and prayed it would do well so there would be a sequel. They should have split this into 2 movies and allowed the audience to melt into the Enderverse- so they cared about what was going on. I felt the actors did an amazing job with what they had. The end was so sudden and abbreviated you were robbed of the emotional payoff- you didn't have time to invest. Same way I felt they missed the mark with the Mortal Instruments movie. It feels as if the first movie is thrown together but their real focus is on the upcoming sequel...,Ender's Game

489,penthesilya,Disappointing,5,3 November 2013,"If you read the book you will be disappointed. They rushed through it skipping chapters, characters and crucial events. I read the book a long time ago and don't remember it so well and I thought it would be an advantage to me so I may encounter surprises in a plot. My memory holds much more than the movie. Well, the things they changed, didn't really influence the main story but, psychologically, it should be very influential on Ender's development. In movie they skipped so much I almost sorry I watched it... The book is so rich and intriguing and complicated... I would prefer if they would do trilogy: Battle school, Command School and The Battle and not rush through with everything in hour and a half. Acting was O.K., nothing brilliant... I didn't like casting for Ender, Harrison Ford showed only one side, Ben Kingsley was best of them all. Dispassionately, I expected much from Bean but there was no space in movie to even understand who he was. I will give credit for special effects - they were spectacular. The world itself that was painted on screen was amazing. The battle (though very short in screen time) was very well done and engaging. That's why I believe that for those who didn't read the book it will be good movie, not deep enough to grasp the whole notion of the story, but spectacular and entertaining movie. I, myself, went back home and grabbed the book :)",Ender's Game
490,joethulhu,Not a good film. I loved it.,7,24 November 2013,"Ender's Game is a very, very flawed film. I would go as far as to say that it is almost definitely a bad film. Most of the actors seem lifeless, the events fly by at a pace that a cheetah would have trouble catching up to, and some of the dialogue is painful. Asa Butterfield's American accent noticeably slips several times. Harrison Ford feels wooden.And I loved every second of it.First of all, the visuals are amazing. This is definitely an effects film. Secondly, although the events of the novel were compressed and (especially towards the beginning) there are a few changes that make me angry, generally it's done well. Small bits like the change in location of a significant object at the end near genius (for an adaptation). Mostly, I think my affection for it comes from my love for the book. This was not a terribly faithful adaptation, and I'll be whining about annoying differences the rest of my life (why are the armies so small? They were more than 40 people in the book) and not everything looks perfect (the battle room is completely and totally inaccurate in every possible way), but as a visualization of the book's contents, it succeeds in most every way.If you're not a fan of the book (which my viewing companion wasn't), you will likely not care for this film. You may hate it. So if you haven't read it, don't see it. It's not for you. If you have read it, by all means, go see this film. You will be disappointed, but you'll also experience a wonderful visual feast that only you can appreciate.Also: The song at the end - performed by one of my favorite bands, so I may have a bit of bias - is fantastic. It's heartwarming and captures the spirit of the book perfectly. At the end, when the score fades down and the song fades in, that's a musical moment no one should miss. There's a whole EP put out by the band of songs based on the book, and all fans of the book should seek it out.",Ender's Game
491,ElliottRobbins,I really wanted to like it,6,2 February 2014,"I came away from this movie with a sense of disappointment. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. The production quality on the film was amazing. The actors for the most part were good as well.This film, had it been successful, would have been the first of many; the story has a total of 6 books in its series, followed by another that contains 5 books.The flaw however, lies in the script. The people working on this movie seemingly decided that character development was below them, it was an unnecessary thing that those who lack directorial talent did. There is very little substance to this film, and what little there is has no consequence. Every plot-line that showed the main character grow, was either removed or minimized to such an extent that it no longer held any meaning.In its place, you are graced with scenes that should have made up the character development, with a voice-over narration from the main character. Usually these voice-overs describe what the character is going through, their emotional state and what their current environment is doing to them. It's a cheap way to get inside the main characters head, so it comes as no surprise that they decided to go with this as a method of placebo character development. I could live with that, had they done it correctly. Instead, you're forced to listen to Ender describe exactly what you see on screen.Had I not read the book, I believe I would have come away from this movie questioning why a few things I saw happen, happened. They even went so far as to spoil what was a major plot-twist in the book, only one third through the film.This film had potential. It had a budget. It had an amazing production and post-production team. Is was however, its script that lead to its inevitable downward spiral that will likely kill any chance of a sequel.",Ender's Game
492,Sapphykinz,Spectacular Film,8,5 November 2013,"I went into the movie expecting your typical sci-fi action flick, but what I got?An immersive story with excellent visuals, acting, that will really surprise you. There's just enough suspense and things going on to keep you at the edge of your seat.As a person always looking for worthwhile sci-fi movies, this will go down in the books for me as a 'classic' film. The progression while rushed because of time constraints feels fluid and incredibly well thought out.Overall, I say go see it. If you're the sci-fi type, or just someone with an ambitious heart. I think you'll love it.",Ender's Game
493,glhringlord,Better than I expected. In fact the best movie I've seen this year,10,12 November 2013,"(This review contains what might be called spoilers--vague references only.) I read the book six months ago, anticipating the movie and I thought it was a perfect adaptation, but then I understand the limitations of movie adaptation. Yes, I would have liked to see more zero gravity competitions. Yes, I would have enjoyed the Demosthenes & Locke story line. Yes, I would have liked to see elements of Ender's Shadow (which I have not read yet) with an expanded role for Bean. Yes, I would have liked concrete references to the ultimate fate of Bonzo & Stilson. However the strategies of other zero gravity competitions would have been less obvious visually than explained in the book and would have only weighted the movie down. The Demosthenes & Locke story line would have made the movie slower. Including Ender's Shadow would have made the movie 3+ hours which rarely works with a major blockbuster. Only the revelation of Bonzo & Stilson's fate would have added less than a minute and made the movie a little more chilling.As it was the experience was very moving. It was a skillfully told story. An essential part of good storytelling is--not lying but--deception. The viewer or reader must understand the character's point of view and, in most instances, be convinced, whether said character is deceived or deceiving. That aspect, so essential in the novel, plays out in full and equal force in the movie as well.Concerning the performances, Harrison Ford--will still did an excellent job as always--was actually the least convincing. I believe this stems from his character's affection for Ender in the book and his obligation of self-restriction. He struggles between the taciturn military demeanor that he feels he must maintain and his desire to connect with the pure and innocent Ender who is being manipulated into evil in the name of an imagined necessity. It seems that Colonel Graff his hiding from his own conscience behind his fear and he consciously believes that destroying the Formics and warring will bring peace when war can only bring war.I will say that I noticed a complete absence of the word 'Buggers' in reference to the Formics. Perhaps it was done to avoid offense but they are bugs and the 'us-vs.-them' mentality is ingrained into the societal psyche. The natural outcome of such closed-minded thinking is offensive name-calling and aggressively destructive behavior, but I think that its absence from the movie is a small injustice though I understand the reasoning behind the virtue of erring on the safe side.",Ender's Game
494,llemnus-917-153091,"Should not of been called ""Ender's game""",2,11 November 2013,"I went in without too many expectation, given the book was so good, but I almost walked out from the movie. The only movie made after a book that has less in common with what was originally written is probably World War Z, but Ender's Game is not far. Everything is changed, from the atmosphere to how Ender looks and interacts with the other characters. Somehow they managed to take a dark, disturbing, hard story and make it into an almost cute story about a boy hero. I found it too soft and polished. It was a disappointment from start to finish, a mediocre movie made worse because it shares the name with a book that is something completely different. What I find most annoying is that small things are messed up. Like the character of Bonzo. I still can't understand why Arias was chosen for the role, given that Bonzo was supposed to be one of the biggest kids around. These things changed the atmosphere too much, just to get that PG-13 rating. I have nothing against book adaptations but this one is very bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has read the book. If you just want a cute sci-fi family movie - it could work. Personally I'm not going to waste my time with it again.",Ender's Game
495,andy-9-378152,Ender's Game: It's How You Play The Game,9,10 November 2013,"Gavin Hood effectively captures the essence of Orson Scott Card's beloved book.Set in Earth's near future, but some 50 years after the Formic Wars, Earth is preparing again for war. The Formics are an alien race that attacked Earth, but because of the heroic actions of Commander Mazer Rackham in the midst of a seemingly hopeless battle, the Formics were defeated.Decades later, the International Military is bracing for what they believe is another inevitable invasion from the Formics.Recognizing their earlier victory was the result of some brilliant but unorthodox tactics, the IM has turned their attentions to their best hope for capturing lightning in a bottle twice: children. The brightest are identified in grade school, and their activities and thought processes are monitored with a chip in the base of the neck.The most apparently gifted strategically are recruited to Battle School, an orbiting space station with an enormous, zero-gravity battle room where increasingly difficult war games are played.This is the window through which we first see Andrew Ender Wiggin. He is a strategical prodigy, showing flashes of brilliance from a very early age, consequently arousing the general interest of the IM, and specifically the interest of Colonel Graff.Ender is also painfully shy and introspective, and is often bullied, first at home (by an abusive older brother, Peter) and also at school.His sister, Valentine, is closest to Ender, and her compassion for her brother sustains him at times when he feels most alone. Although naturally gifted in tactical thinking, it is from his siblings that he learns how to sympathize and empathize with his enemy, as well as how to destroy them with ferocity and finality.Colonel Graff ultimately drafts young Ender into Battle School, and a new round of physical and mental abuse begins for the recruit as he learns to navigate the complicated, confusing minefield of power and politics that is innate in the military.Graff is convinced that Ender is the one who can ultimately lead their forces to victory against the Formics, while Major Anderson has her doubts about his readiness.As the impending conflict looms, Ender and his adolescent army are pushed beyond reasonable limits to prepare for war against an enemy they barely understand, and the fate of the world rests in the hands of a child.If I have any real complaints about the way the story unfolds on the screen, it's that the movie seems to have two consecutive endings, and the first one takes a little bit of the oomph out of the second one. Without revealing anything, I can only say that I wish that the two significant plot points had been better amalgamated.Colonel Graff is played with steely-eyed finesse by Harrison Ford. Asa Butterfield plays young Ender, and his skinny frame and doe-eyed face belie his true age.In the book, Ender is younger, but excellent casting of the other students and cadets make Butterfield feel smaller and more vulnerable than his actual years. Ford and Butterfield have a rare and complicated chemistry on screen, and volumes are communicated between them with a sparsity of words.Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley give stellar, supporting performances, but then again, they always do. Nonso Anozie is a very imposing Sergeant Dap, with a fleeting smile behind his eyes that is at once charming and disarming.One might assume that this is a movie about a futuristic war in outer space, about alien armies and rocket ships and laser beams; one would be wrong.This is a movie about a boy. It just so happens that he has grown up in a world on the brink of interstellar war, a conflict that he has been sucked into through no fault of his own. This is a story about relationships and families and friends, and how those interpersonal interactions help form our own personalities and prejudices.We learn how the people we are related to instill in us the very best and the very worst attributes through years of shared experiences, and we must then pick and choose the bits and pieces that we will hold onto, and the ones that we should like to discard.We come to realize that just as we do not pick our families, we rarely get to choose the people we work with or for, nor do we often get a say in the tasks that are given us. But we do get to decide how we respond to those individuals and to those situations.The story is immediately insightful about a host of habits that, left unchecked, can ultimately destroy us. We see the danger of judging others too quickly without getting to know them, and the futility of subscribing to a might-makes-right doctrine.The ugliness of bullying and belittling others for the sake of self-aggrandizement is revealed for the monster that it is, and we also observe how a soft answer turneth away wrath.And we learn that, ultimately, charity and compassion are far more powerful than angry words or weapons of war. Ender, in a tender scene with his sister, reveals, ""In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.""We watch movies to be entertained, to escape from the problems of our lives and enjoy somebody else's for a few hours. We also like to learn things, to gain insight and perspective, to walk a while in someone else's shoes.The very best movies both captivate our attention and challenge assumptions. Watch this movie with your kids, then talk about it. Ender's Game reminds us that we can't simply judge our lives based on what we do; we must consider why and how we make those choices. That is what matters, and that is why Ender's Game matters.",Ender's Game

Some leadership and negotiation topics came up, making it felt real and genuine. Some of the kids show convincing acting while some not, and very interesting plot twist happened near the end of the movie. As with the real intention of the Aliens, whether they're the pure evil or the victim, is a bit lost in the translation.Some names were also hard to pronounce or remember, creating a feeling of distance between that future and our present.Good watch anyway.",Ender's Game

499,gggreen1991,"A great adaption of the original novel, but needs a bit of a fairy touch",9,3 November 2013,"Hood's execution of adapting Ender's Game is ambitious, however, there is still room for perfection. The CGI work looked amazing in the film, and provided a visual organism to the audiences. The original novel is not a very long piece, however, it is detailed with descriptions of Ender's inner struggles, and Hood was smart to use Ender's narration of his emails to Valentine to deliver his emotions, but the result was not as dynamic as the original book. Hood's version of the screenplay changed the original book here and there, so that the development of the story could be fit into about a year comparing to roughly 6 years in the original book, which really made the film less enjoyable and jumpy. Ford's portrayal of Col. Graff was a little stiff, and there was simply too little of how he was trying to be a ""jerk"" so that Ender could be pushed to be ready. Major Anderson played by Viola Davis was a pain in the ass to understand why she even matters to the story. I appreciated how Hood casted Viola to be Major Anderson who is supposed to be a white male in the book. However, in the novel, Major Anderson can be seen as the good cop comparing to Col. Graff, but in the film, Viola's Anderson seemed like she ,as a shrink, had no idea of what was going on. The development of the relationship between Ender and Petra was a bit coming-out-of-nowhere, and with whatever reason, Hood decided to make the start of the relationship like: ""Hi, I'm Petra."" Said by Petra. ""Hi, I'm Ender."" Said by Ender ""Let's have a date in the battle-room."" Said by Petra "" Do you guys want pizza delivery?"" Said by me. Asa Butterfield is an absolutely amazing and talented young actor, and to be honest, I am a big fan. His performances in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, and the tear-dropping the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas are solid evidence. However, his lanky British figure looked quite odd to the strong personality Ender had. But in the original book series, Card has described kids becoming kind of dis-proportioned (long arms, long legs, and thin bodies) as they grew older. Asa's last 20 minutes were marvelous. He executed really well on how Ender was strong and smart while he was not invincible. Ender's idol, the legendary Mazer Rackham, looked like he just took off his Mandarin's costume and got on all those WTF fake facial tattoos. I like Sir Ben Kingsley, and his portrayal of Mazer was pretty OK. Overall, I will say that I am not disappointed. I have concerns regarding Hood's talents of being a director (He used to be a lawyer!), and he approved himself from this film. Hood was really smart to showcase all the violence from the novel without ditching its PG13 rating, such as the shaky camera work when Ender beat the bully up and that Bonzo was not revealed to be dead.His interpretation of the Mind Game and translation of the battle-room from words to the screen shocked me in a really good way and really made me happy, although, he was way too enthusiastic and confident when he was promoting Ender's Game. He used silence in the film really well, and there were some amazing shots, but the lack of emotions, suspense, and drama made the film merely a good exhibition of how Digital Domain (who did all those amazing graphic effects) is a great company and someone should save it from its bankruptcy, and there was something missing to make this film even better.",Ender's Game

The young characters are engaging and relevant to me. As these characters deal with very real life and death decisions. The visuals were strong and made the movie more compelling. This was not a typical old sci-fi as it has a good message and a twist to the plot. It is good for adults, parents with children and teens as there is a relevant message for everyone.

501,edtholl,Needed to be longer,3,31 October 2013,"OK, So I am on record somewhere as saying ""You, cannot expect a Film to be the same as the book"". I whole heartedly believe that and have enjoyed many films that are based on books even with the differences necessary do to time and the visual media its being transferred too. The book originated as the short story ""Ender's Game"", published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. Over the last few months since the announcement of the films release I have reread the book. Those who have not read the book may enjoy the film but in the theater i was in I was talking with a few people around me and found that all did the same thing, one guy had reread it three times in the past month and one couple has read everything Orson Scott Card ahas written. From this word of mouth will kill this movie I think. It is seriously lacking in any real character development for ANY of the Characters in the film. I think many of the the actors where miscast and seriously took you out of the story. Now I'm not talking about the fact that in the book the kids are 6-16 years old geniuses with the major character of Ender Wiggins being the youngest, there was no way a film could be made with a cast that young. Im talking about the journey he takes in the book, its really well thought out and executed. In the film you really do not get to know anything about how or why they kids are there, nor why some of the major plot points happen. Most of the conflicts that happen throughout the book from his brother Peter, the Bully in school, Colonial Graff, and even Bonso Madrid are glossed over. The entire storyline of whats happening on earth is completely missing, most likely for time. but that plot line was needed for some of the things that happen at the end of the book so without them end is weak. Major plot devices like the development of the Battle room are abbreviated to one battle, that takes place between Enders group and two opposing armies and takes only a few min to play out. In the books there's a series of battles escalating to this one and with out the progression (those having read the book know what i mean) there's no real feeling of the stress that final battle meant in the ark of Enders Training. I could go on about all the things wrong with the film, I even tried to calm myself down and try to look at it on its own merit and leave the book out of it, and trying that only saw how pathetically weak the exciting story was. the film runs 114 min, I do not often say this but they really needed to make it about 150 min so they could do it right. maybe there's a longer directors cut that will come out on DVD that will rescue this film.",Ender's Game
502,espixz,Very Impressed!,9,3 November 2013,I have to say when I heard this was going to the BIG screen like most book-to-movie adaptations I was scared! But I was even more so with the performance of young actor Asa Butterfield. But I still wanted to view it and wow I was very impressed! Asa showed why he was chosen and why he led the charge in auditions! Not only did he do the character Ender a solid by performing him to the ultimate vision of author Orson Scott Card but he portrayed on screen hos amazing talent for future roles to come! Harrison Ford was a great support actor and led with his usual hard fierce dialogue! The visuals were great although at some points you could see the cgi glitch but nothing major. All in all awesome movie and as a fan of the series I'm excited on where the Enders series will head!,Ender's Game

And the end is changed completely form the book. I do not even believed that other half of the book isn't present in the movie.

Aside from the sci-fi spectacle, I didn't enjoy it.",3,22 July 2017,"I am guilty of watching something purely because it's sci-fi which was the case with this. If you're wondering if it's worth your time, it probably isn't. Perhaps because it was trying to summarise a book there were leaps in plot that didn't make sense, and the characters felt very shallow - they started as stereotypes and stayed that way. There was never a satisfying explanation why a bunch of youths were treated as great military leaders. There seemed to be no reason for lead-psycho-kid to make his leap of understanding about the aliens. The film didn't take time to build a world that matters with a plot that goes straight into a sterile spaceship. I didn't care if they won or lost or how they went about it.

I always cheered for Ender, hoping he makes it past the bullies and hardships.The only complaint I have with this was the ending. I understand the premise, but I don't think they executed it well. In the movie, they made it sound and look very confusing. Maybe if they explained it a little bit more, it might have been better. They also ended it off roughly, not really specifying what he was doing with the alien egg. I thought the CGI of the alien at the end was OK, but that part just didn't fit in the movie.

510,Hatton-djh,Two hour trailer,4,31 October 2013,"After reading the book recently I was very excited to find out that there was a movie being made. That excitement was stamped on pretty hard when I left the theater. Firstly, the children are too old. Secondly, Enders brother and Sister were hardly covered at all, in fact I think they filmed less than one page worth from the book. The movie moved far too quickly, the first part of the movie was so rushed I sat there and wondered what I just watched, it was skipping the story like a kangaroo on speed. Harrison Ford is done, he needs to retire because there is no character in him at all, very wooden. The kid, Asa Butterfield was great, but like in all movies, he needed better direction from the director. The end was rushed, a video game Ender plays is rushed, with loads missing. In the book he plays the video game for months, frustrated he couldn't get past a level, in the film it was over a couple of days with no point to even putting it in there. The jokes were removed, the bullying was kept to a minimum and timescale was squashed so much so you just sat there thinking, what the hell? In the book he met his Sister years later, in this film it felt like weeks. Terrible. Everything that was good about the book was completely removed.Very disappointing. Could have been so much better, this could have been a classic if the right director was on it.",Ender's Game
511,wosh_80,A Decent Film,6,2 November 2013,"I will start off by saying that I love love love the book Ender's Game. I went into the movie with very ow expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Now don't get me wrong it is no Lord of the Rings, but it does more things right than it does wrong and considering how hard the novel is to turn into a movie I have to give credit where it is due. There are cuts made from the novel to streamline the story. The entire subplot on Earth involving Val and Peter is dropped completely. Ender is only shown having a few battles in the battle room where as in the book he has quite a few. It is just under two hours long but it is paced well so it doesn't feel that long. The battle room scenes are very cool I just wish there were more. Ender in the books is shown to be excellent at thinking out of the box and while this is shown in the movie it feels a little rushed. We are told several times that Ender is a genius tactician and that is supposed to serve as enough proof. Ender's Game does nothing special. See it if you liked the novel, but go in with low expectations. If you are not a fan of the series you'll get nothing out of seeing it. It won't shatter your world view. The acting is fairly good, except for ironically Ender's part, played by Asa Butterfield. He has a few crucial scenes at the end of the film that he needs to carry and he just can't pull it off.",Ender's Game
512,GrtflMark-424-705554,Excellent Movie of A Complex and Layered Book,9,4 November 2013,"This movie is VERY well worth seeing.It is an excellent movie of a dense, complex, and very layered book. There is a lot of nuance and details it the book - similar to ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"" by Philip K. Dick and, like ""Bladerunner"" - this movie captures the ""feel"" of the aggregate of all these details, while necessarily not the dense content of all of them,Orson Scott Card - despite some things I have seen written about him here - is the best writer of books with the character, plot and old-fashioned storytelling virtues producing books that are accessible, fluorescent and flow with the shimmer of spontaneous prose that make them perfect for making movies of. He is a principled man with character, integrity and passion - he has a strong sense of compassion as well as justice.The density of ideas in his novels is right up there with Philip K. Dick and Jack Kerouac.The performances of Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Viola Davis and Hailee Steinfeld are all worthy of Oscar discussion, at least.It is good enough and dense enough to see more than once.",Ender's Game
513,aglieos42,How to destroy everything unique about a novel.,2,9 March 2014,"I first read Ender's game during my senior year of High School and I was taken with the depth of characters. As a youth who had been put through all sorts of advanced placement classes, the book really did resonate with me as did it's sequels. Now, I am pretty forgiving of movie adaptations normally as I understand the difficulties in translating the written word to the silver screen. I accept that things will have to be left out, and even accept changing minor parts to tighten up a story so it can be told in a compressed time frame. Sadly, this movie just does everything wrong when it comes to telling this wonderful story. The visual effects are solid, the acting is good, and by all accounts, it should have been a great movie. There was just far too much about the character of Ender that was erased for no good reason which, in turn, made this movie no more than another overblown Transformers wanna be. Ender was supposed to be the youngest and smallest child, up until that time, ever accepted into battle school. He was already isolated because, in a world in which families were only allowed two children, he was a third child. He was an exception to the rule which isolated him even more. They pay some lip service to this in the movie, but it never really resonates. One of the best examples was the fight with his Army leader, ""Bonzo Madrid"". In the book, Ender is more than a foot shorter much slighter of build and Bonzo is probably closer to 17 years old where Ender hasn't even hit his teens yet. In the movie, Bonzo is a foot shorter than Ender and the fight just doesn't have any real impact whereas, in the book, it was a pivotal moment. I could spend all day picking apart decisions made in this movie and still have no answers. If you've never read the book and enjoyed the movie, I highly recommend that you grab the books. If you have read the books and enjoyed them, stay far far away from this movie.",Ender's Game
514,biscuitzgravy,Well... the CG was excellent.,5,16 February 2014,"I knew not to expect it to follow the book to a T, the only thing I'm disappointed in is the fact that they dumbed down all of the violence and made this movie for children, pretty much. All of the violent scenes were... terrible. The acting was terrible. I was very disappointed in this movie. The CG was great, though! The scene where he fights that guy in the bathroom? In the book, he really screwed him up. In the movie... I almost laughed at how incredibly terrible they dumbed that scene down. As if they were afraid some kid was going to see it. Seriously, I wish this had been as violent as the book, that's all I had hoped for.",Ender's Game
515,rich-michelson,NOT the books,2,24 July 2019,"I had looked forward to seeing this when it was released, having read the books by Orson Scott Card many many years ago. I was extremely disappointed.

516,mister_mystery-556-42626,Far too short,7,14 March 2014,"As a fan of the entire series of in the Enderverse, I was always going to find flaws in this movie. I expected it to miss a lot of the key plot points in the way that the Harry Potter movies did. I felt that the major flaw in this adaptation was that it was far too rushed. Why not split the book into separate parts and spread the thing over two or three movies. If they could manage it with the Hobbit which is a much more slight novel then it is infinitely possible with this.The book spends a lot of time in Battle School and the various battles Ender faces. We get ONE battle here. The whole book is condensed into one year (according to the Director, Gavin Hood)the result is that too much happens in too short a time-frame.My final gripe is about the casting with two main points. I don't think Asa Butterfield carries off Ender at all. He doesn't seem to add any emotion to the role.Finally, Bonzo Madrid. He's TINY! He's not described as being particularly large in the novel but he is not imposing at all and yet the other characters act as though they are scared of him.If you've not read the book, you'll probably enjoy it. If you love the book, you may still enjoy it but will regret having waited for years for the movie to be made, only for it to not quite bring the novel to life.",Ender's Game

Certain concepts and scenes have to be simplified in order to present a final product (film) which is both coherent and enjoyable.Despite not having read the book, the film was excellent, and very enjoyable, I'd recommend it to anyone",Ender's Game
518,lilzz13,It should have been a TV show,1,11 December 2014,"Ender's Game is a science fiction book in a series. It is about a boy who lived at a time when Earth was at war with ""buggers"", giant ant-like aliens. Ender was sent to a space station with other genius children like himself to learn how to battle the buggers. While Ender is training, his brother and sister have gotten into politics and are slowly taking over America to unite the world and end a future war during peace time. With the help of his comrades, Ender kills all but one of the buggers and is sent to colonize the alien planets. His brother, meanwhile, has become hegemon and Ender's friends are rulers of their respective home countries. Ender's Game was great as a book, but the film adaptation was not. For a film adaptation of a book to be good, it must be accurate to the book. What happens in the movie has to be what happened in the book; whether something was cut out to save time because it was too much information or not important, the events in the movie are a visual version of the book's story line and plot. Ender's Game as a movie was not accurate to the book because many things were added to the movie or changed from the book in ways that made no sense and should have, and could easily have, stayed the same. One scene in particular is where Ender finds out about a virtual reality game and his friends do not know what the game is or what it does. It then goes to a scene where two people are arguing that Ender should not have known about the game. This scene was not accurate to the book because in the book everybody plays the game except Ender because he was not interested in it because he thought it was a waste of time. He later gets into the game and realizes that it knows about him and communicates with him in ways nobody could understand. The game was meant to get into the minds of the children and evaluate them. . This game was extremely important to the plot and the rest of the series later on, so there is not reasonable explanation as for why they made this change in the movie.One reason I do not like watching film adaptation of my favorite books is because the actors do not do the characters justice and show no character development. The characters in this book were very dynamic and grow up so much because this first book, and all the others. The actors chosen for the movie in no way gave justice to their respective characters. Many of the actors were not even the correct race/ ethnicity of the character they were portraying. This was an extremely important aspect of the book that the children were from all over the world, because later on in the story they end up political rulers of their respective countries and this helps them be able to unite the world. A big example of this was how, in the book, one of the major antagonists was a bully to Ender and he was much bigger than Ender. This was mainly because Ender was extremely short, being the youngest to get into battle school in his group. In the movie, this bully was played by an actor noticeably puny and much shorter than the actor playing Ender. This, and the fact that the actor chosen to play Ender was not younger or shorter than the other actors, as he was in the book, shows that the casting directors did not even bother trying to hire actors that look the part. If I watch the movie version of a book, I expect to get the same story and plot line of the book, albeit less detailed. This is not the case for Ender's game. If someone were to watch the movie instead of reading the book for a class assignment, they would fail because the movie left out half the story and almost all the main characters. One of the main characters in this story was briefly shown in the movie and what was shown was important but it had no context so it made no sense. Much of the movie was like this. It was as if the director/producer read a sentence of each chapter and made a scene with it, not connecting anything at all and focusing only on action shots with no explanation of what was going on or why it was happening. The movie was also too short to show such a complicated story; much of what was shown was meaningless and you would not understand the significance of anything without having read the book. All of the things leading up to Ender's rebellion and breakdown was skimmed over or not even shown so that when they showed the scene with him angry at the adults, nobody understands this and he comes off as spoiled and throwing a temper tantrum for no reason. Without reading the book, movie goers would not understand the pent up frustration at the change of rules and the pressure put on Ender to be a perfect commander. I think that, for this to have been a better movie and to keep the timeline right, it should have been animated so there would be no issue of changing actors. One idea might be to show an age phase scene of Ender in the battle room getting older to emphasize that this story takes place over years and not just a few days, as the movie makes it seem.",Ender's Game
519,danielkhartman,"Please read the book, the movie does not do it justice.",2,19 February 2014,"The movie fails to hold the specifics of the book, and most of the time it seems like there is a drama that everyone except for the viewers understand. People who have not read the book, just watched the film will not understand the true impact the book has, the ideology and revolutionary ideas.SPOILER (not really, but just being really careful)The movie depressed me with how it forces itself through the story line, and how not a single human considered the fact that the big-ass ship was a queen ship. Or at least a capital ship. As for the final battle, it was just poorly executed, it focused simply on blind special graphics of a proper and organized battle overview as well as solution. I recommend everyone interested in the story of Ender to read the book, not watch the movie and not need to feel the pain that was viewing this.",Ender's Game
520,DannyDawg,An exciting adaptation true to the story,8,30 October 2013,"Ender's Game is not a perfect film. It rushes through certain important points, and leaves out other parts altogether, instead what you get is a flawed but enjoyable movie that ultimately succeeds, because it always keeps its goal in sight.Certain things about this movie such as the justification for child soldiers, Ansible Technology, and the Genius of the main group of Kids will be best understood by the book readers.The film has wonderful visuals with exciting CGI to showcase the important Battle Room.The Acting by Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield is one of the strengths this project has. They maintain a tense and believable relationship that is very much like the original story.Ultimately the climax of this movie and its main message is what sets it apart from many other Sci-Fi films. The emotion is very much there, and anyone willing to give this film a try will not be disappointed.",Ender's Game

Would recommend to see it in IMAX if at all possible; the spaceflight scenes were incredible. To get the full effect, you're going to have to see this one in theaters; I seriously question the ability of even high-end home theater systems to capture the full effect of this movie.If you've read the book, things are not going to look like you pictured them in your head. Orson Scott Card leaves out a lot of descriptions of the characters and scenes, so as a reader you imagine more yourself. The bad side of this is that when/if it's made into a movie, it's not going to match what you imagined. The battle room, for example, is nothing like what I pictured in my head. But it all still works very, very well.The biggest thing that makes this so good is that it's pretty much true to the book--and having Card as a producer I'm sure is what kept it that way.",Ender's Game

Asa Butterfield delivers a masterful performance as the eponymous Ender, capturing the intensity and moral complexity of a boy genius who is called upon to save his world despite his reluctance and uncertainty in what he is being asked to do. CGI enables Director Gavin to replicate Card's universe it is only in the depiction of the Battle Room that the strategy and tactics of Ender's genius are not fully realized. In addition, one could have hoped that Bean could have been a more fully realized character and a little less made of Petra in a foredoomed effort to interest and placate the distaff members of moviedom",Ender's Game
523,watkins-melissa,Ugh,1,22 July 2018,"I've read the book more times than I can count so I was naturally excited, if not a little apprehensive about the movie. I have tried to like this movie and see it outside the confines of the book, but it's falls so short of what it could be and still makes me mad years later. The special effects were admittedly decent, but the directing and script were filth. Hood talked about wanting to stay true to the novel but he changed really critical elements. Also, I love the cast but they didn't do the film any favours. I feel like Hood cast Academy Award Winners/Nominees in hopes of riding their coat-tails and covering up his abysmal script and lack of vision. The only redeeming qualities is the visual effects.I know everybody always says this, but you're really better off reading the book - or better yet, listening to it. As for me, I'm going to try my best to forget this trash pile even exists.",Ender's Game
524,darkreign2021,"If you're a fan of the novels, walk away and never look back.",4,1 November 2013,"As a movie, I give this 6/10 As an adaptation of my favorite novel of all time, I knock it down to 2/10.I went in thinking I would hate the movie because the age of the actors they used to portray the children, Viola Davis playing Major Anderson, and a few other similar points, but honestly by the end of the movie I thought it worked out perfectly. Asa Butterfield as Ender and Harrison Ford as Graff both came off a little strong in their roles, but otherwise they did a great job. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Mazer Rackham was probably the most accurate in the long run.As far as being just a movie goes, I got the feeling that it was very rushed. Anybody watching it without having read the book will get this inevitable sense that there's something missing. The movie clocked in at 2 hours. It's my belief that any movie based on a novel, and one with as much detail and character development as this, should at least top out at 3 hours. Another hour and they really could've done a few things much better.The visual effects were really well done and although they went with a lot more of a technological approach than what the original novel had envisioned, it adapted well to the concept. The costumes were awesome, the station, particularly the Battle Room, was breathtaking, and the soundtrack was appropriately epic. Basically aside from the script itself, the entire movie was really well done and had the makings of an awesome adventure.As for those going in with the book under their belt, this is the most heartbreaking part. Everything they did was out of order or just plain wrong.1. The battle with the Formics in the beginning is the second encounter, but it takes place on Earth whereas the second battle should've taken place in space out by Saturn. (anybody that's read Earth Afire knows crashing a Jet into a Formic ship wouldn't have done squat to it anyway.)2. The school in the beginning was a military school instead of the traditional elementary school he attends in the books.3. On the shuttle heading to Battle School, Bean is already present on the ship instead of being a later launch group where he first meets Ender (and is made an example of) after forming Dragon Army.4. When in his first battle with Salamander, Ender is supposed to do nothing and in the second battle, he disobeys orders and fires at one man that forces a tie (the system for opening the enemy gate is completely removed from the movie)5. Ender never gets traded to Rat Army even though it's mentioned that Bonzo wants him traded in the movie. Ender is instead promoted directly to Commander. (BTW, they spend the entire movie pronouncing Bonzo's name incorrectly. This was a point of focus in the novel that they should've had the decency to take 5 seconds to include.)6. As Commander, they only show a 10-second clip of Ender's first training session and they skip all of the battles except one. Additionally, Petra and Bernard both fought for Dragon when in actuality Bernard hated Ender and Petra was a Commander on her own team.7. After the fight with Bonzo, which was poorly choreographed and was less martial arts and more flailing and brawling, Ender knows he killed him.8. Eros wasn't blacked out on the surface, the facility wasn't in tunnels underground, and in fact the surface of the planet had a breathable atmosphere.9. In Command School, Bernard is again present as a member of Ender's Jeesh. Additionally, Ender actually had missions failed during his ""Training"" with Mazer Rackham, which should've never happened.10. After recovering from ending the war, the invasion by Russian loyalists never occurred, none of his Jeesh besides Petra were there, and after wandering out onto the surface of the planet, he discovers the Queens egg on the surface of Eros (along with a living queen close to death)11. In the end, instead of taking a colony ship with Valentine and becoming Governor of a new world, he sets out alone to find a home for the Queen.In addition to getting a lot of details blatantly wrong, they've cut off the ending in a way that makes a sequel with even remote accuracy to the novels impossible. With the right script writer (I could've done a better job) they could pull off sequels, but honestly in the state this series is in now, I don't want to see another one.",Ender's Game
525,nuclearblitz13,About as Good a Movie Adaption Could Get of the Novel,8,3 November 2013,"If you have never read the books, this movie adaption will still be thoroughly entertaining as Asa Butterfield did an incredible job with conveying the emotions and character depth of Ender Wiggin as written down in the novel. Very talented young man. The special effects are also pretty spectacular, really immersing the viewer in the grim world of battle school and the Formics (the ""Buggers"" in the novels) and the movie plot is still complicated enough to be a fun ride to be on regardless.If you have read the books or heard about it from someone else, you know that most of the novel takes place as internal monologue inside Ender's head. This is what made Asa's performance even more impressive as he had to act out these internal thoughts and emotions through the use of only facial expressions, tone of voice and eye movements. There is no constant use of a cheesy narrator speaking his thoughts which the director could have resorted to, but, luckily, did not.For the given runtime of just under 2 hours, they did the best job they could adapting this novel to the silver screen, keeping exactly which was needed, spending more time on elements that were critical for the viewer to understand, and cutting/combining some characters to reduce confusion (otherwise the minor roles really would have gotten too little time and no development). An exceptional job was done developing Ender, basically giving him all the character depth found in the novel even under these time constraints.That said, characters such as Valentine and Peter, who were major characters in the novel, suffered greatly due to the constraint of the 2 hour runtime, as their entire subplot was cut out. Granted, if they did this as a mini-series, it could have been much more comprehensive to cover some of these and other subplots in the book. But if one is given enough runtime only to focus on the main plot of this book (and, that of a book of mostly internal monologues), this adaption is about as good as an adaption could get of this novel under these constraints of time and medium.",Ender's Game

The battle room scenes are very cool and you forget that the actors are all just on wires in front of green screens! Asa Butterfield does a fantastic job of portraying the character of Ender and he is definitely not overshadowed (as some suggested) by the rest of the star-studded cast.

I felt little connection to the story but will read the book due to what I felt I may have missed by watching this movie. All in all I feel my time was wasted with flashy lights and instructions to play the not yet released video game (a game I do not believe I will buy).

When I heard they were making a movie about Ender's Game, I reread the book twice. A lot of people do not understand how hard it is to make a movie out of a book. I remember Daniel Radcliffe, in an interview with J.K. Rowling, saying something to the effect that you can make the movie 7 hours long but still not include everything from the book. Book fans will virtually never be pleased when seeing their beloved book on the big screen. That being said I really liked the movie. I thought Gavin Hood did great job. *CAUTION THIS NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS* Certain parts however didn't sit well with me. For instance Bean went up on the launch with Ender, that's not what happened in the book. Another was how little they focused on Peter Wiggin. He is an important character to develop because Orson Scott Card wanted to show you what Ender didn't want to become. So often in the book when Ender resorted to violence he felt he was just like Peter. I know Ender's height was hard to swallow but casting a 6 year old to do the things he did would be impossible. Asa Butterfield did a wonderful job at bring to life Ender. He showed Ender for who he was, a compassionate but calculated battle commander.

Some of the character development happened a bit too fast. I think it might be a tiny bit confusing or less emotional for people that haven't read the book but I'm not sure.I have a pretty good imagination but the movie blew my mind with the epic final battle. I was also happily surprised that they kept the mental assessment video game in the movie. I wasn't sure how they would pull that off but they did amazing.The music is also perfect.

From the quick and pretty uninformative conversations to the shallow characters with literally zero development. Even the music score feels like it was added as an afterthought to give this ""previously on.."" a sense of urgency as you wait to see what's going to happen on today's episode.
I get that its a relatively short film based on a quite meaty and at times philosophical book. I understand that they had to leave out several sub-plots and a few minor character arcs. I'm fine with that. But I'm not ok with ignoring the development of the titular character and completely changing his personality. And I'm not ok with a movie making no sense unless you have read the book.

I think each character was portrayed very well, even if there wasn't enough time to develop some, mainly Peter and Valentine. This film was stunning, and put one of my favorite books onto the big screen in way that had me ""ooh""ing and ""ahh""ing. This movie is now one of my favorites, and I think deserves an award or two in the coming year. This film had beautiful action, emotion, and writing. I have described it to my friends as ""Gravity, if Gravity had interesting characters and an interesting plot*"" *I didn't enjoy Gravity",Ender's Game

536,contact-802-980538,Good special effects. Too many issues...,5,6 November 2013,Only 5 stars mostly for special effects. Couple weeks back I've entered the Ender's Game Series (set of 16 books). One of the best s-fi books I've ever read to be honest. However I was a bit disappointed with the movie: 1. Why Bean was on the shuttle with Ender?! 2. Acting was bad in certain parts. Especially when last battle was won. No feeling of happiness and tragedy at the same time or when Bean said 'The enemy gate is down' so fake. 3. Petra was almost flirting with Ender 4. Fantasy game was not highlighted enough 5. Stilson died. He did not end up in the hospital 6. Why Ender was so tall in the movie. I understand need to hire a teenagers but he did not look young or small at all. 7. They way Ender found the egg is so different from the book. Yet somehow he managed to find it in the cave right next to the military base. No one explored before? 8. Military base was on Eros an asteroid not a bugger planet. 9. Aliens were called buggers in the original book. Formics came later (Hive Queen book written by the Speaker For the Dead) 10. Why Bonzo was so small? 11. No real relationship between Ender and Alai 12. Ships used in last battle should be much older from the ones used on first 'simulation'These are couple more minor issues which I'll not mention it. If you never read the book you might find this movie interesting. Although they're rushing too fast through the movie.Enjoy it!,Ender's Game
537,mzhao-803-835966,Excellent Adaptation Notwithstanding Deviations from Novel,9,2 November 2013,"At the risk of inviting the scorn of the legions of strict adaptationists, I enjoyed this adaptation of Ender's Game. I can understand the frustration. I derived much of my enjoyment of the novel from the deliberate, evenhanded pacing and masterful character development. Condensing this bildungsroman epic into a two- hour film inevitably resulted in some loss of literary fidelity. In that sense, I think the film is a bit of a victim of the novel's success; those who revere the novel will no doubt notice the inconsistencies and shortcuts taken by film. Admittedly, some of these deviations are somewhat vexing. And those who are enjoying Ender's Game for the first time in either medium may feel harried by the film's unforgiving pace and confused given its bare-bones plot exposition.Yet for all the quibbles over where it stumbles, the film carries itself with a stirring gravitas. The art direction is sublime, and Steve Jablonsky's booming score is tremendous, giving me goosebumps on several occasions. Even if I couldn't find myself emotionally invested in the characters as I was reading the novel, the film evokes a sense of wonder which I found to be emotionally-compelling, per se. One might fairly characterize my taste in films as idiosyncratic, but I haven't been as engrossed in a movie's atmosphere since I first saw The Dark Knight.9/10.",Ender's Game

This is coming from one who does not enjoy reading books. To only watch this movie should be a crime.This movie could have easily been two parts. The entire time watching it I was surprised and confused. I was surprised at the animation. It was truly amazing. Better than I would have thought. I was confused because nothing was explained. I had to explain a lot of things to my friend who watched the movie with me but never read the book.How Hood should have started out was with Ender talking about being a third and what it meant. The term was just randomly thrown out there. Hood should have let Ender explain who Peter and Valentine are. The book is in the mindset of Ender, but the movie takes that relationship out. It was too much information to shove into 2 hours. Hood should have pushed a third hour. It may have given him more time to show the battles that Ender went through. Let us just pretend this movie never came out.",Ender's Game

The production was able to spend a butt ton of money on the effects and try to draw you into a vacuous story.Book Ender was quite lively and you revel in this victories while feeling his pain and near angst moments. Film Ender and crew just gave these touches of emotion. Naturally the book is near to impossible for Hollywood to produce. Card had some conversations early on (1990s 2000s sh (cannot use i s h because IMDb has painful rod up their rectum)) and it became clear how this would be a problem. I had hoped Card would not sell out but naturally he did. If scripts were public you could clearly determine where the wrong was made (and maybe there is a nice screenplay out there). If you love the book so much, write your own screenplay and cast it. Don't even bother with making the film until you have those elements down. You may find how valuable the book is and how horrific the film is just by exploring the impossible.

In fact after reading The Hunger Games and watching the movie, I thought I would never want a movie after reading a book. Anyways, this is not the case here.I was sitting a waiting for something to happen. Something cool. Something exciting. It turned out to be fruitless. As the movie was progressing, it was pretty clear what was going on with his training. Emergence of Ender as a leader was very baseless -- he was just assumed to one. His relationship with the girl were almost uncomfortable.Anyways, 3 start for effect -- big fan of CGI. However the rest of weak. If you like CGI as much as I do, watch it.

I went for the movie with my friend and thorough whole movie we kept face palming and yawning from boredom.SPOILERS down there!So first of all, why did it have to be a little kid who leads the 'battle'? The older guys/commanders wanted to pretty much do what he did then: destroy the planet because there are queens. They taught him, and then he did the job they wanted to be done. I don't really see how he was a 'genius' compared to those older commanders. Other than that it was just so damn childish, the simulation battles? Really? They wanted to make it super serious but it was just a bunch of kids playing laser tag. No matter how hard I tried, i couldn't take it seriously. I don't even want to describe how ridiculous was how they formed a team of some outcasts and they just suddenly became awesome geniuses because of Ender andd wuuuu And the ending! So basically at the end of the movie he randomly meets with some bug, gets queen egg and says he will now travel galaxies finding a home for it? Ehhh? What? Are you damn serious? Come on, how dumb is that. yeah, it could be a good movie for a kidBasically I advise anyone above 12 years old not to watch it.Also I did not read the book, just randomly went for this boring movie.",Ender's Game

Easily should have been a 3+ hour movie - so much is rushed through terribly. And what is with all the random alterations to some scenes that added zero to the storyline? So dumb. So many key elements left out or butchered. I expected to be slightly disappointed since I love the book, but to still enjoy it. But so much was changed and trashed - I wanted to vomit by the time it was over and so did my girlfriend. Seriously, it was that bad. Pretty much the only redeeming part was the battles with the buggers towards the end.",Ender's Game
543,nammerama2,"Sadly Lacking in Acting, Action and Overall Content",2,2 November 2013,"I tried going into this movie without high expectations because I knew this would be a hard book to convert to movie format. Unfortunately this movie fell way below my expectations, dashed my hopes, and was much worse than I feared it would be. Though I tried not to compare the movie to the book, this movie falls so far short of the book that I am surprised that O.S. Card allowed this movie to carry the same title at all. The most exciting parts of the book are completely missing as well as some of the most important character building elements of what made Ender who he was as a person and as a genius commander. Aside from the poor acting, there are also far too few battle room scenes to even make sense of what is going on there. For example, you can see dragon army rising in the standings somehow, no training scenes of the army, and only one or two battles with dragon army. There was not even a ""skimming over"" scene that could have helped explain why anyone would put the fate of mankind on this boys shoulders. Far too few battles in command school as well. Too much information was omitted to make this movie worth watching. This book should have been split into 2-3 movies to have done it right. I so badly wanted to write a good review for this movie that I gave it 2 stars instead of the 1 that it really deserves. Too, bad. Take my advise: If you saw the previews and enjoyed them, then try to be satisfied with those and move on with your life. Watching the film is not worth the added disappointment you will feel as you walk away from this movie with a much lighter wallet. :(",Ender's Game

My 11 year-old son and I both read the book. We saw the movie at a sneak preview in IMAX and we both really liked it. It does include most of the key events from Ender's journey, the acting and effects are wonderful. Yes, the ending is a bit different, but possibly setting up for the next one...

545,naduenas,From a die hard fan to a disappointed one,3,31 October 2013,"I read this book for the first time as a teenager in high school and found it to be a world of unknown limitations, where rational thought intelligent decisions, and carefully calculated emotions ruled the day guided by a genius mind. The images conveyed in every page of detailed descriptive writing, from the desperation of Valentine losing a 6 year old Ender, to the anguish of Ender, knowing he killed Bonzo, every major emotion was exploited and bared before the reader. The book was too short for what the readers wanted, and left us craving more, both in the continuing back stories such as Ender's Shadow as well as the deeper philosophical aspects of Xenophobia and those books which followed. This movie, however, left those of us who eagerly awaited the transition of the novel to the big screen appalled and eager for the lights to come up so we could hastily exit the theater, shaking our heads in utter disappointment at the epic failure that is Ender's Game: the movie. From the lack of voice-over (the only proper way to explain the large portion of the book told through Ender's thoughts) to the stilted acting, to the condensation of close to a decade of learning to less than a year, each minute was painful to watch, and even more difficult to swallow. The only thing that could have made this movie more of a disappointment in my book, would have been if it had been not only poorly written and acted, but also lacking in the visual graphics.I will say, the movie is beautiful to watch, though incorrect according to the descriptions in the book, but at least there's something nice on the screen that can ease the sting of the tattered shreds of a great story that's being crammed down your throat...",Ender's Game
546,brushcj,Terrible adaptation,4,1 November 2013,"I can't for the life of me understand how someone can say they read the books and enjoyed this movie. The movie deviates so much from the book that I can only assume these people haven't read the book since they were a kid 10+ years ago.The movie makes soooo many terrible changes for absolutely no reason at all. Some of the changes I despised, but I could at least see why it was necessary for time constraints - but there are plenty of changes that were just idiotic and unnecessary. Bean and Petra in particular were brutal to watch as their personalities were so radically different from the characters in the book; they may have read lines word-for-word from the book, Bean was displayed as a sociable joker, and Petra a soft- spoken empath. Anyone who has read the book would see how much these characters deviated from the book. And don't even get me started on the casting for Bonzo.If you've never touched the book, or you have a terrible memory, then maybe the movie could be decent. Ford does play an admirable colonel Graff, and even the child actors are quite good - although the characters they are playing are not at all like the characters in the book (but that's no reason to critique their performance).Do not watch this disaster if you're a fan of the book.",Ender's Game

But I plan to after enjoying this movie.This film was completely entertaining. There were a few segments which seemed rushed, which made it hard to connect with what they were trying to make you feel. I believe the overall length could have been extended to add more to these few lacking scenes. That would easily move this film into the 9/10 category.

The Battle Scenes look almost as it is realistic, and the ending leaves you at a cliff hanger - which is used almost perfectly. This sci-fi film lives up to the high standards that were set for them, as of including The Harrison Ford and Sir Ben Kingsley, and smashed goals. Hopefully this amazing film will win awards, and also for its child actors/actresses including Asa Butterfield ( Hugo, The Boy in The Striped Pajamas) and Hailee Steinfeld ( True Grit, Romeo and Juliet)Talking about Asa and Hailee, they make the bond between Ender and Petra seem precious. Their friendship is a very important part of the story, and they brought it out. Ender also has mixed emotions, a fear of becoming his violent brother Peter, and also missing his gentle sister, Valentine. Asa portrays the emotions beautifully, engaging with the audience. Well done to the talented team who put this film where it is now, and i totally recommend this film to anyone.",Ender's Game
549,drhanusey,"Loved the book, Severely disappointed with movie",3,1 November 2013,"I saw the trailer for Enders Game about 6 weeks ago, its piqued my interest so I investigated and wound up reading the book. I was blown away! in 6 weeks I've read 7 of the 13 titles in the ""Enderverse"". So to say that I have been staring at a calendar waiting for this movie to be released is an understatement. Right from the beginning I was disappointed with the portrayal of Ender. His distinguishing feature is his intelligence, and the slow talking Asa Butterfield almost seemed to be concentrating on his lines and being able to deliver them in an American accent rather then speaking like one of the most intelligent 12 year old's on the planet. I understand he had big shoes to fill, Ender is one of those great characters that stay with you for the rest of your life, that being said I firmly believe they chose the wrong actor.I don't mind that they had to change things around, I realize it had to be done, however they tried too hard to take a little bit of each section of the book and put them all together with out realizing that without enough detail the smaller samples were not realistic or convincing. Ender is supposed to become one of the greatest leaders in human history as well as winning his soldiers respect to that point where they would ""follow him to the moon without a space suite"" during his time at battle school but the movie would have you believe Ender won the allegiance of his hostile class mates by cracking a single joke!? There was no character development for Enders fellow classmates, other then Petra this movie could have been written without any of them and probably would have been better off for it.The battle room looked fantastic. The special effects in said battle room came up a little short. Maybe because I saw the making of Enders Game, or maybe because I saw ""Gravity"" a few weeks back, but the zero G stunts were not very good. Even though that was the case the look of the transparent walls of the battle room with Earth looming in the background carried enough weight as eye candy to make me want to see all the battles that Ender winds up winning with Dragon army. Unfortunately for me and those that read the book there was only one battle, a mix between 2 of the battle from the book that came towards the end of his training. This was just too rushed, I realize you can only cover so much with a 2 hour movie but this was not the way to do it.They quickly promote Ender to command school where he will be trained to command against the formics. They changed up part of this story and skipped over some of the deeper explanation about the ansible and sending the fleet to attack the buggers planet 50 years earlier immediately following the first invasion, but i feel this lack of detail left the following scenes less emotional then they could have been. The feeling that Ender was humanities last hope, and that the following battles would determine weather or not humanity will continue on or perish came up very short. I gave this film 3 stars pretty much based solely on the last several ""simulation"" battles. the special effect for these I thought were very cool. Enders control of the battle and being able to change perspective and zoom in and out were nice. But as was the theme for the whole movie, things were rushed, a montage was used to give the feeling that the team was being run down, Enders mentions at one point how hard him and his team are taking it having to do all these simulations over the past months. However Asa Butterfields acting didn't sell it. None of Enders soldiers really sold the feeling of being completely run down to the point where (in the book) Petra falls asleep in the middle of a battle, or Hot Soup (i think it was him) goes catatonic due to the grueling schedule. Again, these 12 years olds are supposed to be the best of the best on earth trained in a military facility to be Napoleonic commanders, but come across as a bunch or little kids having a good old time playing wii at a sleepover where they stayed up past their bed time. These kids shouldn't have been smiling at all, there should have been cold calculating looks on there faces with intelligence in there eyes and barrack talk coming out of their mouths. Anyway, the final ""test"" was visually stimulating, it did have a sense of urgency, and there was a nice boom at the end.I could go on about several other aspects of the movie that I was disappointed with (Graff, Anderson, Dap, Mr/Mrs Wiggins, Ender/Valentine, Bonzo..... all fell short) but I won't. I truly truly do not understand any positive reviews from anyone who has read this book. I can only imagine they were as hype as I was going into and let there preconceived notions of how great this movie would be take over for the time being. 7.0 / 10.0 .... way to high. Movies aren't supposed to be better then the books, everyone knows this, but as ""The Hunger Games"" recently demonstrated, they can still be good.",Ender's Game
550,androcles-833-502406,Heavyhanded,5,1 November 2013,"Heavyhanded. Especially in comparison to the book. This is a film that makes obvious conclusions because it doesn't trust its viewers to draw them. Its tone, pacing and complexity would have benefited with the inclusion of the Demosthenes subplot. Externalizing Ender's emotional fragility in the film was a mistake, especially given that a 16 year old was cast in the place of a 6 year old character. This causes the film to lose much of the punch that the book had. Ender in battle school at 16 is much less impressive than Ender in battle school at 6. Ditto with killing other children and being used by the government to fight wars. Given its sentimental tone (in comparison to the book) and its patronizing attitude towards its audience the film never rises above the mediocre.",Ender's Game

But I did not expect it to fail so spectacularly on every level.No character development. You get no sense of who any of the characters are. The battle game is barely in the movie. Ender gets Dragon army; He says ""training begins now"" and then it just cuts to an image of Dragon moving up the leader board. At no point do they attempt to explain why Ender is chosen to be the commander of the entire Earth fleet. They show none of his innovations, leadership ability, and he is downright unlikable at times. Everyone moves to his lunch table because he insults Bernard in class? What? That's why people will follow him to their death? Snark?I've known for two years that they cast an Ender that's too old but I didn't expect him to be a FOOT TALLER than Bonzo Madrid. They call Ender a Third several times but don't bother to explain what that means.The acting is awful (especially Ender, WE DID IT!!), the dialogue is pathetic. The special effects are nothing groundbreaking. The simulator scenes are pointless as you can't follow what's going on. Command School is ""near the bugger home world"". WHAT? How did they get there in time?? The fleet left right after the buggers did!

All but one of the main actors were amazing (the only actor in this movie who didn't fit the role was Harrison Ford... he seemed bored). After reading the book, I was certain it would fail as a film. When I saw the movie preview, I was quite skeptical. The book relied heavily on Ender's thoughts and Orson Scott Card's description of the zero-gravity practice sessions and ""simulated"" battles seemed too extravagant to be captured on film. I was dead wrong. The visual effects were incredible and Asa Butterfield nailed the brilliant, conflicted role of Ender. He channeled each emotion without saying a word; shifting from loving to fearful to angry to compassionate to tormented. He has more talent as a teenager than the majority of popular actors who make millions sleepwalking through roles. This movie was a blast to watch and Asa made it look effortless.

553,aaron_cahoon62,A Well-Made Adaptation of an Excellent Novel,9,1 November 2013,"I have been a tremendous fan of the Ender saga since I was a child and as a result this film was kind of nerve-racking for me: Will it be good? Will it be Percy Jackson? Needless to say most of my worries were generally needless as this was a well-made film.Visually the film does what it sets out to do quite well, bringing to life (and to a 21st century imagination)many of the things illustrated in the novel quite nicely. The CG, for the most part, is fantastic. There are a few parts where things look plastic, but nothing too distracting. All in all, looks good.But how's the acting? As expected, Harrison Ford delivers, and the actors playing the children do their job fairly well. My only complaint is the lack of limelight going to pretty much anybody but the protagonist since, for the most part, a lot of these characters are really well fleshed out and interesting in the novels. But for what they were given, they delivered.The film is surprisingly faithful to the novel as well. It is about as faithful as it could be, what with having to condense a 300 page novel that takes place over the course of several years into a two hour film. Naturally some things were cut or streamlined to keep the story engaging, and few parts if any really overstayed their welcome. Some scenes felt a bit rushed, but all in all, the film is faithful to the novel while bearing in mind the need to keep the pace going for an audience that is unfamiliar with the novel.All in all, this was a very enjoyable film from the perspective of a huge fan of the novel, and it feels as if it would be enjoyed by a casual crowd as well, but a few minor gripes and shortcomings hold it back from perfection. 9/10",Ender's Game

This did it justice in my opinion. Just saw it yesterday, and I have to say some of the grit and heart breaking self-conflict didn't come through right in the film, especially with Harrison Ford and Bean (read the book). Having to take the thoughts, feelings and raw brutality from the book and put it on screen is an enormous task. The director and Asa Butterfield did an outstanding job considering the real depth of the tale. Watch this movie. Don't focus on the age of the actors but the story itself. You may learn something. If you didn't get it, the kick in the end is the fact that Ender wasn't training once Mazer Rackham was involved. There were lives at stake.All in all, good job.

Movie goers looking to enjoy the emotional and philosophical ride that they experienced in Orson Scott Card's book, Enders Game, will leave feeling flat and unfulfilled. The film manages to adequately document the plot of the book while going above and beyond to create the visual aesthetic. The computer effects, costumes, and art design (if you ignore Ender's eye shadow) are stunning. Unfortunately, the producers did not give the same attention to other important elements in film. Where the book drew the audience in, giving them an internal and external viewing experience, this film simply showed the audience everything they needed to get the gist of the plot. In fact, all of the vehicles that Card used to create depth and wonder in his novel were absent: character development, patience, Ender's personal journey through his computer game, his siblings, and all of his families activities that were crucial to having any empathy and understanding for Ender himself –all absent from the film. The film does not show, it tells. The complex themes in the book are cut down to a simple story of unrealistically quick adaptation and ingenuity. The soundtrack is the same cliché heroic orchestral hurrah that we hear in every TV epic. They might as well have just used the Game of Thrones soundtrack, in fact, they might have. Without the stunning visuals and a few good performances it would be a complete failure. Asa Butterfield is the only real standout as Ender. Other performances were adequate, but unfortunately the writer's didn't give the actors much to work with in terms of emotion or expression of any kind. Films can have the same level of depth as books. It is dumb to expect the same experience in the film that you got from the book, but you can at least hope to see the film done with all the necessary trappings of a story well told.

Some scenes made me laugh although they were not supposed to be funny. It was like I was watching something from an acting school when the actors don't really nail their parts yet. Asa Butterfield was great, though. Harrison Ford... well I've never been his greatest fan. Ben Kingsley was a bit weird, i think they should have used him more and better. Again, I don't't think the director loved this movie enough to make it great. I was a bit disappointed. Special effects were nice. The training battles were good.

557,jsherman-834-629391,Disappointed by Everything but the Title and the Graphics,4,3 November 2013,"I give it 4 out of 10 stars. 3 stars are for the visually stunning graphics and the one star is for Harrison Fords nose because it's what I focused on for most of the movie. Now if you haven't read the book and don't plan too it is a brilliant work of teen fiction based using the inner monologue of a child to show the loss of innocence through war and using people as a means to an end. Now onto the movie, it is extremely similar to the book in terms of title, identical in fact, but they took way more justice in terms of substance and meaning. While trying to fit several years of a boys life in book time filled with thoughts and emotions they went with the bold move of having one sentence consisting of five word that covered months of thought processes and advanced scientific explanations. While the quick cut scenes of passing time keep you on your toes, because you're either trying to sneak out of the theater or have no idea what's going on because you haven't read the books, it makes it so no sub plot line is fully panned out but you see that there may have been some connection there in the book. The perfect medium of giving not enough information to satisfy the watcher, but enough to make them notice a better movie would have shown a relationship there. Now in the book they make it obvious that Lieutenant Anderson is the superior to Captain Graff, but the movie took justice with this making it so Harrison Ford could be the boss and that 20 minutes of the movie could be a close up on his face. Lastly onto Ender himself. While I am not an actor by choice (not my choice) I will say the performance was similar to me walking up to a child on a street and going, hey read this sentence and stare at that camera. So after reading the book and expecting some magical meaningful ending, the final meaning of the movie was follow your heart, you're friends are always there for you (even if they only make it into 3 scenes of your life and have no background), and Harrison Ford is kind of a dick. Now I hate to be that guy that points out movie flaws in sci-fi movies but at the end when he's walking on the planet with minimal oxygen and he needs to breath out of that can twice every minute, then has an interaction and just kind of forgets that he needs air to breathe, well I didn't forget and it makes me sad that you did. Now if you plan on going to see it I advise you to not go in thinking this is a good display of the book. In fact I advise you to not go in at all, and eat popcorn in the lobby while you read the book.",Ender's Game
558,kriss-835-694200,Strong history and nice acting.,10,3 November 2013,"Being a fan of the book I went to a movie a bit worried about how filming of Ender's world will be done. A lot of the book happens inside Ender's head - and that is complicated to film.But I was pleasantly surprised as the changes that were made to a book didn't harm the story. The story in a movie still concentrates around Ender's transformation from child to commander. Changes that were imposed by the movie limit the time Ender has to learn - he is no longer as young as he was in a book. Some other choices were obvious - there is no Locke- Demostenes plot and this doesn't hurt the movie. I really enjoyed Battleroom appearance and I think it is better than the one in the book :). The movie is nice to watch and I found some ideas that were added to the movie to be reasonable choices for completing the story. There was however one thing that bothered me after I watched the movie - I wasn't sure how many of the choices and changes to Ender situation were reasonable because I read the book. I am not sure if the way the situations unfold in a movie provides strong enough justification for the resulting decisions in the Battleschool. But I strongly recommend the movie and if you like it - read the book, you will like it even more.",Ender's Game
559,danielham-ib,"Good movie, bad adaptation",5,3 November 2013,"Overall, if you hadn't read the book, Ender's Game was a good movie. It lacked some character development, but the acting by Butterfield and Ford was pretty good. Now, to the bad part. If you read the book, you won't like the movie. The writers and director changed too many things from the book to the movie for it to be a solid adaptation. Some of the errors made a solid sequel to this movie impossible, as many plot points are missing, or just falsely done. I would've been willing to sit there for three and a half hours if it meant that they could get a solid and book-driven movie. Unfortunately, they didn't. It was almost two hours long, and didn't adapt well at all. There's no reason why they couldn't have gotten more of the plot correct, even in the time allotted. They should have made the movie longer. It was meant to be a longer movie. They didn't however, and it made the movie not nearly as good as it potentially could have been. This is yet another movie Hollywood has destroyed because of lack of attention to detail.",Ender's Game
560,sheilawindham,Waste of money,1,3 November 2013,"""Enders Game"" is my all time favorite book, but this movie should never have been made and is a waste of money. Lots of movies have to be changed a bit because there is just too much to fit in one movie, but they didn't just change a little bit. I ended up leaving before the end of the movie because It was so bad. In the book, you cared about Ender and all that was done to him, but in the movie, there was no reason to feel anything for him. They took several years of battle school and condensed it to just a couple of days, changed things that didn't need to be changed. If you didn't read the book, it would make absolutely no sense and if you did read it, it would just make you angry that they would butcher it so bad. The actors were good choices and they did a good job, but the story just sucked big time.",Ender's Game

Harrison Ford should get nominated for best actor and Ben Kinsley for best supporting actor. Imagine a movie where AP Students go to a war in the future. It also evolves out of the tiresome cliché storyline of the aliens are bad and we are good.It is very intelligent and brilliantly acted. Everyone did a great job in the film, and it is easy to see that Asa Butterfield will become a top star.I also predict it will be the most underrated movie of the year. Hollywood is not kind to science fiction.",Ender's Game
562,johnny04,Suffers from a few bad choices,5,5 November 2013,"The movie suffers from a few bad choices. The movie glances over the bully stuff, which is supposed to be the main theme of the story and to make people identify with Ender and root for him.The main bully is a short little guy who has to pull Ender down to face him. Yeah, that's very intimidating. Their fight is over before it starts.The secondary bully is a big chubby guy but never actually bully Ender in the movie.The fight with the aliens is the same, never got personal, so no one cheers at the resolution because we aren't rooting for Ender as much as we should. Whether he wins or loses, he has as much to lose as everyone else, not a tad more.The movie has no humor.If they added another 15-20 minutes to flush out the characters, it could have make a huge difference. Instead, most characters (the kids) are just stick figures around Ender.Overall, the movie lacks of character development but has lot pretty special effects, to the point fighting aliens look pretty.",Ender's Game

Because this is called ""cutting of your nose to spite your face"". You're doing no harm to anybody but yourself.There is a really good movie here, that covers the deeper aspects of a child's mind in an adult world, and you people want to protest against it? You're going to boycott someone's work, just because you disagree with them? You're going to discriminate against them, let your bias control your actions? If you boycotted this movie because of the author, you are a massive hypocrite.(To use a different example) I abhor everything the Westboro Baptist Church stands for. Yet they have a right, under the Constitution, to have their freedom of speech.Now, let's say they go and make a movie that is completely and totally unrelated to any of their views, and they hold a public screening of it.And you and all the others show up on motorcycles to drown the sound out.Just like the WBC did at funerals with their anti-gay speeches.Hypocrites.

564,onlyanamerican1,Worth watching,6,7 November 2013,"While the movie itself has great graphics and an excellent choice of actors it fails to capture what made the Ender book series great. I found after watching, that this movie only follows the book about half the time and introduces character interactions that didn't take place in the book. It also failed in conveying Enders character and how he evolved into the person he would become.Taken as a whole: This movie is worth seeing at least once.on a personal note; it would be nice if these directors and producers in Hollywood would stop putting their ""Intellectual interpretation"" on popular fiction because they take away what made the original story so appealing in the first place.",Ender's Game
565,don-peppers,"I wanted to be disappointed in this movie, I was disappointed",8,7 November 2013,"After seeing the trailers for Ender's Game, I knew that the movie was not going to follow the book. I just knew they were using the title and making up crap as they went along. I knew I was going to be disappointed in this movie. I am so glad I was disappointed in my expectations.I liked this movie, yes it felt rushed, the only thing that appeared to let you know there was something else happening that we didn't really see was the Dragon Army's rise on the leader board. In the Book, Dragon Army was at the top and never dropped, in the movie we saw it raise to the top. I went and saw this movie with a friend that was also a fan of the Ender Series. She and I both came away with the same impression. This was a good movie. It left out a lot of things that could not have been included in a 2 hour movie. Especially the reason why Ender being a third was such a drastic influence. It barely touched on the relationship between Peter and Valentine and their relationship with Ender. Or why was it Valentine not his mother or father that went to the lake house. If there was one major disappointment in the whole film, it was the ending of the last battle. I did not feel any of the desperation, the total exhaustion that the book let me with. Like Battle School, the movie missed the lead up to the final battle. I can forgive the ending, it was artistic license so it was not as disappointing as it could have been (See the movie to see what I am talking about).However the consensus between myself and my friend, Ender's Game was a good movie. Some of the scenes were stunning, some were a little flat, and some required some understanding that was not provided by the movie. My suggestion, see the movie, then read the books, the two must read books in the 16 book series, Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. I really hope the Sequel will be Ender's Shadow, because like the books, Ender's Shadow will explain those parts that were left blank. Long Live the Giant, though he must die in the end.",Ender's Game

Having the battles only briefly viewed under the belief that they were games was a bit of a let down at the end. i really hopped to see one big battle at the with some great action. not a concept of computer simulations that kept ender thinking he had nothing to lose, which yes i know helped him focus and work to his advantage but didn't cover enough. Over all i did enjoy the film, but it was not a Cinema film deffo a DVD job at home. save your self some money buy the DVD it is worth it, but if it is still on in the cinema don't bother.",Ender's Game

I'm not particularly picky with adaptations, I have liked plenty of them, but this is maybe the 1st adaptation I really disliked.Such a long story, with all the character development present in the books, required 3 hours as a minimum, maybe even 2 separate movies or even a 10 hour TV series. After watching this, the feeling I get is that I have just watch a trailer for a movie or a history documentary resuming years of training/war in a small documentary. Entire battles are crammed up in a few seconds, there are only 2 battle room battles in the entire movie, each lasting a minute or less!!! With the exception of a couple of scenes there is very little dialog that help you with characterization.The battle room looks great and the academy too. Other then that you're better off reading the books then maybe watch the movie, just to see a nice interpretation of the battle room.",Ender's Game
568,xmcarrie,I want to see a sequel for sure!,10,10 November 2013,"I never read the book and never even heard of it before entering the theater and I feel like that's maybe I enjoyed the movie so much more! Everything looked fantastic and breathtaking on the big screen. Actors did a brilliant job. Asa Butterfield is such a talented young actor. I can't imagine anyone else playing Ender better than him. The movie is not only sci fi it also has real feelings which you don't normally find in any typical sci fi movies (I've watched so many sci fi movies before and watching them once is more than enough for me - simply because they're forgettable.) However the personal emotions in Ender's Game were so delicately communicated by Asa Butterfield. His eyes, facial expressions, and actions reveal all sorts of emotions. While watching the movie I felt like I was really connected to the characters, their thoughts, struggles, and pain as if I were there! Everything feels so real in that movie. To be honest I've watched it multiple times already and my interest level hasn't reduced even a bit - and that's part of the reason I gave it a 10. I wish Ender were real and the leader of our planet. Most people who watched this movie would love this movie, unless they spent majority of their energy comparing it to the book. I hope to see a sequel for sure. They better improve their marketing strategy next time by not making it sound like just another sci fi - the movie has so much more than that! Other sci fi/adventure movies that are selling more simply because they have started marketing since long time ago and the actors are well known. If I hadn't randomly selected Ender's Game to watch I'd never discovered this great movie and the great young actor Asa Butterfield. In an interview Asa mentioned whenever making a movie regardless how big or small the role is just try to leave your mark...and he successfully did it.",Ender's Game
569,dhar-juhi,"Left me with strange mixed feelings, but definitely worth a watch",8,11 November 2013,"For all potential movie goers I'll give a spoiler free synopsis for the movie. I think comparable to most of the reviews here, this is a good movie but falls short of being great. It left me feeling similar to the recent Great Gatsby adaptation, in that they manage to keep true to the events of the book and yet manage to somehow loose their impact. But I think definitely watch it for the kid playing Ender (Asa Butterfield) I was very pleasantly surprised! Being a HUGE fan of the book and the entire quartet, world etc of Ender I will admit I did not want to see the movie when I heard teenagers are cast instead of the children of the book. But I was definitely proved wrong, Asa's brilliantly nuanced performance of Ender conveyed a LOT of what was left out from the books (with a better script/dialogue/adaptation it could have been perfect). I understand why they did that, and still say that a LOT of the brutality and the sickness you feel at the pit of your stomach while reading the book is a bit lost, since it is no longer a 7 year old child being manipulated and near tortured!**** SPOILER ALERT ****Now for delving into the details - they've taken the events from the book and pretty faithfully inserted it in the movie. Now for whatever reasons i felt the events were hollywodized (for lack of a better word)!! They really did themselves and the movie a disservice by not staying true to the brutality and the visceral reaction to same as explored in the book. It was just tossed around in dialogues between Graf and Anderson never felt and therefore made real for me while watching the movie. And that was the main reason why to an extent as a book adaptation 'the hunger games' was more successful than this. The kept the impact of the reality of what happens when children (no matter how gifted) are the ones expected to fight to the death. This for me was a BIG omission in the telling of Ender's Game. They should have kept the brutal and messy fights which Ender had for it to have had any impact on us as a viewing audience. And that scene of children switching tables to Ender's side was just OMG! I don't know what to say! It almost ruined the somberness of the entire movie!!! What were they thinking!?? the WHOLE point of Ender's world was that this is not an ordinary high school with ordinary children!!! GAH! Somewhere along the line they forgot to make us 'feel' instead of just react to the visuals. Which were quite outstanding by the way, I think the final battle was brilliant and visually better than I imagined it to be (something I can't say for the rest of the movie). I do think some omissions should have been added - like more of the battles and some scenes to make us realize Ender's rise as a commander. How truly psychotic peter was so that we can feel much better Ender's deep rooted fear of becoming Peter, which in turn helps inform us of his true empathetic nature. Anyway enough said, bottom line - I liked the movie, mostly because Asa Butterfield and the CGI was stunning to watch. It should have been made into a mini series instead for sure, or at least 2 parts. Part 1 focusing on the battle school and Part 2 on the actual training and the war and a more drawn out epilogue. I missed the conversation of the queen larvae with Ender! Dislike was for the sense of incompleteness and emptiness it left in me (being a massive fan of the book) the movie did not even come close to the true gravitas of the book, which was a shame, since I felt it easily could have with the same cast and 15 min more!",Ender's Game

Ender's empathy is what drives the whole story: it contributes to rapid promotions; allows him to become a leader; & is the single most important tool he uses to find the weakness in his opponent, but it also forces him to connect emotionally to the enemy & results in a great burden to him when he conquers them.Outstanding acting all around from both the veteran actors and the kids. The movie adaptation is less dark than the book which works for me. I want to be able to watch a meaningful, thought-provoking story with my teenagers, one that offers complexity of character and situation that leads to discussion. Most of the special effects and environments were convincingly futuristic and realistic. The soundtrack enhanced the story and added to the emotional weight already there. We loved it enough to see it a second time, and while the element of surprise was no longer there, we enjoyed the movie just as much. We were able to pick up a few things we missed the first time, talked about character motivation, actor delivery, plot, etc. It was very satisfying because there were so many elements to explore.",Ender's Game

Strong visuals, strong story (book is much stronger of course, but what do you expect?) and decent/engaging acting. The only thing I hated is that they really didn't mentioned why the war started. Without it, the moral problem of Ender is not clear. If you go by the movie, bugs started it - bugs got it. Genocide is bad of course, but not as much as war based on misunderstanding of biological principals.But the main reason I LOVED the movie. It's for what it's not. It's not a remake, it's not n'th sequel to pop franchise, it's not vampire love story, it's not formulaic, it's not insulting to my intelligence like every other movies sans Gatsby I saw in 2013.It makes you think, it makes you feel, it keeps you at the edge of your seat.",Ender's Game

Usually, I use the movie trailers as a guide to help me decide if the action looks spectacular.Although the trailer for Enders didn't seem that inspiring, I took a chance after reading about the book series plots and decided that in spite of the so-so trailers, it was worth a try based on the potential story quality. Face it, if you're looking for clean action movies that are good enough quality that multiple generations of the whole family can enjoy them, it can be slim pickings these days.Outcome: parent/teenager agreed the movie was worth a second viewing while it's still in theaters - and I can't remember the last time we agreed that a movie deserved that. Don't usually write reviews, but since it's a rare movie that exceeds my family's expectations, thought I'd pass it along in case you and your family may enjoy it too!",Ender's Game
573,belamnon,"should be perfect movie, but...",4,13 November 2013,"just finish watching it, and my personal opinion are: 1. Got to watch in 3D, the special effects surely will come more real and cool.2. for the characters. this movie tries to show how the real world is focus on two main characters, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield). - Colonel Graff. He only sees these children merely as a tool or pion to win a war (I'm helping my father raising horses etc. he didn't care about their feeling as long as earth wins (when he cuts ender debate by saying something like I don't care as long as we win). in real life, it shows a selfishness of an adult that ""I don't care anything as long as I win"". - Ender Wiggin. A boy who at first compassionate of becoming a commander and fight these creature (surely destroy them). but as he follow the training and all the experience he had, got a turn point become more rational, hate the war, questioning about the enemy. this shows how in real world when a boy grown up, meeting up new experience and people will shape him and mature him.3. The bad guys. at first i was focusing on the characters, so I didn't care too much about the alien etc. but when Ender finally met the alien, whereas in this movies, it was shown as a creature grasshopper and ant fusion. How on earth and alien world that an graso-ant be able to made a battleship like that, how they build it, etc. I mean do they build it with their psychic power or what. for me it should be a bit more rational bout the creature. but then again this is from a book.4. The ending. for me it would be a good movie if it ends just focusing on how will Ender react after being lied by adult (graff), knowing he merely only a tool to kill. how Ender will facing the rest his life where in one sided he will be known as a hero who save earth for all time, but on the same moment his consciousness will full of guilt of being a murder, a destroyer of a planet, an entire race.This is just my personal thought.

574,tremere-850-823690,Probably as good as could be achieved without making it a two-parter.,7,21 November 2013,"In preparation for the movie, I reread the book last weekend, so I went to the theater with the story fresh in my mind. Maybe this was a mistake though. I spent most of the movie comparing it to the novel rather than watching it for its own sake. But how does it compare then? Well, cinematography and effects are great and the movie looks pretty much the way I'd imagined it or at least close enough. They also include almost all the story lines, all the major characters and stick as close to the book as can reasonably be achieved. Mission accomplished then? Not quite. My main gripe with the movie, and this may be much less of a problem for people who didn't read the book, is that the scope of the story is missing. Ender spends six years in Battle/Command School, but in the movie it's more like a couple of months. I get that there were time constraints (and the fact that aging such a young actor would have been tricky), but as a result the whole thing feels rushed. The same can be said about the battles in battle-school. It fails to show Ender's gift for tactics and really skims over his relationship with the other students.There is also the fact that the movie is softer than the book. In the book, Ender kills Bonzo (and Stilson before that). Here, he only critically injures him. In the book, training is extremely taxing at Battle-school and command school is downright grueling with multiple nervous breakdowns from students.The movie also omits the Demosthenes/Locke storyline, but that can be forgiven, since it most likely would have taken far too much time to portray on the screen.All in all and given the time restrictions, they did a good job.",Ender's Game

I am a huge fan of the Sci-fi book Ender's Game. Although the opinion of an ordinary girl half the Earth away may seem trivial to you, I still want to thank you for showing a reader a world I thought only existed in imagination.Unlike some other Sci-fi movie (I don't want to mention name here) which fall into the easy track of piling up fancy battle scenes and advocating individualistic heroism, this piece of art work is a loyal presentation of the essence of the book. I do enjoy the breath-taking demonstration of the battle room and the inter-stellar war in this movie, but what I appreciate most is how it depicts Ender, the main and most complicated character in the book. This movie shows a true Ender, so the audience can see both a fragile and incredibly strong boy. The director even managed to show the deep influence on him by his cruel brother with minimum scenes with Peter.War is never the emphasis, but Peace is. I'm glad that although training and fighting are important scenes of the movie, it did not stop there. On the contrary, it raises the question that why we have to fight this war, and whether there is any chance of peace, which is consistent with the idea of the book: every civilized species in the universe should be treated equally and with respect.",Ender's Game

Characters like Peter, Dink and even Valentine felt like you really couldn't understand they're relationships with Ender. This movie also skipped over a whole epidemic in the novel. Other than that this movie was nearly perfect. Overall I was extremely fond of the movie and how close it was to the novel. A great performance by Asa Butterfield. You could really feel the pain Ender was going through from his great acting. My rating:8/10",Ender's Game

In a greater directors' hands there might have been a superior outcome. If the film frames were pages, I would rip most of them out and bin them. The filmmakers have failed to capture the magic of the book onto film. The screenplay was atrocious. The great Harrison Ford gives one of his worst performances to date. Han Solo would not be proud. Viola Davis is not a stand out either. Asa Butterfield, who plays the title character does a fine job. We'll see more of him in the future. Ben Kingsley, who appears to be popping up in every other blockbuster these days, has too small a part, to make a significant impact. Expect no sequels.",Ender's Game
581,yeshuahislord,"Okay, but not Card's story.",4,12 December 2013,"I just finished watching Ender's Game, and this is my review. If you know and love the book, you will find it disappointing on many levels. The directing by screenplay writer Gavin Hood leaves lots to be desired, although the special effects are incredible, minus a few continuity mistakes (missing colored direction lights in hallways inconsistently for instance). The book issues are many, making me really hope someone does an animated mini-series on this someday to get it right. Bean is introduced at the same time as Ender, and is not the tiny runt he must be with his genetic condition, making much of the ""Enders Shadow"" series impossible as written. Also, Ender is WAY too old at the beginning of the film, which makes him a decent sized, almost tall, early teen. The idea of the tiny extra young recruit is completely lost, even though they kept some of the lines that refer to it. They even made the Salamander Commander about 8 inches SHORTER than Ender, which really defeats the purpose of the whole bully concept and looks pathetic on screen when trying to convey the pressure Ender was under. They rushed through battle school so quickly that I wanted them to divide the movie into 2, one ending with the final Battle School victory, and the second to go into the Command School war. It would have made for better film in this case. As it stands, the pressure buildup that allows the audience to understand why 2-teams was such a big deal at that point never happens, making it just another somewhat interesting event, not the overwhelming pressure event that it would be had they built it up as they did in the book. Also in the final Formic battle, they rushed it, giving the Formics only their main planet instead of battle by battle on the outpost planets, also thereby rushing and only using the Little Doctor once, and not in even a similar manor to that in the book. They even gave the line ""The Enemy Gate is down"" at the START of the battle, making half of ""Ender's Shadow"" issues useless in future films. So if, like me, you are a big fan of O.S. Card and this book and series, this film will leave you feeling like you still want to see your favorite book on film, because this was not it.For those who are not familiar with the book, this is a somewhat good movie, not great, but not entirely bad. They build it up nicely, despite bad directing, and the end climax conveys well what happens to Ender's head and how he is as a person, which is much of what the point of the story truly is. There is, unfortunately, much that is never explained in the movie, but referred to, though, and so sadly, you must be familiar with the book to fully understand this movie, even though the movie is so very far off of the book in so many ways. An example is a mention of ""using the ansible"" but no explanation what the ansible is. Altogether not worth seeing in theaters, but a nice mindless rent maybe once. I would not watch it twice except to compare notes if sequels are ever made or if the Ender's Shadow series is ever made into film. The acting is limited by bad directing in my opinion. It is a nearly all-star cast. Harison Ford, who used to swear he would never do a movie with aliens, does an excellent job as Commander Graff, but you see very little of the necessary discipline that comes with his station and rank, which I believe is bad directing (based on the equally mediocre jobs of the other actors). Asa Butterfield, who played Ender, is just mis-casted. He is a good actor I am sure, but really did not fit this role at all, either with or without the book. I am sure he may be good in other roles with a good director. In this film, they also seem to hint at a romantic desire from Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) to Ender, which would also cause issues with the Ender's Shadow series. Abigail Breslin played an excellent Valentine Wiggin, and even though she was on for probably less than five minutes, was the best acting job I saw in this film. Of course, with the bad directing, her short screen time could be the reason she did so well. Ben Kingsley also did a decent job as Mazer Rackham, although some tech issues already brought up elsewhere on this site plagued even his screen time. Conor Carroll was a very believable Bernard, which is nice since so little else carried that well. There was far too little development of any of the other characters enough for mention, which is sad, because the book does an excellent job of doing so. The director here just did small dabs of character development that never matured. It is really too bad they refused to use book author Orson Scott Card's screenplay. It could not have been as bad as this.As a big fan of both sci-fi and of the author and book, I rate this film 4 out of 10 stars.",Ender's Game
582,polyxenitopalidou,Objectively shallow and trashy,1,2 September 2014,"NOTE: If you're a book reader that was curious of the film adaptation, skip to the ending of this review for my conclusion on the matter, as I, too, only came to this movie because I loved the book.Let us begin by saying that the movie was extremely short for the material it tried to work with, and as a result came off as completely shallow. It never deepened on key points, and it was obvious from the start that the only connection with the books that was going to be made would be the name of the characters and the general movie timeline. Some more specifics:α) Ender's character was not explored. At all. His tactical genius, his inner struggles, his loneliness was all left out. As a result, Ender, throughout the film, remained a brat that the viewer did not really connect with and said viewer would constantly ask himself (as many people watching alongside me, who have not read the book, asked themselves) 'why are they giving command of the entire human fleet to a 12 year old'? NOTE:Ender's loneliness was also completely destroyed when they showed him making friends not only during Battle School, but also during Command School. So much for the struggle of the lonely leader. Ender's accidental murders didn't make it on-screen either, which took away from the tragic part of Ender's existence. Bonzo did get killed, but they made it look completely like an accident, possibly because they couldn't film complex fighting scenes with the juvenile actors.β) Peter and Valentine were not explored at all, again. This gave the viewer NO connection whatsoever at why Valentine was important to Ender, and why she acted as his moral compass. Peter, also, was left out and the whole aspect of Ender's fear and self-loathing for slowly turning into, or reacting like Peter wasn't there. Because of that missing concept, Ender seemed more immature and less fleshed-out as a character, too.γ) Demosthenes and Locke weren't explored, at all. That left a huge void in the backstory of the film and, again, why Peter, Valentine and Ender were important as Special Children, why they thought very much unlike 12 year olds and how big their genius was. Also, the nature of humans seeking out conflict, even right after eliminating the Bugger threat or seeking to murder Ender would lend a nice gritty feel to the ending part of the movie. But alas.δ) The timeline was extremely cramped because of the movie's time limit. Ender's recruitment into Battle School to his Graduation Battle on Eros'es Command School happened over the course of 2 months, in the movie. While they also constantly dropped hints about the human fleets approaching Bugger worlds and getting ready for a fight, which took away from the final twist.ε) The Mind Game and the Speaker for the Dead part was not explored. As a result, the ending was a complete clusterfuck. People were legitimately asking ""What the f*ck"" around me at that point. Nobody knew how Ender 'communicated' with the queen or where he had formed the connection to her. Nobody knew how they could build a place in honour of Ender since, in the movie, nobody explained the concept of space-travel time passage, at no point were we aware that the trip to Command School apparently took 3 months, so a viewer would rightfully think, 'Ender was introduced to this whole thing AND the Mind Game last month, how could the Buggers have built a monument to him 27 years ago'? Also, Ender doesn't even find the monument in the colony world with Val, he finds it right there on Eros, the Command School planet, along with a fully alive Queen!I stopped trying to make sense of the film from the middle of it. I became increasingly bored as I watched. I realized that it was a kiddie film, or a quick cash-in on a very popular sci-fi classic.Book readers, Do not seek the complexity of the book here. People who enjoy good films, avoid Ender's Game. If you would like to watch and decide for yourselves, find a way that will not cost you money, because you would be throwing them down the drain.I was utterly disappointed.",Ender's Game

Man of Steel, Pacific Rim..... and all of these movies disappointed me. My brother begged me to take him to see Enders game for his birthday, and I thought ""Enders game? What the heck is that?"" My expectations were low as I entered the theater. And when I left, I was blown away. From creating suspense from the battles, to tears at the ending, this movie had it all. A great hero, a great actor, and an amazing scifi film.Now, those of you who are saying that is was a disappointing movie have obviously never seen an MST3k. Those are bad movies, made good by the crew. To make a movie like Enders game, and to have it go through all of the problems that it did and still come out this good is nothing short of epic. The special effects were outstanding. If you want to know how it is to make a movie like this, go and do it, and tell me how it went afterwards.I agree that it could have been longer, but thats besides the point. If they had, the movie might be too good, and then people wouldn't stop watching it!! As for the book being better, I do not own the book, though i have read it. I plan on owning the movie.

It's just not good the way it is now.There are too many things left hanging. Like ""what and why is this third kid policy?"" ""Alais Salaam - what does that mean?"", his relationship with his sister Valentina, the way Ender gained acceptance and friends, etc. The training and evolution of dragon army is completely left out, like what made them special and different from other armies, what did they do differently? it's all mentioned, but not explained.

585,craigbrotherston,Horrible,3,22 January 2014,"Just really bad. That's all. I was quite looking forward to seeing it because the trailer looked great but my god, I don't know what to say. The film was very dull with unrealistic events and characters. The main character was like a wet noodle. Finding a connection with this soft planet saver was truly impossible. 7.1 rating? Not a chance. I'm quite sure I have seen every decent film created for the past 20 years and I would personally give this a 4.0, at best. Just awful. Harrison Ford ought to be ashamed of himself. 2 hours of pampering a little sissy with dreams of grandeur. Puke.Another story LOADED with potential but dumbed down to suit the masses.",Ender's Game
586,ap-francis,Lacking on every level.,5,14 August 2014,"I give this movie a generous 5 out of 10. To no extent should this movie ever be considered great or even good. As someone who is a fan of Scott- Cards writing, especially Enders Game, I expected nothing less than exceptional acting, and promising story conviction. The movie lacked in pretty much every aspect. The special-effects were less than impressive; seeing it was a science-fiction based novel/movie, I assumed they would bring out great(ER) effects, if not that, amazing cinematography, which they did not. The movie failed not only visually, but on a simplistic matter of story line. First off, there was no character development what so ever and the dialog was less than stimulating. Noting that I've read the book, I knew they would trail off a bit, but I didn't suspect that they would completely rewrite the story. Not only did they portray each character wrong, or add characters in when they weren't supposed to be there (BEAN) but they also left out the complex line of events from Valentine and Peter- whom in the end of the movie should have played a BIG role. As well as taking out significant parts in Enders life (deaths, fights, conversations)so the rating would be low enough for younger children to see. Personally, I think changing anything to get a different audience to watch is wrong, specifically when it's a film adaptation. Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the adaptation of one of the best science-fiction books I've ever read and as a student studying film and the history of film, I was let down by this sorry-excuse of a movie. It was more of a tragedy. In all, I give it a 5, only because I could recognize the effort that went into the film, but they didn't execute it in a way where I was expecting. So, if you don't mind sitting around watching a beautiful book get torn to shreds for 2 hours, please be my guest in watching this film.",Ender's Game

When I saw that Orson Scott Card co-produced the movie I had high expectations. I was not disappointed. Ender's Game the movie stays true to the book. Much of the dialog is taken straight from the book. I'm sure the movie would not be near as enjoyable if you haven't read Ender's Game. I recommend reading it before you see the movie.

At no point in the movie did I find any of the characters weak, even with a cast full of children and young adults there was enough to keep me interested in each character.

594,leslisa1,Disappointing at best,4,18 February 2014,"So much is wrong with the movie. Ender's more than just too old. He's too mature. He's a genius but he's still a child. Where is Locke? Where is Demosthenes? This extremely important subplot is never even mentioned. Where is Ender's jeesh? Why are years of training squished into a month. Months on a lake are shoved into a 2 minute visit on a raft. The respect he earns, the solitude of command, the unfairness of the games, the beating down and building up of his soul, all of it gone. Ender's mind, his motivation, his true genius are never explored just forced down you're throat like a too hard to swallow pill. The beauty of the book is we sometimes hate Ender as much he hates himself but we always respect him, we always want him to succeed. We see within him the struggle many go through. I never FELT during the movie. I never felt the self implosion, the true love he has for Valentine, the realization he was a monster. Gah! So sick of books I love being raped for a quick buck. The Hobbit was exaggerated into two very long, disappointing movies. Ender's Game is condensed into one short, disappointing movie.

I thought there choice of actor for the character Ended was spot on as well, to what I understand that Ended's character seem cold or rather jaded to human emotions through out the first two books. He quoted ""he's the making of the Reaper Death itself"" which I had to agree with him. So points for that!

Movie would definitely have been better if longer. Ender's age, though the novel encompasses a far longer time frame I felt that by choosing , one actor who fell middle of the road age-wise, the movie accomplished a continuity that would have failed if different actors were used to play the character. Regarding Donald Armstead's review-Confused as to why he has a problem with height difference between Ender and Bonzo. Actor playing Bonzo is clearly older than Ender, in fact, he is actually 3 years older than the actor playing Ender. Even then just watching them it's obvious. In the long run it actually helps to clarify all the difficulties Ender must face to accomplish what is being required of him.",Ender's Game

I read this book in one of my classes in school, and we discussed many aspects of the book at the time. The overall quality of the film allows you to overlook the missing aspects of the book. It was amazing how much was pulled together in a little under two hour movie. I would suggest if you have read the book, you will not be disappointed. Another aspect of this film is its ability to allow you to transform your depiction from reading the book. The visual images created in the film are absolutely stunning. I would have suggested things be a little clearer for those who have never had experience with the story.",Ender's Game

I do feel that once he gets to the command school that they could've spent more time on that though. The final battle seemed to be a pretty good depiction of what happened during the book and definitely was entertaining to see the visuals of the battle.

Ender's Game is a very, very hard book to make a film adaptation of, simply because the book really centers on Ender's thoughts. The movie contained some really nice CGI, and hey, the acting was not nearly as bad as some reviewer's claim. I will say, however, that there was not much character development, which is a bit of a let down, as it would have been a huge plus to an already decent movie. I will also say that the score is simply amazing, probably one of the best movie scores I have ever heard. The only other objection I have with this movie is what they chose to include from the book. There is so much source material in the novel that the movie could have been at least another half-hour long,and it would have been a huge plus. Other then that, a fairly solid action adaptation of a very popular novel. 9/10 stars.",Ender's Game
601,maryrawle-111,"Poor Writing, Casting and Character Development",1,19 March 2014,"This movie had a lot of disappointing aspects for me. If the viewer has not seen the book, I would describe it as a fast-paced and rather interesting action movie. If the viewer has seen the book, or is a real fan, as I am, then I would describe this movie as a failure. So many things were changed or not taken into account that it is just inexcusable.As most reviewers have noted, the movie was too short. There is just too much material that needs to be included for this movie to be of any quality. My suggestion would be to present it as a mini-series rather than multiple movies, because the viewers are following a thread that should not be interrupted by great amounts of time.I agree that certain things can be left out entirely, such as anything about his home life (except for the event with Stilson). It is too time consuming to include. The movie made the characters so shallow, why would one need to know background at all? I will assume that the characters were shallow because they were trying to tell the story too fast, to cram all the plot into an allotted amount of time. This is a reason for producers to wait until they have better terms on which to make a movie, movies or series.The violent events that involved Ender were all changed or omitted. The whole Bonso thing was a disaster in my opinion. Bonso was supposed to be much larger than Ender...a very threatening bully. In the movie, Bonso is a head shorter than Ender. Ender would seem like a bully to overpower or hurt this little wimp on purpose, so they made it an accident. Why was this violence taken out? Did someone think it would traumatize young viewers?Size is a very important factor in children's lives. Ender Wiggin was a very small child in the book. This was a very big part of his character. He was younger, much smaller and much smarter, a profile that other children always resent. And it was a victory that he had the charisma to become a good leader that the children would naturally follow. In my opinion, this was half of the story. Asa Butterfield did an adequate job, but I think many other young actors could have performed just as well, and been physically correct for the role.It was important that several of his close friendships be developed. Without this, the movie is flat. He has basically one-line interactions with the other children, except for Petra, which was turned into a semi- romantic situation, which was not true to the book.Character development is paramount to a story. If you don't invest interest in the characters, you don't care what happens to them in the end. Scenes should have been put in to do this, so more time to tell the story was essential.The pilots in the simulation were referred to as ""drones,"" which I assume means they were not human. Nothing was said about a live fleet, that had traveled for a whole generation to meet the Formics in battle, which is what the situation actually was supposed to be.When it got to the end of the movie, I thought, gee, the situation is interesting, but I don't really care what happens to anyone. I might have been affected if Ender himself had died, but even his character was not developed very well.The exception in the movie is Ben Kingsley. Ben Kingsley is excellent in everything he does, and he is excellent in his role here. He makes the most of what is given to him, but even that wasn't very much.My summary as to why I thought this movie was awful: There was not enough time allowed to tell the story the way it needed to be told. If enough time were allowed I can only assume that it would have been used to develop the characters in a way that would make the viewers care about the story. And the casting of the characters including Ender, Bonso and Bean, should have been done more thoughtfully. I thought that the reason this book was not made into a movie sooner was because the cinematic effects were not developed enough to make things look real. The movie looked great visually, I am just so disappointed that they really botched the rest of it.",Ender's Game

I have never read the original book(s) to be able to express my overall thought, but over all I would label it as an 'Okay' film. As far as the production side of things, there are areas in the film that a thinker will not let go. Continuity is one of the things that the production team should of looked over in some scenes, and a few action sequences that didn't felt believable, as well as its Sci-Fi establishment. What I mean by that is most Sci-Fi films like to show you the science/technology in the films, at times film makes/writers like to incorporate the science/tech in its dialogue to the point were if its too much it becomes agonizingly annoying. 'Ender's Game' however didn't over explain the science/tech in its dialogue, they focused more on the story (personal opinion). However they tend to over establish a number of the science/tech in scenes, and a number of it will lead you kind of board. But I guess if you have a lot of effects in a film, you kinda have to show what the developers have done. I will give credit to it's message, me explaining it will only ruin the whole point of the film being made in the first place. But its message really is one that makes you think on the outcome of war. And lastly, i'm only 20 right now.

605,social_d_emily,Rapid story succession with no character development,3,27 April 2014,"The fact that I'd take the time to review the movie version of a book that I wasn't particularly fond of should speak for itself. Yes, I've read the book, which in most cases I think ruins your suspension of disbelief when it comes to the film version, but in this case it was the only way I would understand the plot of the film. The film took off rapidly and immediately grabs Ender and pulls him from his special Earth based school and pushes him into military school on an space station. We get a brief moment to see that he is, I guess, supposed to be very close to his sister while having a horrible and abusive relationship with his older brother. I personally didn't get anymore out of it than his brother was a bully (much is left to desire after knowing how psychotic and much of a sociopath the character of his brother is in the book). Ender is whisked off the military school where I guess he does well? We miss out on countless battles described in the books that show how Ender continuously outsmarts his contemporaries and superiors. He's boosted from one position from the next for seemingly showing a slight amount of ingenuity in battle. Again, it's kind of hard to tell. I really wasn't sure what was supposed to be going on in the first battle, all I know is that it made his commander look bad for some reason. Ender should have friends that he gains during this time, people who look up to him and who he might hurt mistakenly. We get introduced to them vaguely. Honestly, I really don't car about anyone in this movie at this point. He has some kind of almost romantic thing happening with Petra, but again, I don't care about either of these characters. I've been given no real reason to. They haven't been developed, Ender only vaguely so, but I don't care about this dude or anyone he meets. Whatever, then he gets to command his own group, then suddenly Ender gets in a fight and injures another kid and he's like ""no I don't want to do this"", but then they let his sister visit him and she's like ""Ender you totally have to do this"", and Ender is like ""Okay, I guess I go back in do it because you're my sister and we're supposed to be close and stuff"". Seriously, that's what I got from it. Ender is then whisked off to a space station on an asteroid for his final Commander training. We meet the guy who defeated the bad guys they last time the attacked. Wait, this dude is still alive? If he's so great then why isn't he commanding the armies to take down the baddies? I don't know, it's never explained. Then all of Ender's old ""friends"" show up to be his special command team. I have to emphasize again, I don't care about these kids. They showed up to help and I'm like, whatever. You could have disappeared for the rest of the movie and I wouldn't have realized it BECAUSE NONE OF YOU WERE EVER Developed AS CHARACTERS. Ahem, excuse me I got a little out of control. Ender fights his final simulations in order to graduate command school and then win and stuff, yay whatever. And then they're like, ""No Ender, that was real, you killed the bad guys"" and Ender is like ""What, I wiped out a species I'm so sad"". Why do we care? All we've really been shown is that these dudes attacked us first so we just got them before they could get us again. But Ender is sad saying we might have been able to communicate with them. I haven't been given any reason to empathize with any human characters so far, so you can bet that I have absolutely no empathy for the aliens at this point. Who cares? Seriously? Yes, this is a synopsis coupled with a review, but this film took no time to develop any of its characters it jumped into what was supposed to be excitement, but what was really just confusing battle (I guess?) sequences. I know these characters from the book, they have personalities, they're interesting. I have no idea who any of them are in the movie. I don't even care about Ender, I don't know why I should care about his sister short of the fact that she's his sister. There is an entire side story between Ender's brother and sister that are ignored in the film. The plot is muddled, action scenes are confusing, and the characters are completely forgettable. Let me remind you, I didn't even like the book. So shame on you film executives.",Ender's Game
606,Chico_Maivia,Disappointing.,6,24 November 2013,"Political b.s. aside, I went and saw the flick. Having read the book in middle school, there was no way I wasn't going to see it just because Card has his own ideas about how things should work. In a karmic twist of fate, the movie ended up sucking, quite a bit. The film assumes the audience has read the book, so be prepared for that.First of all, the movie felt way too short, almost like a super extended preview for a much longer movie. In an effort to get as much of the story on screen as possible, the bulk of what made the book entertaining was left out, or at the very least, not fully realized. Relationships, character beats, even entire plot threads suffered or were omitted entirely. When a moment that was touching and heartfelt in the novel comes off as completely forced, rushed, and unbelievable in the film to the point that it takes you out of the novel--namely, the ""salaam"" moment between Ender and Alai--you know something is really wrong.Also the acting at times was...not the best. The opening scene with Ender, Val, and Peter was PAINFUL. Not to mention it was Peter's only scene. Also because the filmmakers were nebulous about age, it's difficult to get a sense of who Ender is, emotionally, at any given time. The whole Humans VS Buggers thing with Peter plays very awkwardly, seeing as it seems like Peter (and Ender, and even Val) are too old for this kind of malarkey. This nebulousness carries into Ender's love life(!) as he and Petra are apparently in the midst of a budding romance.Possibly the most shocking turn was Bonzo Madrid's casting. This is less a knock on the actor and more a knock on the casting director. In the novel, Bonzo's an older boy, taller, stronger, and a real threat to Ender's life. In the movie, he's a short, hawk-nosed pit bull of a kid. He's a full foot shorter than Ender, which really takes the menace out of their exchanges. Definitely a disappointing choice.The battle room scenes were actually pretty cool, but again, too short, and too few in number. Also the depictions of the battles at Command School are serviceable. The famed Fantasy Game appears as well, if in slightly altered form, story wise. Very cool inclusion though.All told, I'd say the movie should have been at least thirty to forty minutes longer, and there should have been an attempt to age Ender a little bit. Maybe have Asa show up in the second half, with a slightly younger boy in Ender's shoes in the beginning. This film basically is the broad strokes of the book, thrown together hastily, and ultimately not as entertaining or exciting as the novel proper. Disappointment all around.",Ender's Game

608,thebadassunicorn,"Average, Enjoyable Film with a Brilliant Young Lead",8,25 April 2015,"Ender's game is an imperfect film but has some moments of brilliance. Among its flaws I would count its writing. The film moved to fast, rushing through each of the stages of Ender's journey particularly past his emotional change after the severe injury of Bonzo. With a running time of under two hours I feel this film could have been improved by adding length. Another issue I have with the film is some of the supporting characters, such as Valentine, were not very strong.One Aspect of the film I thought was incredible was the acting of Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin. His performance showed an emotional maturity well beyond his years. In particular, the scene at the end when Ender discovers he killed an entire species, Asa was able to communicate the journey from joy to confusion to realisation to anger and pain without opening his mouth. Incredible. He will have a bright future in this industry.All in all I found this film enjoyable to watch. Although it is not a work of art and could have greatly been improved, I have watched it a number of times and would watch again.",Ender's Game
609,munkies44,Disappointment,4,26 May 2014,"If you read the book first and loved it, you may not like this movie. While the story line is followed for the most part, the movie just isn't as convincing as your own imagination. Basically, I really loved the book but I couldn't get more than half way through the movie. I almost think they should have changed the story and used characters that were a bit older, maybe than it would be a bit more believable. I wonder if they will make any of the other books in the quartet into movies? Anyway, I guess the writer of the book thought the movie was pretty good and similar to what he envisioned in his head but this movie is for kids IMO. Although I am an adult and was when I first read Ender's Game the book I could relate to Ender but not by watching this film.Just my two cents - Joseph Trevor Munro from MN",Ender's Game
610,cnahill123,"This is what I believe was wrong about the ""Ender's Game"" movie, in relation to the book.",6,29 May 2014,"The movie ""Ender's Game"" is a good movie if you have not read the book, but if you have, you are likely to be unsatisfied. It lacks sufficient detail and there are many parts that are made-up. A major difference is that the Buggers are referred to as Formics. In the beginning of the movie, his launch group includes Bean, who, in fact, does not appear until Ender receives his own army (Dragon). Also, when Ender is transferred, Alai says an entire sentence aloud and then gives the full meaning, instead of whispering ""Salaam."" as though it is forbidden, and kissing Ender's cheek. Dink Meeker, originally in Rat Army, is in Salamander in the movie. As a matter of fact, Rat Army is not included at all! In Salamander's first battle, Ender launches a surprise attack, instead of staying by the gate. The mind game was also a disappointment. In the book, Ender pays the game over and over again. However, in the movie, he plays twice and then kills the giant. He then goes into a world that is not Fairyland as it is in the book. In this land he comes across Valentine and they go into a ruined castle. In the castle there is a snake, which he strangles, and then, in a mirror, he sees Peter, his vicious older brother. Soon after, Ender receives his own army, including Dink. They win every battle and they all graduate. Ender goes to Command School where he meets Mazer Rackham, an older hero with a terrifying array of facial tattoos that the book failed to mention. In the Command School, he plays a simulator. Once he is adept, he receives a group of soldiers, who are old friends, to command on the simulator. All of his soldiers (plus him) are in the same room, and the simulator is not filled with multicolored dots, but instead shows the enemy and Ender's ships in full color detail and is controlled with Ender's hands, not a joystick. During his last battle, he clears away all of the Formics, but then realizes that there are many many more, and decides to take out the entire planet, instead of just taking out the planet as he does in the book. Suddenly, Ender realizes that the Formics were trying to talk to him using the mind game, and he goes out and finds a castle similar to the one in the game. In the castle is a little cocoon, but when he touches said cocoon, a Formic is heard. It then appears from behind some rubble, touching Ender's neck with a sharp pincer/claw before allowing him to pick up the cocoon. Throughout the movie, Ender sends his sister letters, and the movie ends with a letter to her, saying that, instead of the two of them traveling the world, that Ender would be away for a long time, trying to find a home for the queen. After watching ""Ender's Game"", I was not satisfied, because although it was a good movie, it simply was not the book which I love.",Ender's Game
611,natekiehnau,Excellent movie.,10,12 June 2014,"While this movie was a little slow to start with, it allows you to really get to know and love the characters. You don't need to have read the book to enjoy the movie, it can stand on it'a own quite well. While there were some things that were different than the books, it was over all a very well made movie and a good portrayal. I highly suggest it if you are in the mood for a movie that will appeal to your intelligence and leave you thinking. Though it also has some fine action and memorable lines. Also I would add that the actors chosen for the roles did an excellent job. There was not one poor performance in the movie. When you see Ender Wiggin in the movie, you don't feel like your watching an actor pretend to be Ender, you see Ender!",Ender's Game
612,gchang4,"Felt half hearted, to a viewer who never read the books",5,15 June 2014,"I actually wanted to see this movie in part because I've never read Ender's Game and was told by multiple people who know I like science fiction that it is sort of a must, to feel out the books a little before hand. So, going in I understood that the movie was probably in all likelihood not going to have the depth or breadth a book could have.However, even know this, the movie fell a little flat. The pacing seemed clipped at some parts, and there is no explanation given at all why his brother and family act the way they do. There is obviously a lot of psychological/philosophical stuff that is going on in Ender's head, as well as in Graff's head and the other characters, but since this is a movie we get to see none of that so all their actions felt precursory.The filming style and the ""deep serious we-are-running-out-of-time"" music throughout the entire film just made it feel like one long, 2 hour trailer than a movie with a beginning, middle, and end. The ending felt super rushed, and the ""reveal"" of what the final game is felt predictable.I guess you could say the entire film felt a bit predictable, like some sort of Hunger Games YA story in space- which I know that the books are very much NOT young adult books. And part of that predictability to me comes from not knowing any of the motivations for the characters beyond one-liners as explanations.Not to say that it was a bad movie- just mediocre. As a sci-fi movie, there are a lot better ones, and as an action movie there are also a lot better ones.I think the movie-makers/script writer floundered here. Even as someone who never read the book, I could see that they were trying to fit/adapt something that was more cerebral into a faster-paced dystopian sci-fi action movie, and it failed, especially towards the end. I could see glimpses of where they tried to bring on bigger moral issues into the movie, but given the short amount of time and how much ""action"" they were trying to cram into it they could not afford to linger too long on those issues and so as a whole the movie came off as ""not quite"".Vaguely entertaining, but forgettable. Not bad, but I came in with higher expectations of it being a good science fiction film, and it was only so-so.",Ender's Game
613,f_all_spammers,Depends on the viewer,1,9 November 2013,"If you haven't read the book they did an excellent job with the special effects and graphics. Things very much reflect the current American viewpoint on military behavior and the representative mix of races and gender at the battle school. If you like the book, the mutation of fundamental points of the story makes this movie a complete waste of time. It has been warped into basically an action movie with only a shell of meaning. After loving the book for so many years I found myself repeatedly saying outloud, ""WTF!"".!Spoilers! I have no idea why they moved the entire formic invasion into the atmosphere instead of leaving it spread throughout the solar system. I have no idea why Dap got changed into a drill sergeant instead of being a substitute mother figure. I have no idea why they wussied out on Bonzo's death scene. I have no idea why Bernard lost his french accent and his broken arm and became a supporter of Ender. I have no idea why they allowed Ender to contact Valentine while in school. I have no idea why they erased the colonization movement after the war and had Ender find the cocoon in walking distance of the military base. I have no idea why a key part of general training in the book, the mind game, became something specifically authorized for Ender instead of everyone. I don't know why in the giant's drink game they made all the drinks look the same instead of having the variety described in the book. At least they didn't have Ender getting romantic.",Ender's Game

615,Iasus-Ancient,Road Filled With Dread,2,8 December 2014,"This review contains spoilers.The glorious novels meet their ultimate doom in the insight of the film makers of the movie: Ender's Game. As nails screeching on a chalkboard, you will be overall annoyed with how this film toys with what the novels tell, though taints the final image of the fantasy adventure.Many critical scenes were not accounted for, and some were done plain wrong. e/ Graff shows up at Wiggin's house to take Valentine to see Ender at the lake. He should have been at her school, waiting outsideOther horrible mistakes include the Battle School layout, dialog, character traits, character ages and characters.Bean, the child who annoyed me greatly, is introduced wrong. He was not on the first launch to Battle School, but, years later. He meets Ender, finally, when joining Dragon Army.Benard is the bully-turned-friend-turned-bully. He is not amongst Ender's closest pals (on how they constructed Ender's jeesh for Command School) and should have never been at Command School with Ender. Battle School was an utter disaster. Army rooms were far too small. They didn't even attempt to give it the long, narrow and stretching upwards look the novels described. The school also had plenty of battle rooms, not just one gigantic one (although, seeing it in action of army against army did feel like the novels, except the ""stars"" were not cubes).There was no occupying ""Commander's Mess"" in the Mess Hall, which seemed really absurd.Eros, or which is known as, ""Command School"" was bad, as well. The quarters were too small, Ender had space to do exercises in them. Where the virtual ship game training holo's were, was very inaccurate. For one, Ender was isolated from his jeesh in Command School. All of his jeesh had separate rooms for their holo's.I may also point out, that, if Ender were as smart as they said he was, he'd turn around when they played the final battle and see Mazer Rackham starring down upon him and then trying to say he beat him. Hah.The film was a let down to hard core fans of the Ender Series. You can tell, obviously, that the film makers sandwiched the movie together to fit it all in, and to leave numerous scenes out, and all the accurateness.There is too much to rant about what the film makers messed up on and cut out. One major piece of evidence is the age of the actors. The other, is having to hear some kid going through puberty through the whole movie. Seriously, he sounds like he is doing animal calls when he yells. Through all this rant, and the movie, I only personally liked one thing about the film: The picture of it.Iasus",Ender's Game

Alas, no real disappointment apart from a little underdevelopment of the characters but hey it's Hollywood. Really loved the roles of Ender and Bean although there could have been a little more of the Battleroom, or at least a windy five minute fly-through of Dragon army's rise to the top. Still it's not as bad as After Earth where I was cheering for the Ursa to kill that little idiot.

A wonderful film and one I have now watched more than two hundred times (I have long-since memorised every speech by every actor}.Although not nearly as faithful to the book as is claimed (the entire spirit of Ender Wiggin is somehow missing from the movie - partly because they excised many battles for financial reasons - and these contained the essence of Ender's character} the film is well able to stand alone on its cinematographic credits.If you care about the spirit and the real content of the book - i.e. its real message - you will have to read it. Great as the movie is, it manages to entirely miss the point of the book it claims to portray.I found the first half (battle-room sequences) which were brilliant, much superior to the last half (the space ships were more reminiscent of ""Transformers"" than anything else).

620,hdill-76355,Enders Game is an Okay Movie,9,11 March 2016,"I thought Ender's game was a really good movie. Out of ten stars I would give it nine stars because the movie had action-packed battle scenes, the camera work was creative, the special effects were realistic, and the props were futuristic.The only thing I wish the movie had more of were battle scenes like the book. In the book there were several battle scenes, but in the the movie there were only four. No one can say a space battle isn't amazing. The scenes were especially awesome because of all the fighters and the way the ships moved. In the book there were more battles even if the battles weren't against Bonzo, Bonzo is the bully at battle school. Overall, the movie was pretty amazing for an hour and fifty three minutes. I know it's kind of a serious movie, but they did include one joke. Bean says ""your mother cheated that's why you look like a plumber,."" Even if there were more jokes and I didn't catch them that's the only funny one. I think it could've used more humor to make it a little less serious after tense parts. I enjoy movies where there's lots of action, but still have comedy.When I watched the behind the scene video about how they made the movie, I thought it was interesting how they only used the faces in the battle scenes. and how the bodies were edited out and replaced with CGI bodies. In movies, you can normally tell if something has special effects, but in this movie the battle scenes were realistic. I really couldn't tell the bodies were special effects. I also thought it was interesting how sometimes people dressed in green suits would even guide them across the set. My favorite special effects were when it showed battle school from the outside. I thought that was AWESOME!!!I overall thought the movie was enjoyable. The book was better though because there were more details and battles. The movie even left out a character, Shen! Apart from some of those wishes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. They left out a lot of important parts from the book; for example the part where dink tells him the propaganda videos are edited and only show victories and how they're fake, is in the book but not in the movie. The acting was pretty good except for the part at the end where Ender is laying in bed and then he yells ""VALENTINE!!!"" During that part I was like ""ppppppffffffffffffT! that was stupid.""

It's based in the future and has different rules for the people, like how they can only have 2 kids. This book is about a very young boy, who has a brother named Peter, and a sister named Valentine. Since he is the third child, which is illegal, the government practically owns him.This book also includes bugs and wars. The huge bugs attack the world; and so the government has a battle school and it teaches young children how to fight in a battle. If you're into that, you will love this book.Although I think this book would be good for young teens it is very graphic and uses profanity. If this book was a movie, which it is, I would rate this book as PG-13. I believe the book was a lot better than the movie; almost every book now-a-days are better than the movie.

All the scenes were in the future and I felt like that was good because of all the technology It was very creative to think of putting the movie in the future but the question is why? I think that is because the director wanted it in the future because in nearly every alien or space movie it's set in the future. How the battle scenes were set out. The set was amazing it would've taken a lot of mathematical brains to figure out every part that needs math. It's really cool how they made it look like they were actually in space.Special effects were astonishing. I don't know how they made a man in green push them around and make it look like they're flying but that was really good. The aliens looked so realistic and I thought that was outstanding. All the stuff they used like the guns and cars were cool because it made you think if that's what the cars and guns would look like in the future. I really like how they made the alien's face with the special effects. It was awesome. The way they made the battle room was creative. The roles of the characters were alright. I don't think Abigail Breslin played a good role for Valentine. It was just boring every time she was in it. Harrison Ford played a good role because he was good at playing the head of the battle school. Asa Butterfield played a good role because he acted like a leader. Hailee Steinfeld acted well as Petra because she really acted like a good friend and a leader. I thought the main character (Ender) played a good role because he acted like a leader and really took pride in what he does. I don't think anyone else should of played his role because I think he's really a good actor in ender's game. It was strange how the fifteen-year-old children including Ender are that intelligent that they are smarter than Colonel Graff. Out of ten stars I would rate the movie 8.5 because of all the boring scenes. The second reason is they only showed two battles in the whole time when he was in battle school, not including the battles with the aliens. In the movie they left out some characters like Shen and more I don't know why? They left out some parts in the book meaning some chapters and I think that's a bit silly.
