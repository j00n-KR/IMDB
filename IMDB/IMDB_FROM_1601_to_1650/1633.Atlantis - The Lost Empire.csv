0,MartinHafer,A most un-Disney sort of cartoon.,5,6 August 2020,"When ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" begins, you can tell is certainly is NOT going to be a traditional full-length picture from DIsney. Much of the opening animation was done with computers...much more than you'd have seen in 1990s Disney films. At the time, it must have wowed audiences, but since it was 19 years ago, it looks unbelievably dated now...perhaps even bad. What follows is again, most unlike most previous Disney films. There is no Disney princess and the story is much more geared towards teens and adults and gone are the usual songs. Clearly Disney was trying to make a more mature sort of animated film. But this film and their subsequent ""Treasure Planet"" did not do very well as the box office...an Disney returned to more traditional style movies.The story is about an expedition to find the lost city of Atlantis. A linguist named Milo is obsessed with finding this lost city...and most people just think he's a nut. But a rich plutocrat inexplicably bankrolls just such an expedition...but my guy reaction was 'this is too good to be true...I suspect something is amiss'. Well, there is...and you should see the movie to learn what it is.So why was I rather cold about this film? Well, it wasn't the style, more significant use of CGI or the more adult plot that left me cold...it was the characters. While the film is clearly going for a most mature look and style, several of the characters are NOT mature nor even well thought out at all. Mole and Cookie, for examples, are just terrible...completely unrealistic and dare I say it...annoying! Yes, annoying. The plot, also, is a bit obvious. With a minor re-write, the picture would have worked much better for me. I think the adultness of the film isn't the problem...just the writing.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
1,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly good!,8,20 July 2009,"Although I have said that Tarzan is the last great Disney movie, there have been some surprisingly good films like Lilo and Stitch and Fantasia 2000, though the best of the post-Tarzan Disney movies is Emperor's New Groove. On the other hand, some of the direct to video sequels are saved by some excellent voice overs and moments of cuteness, but overall they are cheap parodies of their originals, Patch's London Adventure sadly being the worst. Atlantis: The Lost Empire belongs to the surprisingly good side of the film spectrum, with excellent visuals, particularly of Atlantis itself. The music was beautiful and sounded epic, and the voice cast was great, the standouts being Michael J.Fox and James Garner as Milo and Rourke respectively. John Mahoney and Cree Summer offer fine support as Whitmore and Kida, who is so sexy. I only have two criticisms of this movie. One is that while the idea of the story is fantastic, it is a little too fast for my liking. My second criticism is that while the script is very good on the most part, I don't think it is as funny as a film like Emperor's New Groove, though Vinny was hilarious, so I just worry that younger viewers mightn't find it as engaging as their parents. Overall, very pleasing to the eye, and a very good film overall. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
2,SnoopyStyle,like the visual but not much else,5,29 June 2015,"In 1914 Washington, Milo James Thatch works without notice in the boiler room of a museum. He has a theory that Atlantis had an advanced power source and lies in the ocean off of Iceland. Nobody believes him and they refuse to fund his expedition. He's approached by Helga Sinclair and brought to wealthy Preston Whitmore who was a friend of Milo's grandfather. Whitmore gives him the mysterious Shepherd's Journal from his grandfather and finances an expedition. There's a large ship, an impressive submarine and an expert crew.The animation work is pretty good with good CGI for its era. It's got some action that also works well as CGI. The visual style looks good. The story and the characters are another matter. I'm not thrilled with Milo but the other characters are worst. Milo needs a comedic sidekick. I didn't like or trust the other character. It turns out that it's for a very good reason. There just isn't any thought to make a fun group to root for. As for the story, there isn't much other than the fun fight against a giant lobster. I don't know how the Atlantean suddenly learn to speak English and yet they couldn't figure out how to fly the fishplanes in all those years. The whole thing feels like it needs a few more rewrites.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
3,kosmasp,Nicely done,6,16 September 2010,"It's a Disney movie, pre-Pixar cooperation, so you get more or less the usual fare. It's not as intelligent or clever as any Pixar movie (bar Cars), but it does do the trick. Quite strange characters are on hand here and the story is quite nice too.I watched this as a Sneak Preview, expecting ""Final Fantasy"" to be playing. Since I'm not that aware of the whole FF Universe, it might have been better, that they did play this instead. Of course the Atlantis myth is also a big one, but not having a clue (or not much of one) about the history of that, will not be a problem for you to watch this one. Family entertainment light then.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
4,gavin6942,A Bit of Dud,5,4 December 2017,"A young adventurer named Milo Thatch (Michael J. Fox) joins an intrepid group of explorers to find the mysterious lost continent of Atlantis.The film has the makings of a cult classic. Joss Whedon was the first writer to be involved with the film but soon left to work on other Disney projects. According to him, he ""had not a shred"" in the movie, which is a shame. The artistic style comes from the same hand as the creator of ""Hellboy"", which probably attracted a certain audience. And the protagonist is a descendant of the the legendary Blackbeard, which opened up some interesting world-building possibilities.But the story is not as good as it could be, and the idea of different languages is cool but simplistic. The idea that a language an be translated letter by letter in nonsense, on top of the fact that ""Iceland"" and ""Ireland"" would both be in English... that is a bit silly.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
5,jboothmillard,Atlantis: The Lost Empire,4,20 June 2005,"When I heard about this film from my brother, he told me Atlantis: The Lost Empire was pretty good. He is kind of right, it is an interesting idea for a film. Milos James Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox) is chosen for a special secret mission to try and find the lost empire city of Atlantis. I can't remember much of the team joining him, but I do remember the rather amusing antics of the character called 'The Mole'. A rather weird story in places, they do find the missing empire city and see many strange things. For example, for some reason the princess of the city keeps going to a lake and floats in the air being surrounded by blue light, why? Okay!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
6,Quinoa1984,One of the better animated films ever made,7,15 June 2001,"Atlantis is an experiment for Disney, but it is one of they're most successful ones.  By excluding often dumb songs (though some of them in the past weren't horrible like in The Lion King and the Jungle Book) and even dumber animal sidekicks, Disney for one of they're few times taken an interesting type of story and given it good dialogue that will appeal to adults more than kids.  And while I know kids are the prime target here, I reccomend the animation for them, which takes it's cues this time heavily from the pulp comic book tradition (which is a good thing) and the anime style of quickness and seriousness in characters (which is even better).Michael J. Fox stars (in possibly his last role due to his claim that he will not act due to Perkinsens) as a ""jibberish"" decipherer who can decipher most lost languages, and believes in the fantasy of Atlantis, and soon a billionaire gives him a chance, and a crew, to find Atlantis.  What follows is a energetic and flowing adventure of the journey, discovery, and fight of Antlantis, filled with spectacular animation (the crystal rise up scene and finale Atlantis scene are awesome animation feats) and characters that older kids and adults can like as much as, or even more than kids.  And once again for you parents reading this, if your worries your kids won't like this, just remember what chum is coming up in a few weeks: Cats and Dogs.  See this movie is only to avoid that.  Varney's last voice-over and movie role (unless Daddy and Them gets released).  A",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
7,studioAT,Average Disney film,3,31 March 2017,"After the Disney Renaissance came this film, that tried to use the legend of Atlantis as a springboard for a good animated film.And while it has it's moments, I don't think it ranks in anywhere near the same league as classics like 'Snow White' or even 'Beauty and the Beast'.The voice cast all do good jobs, and there are some nice action sequences, but this is Disney painting by numbers, and trying desperately to get a hit. And it doesn't quite pan out the way they'd have liked it to.A solid, yet unspectacular film.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
8,CinemaSerf,Journey to the Centre of Atlantis...,6,10 November 2021,"We start off watching the destruction of the legendary city before advancing several thousand years to meet ""Milo"" - a rather geeky young man whose grandfather had been obsessed with the mystery surrounding the lost continent. Gazillionaire ""Preston Whitmore"" recruits him on a perilous expedition to try and find the truth - so equipped with a submarine and a crew you just know have another agenda, off they go. The first forty minutes of this over-long adventure is much more reminiscent of something from Jules Verne, only spent on elongated character establishment scenarios, some borderline slapstick humour and by the time the film gets anywhere near it's sharp end, I could already feel a sense of ennui setting in. Michael J. Fox does inject some character as the young lad, and James Garner has his tongue firmly in his cheek as the completely untrustworthy ""Rourke"", but that can't really inject enough to create any sense of pace into this competently, but unremarkably, animated feature. The style of the artistry, though colourful, is clearly computer generated. The animations lack depth or texture and coupled with a really average storyline leaves this in a sort of Disney limbo. It is certainly not as bad as some that were produced ten years earlier, but it is still factory-style output that lacks for imagination and any of the traditional uniqueness that this studio used to deliver. It is watchable enough, but pretty forgettable.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
9,dbborroughs,Grand adventure,9,21 October 2009,"Grand action adventure from Disney concerns the search for the lost continent of Atlantis. Atypical from most animated films from the Mouse House made around the time in that there is nary a song anywhere to be found. Instead its simply great adventure as Milo (voiced by Michael J Fox)leads a team in a submarine into the depths and into the center of the earth. Its a rip roaring film thats high on adventure. I think this is one of the best films that Disney put out, but I'm skewed toward the non musicals with the much maligned Rescuers Down Under being another one of my favorites. Think of it as a film in the grand tradition of Gunga Din or Journey to the Center of the Earth or even King Solomons Mines. Its a boys own adventure (though girls will like it) and a great deal of fun for those looking for adventure and not too much goofy kids stuff.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
10,view_and_review,Atlantis Disney Style,7,24 December 2020,"Atlantis has been depicted and kicked about in many movies. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is one of them.Milo Thatch (Michael J. Fox) is convinced of the existence of the lost city of Atlantis. He has dedicated his life to proving its existence and perhaps getting a hold of their permanent and perpetual power source. He doesn't have malicious intentions, he just believes it could help mankind immensely.He finally got the funding and the team he needed to find Atlantis. The team had their own motives. Once they found it some of the team members cared little about the plight of Atlantis because all they could see were dollar signs.Full disclosure: I did fall asleep on part of the movie. It's good and all, but it was nothing mind-blowing. It was a Disney movie following the Disney formula.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
11,anaconda-40658,The Lost Screenplay.,2,24 June 2015,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001): Dir: Kirk Wise, Gary Trousdale / Voices: Michael J. Fox, James Garner, Leonard Nimoy, Cree Summer, Jim Varney: Dazzling animation set in Washington D.C. 1914. Young professor Milo Thatch discovers his grandfather's journal and wishes to prove that Atlantis exists. Boarding a submarine with a crew that seems to have walked off the set of Saturday Night Live they encounter gigantic creatures and the tribe of the lost empire. They carry healing devices around their necks because Tylenol wasn't available. Unsatisfactory ending with hero's detachment from civilization. Contrived plot directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale who previously collaborated on the much better The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Michael J. Fox voices Thatch as a straight ripoff of Indiana Jones who feels the need to stray from logic. James Garner is typecast voicing the villain who has all the personality of a paper bag. Leonard Nimoy plays that ever familiar senile tribe leader who goes from cold to warm to complete moron. Cree Summer voices daddy's little Princess who holds the key to the future of Atlantis, which lay in ruin, much like the film. This is also one of the last films to feature the talents of Ernest comic Jim Varney. The only thing she holds the key too is Thatch's late night sexual fantasies. Pointless idiocy render the empire totally lost. Score: 2 / 10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
12,StevePulaski,The Disney film that could've,8,19 March 2012,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire could very well be Disney's most ambitious animated feature to date. It features intense, merciless scenes of battle and peril, depicted in some of the most stunning and fresh animation of the 2000's decade. The bravery and the thought process behind the film was nonetheless detailed, involved, and intricate, yet its payoff was pretty sour.We'll discuss that later. The film centers around Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox), a brainy cartographer and linguist who works for the Smithsonian Institution studying the language and the environment that existed in the lost continent of Atlantis. He believes he possesses directions to the underwater world of Atlantis, in a book called ""The Shepherd's Journal."" After getting shut down by the museum board to pursue the costly adventure, Milo conveniently meets Preston B. Whitmore (Mahoney), a millionaire who offers to send Milo and an already organized crew down to the depths of the oceans to search for Atlantis, all expenses paid.Milo accepts and goes on to meet his band of misfits. They are gentle giant Dr. Sweet (Morris), explosives expert Vinny (Novello), teenage mechanic Audrey (Obradors), crabby Mrs. Packard (Stanley), chef Cookie (the late Jim Varney), and quirky Mole (Burton), whom are all lead by Commander Rourke (Garner). Together, they plumb the depths to search for the continent of Atlantis, and get more than they bargained for along the way.The film's animation is lively, bright, and visually intelligent. It almost looks like scattered scenes from a comic book, that have come to life. The film was released in 2001, and unfortunately, found itself caught in the awkward time where animation was beginning to change drastically. Just one month before the release of Atlantis, came Shrek, a runaway hit shooting Dreamworks' popularity up to the stars. Not to mention, just a few years before that, we had A Bug's Life, Toy Story, and its sequel - all CGI animated features. Hand drawn animation was quickly decimating, and kids and parents blamelessly began looking elsewhere. That elsewhere was the brighter, more sophisticated color scheme of CGI; a method that would eventually transform animation forever.Atlantis: The Lost Empire was victim of poor timing and unfair judgement, when in reality, it's a breathtaking adventure. It's not perfect, but it's a great leap from traditional Disney clichés such as soft music, cheery characters, and sing-a-longs. That might also be the reason why many parents were turned off as well. The film is very swashbuckling and adventurous. Some of the scenes of peril are frightening, intense, and very, very serious. The PG-rating is the not the thing you're used to seeing on a Disney film, and because of that, this found itself a bit blacklisted.Because of all the uncertainty of where a project like this go, Atlantis's gross was a modest one, especially for animated films, and failed to drum up a significant amount of revenue. Because of this failure, a sequel, titled ""Shards of Chaos,"" a spin off series titled ""Team Atlantis,"" and a water-ride at Disneyland were all canceled. Disney was clearly anticipating a breakthrough success, but sadly, it all vanished before their eyes, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire would bring one word to people's minds; underwhelming.Despite a few things lacking, like credible character development of Milo's crew, Atlantis is a wonderful adventure. It almost reminds me of a more attractive, animated Pirates of the Caribbean before the films even came out. The risk of releasing the film was high, but Disney took the chance, and as a result, created an attractive animated film with style, wit, and action galore. How many failed risks can one say that about? Voiced by: Michael J. Fox, Jim Varney, Cree Summer, Claudia Christian, James Garner, Corey Burton, John Mahoney, Phil Morris, Leonard Nimoy, Don Novello, Jacqueline Obradors, and Florence Stanley.

14,OllieSuave-007,Plot lost in Atlantis.,5,30 July 2015,"Disney's 41st full-length animated feature film is a story about a young adventurer named Milo Thatch, who joins a group of explorers to find the lost continent of Atlantis.This movie brings back Beauty and the Beast directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, who gave us quite an adventurous movie full of sci-fi action and drama. Being a film set in 1914, the character dialog didn't sound too slapstick or modern, which fits the story better. The animation wasn't as colorful or vibrant as in earlier animated pieces in the Disney canon, but it is serviceable. The visual effects, particularly for the action and magic scenes, were done well and mesmerizing.However, there was very little storyline to the movie due to its predictable moments, lack of interesting characters and character development and limited intrigue. Nothing really sticks out or captures my attention and there is room for plot holes to fill, as much of the magic roots of Atlantis (like the electrical flying cars and how the Atlantis people survived for so long) were never really explained.Overall, the Atlantis concept of the story is interesting, but the it's not one of the better Disney movies out there.Grade C-",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Somewhere beyond the sea.,7,14 April 2021,"Although it has an odd, inconsistent pacing and some of its plotting is frustratingly unclear (or, perhaps, underexplored), 'Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)' is a typically entertaining and engaging 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1980)'-esque adventure. It has a bit more of an edge to it than Disney's usual fare, with a surprisingly high body count which includes the deaths of several major characters. It also has a somewhat strange aesthetic, more akin to a Saturday morning toon than a full-blown studio feature. Neither of those things is necessarily bad, though. The piece is often exciting and its animation is as well-achieved as you'd expect. Though some of its characters are straight-up bizarre and don't quite fit within its established world, most of the major players are brought to life with strong voicework (including an excellent lead performance by Michael J. Fox) and assured animation. Plus, the picture peppers in just enough subtle character work to keep you invested in its events. Though it isn't perfect, the movie is a enjoyable pretty much throughout its runtime. 7/10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
16,g-bodyl,A Treasure-Filled Adventure!,9,28 September 2008,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the fabled Atlantis. Along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice cast is great. They surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. The music is nothing special but likable anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

18,Bored_Dragon,Very good,7,15 November 2017,"I love to put my movie marathon on pause from time to time and watch some Disney cartoon for a change. It's healthy for a soul. From this one I did not expect anything at all and I was in for a pleasant surprise. Young and silly scientist gathers expedition to find Atlantis, but his crew are not who he thought they are. After about 20 minutes I lost any feeling that I am watching cartoon and I experienced this same as feature movie. It would be great if they would really make one. It hold attention and does not irritate you with too much niceness and morality, so it is not annoying to non-kids audience. It's not on the level with greatest Disney masterpieces but it definitely is worth watching. I really enjoyed it.7,5/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
19,briancham1994,Incredible,8,24 August 2020,"I loved this film as a child. It had all the cool elements that I felt were lacking in other animated films - more intense action, science fiction worldbuilding and incredible production design. The Atlantean civilisation is amazing from its architecture to its machines to its language. It feels both futuristic and ancient at the same time, and it feels like a living society. This is brought to life by incredible visual effects like the Leviathan, the submarine battle and the crystals. The overall quest is also very exciting with a grandiose, epic feeling, and the characters are all memorable.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
20,Thanos_Alfie,Very good...,7,14 October 2021,"""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is an Adventure - Animation movie in which we watch a young man joining a group of explorers to find the lost continent of Atlantis. He as a linguist can help the team by translating the ancient documents and find out where to search for Atlantis.I enjoyed this animation movie because it had a nice subject with an interesting plot that combined very well mystery with adventure. The direction which was made by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise was very good and they presented very well the story behind the lost continent of Atlantis along with the scientific community and its perspective about it. The voice of Michael J. Fox as Milo was an excellent choice and fitted very well. In addition to this, both the voices of Cree Summer as Princess Kida and James Garner as Rourke fitted their characters. To sum up, I have to say that ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is a nice animation movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because it will travel you somewhere different and I am sure you will enjoy it, too.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
21,leplatypus,Already awful thus what if Mignola didn't get involved? (screen),1,4 June 2011,"Disney chooses to make an adventure animation and picks the Atlantis Myth. The studio decides to hire Mignola as consultant and inspiration. Mignola delivers some great visuals. So far, everything is perfect.Unfortunately, when the time arrives to write a story, things get complicated: if you watch the movie, going to Atlantis is as easy as taking a bus: maybe dangerous but always in straight line! Then, the explanation behind the power of Atlantis is stupid: crystals, sleeping giants... But the worst is to come! To live the adventure, a team must be put together but for Disney, the characterization means psychos: Mole, Dynamite man, Cookie, bragging doctor, Smoking grandma???? Nobody could them that they weren't the right stuff but the wrong stuff. In addition, they try to be funny but they failed. Well, the only good moments here are the scenes with Milo and Kida and the Mignola's touch but that's all. And to conclude this requiem, Disney is always happy to sell ""Disney DVD"" with ""pure digital magic"" but take a look at the bonus material and you'll understand it's only advertising: long, dull, boring, complicated. Maybe ¾ hours of talking to never understand still how an animation is made!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
22,southdavid,Better down where it's wetter ?,5,15 March 2021,"This was another Disney Plus film that I came to on my alphabetical trawl. Despite being a relatively high-profile release (compared to some of the straight to dvd / made for TV content stuff of D.P.) I've never seen ""Atlantis. The Lost Empire"" before and personally, I don't think I was missing much.Milo Thatch (Michael J Fox) is desperate to continue his grandfathers research into the whereabouts of the lost city of Atlantis. Shunned by the conventional science community, Milo is asked to meet Preston Whitmore (John Mahoney) and old friend of his grandfather who agrees to fund an expedition and who provides a fully crewed submarine. When they finally discover the hidden community, they find an active but fading empire, whose power source, a massive crystal, could be harnessed for use by the planet.I'm afraid, I do rather think of this period of Disney as being a bit of lull time for me. I was 21 when this came out, and along with ""Lilo and Stich"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Treasure Planet"" (and a few others) represents a time when I felt I was too old to see them. So, this is one of the films that I don't come to with any nostalgic love for a childhood favourite. As I result, though I do think I liked some aspects of it, there were many others I didn't.I liked the humour in the script, for example, a few little ad libs and throwaway lines were quite funny, but I didn't enjoy the story. It feels rather thrown together, there are seven credited writers (including Joss Whedon, but not including Plato) and I wonder how many rewrites, edits and cuts took away from central ideas. There might have been more of a ""20,000 Leagues"" aspect to some versions, with more taking place on board the submarine, but as it is, that is introduced only to be destroyed about 10 minutes later. That gets us to Atlantis quicker, but probably guts a lot of character moments that might have made the stories well telegraphed betrayal a bit more resonant.I really like Mike Mingola, and have read quite a bit of ""Hellboy"" but I feel like his character art here jars with both the previous and subsequent Disney styles. That's only really prevalent in the actual humans though, with some really really impressive scenery and vehicle work.In some ways it's technically impressive, but as a film it's a dull and pedestrian affair.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
23,Vartiainen,"Convoluted and littered with unneeded characters, but otherwise a decent pulp adventure",6,29 December 2015,"This film credits eight people for its screenplay and story, one of them Joss Whedon. And yeah, it shows. In the worst way possible.So what's the story? Milo Thatch is a linguist and cartographer, living in 1914, who believes he has cracked the case of Atlantis, believing the answers to its disappearance and lost location lie in an ancient Icelandic book written by a man who has lived on the island. After the university rejects his proposal for being ill-though and far too unlikely to produce results - not undeservedly so, I must admit - he is approached by a mysterious benefactor, who was a friend of his grandfather, the first Thatch to seek the lost Atlantis. All the classical elements for a great pulp adventure are here and this opening act is easily the strongest segment in the film story-wise. The characters are instantly identifiable, have great designs, the dialogues are interesting and funny, and as a whole the film evokes the feel of the era and style beautifully.The animation also has a style of its own and it is a gorgeous movie in every visual way possible. Especially the scenes in Atlantis are simply majestic, with amazing colours, designs and depth of field.But alas, the bad stuff. First of all, there are too many characters, which is the fault where I can see Whedon's influence the most. This is a cast for a TV series about the finding of Atlantis, not a cast for a movie only hour and a half long. They're all introduced properly and given good, funny characters, but then the film has to drop them to move the plot along. The expedition crew alone has nine members, including Milo. The movie needs Milo plus a crew of three plus the people in Atlantis. Milo plus a crew of two, if you want to be skimpy, but three wouldn't have felt crowded at all.The plot itself also has some minor problems, most notably a few gaping plot holes that could have been fixed without the story being in any way different. Usually I don't mind all that much, but the script draws attention to them and tries to handwave them away through some linguistic mumbo jumbo that's in no way believable. These holes don't ruin the film but they, combined with the general feel of rush caused by the cast overpopulation, make the film feel like it would have been significantly better with one more re-write or perhaps with a slightly longer running time.All in all the film is definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Disney or pulp adventures. It has a distinct style, fun characters, phenomenal visuals and a story which, while flawed, still delivers good entertainment.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
24,lisafordeay,Not a bad Disney movie from the Disney canon.,6,3 January 2015,"I haven't seen this movie in over 14 years,so I got it on DVD during the Christmas season. The film is about a professor named Milo Thatch(voiced by Micheal J Fox from Stuart Little) who is out on a mission with a group of highly trained people to search for Atlantis as Milo's dad passed away and wasn't able to finish the search for Atlantis. We of course are introduced to a commander named Rockie(voiced by the late James Garner from The Notebook who I thought was Tommy Lee Jones first going off)and later we meet Kida(voiced by Cree Summer).When Milo and the gang finally find Atlantis they discover that the people who live there wear necklaces as this is some sort of youth thing as Kida is over 200 years old and she has magical powers(like Elsa from Frozen and Rapunzel from Tangled who were the next heroines to have superhuman powers like Kida)and Rockie(ends up being the bad guy or the villain I should say) as he wants to destroy Atlantis and kidnap Kida.So what did I think of the movie.....well it was a better than average cartoon and the animation was great and the pacing was great.The story however you can't really explain it right as its a sort of movie you have to watch numerous times before getting the hang of it.The voice acting was great even though the only two I knew was James Garner and Micheal J Fox.The rest I had NO idea what other films they were in.Overall if you liked Treasure Planet which would be the next film after Lilo & Stitch as Atlantis was Disney's 40th then check it out. Parts of it reminded me of James Cameron's Avatar for some strange reason as the commander was a bit like the villain in Avatar.Overall check it out.6.2/10C+",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
25,FiendishDramaturgy,Magical journey to our most famous lost city.,9,28 October 2003,"It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard Disney musical fare. While the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous. I had hoped for a bit more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be. The animation quality is average, but the dialog is quite compelling, as is the story line, plot, sub-plot, and amazing creativity I found within this production. I will refrain from outlining the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy.This is, in my opinion, THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Length Film.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
26,thinker1691,"""We witness the Mother of all Races, to once again see it disappear """,7,11 May 2012,"Facinated with the ancient story of Atlantis, we have here yet another attempt to resurrect it from a watery grave to entertain modern audiences. The film is entitled "" Atlantis: The lost Empire "" and once again it's left up to the animators of Walt Disney studios to offer us this charming rendition. James Garner's recognizable voice plays Commander Lyle Rourke an opportunistic, adventurer who leads a team to the wondrous and fabulous city of Atlantis. Michael J. Fox is the voice of Milo Thatch, who's grandfather left him a book detailing the route to reach the mythical city. John Mahoney, Phil Morris, David Ogden Stiers, Don Novello, Jim Varney and Leonard Nimoy head an all star cast to the water kingdom. It's a magical place with colorful sceneries and highlighted with flying vehicles, all of which are designed to bring to life the city beneath the sea. The film has garnered much praise and countless awards in it's quest to become what for Disney is yet another Classic movie. Cree Summer adds a royal flair as Princess 'Kida', while Claudia Christian, Jacqueline Obradors and Florence Stanley complete the wonderful assemblage. The entire movie is another triumph for directer Gary Trousdale and writer Kirk Wise. Easily recommended. ****",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
27,dee.reid,"A peculiar, oft-overlooked gem from Disney",10,14 August 2012,"""Atlantis: The Lost Empire,"" released during the summer in 2001, will most likely be looked upon by future generations of audiences as a peculiar, if not totally over-looked gem. I first saw this delightful, Jules Verne-inspired little animated film from the co-directing team of Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (with producer Don Hahn) - who were behind Disney's animated renaissance favorite ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) - when it came to DVD in early 2002.Having watched the film today for the first time in ages, I was again awe-struck by the lush beauty of its visuals (which seemed to have mimicked the style of Japanese Anime' and American ""Hellboy"" comic book artist Mike Mignola), its highly evocative musical score (by James Newton Howard), and its beautiful aquatic imagery; I have a thing for water, the ocean and aquatic imagery/visuals, so ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" was right up my alley. I was also disappointed at the time to find out that this movie was not a success (at least not as big as Disney had originally hoped), but regardless of its box office performance, this is a movie to be cherished.There is some historical significance with this picture 11 years down the road. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" has the benefit of being one of the last animated Disney films (one of the last animated films period) to be almost entirely hand-drawn - that is people actually sitting down at a desk and drawing things down on paper, by hand! Yes, there is some heavy use of CGI mixed with the hand-drawn images, but for the most part it's easy to tell where human hands left off, and a computer stepped in to do the rest.The other added benefit is that the CGI is hardly noticeable here (at least to the untrained eyes of certain audience members); but I will admit that 11 years later down the road and with so many significant advances in CGI animation (in addition to having seen, and loved, ""Avatar"" in 2009), it would be interesting to see how this movie and its underwater imagery would have looked had it been done completely in CGI, so I'm not going to lambaste CGI animated films completely.And yet there is a human story, with real flesh & blood animated characters; such characters, their stories, and their motivations usually get lost in a production such as this, even an animated one. As you might expect, the story concerns the search for the lost continent of Atlantis of ancient folklore/legends (particularly those as described by Plato and the famed clairvoyant Edgar Cayce), which was befallen by a great cataclysmic event that caused it to disappear beneath the surface of the ocean centuries ago. Opening in 1914, Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox, one of my all-time favorite and inspirational actors) is a young linguist/cartographer trying to get funding for an expedition to find the Lost Continent.Shunned by his colleagues but spurned on by the cherished memories of his late adventurer-grandfather, the enthusiastic young explorer finds unexpected financial backing from the mysterious rich benefactor Preston J. Whitmore (John Mahoney) who puts him on an expedition to find Atlantis. The operation is led by Commander Rourke (James Garner) and his second-in-command Helga Sinclair (Claudia Christian), and others include ex-Army physician Dr. Joshua Sweet (Phil Morris), French geologist Gaetan ""The Mole"" Moliere (Corey Burton), Italian demolitions expert Vinny Santorini (Don Novello), feisty teenage Latina mechanic Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors), chain-smoking radio operator Mrs. Packard (Florence Stanley), and chef ""Cookie"" (the late Jim Varney).They eventually find the underwater kingdom, only to discover that there is an entire civilization of people thriving there, led by King Nedakh (Leonard Nimoy) and his beautiful daughter Kida (Cree Summers). The Atlantean people are highly advanced technologically, and have their own thriving native language (developed for the film by linguist Mark Okrand) and thoroughly self-contained mythology.Thinking about the film, I remember that much of the story and imagery in ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" still remains remarkably fresh in my mind; I find that to be one of the strongest hallmarks of any animated feature. That Disney was able to make me care so much about the characters and story says as much about its overall entertainment value. Additionally, the all-star cast of first-rate voice actors make the proceedings even more enjoyable; I'm also glad that there were no songs here, either, and that it was a straight-forward science fiction/adventure movie, and a rather thrilling and intelligent one, at that.I find ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" to be a beautifully animated Disney feature, oft-over-looked but hopefully never forgotten by the masses of animation fans out there. It was one of the last animated films to have been almost completely hand-drawn, during a time when animated movies were making a huge transition to being almost completely computer-generated.Just get ready to dive in to one of the greatest animated adventures of all time!10/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
28,drqshadow-reviews,"A Lovely Adventure Film, Lacking Spirit",5,22 June 2021,"An international submarine expedition uncovers the world's most famous lost civilization, the technologically-advanced society of Atlantis, still kicking after a millennium in isolation. Although we follow the perspective of an eager young scholar, enlisted as a lingual interpreter, the men actually in charge of this voyage don't have the most altruistic of motives. Go figure, right?Arriving immediately after the creative pinnacle of Disney's 1990s resurgence, Atlantis has something of a bad reputation. It's not Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast, and for that it's judged rather harshly. Not that such critiques are unfair: though it's well-stocked with colorful characters and a gorgeously intricate, stylized art direction (Hellboy creator Mike Mignola's influence is readily evident here), the plot is too thin and those worldly supporting characters don't distinguish themselves beyond a simple, superficial level. I found Michael J. Fox distracting in the lead role, too. Some voice actors have the ability to tailor their performance to fit a character, but in this case it seems to go the other way around. Jim Varney, he of Ernest fame, fares better in a throwaway secondary role. In his case, sadly, the film was a posthumous release.In a strictly visual sense, Atlantis is delightful. The distinct shapes and colors, fluid motion and eclectic, versatile cast are a nice treat for the eyes, even if the occasional blend of CG and hand-drawn animation doesn't always come off without a hitch. From a storytelling perspective, though, it falls short. I kept waiting to be wowed, to find reasons to care, but it never happened. Little more than a thin, inoffensive Jules Verne imitation with a sparkling coat of paint.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
29,GiraffeDoor,Criminally forgotten.,8,13 May 2021,"I think of this as the spiritual successor to ""Treasure Planet"". Overall I consider this one a bit better, I thought the other one dragged a bit in its third act but still good.Like the first one: if you think you don't like disney movies or family movies in general then I really feel this is one of the ones that truly deserve a chance from you. This movie conveys a seriousness and maturity you don't really expect from the ""family movie"" industry and I am totally willing to acknowledge that ""Inside Out"" as the masterpiece of nuance storytelling it really is so don't think I'm one of these people who don't appreciate this kind of movie generally.This adventure into the unknown is captivating from the very beginning with the world building and aesthetic design immersive and exotic. I really felt like I was discovering a culture previously unknown to science that still felt like it could be real.Every character could have their own show. There's just so much personality in this story of a adventure and subterfuge. The sexy girl quota is reached and the protagonist is adorable. We need more heroes like him.It looks amazing, the score is superb and they even sort of try to find a way around the language barrier.Don't think it's portentous or austere; they have a great sense of humor to match the grandness of the story they want to tell.I will definitely watch this again. I can't guarantee that myself as a child would have really appreciated it but who cares. Just enjoy it on your own when your kids are asleep.Oh, and Helga is just...we need more of whatever she is.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
30,CubsandCulture,Hollow but beautifully animated,6,14 December 2020,"I wished the filmmakers spent more time developing a story as they did on the animation. The design of Atlantis and their culture is among the most beautifully realized designs in the Disney canon. Likewise the animation is a technically polished and striking.Unfortunately, at the heart of the story is a MacGuffin that is at once a mere plot device but also suppose to inspire awe and spiritual sentiment. That a central character losses their agency to this MacGuffin (how? why?) makes it the worse. The entire 3rd act is built upon false tension.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
31,r96sk,My favourite part of it is the animation,8,14 July 2020,"Excellent.I had previously heard a fair bit of hype down the years regarding 'Atlantis: The Lost Empire' and now, finally, I can understand why. It is very good. My favourite part of it is the animation which is exquisite, especially across acts one and two with the great amount of detail. The characters are cool, while the premise is pretty fascinating.Michael J. Fox is a superb cast as Milo, he is fantastic in the lead role. Honestly, none of the other voices stand out to me but that's not always a bad thing - especially in this film. There are no huge individual performances, away from Fox, but they all bounce off each other nicely.The plot is very interesting, brought to life brilliantly by James Newton Howard's terrific score. It's not near the top of my Disney animated favourites, just through process of elimination really, but it certainly isn't majorly far off. It's a fun experience, one I'd recommend you see for yourself if you haven't done so already.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
32,MissSimonetta,Screw it-- I like this movie,8,14 March 2014,"I loved this movie as a child. It was the first movie I ever saw in a theater and the VHS copy we owned was well-loved. Then I became an film geek and in that community, this film is often derided, seen as an embarrassing misfire aimed at teen boys, the last demographic that would want to bother with Disney films. So for years, I too dogged the movie.Then I revisited it and now I've gone back to loving it. Yes, it has plot holes. Boo hoo-- Milo is still a great lead, the cast is a lot of fun, and the animation is breathtaking. While not every design choice works (Helga's square look doesn't real sell her as the seductive femme fatale she's supposed to be), most of them are very original and interesting to look at. And the score is to die for, so epic and packed with adventure.Can we go back to THIS Disney? The one that took chances instead of buying up every IP in sight?",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
33,dwpollar,This action-filled adventure is unique for Disney...,6,24 December 2004,"1st watched 12/24/2004 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise): This action-filled adventure is unique for Disney in that they didn't try to cuten themselves out of the story by giving us lovable little creatures to giggle at. I think this is a maturity-level that their animation and storytelling has gone to that might not help them in the pocket-book, but definitely broadens their artistic appeal and shows it's audiences the ability to stretch themselves. This story is about a looked down upon historian who is given a chance to find the lost continent of Atlantis for the sake of the discovery. We find out later that this is not the intention of everyone on the crew which eventually brings about much of the action in the final 3rd of the movie. The crew consists of funny and unique characters that are a ragtag bunch each with their unique abilities to lend to the expedition. Some dazzling animation effects are a plus as well for this much more male-focused entry for Disney. The uniqueness in the story should keep this a classic and should proudly be put on the shelf alongside others like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the ""Lion King"" despite it's definite differences and because of them, showing the consistency for them(Disney animated films) to be inconsistent.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
34,davispittman,"Not Disney's best, but still entertaining and fun",8,5 December 2017,"This movie truthfully isn't Disney's best work, there's definitely been better by them, but this film is still fun and entertaining. Everyone has heard of Atlantis, and the myth/legend of the lost empire. This movie is set in 1914, the beginning takes place in Washington DC, where the main character Milo is trying to plead his case to his superiors to let him continue with his Atlantis research, and to let him go on an expedition. They laugh in his face and refuse. He is discouraged and almost ready to give up hope when he is visited by a mysterious woman who offers him a chance to go in search of Atlantis with a crew. This crew is experienced and very diverse. As far as the crew goes, I liked the different characters, some of them are humorous and some are mysterious/sketchy. The film does a great job with Milo and with the villainous characters as well. I also thought the animation was done in a very skilled fashion, and the effects are done well, visually appealing. The story has a likable way about it, the chemistry between the two main characters is nice to watch and the scenes once they get to Atlantis are very captivating and have a ""magical"" kind of feel to them. I think everyone can find something to enjoy in this film. 8/10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

36,invisibleunicornninja,Boring.,4,8 April 2018,"One time I was on a bus. That bus was with a summer camp and we were going to an aquarium. The distance from where the camp was located (it was at some college) to the aquarium was several hours long. This is one of the movies that played on the little TVs on the bus. Hanging out at the aquarium was more entertaining than the experience of watching this movie. This is a really boring movie with some decent animation. The characters are all idiots, and the plot is really dumb. I would not recommend this movie, but there are a few semi interesting moments (because of the art and devices not the story).",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
37,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Action Packed Disney Flick,10,9 December 2011,"From the early 90s to the beginning of the 21rst century, Disney has made some pretty spectacular animated films. Many of them have been some strong box office hits. Well here's another film that'll blow your socks off. Atlantis the Lost Empire is visually a sight to behold. Why? Mostly because of its action sequences. There are so many different action sequences that'll keep the viewer staring at the screen because everything is done differently from Disney's previous films.Note: for any Disney fan, this movie contains a good amount of action/violence. If you check out the MPAA rating, you will see why. It is actually pretty violent for a Disney movie. That's just an FYI for any viewer. Going back to what I was saying though, the action scenes are quite interesting because some scenes look like they're close to 3D. Of course they don't look 3D to the point of coming out of the screen but the way the pictures flow is so smooth and well developed that it looks 3D.The story revolves around a wimp named Milo Thatch, played by Michael J. Fox looks to find the lost city of Atlantis. Fox was the perfect pick for Milo Thatch because his voice does not sound that authoritative. It is not until Preston Whitmore voiced by John Mahoney, tells him how he lost a bet to Thatch's grandfather where he must fund the exploration of Atlantis.From here this sets up an introduction to a whole list of voice actors that do a magnificent job in making their characters come to life. To name a couple; James Garner, Leonard Nemoy, Don Novello and Claudia Christian all play characters that resemble them in some way. This is another strong feature to this movie. The voice characterizations are done perfectly. I have to say that my favorite character from this movie was Vincenzo Santorini (Don Novello). Novello uses his voice from ""Father Guido Sarducci"" to make this character work, and I will say that he is what makes up most of the comedic parts in this movie. For example: Milo Thatch is showing some civilians how to start a carp shaped vehicle of some sort. Novello's character then asks, ""Hey Milo, you got something sporty? You know, like a tuna"". I couldn't stop laughing after that moment for about 5 minutes.Although it is one of Disney's more violent renditions, it pleases with eye opening visuals and fantastic voice-overs. With this at hand, Disney has yet again created another fun piece of film work.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
38,Rob_Taylor,More deaths than a Rambo movie.....,6,25 September 2005,"Gone are the days of completely harmless animations such as Bambi or Snow White. Today's Disney churns out movies like this (which I admit I found enjoyable enough) but which, in my humble opinion, are a far cry from the kid-friendly, don't-need-to-vet-it, it's-a-Disney, movies of yesteryear.It was my partner who pointed out that there were rather a lot of people dying in this film for a Disney. I hadn't noticed up to then, being absorbed by trying to decide if the animation was actually very good, or very bad. But she was right. People die all over the place here. Not just casual, in-the-distance deaths either. People get drowned, are trapped and die in water-tight compartments, are even set on fire, for goodness sake! It's like the entire Disney team were hyped up on a caffeine overdose when they made this.Whilst the movie is harmless enough entertainment for us adults, is this what we want our kids to watch? I can remember a similar incident with Disney's ""Dinosaur"" movie. All the mothers and toddlers trooping in to watch it, then a number coming out horrified after ten minutes once the meteor scene arrives, kids crying at all the little monkeys getting killed.What this all says about what we let our kids watch these days is, I'm sure, a debate that will continue indefinitely. I think its OK for kids to be scared by movies. But I think the way we accomplish that needs to be given some attention. But enough sermonizing..As for the film. The story is simple, along with the animation, for the most part. It's not a movie you'll watch again anytime soon, but it is quite entertaining for a one-off view. I was particularly pleased with the voice cast. It's nice to see old faves like James Garner getting to do their thing again, and Claudia Christian shows she can do this sort of thing quite well.As I say, not one to be watched again and again.

41,vip_ebriega,"Different Disney fare, but a great adventure nonetheless.",7,12 May 2008,"My take: Old-fashioned thrills elevate this animated Disney adventure. In the fashion of old-fashioned adventures the likes of Indiana Jones, Disney's ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE is enjoyable, exciting and very well done. Although the film slows down momentarily during the second act, moments of high-flying adventure and jolly-good action sequences helm ATLANTIS to a great, ripping yarn, a true family entertainment that rewards kids and adults alike.In terms of characters though, ATLANTIS is a tad below the other wonders of Disney's earlier adventures. The lead character of Milo Tatch is appealing and comedic, and under the talented voicing of Michael J. Fox, the character is fun but not quite as memorable like Aladdin or Hercules, other Disney characters. Other supporting characters are well drawn, but not quite as well drawn as Disney's previous animated brainchildren.But its limits never diminishes ATLANTIS' overall impact. It's still a fun ride with beautifully drawn scenery that delights, enthralls and wonders. The sight of the large, technology-driven primeval world of Atlantis during the opening scenes (when it nears its imminent doom) and during the final climax (when the ultimate battle to sustain ensues) are wondrous as any of Disney's most exciting escapades. The machinery, including the giant submarines and digging machines are marvelous creations. The screenplay, on the other hand, is a terrific replenishing of old-fashioned adventures like Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", as well as Sir A. Conan Doyle's ""The Lost World"", complete with great moments of pure adventure (the battle with the monstrous leviathan earlier in the film being the best).Overall, pure action-packed escapism for the whole family.

43,Animany94,Interesting move from Disney.,8,26 August 2017,"I watched Atlantis a lot when I was a kid and liked back then. To this day I do not love it, but view it as a mostly successful step from Disney away from their usual song-driven fairy tales. When I say mostly, it is because of the Atlantian mythology and their language and gadgets created for the movie are inventive and well done while the supporting characters and their development through the movie is a little lacking. Milo is a likable main character and Kida is also memorable. It's just the crew members i am pointing out.Characters like Mole is really annoying and seems pointless, but that's the only really bad thing about Atlantis. The crew members feel rushed in when they meet Milo and are not overly memorable. The smoking lady and Vinny are exceptions. Despite the villain, Rourke, being one of Disney's weaker villains, I find his arguments with Milo and the battle between them in the climax of the movie good and well executed. And he has one of the craziest deaths in the Disney catalog. The action scenes are in general pretty awesome.Atlantis is overall recommendable, but it is not the typical Disney flick. Therefore I will call it a gamble if you like it or not. I like in spite of its weak spots.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

45,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An underrated adventure epic despite it's predictable story!,8,5 November 2012,"I think I remembered watching this in theaters when I was seven years old and I was usually blown away by it. A few years later, I watched this again and still loved it as ever. The premise really intrigued me. It was like ""Indiana Jones meets 20000 Leagues under the Sea"" and it works really well. There are two flaws that I really hate about this movie. First, there's the villain. James Garner voiced him really well, but Rourke is by far the worst Disney villain I have ever seen. He wants to find the Heart of Atlantis so he could use it to gain fame and fortune. Come on! It's the same villain Governor Ratcliffe from Pocahontas. The same thing happened to Clayton when he wants to find Gorillas in Tarzan and look how well that turned out. Second is the story. It has an original concept, but the story itself is too predictable for my tastes.Flaws aside, everything turned out great. Aside from the main villain, the main character Milo voiced by Michael J. Fox is likable as the brainiac nerd we've seen in most movies and his romance between him and Kida voiced by Cree Summer is romantic and enjoyable to watch. The side characters, although undeveloped, are good comic-relief pals that made me laugh right through the very end especially Mole who almost steals every scene. In fact, the voice acting for the characters is excellent. The action is pretty intense and enjoyable to watch especially the final battle which is my favorite part of the movie. The dialog is also smart and witty at the same time and the script is pretty clever. The music from James Newton Howard is beautiful and epic, but the strongest aspect goes to the animation. The visuals are lovely to look at it gives the movie an epic sweep to it and the character animation is nice to look at.Overall, Atlantis: The Lost Empire may not be a masterpiece, but I don't understand the hate it had when it was first released because this is a completely underrated film that should be watched over & over again. Go watch it to those who have not seen it! It's that good!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

""Atlantis: The Lost Empire,"" Disney's dazzling animation spectacular directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, leaves the expected musical numbers behind to develop concepts and action. It works, and there is certainly nothing wrong with the film's style, but I long for the next Disney classic. The studio has not released a true animation masterpiece in years. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is worth a watch, but it doesn't qualify as a contender for the Disney's next classic. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" doesn't contain a lot of interesting characters. The film doesn't clearly develop the protagonist, named Milo Thatch (voice of Michael J. Fox), a timid cartographer in 1914. He wants his museum boss to give him money for an exploration where he hopes to find an ancient relic that will provide the information he needs to find the lost island of Atlantis. Milo is a surprisingly bland character. Usually, Disney prospers with strong protagonists, but Milo is week, timid, and bland.
Everyone thinks Milo is crazy, as he babbles about lost empires and ancient cities; it doesn't help that people also accused his late grandfather of insanity. However, a rich old man named Preston B. Whitmore (voice of John Mahoney), who knew Milo's grandfather, has the artifact that Milo so desperately needs. Preston B. Whitmore funds Milo's exploration; he provides a huge submarine led by Commander Lyle T. Rourke (voice of James Garner). The rest of his crew consists of Vinny Santorini (voice of Don Novello); the young mechanic, Audrey (voice of Jacqueline Obradors); ship doctor Joshua Sweet (voice of Phil Morris); the cook, ""Cookie"" (voice of the late Jim Varney); the old grumpy switchboard operator, Wilhelmina (voice of Florence Stanley); and ""Mole"" (voice of Corey Burton). The ship travels to the bottom of the sea, searching the power source of Atlantis. A gigantic monster protecting Atlantis kills much of the crew and damages their ship, but the main characters manage to escape with their lives and some equipment. Finally reaching the Kingdom of Atlantis, they meet a beautiful young princess named Kida (voice of Cree Summer), whose aging father controls the troubled city. However, Milo's fascination with Atlantis has been a distraction from a greater motive that has corrupted the other's minds. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" does not capture the heartwarming atmosphere that many other Disney movies did, like ""Aladdin,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""The Fox and the Hound."" This film is adventurous, but lacks actual suspense and tension. An adventure requires motive and reason, and an increasing danger or rising of the stakes. This creates the suspense and tension that keeps us involved. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" only briefly sketches its characters and quickly establishes the situation. The filmmaking works under the circumstances, but it certainly does not prosper overwhelmingly. The movie does not prepare for a particularly involving finale; the villains don't even come into play until the final act; the audience's involvement is tentative until the last thirty minutes.
Most people will enjoy ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire,"" especially children looking for something more mature than Rugrats and less intense than ""Final Fantasy."" With its interesting plot and some exciting action sequences, parents may even find themselves enjoying this picture; I certainly had a good time.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
49,moviesleuth2,Good adventure yarn,7,4 July 2010,"I love movies like this. Movies that explore new places with new ideas, people, and images. The excitement of finding a long lost city is salivating to me, and ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" attempts, and adequately succeeds, to create this adventurous spirit.Milo Thatch (Michael J. Fox) is a wannabe adventurer who is stuck in a job fixing the boiler at a museum. He thinks he knows how to find the lost city of Atlantis, but is scoffed at by the museum curators. Then he is contacted by Preston Whitmore (John Mahoney) who offers him to lead a fully funded expedition to find the lost city.The voice talents are solid. I don't think there was any other choice for the role of Milo than Michael J. Fox. Fox's breaking voice and his ability to portray geeky eagerness and absolute shock are perfect for the character. James Garner is also effective as Rourke, the head muscle of the expedition. Rourke is a genial guy, but his motives may not be what they appear to be. Special mention has to go to Claudia Christian, who is excellent as the dangerously beautiful Helga, Rourke's right hand.This film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and produced by Don Hahn. These three were behind the production of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. Although this is a good film and I definitely recommend it, it's something of a let down. The problem isn't the story or the characters, it's the animation. It's so crude that it's almost an insult to call it a Disney movie. For Saturday morning cartoons, it would be acceptable. But for a full-length theatrically released movie, it's shocking. Audiences who paid good money to see this in the theater and who are expecting something along the lines of ""The Lion King,"" or even ""Hercules,"" deserve better.Nevertheless, this is a fun movie for the whole family. Maybe not the little ones because there is some violence and action, but for those in grade school, it should be a great time.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
50,LebowskiT1000,One of Disney's best!,10,30 July 2002,"The animation alone in this film is well worth watching!  This film doesn't really seem like a Disney film though, but I sure did like it.  The story is really interesting, with few things to complain about.  The story, of course, is nothing terribly complicated, but still rather good.There are a number of recognizable voices in the film too.  Michael J. Fox, James Garner, John Mahoney and Jim Varney in one of his final performances.Overall, I thought it was a very good Disney movie.  It wasn't nearly as cute and cuddly as certain other Disney movies, which in this case is a good thing.  I thought the movie was great, and I hope that you enjoy it as well. Thanks for reading,-Chris",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
51,EmperorNortonII,Disney Grows Up,8,11 July 2001,"""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" has been widely discussed as a departure for Disney animation.  You can tell this is so, since this is not a G-rated musical.  I found the animation very well done.  There was some Atlantean lore that was thought-provoking.  But there is quite a bit to be taken with a grain of salt.  For one thing, most of the story takes place in 1914, but Cmdr. Rourke's crew looks more multicultural than can be believed.  Anyway, the story mostly takes a back seat to the artwork, which is a common pitfall for animated features.  I call it eye candy.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
52,raypdaley182,very good,8,3 March 2007,"Micheal J Fox was excellent in this. Admittedly he was the only voice I actually recognised, But I really enjoyed this film. I thought the Commander was Tommy Lee Jones (as it sounded so much like him).All the characters were excellent, i'd like to have had a bit more plot but the animation was excellent and generally was very enjoyable.The film seemed to run out of ideas a bit and I get the feeling they based Fox's character on Daniel Jackson from Stargate ( A misfit good at ancient languages).All the nice shiny crystals that make them live for thousands of years are clever and Leonard Nimoy was unrecognisable as the chief of the Atlanteans.highly enjoyable.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
53,SquigglyCrunch,"A Well-Paced, Enjoyable Disney Movie that's Darker than the Rest",6,29 February 2016,"I loved this movie as a kid, and I remembered almost none of it. Watching it again I realize that it was a pretty good movie still. It follows a man who believes that Atlantis exists and goes searching for it. The plot of Atlantis: The Lost Empire is interesting. It doesn't waste any time getting right into the adventure, which wasn't surprising. It wasn't really a good thing either though. Other than that, the movie is well-paced and entertaining throughout. The history of Atlantis is one that I haven't seen before though, and it's quite interesting. Other than that it's not horribly original, but like I said, it's still enjoyable for sure. The characters aren't anything special. We get some brief back stories that don't really do much for the characters, but some of them work well enough. Still, they're rushed. Again, it's not like I'm surprised or anything, but it just limits the amount of people who will be able to fully enjoy this movie. The visuals are very good. The art style is very cool, and the character designs are great too. It doesn't stick right out in your face, but it's there, and I loved it. Overall Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a solid adventure movie. While it's ideas aren't particularly unique, it's well-paced and presented well enough. The characters and beginning are rushed, but the visuals are great and it's just all around a really enjoyable movie. In the end I would recommend this movie.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
54,elicopperman,Ambitious albeit Flawed Adventure,7,21 July 2021,"20 years ago, Walt Disney Animation Studios released an interesting feature during a time when they were straying away from their usual musical fantasy formula. The film was Atlantis: the Lost Empire, an original project conceived by producer Don Hahn, screenwriter Tab Murphy and directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. While the feature was hyped upon its original release, it was met with mixed reactions and underperformed financially, not helped by the main factor of it losing over Shrek. However, it has remained one of the company's biggest cult hits amongst an underground fanbase. But just how deserving is its cult status?Set in 1914, 8,000 years after the ancient city of Atlantis sank below the sea, the film tells the story of young linguist Milo Thatch. Upon gaining possession of a sacred book which he believes will guide him to the lost city of Atlantis, he pairs up with a crew of mercenaries in search of the civilization. From the setup, the feature definitely feels like it will offer a lot of thrills along its way, and to the filmmaker's credit, the proper motivations are all set up, and not just from Milo. The actual mercenaries he tags along with consist of a war hero like commander, a sardonic demolitions expert, a rapid fire medic with a big heart, a neurotic mole like geologist, a tough teenaged mechanic, an elderly cynical radio operator and plenty more. In addition to a very solid voice cast such as Michael J. Fox, James Garner, Don Novello, Phil Morris and many more, the main lead and side characters truly make the first half of the movie a spine tingling adventure. While the entire movie isn't all spent on the journey, unlike the original script, the character driven aesthetic shows a lot of promise for more to come.However, the one fatal flaw that really holds the movie back is regarding its underdeveloped plot elements. A lot of thought and care was put into developing the world of Atlantis itself, down to famed linguist Marc Okrand creating a unique Atlantean language, but the movie itself ends up putting more emphasis on worldbuilding rather than much logic as to how the city survived for so long. Even with the vague preservation of ancient crystals, the film doesn't spend enough time establishing the world's essence to make for a concise second half. According to the film's story supervisor, John Sanford, the filmmakers chose to lead the function of Atlantis through more ambiguously to the point where even he believed they went too far. And all because George Lucas wanted to explain how the force worked in the Star Wars prequels too. It doesn't help that once the main antagonist is revealed, the movie ends up becoming too derivative of Dances with Wolves, if only not as preachy. In the end, we have a lost civilization that ends up creating more questions than answers once discovered.To give more credit where credit is due, the cinematography and shot composition are truly breathtaking. As much of the film takes its time getting to Atlantis and then showing off the civilization itself, much of the pacing ends up feeling like a suspenseful journey through a newly discovered land that no one had ever ventured before. In addition, the art direction ranges from cold and grimey caves to a luscious albeit washed out city of blues and terrain, allowing for a very solid contrast between the lost world and what lies before said world, along with some wonderful cel shaded CG props as a bonus. As for the character designs and animation, given that Hellboy creator Mike Mignola was one of the film's production designers, the cast end up looking like a blend between Mignola's rough sketchy outlines and caricatured Disnefied design work. Thanks to the work from veterans such as John Pomeroy, Michael Surrey, Randy Haycock, Ron Husband, Dave Pruiksma, Shawn Keller and many more, the animators' finest work ended up keeping the film's weaker second half from getting too stale.So while it does have all of the right pieces to make a wonderful action packed adventure, Atlantis doesn't quite hit the mark to truly stand out besides being the more action-packed Disney flick from a different time. That being said, the fact that the filmmakers were even allowed to go this far to try something different in the company is worth admiring, perhaps partially why its cult status is still going strong after 20 years. Of course it did get a failed TV spinoff that turned into a worthless sequel, but aside from that, it's great to see how a film that fell below the radar has now gotten the attention it almost never had before.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
55,DavidSim240183,Another sadly underrated animated feature,9,18 April 2007,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is an animated film that has much to recommend it but failed to set the box-office on fire upon its release. Made only six years ago, it came at a time when Disney's animated branch was really in a slump. Although I'm not really a Disney acolyte, they do on occasion turn out decent pictures. Atlantis was sadly one of their last really good ones before Disney's hand drawn animated division shut down production.Much more serious in tone than Disney's last outing, the delightful Emperor's New Groove, Atlantis is a film that takes a leaf from classic matinée serials and sweeping Indiana Jones adventures. A team of scholars, mercenaries and soldiers set off in a grand submarine to locate the lost city of Atlantis, and when they discover it, it all results in a clash between exploration and capitalism among the crew.Atlantis may not be quite in the classic bracket, but its definitely got much going for it. One thing I found refreshing about it is compared to most Disney films of late, there are no buffoonish comic sidekicks, no songs and no glib contemporary film references. Its all played with a considerable degree of seriousness, making it an animated feature that even adults can enjoy. I can safely say I never felt patronised by the material.One thing Atlantis has in its favour is the really wonderful cast of characters that Disney have managed to create. There may be a few too many, and it could have done with dispensing with one or two, but this is a crew that's motley in every sense of the word.Michael J Fox is likable enough as the nerdy Milo Thatch, providing a suitably exasperated voice to their dilemma. But its really the supporting characters that give Atlantis its life. James Garner is perfectly crusty as the treacherous Commander Roarke. Leonard Nimoy brings dignity to the King of Atlantis. Jacqueline Obradors is a wonderfully feisty engineer (a female engineer in a Disney film, gasp!!). And Florence Stanley is downright hilarious as the ship's dryly cynical radio operator.One thing that took me by surprise when I read the end credits was that part of the screenplay was written by Buffy creator Joss Whedon. Crafting the crew must have been his input, because there are striking similarities between Atlantis and Whedon's much underrated SF show Firefly. Two eclectic crews who swing between ambiguous extremes of profit and nobility. Look at the crew of Atlantis, and you see the crew of Firefly in an earlier form.Another great character is Princess Kida, the King's daughter. She is one of the sexiest characters to ever crop up in a Disney film. We even see her strip down to her bikini! Not only is she a great sex symbol, she's a great leader too. Its a shame she gets sidelined towards the end, although the scenes of her transformed into a being of pure light are very eerie, and recalls the style of many a Japanese anime cartoon.Some of the animation is a little bit on the blocky side and not quite up to the high standards of Disney's earlier efforts. But some of the backgrounds and underwater shots of Atlantis are exquisitely stylised and detailed. And I love the moment when Milo and Kida climb to the top of a pyramid, and the camera does a stunning 360 degree angle of the entire city of Atlantis.And as it gets to the end, we get to see some really exciting action sequences, aerial dogfights and monumental plot developments. There are times when Atlantis scales almost operatic heights. A truly thrilling climax! Its a pity Atlantis: The Lost Empire went unnoticed by the public because its far too worthwhile to be cast aside. With so many great voice actors and set-pieces, its a superb animated feature, and one of Disney's lost treasures.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
56,garrard,"Disney veers from the ""singing teapot"" mode",9,10 April 2006,"After having much financial success with animated musicals like ""The Little Mermaaid, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Pocahontas,"" and the mega-hit ""The Lion King,"" Disney charted untried waters (pun intended) with this underwater epic about the fabled continent. With an all-star talented cast, that included Michael J. Fox, Leonard Nimoy, James Garner, John Mahoney (""Martin Crane"" from ""Frasier""), the film is one of the best performed of many films in recent Disney history. Even with a heavy-hitting cast like the aforementioned, it is voice-over veteran Cree Summer that really steals the show as the Atlantean princess, Kida. Not only does the actress have to speak in English but also in Atlantean, a dialect that was obviously developed for this film.With a story that is heavy on fantasy and science fiction, the animators didn't spare any creative juices, with breathtaking landscapes, thrilling battle scenes, and truly awe-inspiring appearance of several stone giants.Also, an appearance early on of ""The Leviathan"" is not just impressive, but goose bump-inducing, too.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

58,La Gremlin,"Well, I liked it!",7,14 February 2002,"Here's what I knew about ""Atlantis"" before watching it:* - It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure.  I'm not sure how accurate that is (I like to nitpick) but it made me curious first time I heard it described.* - The preview looked, for the most part, damn cool.  Evidently, it was also ""too cryptic"" according to some critics after the fact.* - It apparently did SO badly that Disney said, ""Screw it, let's re-release 'Spy Kids'"".So, with all that said, how is the movie?Hella-cool.I'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but ""Atlantis"" goes all out.  It's a throwback to all the CGI eye-candy shots in ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", so much so that it's almost an effects animator's Best-Of Show.  The characters maybe aren't that memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot's a little dull, but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot.Here's a controversy that bothers me.  The ""failure"" (as in, it ""only"" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; I know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation.  I don't think that's true.  How do you account for the ""South Park"" movie?  What about ""Final Fantasy""?  Really, the story and the artistry is everything, not the method.  I don't know what Disney's comeback movie will be like, but I don't think they're out of the picture yet.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
59,Trevor-Kerensky,Head-first into adventure,8,18 December 2017,"There have been many animated Disney movies that have come and gone, and most of them had cutesy characters and memorable songs. Not here though. But that makes this a black sheep among the Disney lineup. Don't get me wrong; I did enjoy this movie and it took me a while to see it. But it turned out to be entertaining. Steampunk and action, as well as a plot that looked like it came out of Jules Verne or Indiana Jones. If you want a different kind of animated movie, great. If you still enjoyed those musicals with cutesy characters, no deal. But that depends on what you like. So try to go in with an open mind and you'll enjoy it.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
60,jakethesnake-42007,Underrated and ahead of its time,7,20 April 2021,Atlantis is probably one of Disney's biggest underrated films. The film bombed at the box office and original had ok reviews and now the film is one of Disney's biggest cult classics and one of its most underrated films. The film is not Disney's best but it's still a lot of fun and maybe ahead of its time. Maybe if the film was live action it would of started a franchise or maybe it would of still flopped I don't know but at times the film seems like it should of been live action. Cause the film is more mature and action it is ahead of its time if the film would of been related now it would of been a bigger hit. I remember when it was released the marketing was not done good also. The film is not Disney's best but it's a different Disney film abd that's what I like about it. It's fun and the characters are great. The main problem is it's trying not to be Disney and maybe to grown up for the younger audience. Overall it deserves way more credit then it deserves and I'm happy it's getting the credit now.,Atlantis - The Lost Empire
61,benoit-3,Why « Atlantis » deserved to sink,1,5 February 2002,"I paid $ 45 (Canadian) for this DVD and how I wish I had my money back! I can't even offer it as a hand-me-down to a deserving child as this film is a racist pamphlet that would probably get me in trouble with his or her well-meaning parents or the local schoolboard. There are so many wrong-headed aspects to this film, I don't know where to start. First of all, being myself, if not French, at least Québécois, French-speaking and Francophile, I found the character Molière, a geologist, a kind of absolute compendium of hate mongering, xenophobia and of the use of negative stereotypes to inflict humiliation on nations who do not happen to agree with US foreign policy at all times. The Nazis would have been really proud of this one. Molière (or `Mole', get it?, a pun that can only exist by mispronouncing `Molière', i.e. pronouncing it the ignorant American way  moh-lière - instead of the proper French way  mah-lière) was a French XVIIth century playwright whose name (an invented one, his real name being Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) has become synonymous with the French language. One says `the language of Molière' for French as one says `the language of Shakespeare' for English. So naming this virulent collection of vile racial stereotypes `Molière' is tantamount to insulting the entire French nation and its language. Molière is short, ugly, unkempt, unintelligible, lascivious, slobbering, voracious, hairy, selfish, boorish, stubborn, greedy, piggish and smelly. He has an aversion for soap. Molière became a geologist because he likes all things dirty, presumably (he is the only one who doesn't get to tell his story). Molière is a sub-human character, just the way Hitler pictured the Jews in pre-war propaganda films. His opinions are uninformed and inconsequential. He is an object of scorn, shame and ridicule and he is not to be trusted. I can't say I appreciated the bull-dykish, ex-school bully, street-smart, female Spanish-American mechanical engineer much either. What would have been really refreshing and original is to depict a female mechanic who does her job, against type, with a certain grace, charm and femininity. But then grace and originality are not on the agenda of this outing. As soon as the bookish hero joins this practical crew, all the characters who depend on him to make their fortune automatically resort to sarcasm, violence, bitching, dirty tricks, razzing, bullying and ostracism to keep him in his place. What is this? A co-ed episode of `Oz'?! Do they really hate him because he is intelligent and cultured? Am I reading this movie right? Are there really 86 minutes left of this tortured monograph of a turn-of-the-century criminal subculture?! Let's skip 70 of these minutes and get to the point: Besides all its other faults, this movie is the first Disney opus to have a really appalling body count: untold thousands die in the prologue, many hundreds die in the Leviathan incident and the rest of the movie is a general orgy of blood-and-guts violence. You will yourself call for a merciful end to all this long before the dénouement. The `heroine' was modeled after the type of bleached California beach volleyball slag that can so easily be mistaken for an overage hooker off the court. The `natives' are dumb, silent, lumbering, uninformed and inconsequential, basically cannon fodder for the visiting Americans. Maybe they're meant to represent an idyllic vision of the French at the beach, I'm not sure. The authors' intentions are as obscure as the story points in this one. One thing is for sure, this little effort won't play long at Euro Disney!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

64,fjhuerta-2,...wow.,4,9 July 2001,"Wow.That was the first word I uttered after coming out of the theatre. I was more than impressed. I was happy to see what the Disney film studio is turning into.They weren't getting anywhere with their musical stuff. Snow White *had* to be made that way, because vaudeville was all the rage back then. But that time is over. Disney was still dragging, including at least one musical number per film. Terrible. Just terrible.Then comes something like ""Emperor's New Groove"", a fantastically funny piece, unmarred by songs filled with false emotions. Back in my comments of that film, I stated I could only be grateful if Atlantis came out half as good as that film.Turns out I am more than happy now. ""Atlantis"" is not twice as good as ""Emperor's"". Atlantis *is* a certified, bona-fide, old time Disney classic.From the strength of its drawings, characters taken almost directly out from ""101 Dalmatians"" (the hero looks a lot like the hero on that movie, too!), to the incredible blend of CGs and hand images, Atlantis shines on the big screen with such an intensity you simply cannot stop watching it. SPOILERS AHEAD: The story is aimed at a semi-mature audiences. There are numerous deaths and scars throughout this film, plus assorted explosions of all kinds. And the best, and I mean this, the loudest laugh I had was when the mole used the cleanest, purest form of sexual innuendo on the heroine of the film (""Parlez vous francais? Oui? Voulez-vous..."" followed by a tremendous punch from her). The best thing about it is that no children noticed it, making the movie good & clean fun for everyone.There are so many hidden details on the film there is no way a comment can address them all. And that's the reason I'll have to watch this movie again. And again. And maybe again. It's pure joy.And maybe, after some time, I'll raise the ""9"" I rated this film with, to a ""10"".",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
65,kevinxirau,An underrated journey into a mystical wonder.,10,14 April 2012,"I don't think that this movie has been given enough credit by the general public. This is a welcome departure from the traditional music-filled genre that Disney has been known for, going for a more sci-fi route than a magical fairy tale, which ironically is what most people in this world think Atlantis really is. That doesn't stop our main hero Milo Thatch (Michael J. Fox) from revealing the truth about this lost civilization. So let's dive into Atlantis: The Lost Empire.It was archaeologist Milo Thatch's dream to prove that the legendary Atlantis is not just a myth, so he takes a journey with military officials and adventurers alike to find the lost civilization. After going through numerous deadly obstacles, they finally found it, but not all is as it seems. With Atlantis, and not to mention the world, threatened, Milo and company (including newfound love interest princess Kida, voiced by Cree Summer) set out to save the day and prevent the same disaster that had Lost Continent sink beneath the waves.I'm glad that the filmmakers made sure that this appeals to adults as well as kids as there are numerous rather dark moments throughout the film, a characteristic typically overlooked among Disney movies. Most of the characters are tons of fun as they all have some funny quirks and moments that serve as a source of comedy, which is done very well. They generally have some complexity too and this is backed by a dynamic voice cast from Michael J. Fox to Leonard Nimoy. Kida is probably one of the best Disney princesses I have ever seen; not only is she easy on the eyes, but she's also quite curious and tough. I prefer Kida over the likes of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.Other aspects of the film are truly spectacular. The visuals and art design are breathtaking as you could stare out and marvel at its wonder all day long. The action scenes are great, probably some of the best in the Disney franchise with cool camera angles, intensity, and a surprising body count. I also like how they use the science in this film as it plays around how some cultures had stories of Atlantis and how myths have a basis in truth. The story and themes of Atantis are done very wheel and they're quite thought-provoking.Overall, this semi-aquatic film is a true masterpiece. It's often you see a movie like this from Disney of all companies. I only wish that it will gain a greater recognition from the world. Atlantis, the story that continues to bring sense of awe. Check it out!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

I literately said ""wow"" out loud because of how amused I was.Then the movies goes on and coming to the climax of the movie when it was revealed one of his helpers was in fact evil caught me a little off guard.

To argue that it's not very original is not meaningful, but it surely can be criticized for duplicating Castle in the sky. However, it also has something to say very helpful in this era of chaos.To note, the movie is about the differences between cultures and the right attitude towards it. Atlantisians simply would hide themselves in the temple for the reason of preserving their culture and life. But are they just right in this way? Possibly not. But also possibly right. The movie turns the tone in the middle of the story, just when the captain disclose his own purpose in the Atlantis city...... Different from Castle in the Sky, this movie showed a positive conclusion in the culture of ancient world. The confidence through the culture plus right faith in humanity would save them all. That is what about to say.Atlantis is equipped with very beautiful 2.5D cartoon rendered visual style, and it showed the perfect integrity of Disney cartoon production. Overally it's good and enjoyable.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Even the mixture of 3D isn't bad either. I really love the characters in this and the voice acting. I love how they play off on one another. The soundtrack is ok. But theplot is kinda recycled.

69,twanurit,Atlantis: The LEAST Empire,5,5 March 2002,"No wonder this fizzled at the Box Office: it's a ludicrous excuse to show off animated super special effects. The story, set in 1912, is replete with assinine, stereotypical, overly contemporary characters, including 2 women, who unfortunately at the time would not even be allowed to join an expedition, half-baked plot developments, unanswered twists (what's the back story on the gigantic crustacean?), and an excessive climax. The lack of songs are actually sorely missed. No wonder ""Atlantis"" sank.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
70,neenahhh,This film opened up a new genre for Walt Disney films,8,18 April 2011,"This movie revolves around Milo Thatch who is a cartographer and a linguist. He has spent his whole life learning about the lost city of Atlantis. With some help, he gets to join a group of explorers who are also dead-set on finding Atlantis.Overall, this was a very interesting film. I couldn't stop watching it. It was engaging and kept me glued to my seat. It had tons of adventure and a tad bit of romance. But it mostly concentrated on adventure and boy, was it good. It's not Disney's usual type of film, but it worked and it worked good!People say that ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" has many similarities to James Cameron's ""Avatar"". That's true. But it doesn't make either movie less good than what it really is. Aside from ""Avatar"", I also felt a sort of ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" vibe, especially during the last battle scene, which actually gave me chills!I don't think this movie was perfect. And judging from other reviewers, I'm not the only one who thinks so. It lacks something. But I'm not sure what that 'something' is. I mean, this animated film has everything! It has quirky, yet lovable characters. It has good and light-hearted humor. The villains are interesting people themselves. And this movie doesn't only target to children- I feel like even adults will enjoy this one. So I don't get why I can't just give this a perfect 10 without feeling uneasy. Maybe because the whole crystal talk was a bit shaky. That's my only complaint. It could have been more expounded on. Oh and I wanted more battle scenes. The effects were amazing!Disney should concentrate on making more films like these instead of making crappy sequels to great movies. I know I won't be watching ""Atlantis: Milo's Return"".Viewed on: April 18, 2011",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
71,SofiaHedge,Amazing!,10,16 August 2020,Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a great film. I don't know why it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. The film has great storytelling and dialogue with a nice concept and beautiful visuals. This movie is an underrated classic.,Atlantis - The Lost Empire
72,datautisticgamer-74853,Another obscure gem (or should I say crystal?),8,7 January 2018,"As I had to return to Chicago tomorrow, I recommended to my aunt that we view this as a parting gift. It was the first time I had seen this film in over 16 years, so it felt fascinating to view it on VHS after all this time between her house and some theater I don't remember from my infancy. So what do I appreciate about this film?The story is rather nice with its idea of combining modern technology with what people in 1914 believed would be the near future, as well as providing a different perspective on Atlantis than the usual mythology. It isn't acted to its fullest (I noted some parts where Michael J. Fox's performance as Milo felt really off), but does pull off the occasional gag and passable action. I believe Lyle to be in the mid-tier of Disney Villains, as he has an impressive motivation but doesn't carry it out too effectively. The characters are a rather strong suit of this movie, with Milo of course having a familial legacy to develop and the Atlanteans being significantly more sophisticated than a society buried for centuries underwater would suggest initially. I found the specialists to be a tad above standard for somewhat minor characters, but they did contribute enough in the action and gags departments that I did have some fun. By far, however, the animation is the best thing about this movie; the character designs are really catching and the environments are among the best I have ever seen in a Disney movie. And oh goodness, the effects... I just can't describe them. And it's at that point when you know Disney is on another level altogether.As forgotten as this movie is in the Disney canon, the animation is sure to please Disney fans. Ones who have sci-fi hold them to captivity will likely get something out of this, though it's more for a slightly older audience compared to the average Disney movie. That said, families can enjoy it just fine.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
73,Criticman12,Disney's first Sci-Fi animated film is great,8,6 March 2011,"Disney has made ton's of classic's like, ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and ""The Lion King"". But in 2001, they released their first Sci-Fi animated film, ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"".The thing's I liked about this film is that the animation was great, the action scene's were good, and the voice acting was good. Michael J. Fox does a good job as the nerdy Linguist, Milo. James Garner does a good job as the villain, Rourke.The thing's I didn't like about this film is that it has a problem with character development. We only see the side character's as comic-relief character's and we see them at the end of the movie. Also, their wasn't that much plot. It's just about a group of explorers finding the lost city of Atlantis.Overall, ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"", is a fun, Sci-Fi animated film that's worth watching. It may not be as perfect as, ""Titan A.E."", but it's still a great movie.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
74,Hup234!,Another landmark film to mark the decline of Disney.,6,25 July 2001,"See it once to satisfy your curiosity, and then go rent ""Bambi"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"" and all the rest from Disney's Golden Age.Here we have a few good moments (averything with Don Novello) and lots of pap ... unconnected, too-short sequences that will frustrate anyone with an attention-span longer than that of a flea. The film looks like it was edited with a hedge-clipper.And parents, beware: the character of Mrs. Packard smokes endlessly. (Disney couldn't create her without a cigarette? That shows how the creativity-process runs throughout this film.)",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
75,smashattack,A new kind of Disney.,8,18 February 2002,"I'll have some spoilers ahead.Death.  Destruction.  Explosions.Does this sound like Disney to you?  Hardly.Yet Atlantis:  The Lost Empire has broken through the restraints set on earlier Disney films and attempted to become more of an action flick rather than the usual feel-good Disney content.Is this a good thing?  Definitely!  Disney is trying to break through, survive, and attract a larger crowd.  Recently it has done that, pitting major characters against nature, evil advisors, and comrades.  Death, something which occurs quite frequently in real life but isn't to be seen much in Disney films, is now appearing more and more with the introduction of Dinosaur and now Atlantis.  Disney has slapped the audience in the face with these newer movies, giving them something more realistic.Atlantis continues this newer kind of film, especially since around 150 people are killed within the first hour of the film.  Great graphics and realistic (but somewhat shallow) characters add to the film's depth.  One of the worst things about the film, however, is the sense of rushing through a busy highway going 110 mph.  Images flash by and quickly you're at your destination.  The beginning of Atlantis is like this.  The viewer is bombarded with constant scene shifts and new plot developments all the time in the beginning, which makes you feel kind of thrown into it all.All in all, Atlantis is quite a movie, and proves that Disney is making a great name for itself as it bursts into this new era.  Let's hope they keep it up.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

78,TexasRedge,This was the Biggest Mistake in the history of Disney,10,17 May 2003,"This was the Biggest Mistake in the history of Disney..by that I mean, I absoluteley loved it...and I believe this may be one of (if not the) Best animated movie I've ever seen.right now you are asking yourself,why was it a mistake?-------because this should've been a Live Action feature film ! !------
the story is GREAT! if this had been done as a feature film instead of a cartoon, this movie would've easily gone down as one of the all time Sci-Fi/Fantasy giants,ranking right up there with the Star Wars,Jurassic Park, and Lord of the Rings films - YES, The story and concept IS really that GOOD. Unfortunatley this was done as an Animated Cartoon Feature and now it will forever be type cast into the realm of Disney's Movies like Dumbo,Pinocchio, Lady and the Tramp, and Bambi and will never be taken seriously by the Sci-Fi/Fantasy realm.as I was watching it, I could already imagine Matt Damon as Milo Thatch, and maybe Drew Barrymore as Keeta..and I could imagine some top noth special efeects -- but that will never happenI gave his film 10 out of 10 stars --but this story was WAAAAY to good for animation.........maybe (if we are lucky) 10 years from now Disney will remake it into a 1st class Feature film production (Why not- It'd be much better than 102 Dalmations(2000) or The Jungle Book(1995)movies were!)",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
79,Gambitt,Weakest of the new Disney animations,5,12 July 2001,"""Atlantis"" is entertaining, but nevertheless remains inferior to most of its new-age, animated counterparts.I'd enjoyed The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin a lot.  I liked Lion King less, and Hunchback of Notre Dame still less.  Since then, I haven't seen any of Disney's cartoon movies, until Atlantis.What disappointed me most about Atlantis compared to its predecessors was the lack of an underlying theme.  Little Mermaid was about growing up to experience the world, and the spirit of adventure that burns in young people.  Beauty and the Beast was about beauty of the spirit vs. physical appearances.  Aladdin was about being true to yourself.  In all of these movies, the plot revolved pretty tightly around these central themes, and most people could relate to the characters because of it.In Atlantis, the central theme was.... honor thy ancestors?  Or maybe, don't always do it for money?  In either case, the ""theme"" played a minimal role. If there was a message in this movie, it was vague and weak.Another disturbing trend in Disney's animated movies is the proliferation of useless, slapstick characters.  Aladdin's Genie was really the first slapstick sidekick.  He worked well, but since then, Disney has gone into a hiring frenzy with extras.  In Atlantis, we are presented with an excavation team of about 8 characters. None of them are developed in depth, yet all are still far from mere stand-in characters.  Most of them, ie mole, that old lady, and the cook, have absolutely nothing to do with the plot; really now, how necessary was it to have a switchboard operator on this mission?  Instead most of these extras are there for cheap slapstick jokes and gags.**some spoilers**Overall, the plot was ""mystical"" and ""magical.""  I would even call it ""sloppy"" and ""illogical"" but that's just because I'm so darn cynical.  The nature of the Atlantian's ""special blue power"" was never explained in much depth.  Why was Kida returned by the crystal whereas her mother wasn't? Didn't essentially the same thing happen with her mother thousands of years ago?Yes, that's being picky.  Regardless of the mystical nature of the plot, there were nevertheless some more basic plotholes.  It made no sense how the Atlantians had ""lost"" their culture.  Afterall, don't Atlantians live for thousands of years?  Many of the Atlantians that Milo meets would've been alive back when the city was first buried.  At the very least, we know that the King and Princess were alive back then.  **end spoilers**The animation and artwork are good, but to be honest I wasn't that impressed.  Most of the effects only seem a few steps better than Aladdin, which was created nearly 10 years ago.So all in all, bring the kids to see it, but don't overthink or analyze this one, like I did.  This time, Disney used a bare minimum of plot and depth.By the way, the first half of this movie, and the end, really reminded me of Stargate.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
80,andrewmerritt-31652,"No the greatest Disney movie, but I was entertained",8,18 January 2019,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is Disney's first science fiction film and features the voice of Michael J. Fox. Michael J. Fox voices Milo Thatch, a researcher who is passionate and dedicated to find the lost city of Atlantis. The problem is, is that everyone thinks he's crazy; expect one person who gives Milo the opportunity to find Atlantis. This movie is a combination of Indiana Jones meets 200,000 Leagues under the Sea. And I love the animation style as the animators really took the time, patience, and detail to create such beautiful artwork especially Atlantis. It's really a pleasure and a delight to watch something that you grew up with before Disney discovered the magic of CGI. I'm not saying that Disney movies now are full of CGI and that there's no imagination, but watching this in the era before Disney knew what CGI was is incredible to experience. What I like about Disney is that they create characters that we can connect to on a personal level like Milo Thatch. Whether we care to admit it or not we all can relate to Milo Thatch as he is passionate and dedicated to find Atlantis. As we all are passionate and dedicated about something we care about. And I can argue that he is crazy just like everybody says he is, somewhere deep inside my brain can't help but admire how passionate he is. And seeing that also makes me passionate as well as we want him to achieve his goals as well. My biggest problem with Atlantis is the mercenaries that follow Milo as they bully and belittle Milo. Eventually I do sympathize with them, as they are humans just like us deep down, but that feeling is gone as they are just in it for the money, while Milo is in it for the journey. I didn't feel any connection to any of them where I was supposed to sympathize with them, and I do, but not that much. Just like my review with Treasure Planet this movie didn't do good at the box office, as Disney didn't feel that this was a magnificent experience, as they would've liked. And it's also a shame seeing the creators and animators pour their sweat and tears into creating something epic only for Disney to quietly cancel a television series and maybe a live action movie in the future. I always find it puzzling that people are so quick to trash and destroy a movie so quickly when they haven't even seen it or because its not the next Pixar movie. While it may not be the best Disney movie released its still nonetheless a great animated film to watch as I enjoyed it from start to finish. But do yourself a favor, go watch this movie with the whole family and be prepared to be swept away.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
81,Cephyran,"Majestic, impressive, fun...",8,13 September 2004,"I like this new generation of Disney movies. The newer films have the fun, colorful appeal that has made the Disney company the official pandering superpower to young children, and yet the writing is improving. There's a touch of humor, sometimes just a sight gag or hinted hilarity that is funnier than trying to drive gut-busters right at us. Atlantis is a very glossy film, a product of this new generation where all cartoons are made on computers, but keep their 2D qualities. With the digital era, Disney films have grown to this new scope, a wider panoramic, in the sense that they've created deep, rich environments for the stories to play out within. Michael J Fox is the kind of actor you can't not like. Even in voice work, his nice-guy personality shines through, with that hint of innocence, almost sadness you hear when he speaks. Overall, I felt that Atlantis managed to recreate that majesty that the classic films built upon. It's cool, dynamic, and funny. I recommend this for everyone in the family.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
82,brent_or,Terrific Sci-Fi/Fantasty Adventure from Disney,9,6 April 2014,"I've seen this film three times, each viewing separated by several years, beginning with seeing it in the theater. And even as an ever-older adult, I like it more every time I watch it. This is one of the best things that Disney has ever produced, in my humble opinion.First of all, it's not musical. This film is not a descendant of Cinderella or The Jungle Book or Beauty and the Beast. It's much more a descendant of Disney's live-action films like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It combines the classic style of Jules Verne-era science fiction with the retro-futuristic-mythology of Stargate (the lead character is basically Daniel Jackson). Throw in some Indiana Jones overtones, and there you have it. I love all of those influences, personally, and I find Atlantis here to be a very enjoyable blend of them.From an animation standpoint, I love the stylized character designs. Some people note the influence of anime, but don't worry; the characters here don't look anything like the over-caffeinated Dragonball Z aesthetic. A better reference point would be Genndy Tartakovsky's original Star Wars: Clone Wars. CGI is used for some of the vehicles and panoramas, and it is breathtaking at best, but I really appreciate how the look is purely 2D - it's classic-style animation, just utilized optimally to fuel the adventure. There are some truly wonderful visual elements in this film, from the beautiful design of Atlantis to the steampunk-influenced submarines and other vehicles.The cast of characters is made up of many typical clichés and types, for sure, but the dialog is often witty and the pacing fast. The only character who really bothers me is the French geologist/excavator Moliere, a truly horrible, demeaning caricature if there ever was one. Otherwise, the cast is fun, diverse and each individual is a worthwhile inclusion, making the film better for being a part of it.I felt compelled to review this film because, having lived with it for all these years, I am more and more convinced that it is simply one of the best throwback sci-fi adventures put to film, animated or otherwise. It's true that the story could use some additional running time to flesh itself out, but I defy any other film to fit so much clearly-executed (if abbreviated) storytelling, action, humor, awe and wonder into an hour and a half. It goes without saying that this film is designed for the young at heart; if that describes you, rest assured that this one is a great experience for all ages.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
83,mergatroid-1,Loved it,7,8 April 2010,"I have to say I enjoyed this movie all the way through. The acting is good, the script well done, the animation is classic and the production values what we come to expect from Disney.Thank the Powers that Be that they didn't have to sing any songs in this movie. I've really gotten tired of that old shtick, and thankfully Disney does without it this time.First class actors in this movie do a great job with their characters.The story rolls along as a group of explorers set about finding Atlantis. They manage it but it turns out most of them are after Atlantis' ""wealth"" before anything else, including worrying about the paltry lives of the Atlantians.Our hero (played by Michael J Fox) must convince as many of the crew as he can to change sides and help him save Atlantis.So, it's not too deep of a story, but it's a fun movie with a few laughs and the story moves right along. I sure enjoyed watching it, and I'm also sure any animation lovers out there will enjoy it just as much. The kids will love it.Go see it right now.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
84,Martinito_08183,A underrated gem.,8,20 August 2019,"One of the most underrated Disney movies ever. The 2000s many not be the strongest decade for Disney, since the popularity of computer animation got huge and Pixar receiving all of the critical acclaim at that time for their stories and for those reasons many 2D animated movies by Disney, especially Atlantis: The Lost Empire did not perform very well at the box office, but that doesn't mean that all of them were bad.While it may not be perfect - suffering from problems with the story at the end of the second and some moments of the third act; a very OK soundtrack, with some tracks being memorable, while the others are forgettable; moments of weak dialogue here and there and some of the characters are not very interesting or could have been written way better, so that they can fit naturally into the story - it's still a great movie that deserves to be called a classic by many people and will always have a special place in my heart.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
85,qball_82,Nice work...,7,21 February 2002,"It's nice to see that Disney are continuing to explore other ideas in animated story telling, and it's refreshing.  Atlantis isn't a bad film.  Not my favorite Disney flick but I can appreciate the effort that went into it.  The visuals are top-notch as always, and the style is quite a departure from the traditional Disney animation.  There are definite hints of anime influence in this film, and it very much works.  The music in parts is beautiful (the Enya-like music was awesome), fitting in with the scene wonderfully and helping to convey the mood.  In particular I refer to the sequence in the chamber containing the giant rock faces of past kings.  Combined with the imagery and editing, it was breath-taking. This is where my main qualm with the film comes in.  It's disappointing that Disney didn't try to maintain this approach througout the rest of the film, using both the music and imagery to evoke such moods.  The Atlantis story had a lot of potential in this respect, but Disney only touched on it here and there.   The story, as others have pointed out, is kinda thin.  The characters are pretty shallow and to be honest, Milo took the geekazoid act to the extreme and it got kind of annoying.  Michael J Fox did a great job with the voice-acting, but personally I felt his voice didn't match the character too well.All in all, not a bad flick.  See it on video.  7 out of 10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
86,RestlessRust,What Titan: A.E. Should Have Been,8,22 June 2001,"Well directed, energetic and engaging, with a seamless blend of CGI and hand-drawn animation, ""Atlantis: the Lost Empire"" is Disney's best animated offering since ""Aladdin"", or at least ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"".  It's the Sci-Fi action flick ""Titan: A.E."" tried to be.  And while this most likely will not be the blockbuster event that ""The Little Mermaid"" was, it may well serve as the latest reinvention of the Disney animated movie.The story follows a young loner named Milo.  (""Linguist, cartographer, *and* plumber--it's a wonder he's still single."")  Milo's grandfather dreamed of finding the lost city of Atlantis, and now that dream (as well as a ""lost"" book) has been handed down to him.  Funded by an old friend of his grandfather, Milo guides a rag-tag team of explorers into the depths of the ocean to find the lost city.  There are dangers along the way, and many of the crew are lost. Then upon arrival we realize things may not be all they appear to be: why does the presence of Atlanteans threaten the captain's plans, and what is the king of Atlantis hiding?Rated PG for violence (the death toll reaches well into the hundreds, though we never actually see anyone die, and we only see one recently deceased person resting peacefully), ""Atlantis"" may not be suitable for younger children, but rest assured it is harmless entertainment for children old enough to enjoy such classic cartoons as _Speed Racer_ and _The Transformers_.  For adults, the storyline may seem a bit simplistic, and the movie is a little slow getting started.  But there is enough action and suspense here to carry anyone through to the end.""Atlantis: the Lost Empire"" probably will not become the classic that other Disney films have in the last fifteen years, mainly because there just aren't many levels to this straightforward action tale.  But in a summer thus far virtually devoid of any good entertainment, ""Atlantis"" is a good enough reason to take the family to the movie theater on a hot Saturday afternoon.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
87,RolloTomasi,more eye candy from Disney,7,18 June 2001,"`Atlantis' has no doubt been in the works for a long time. The last time Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise teamed up, they were making the under-appreciated `Hunchback of Notre Dame' and before that, `Beauty and the Beast.' Only this time, instead of the big song and dance, it's pure adrenaline-pumping action. So, after working on it for this long, how did these guys do at their first non-musical? Well, `Atlantis' is no less visually stunning than any Disney ani-feature. In fact, the artwork and images overpower everything else about it. The story itself, while inventive, original, and basically sound, can't compete with the eye candy Disney's artists create. True, many of the ideas and story elements are borrowed from other places. But this material is presented in a visually inventive and interesting manner, you'd hesitate to accuse anyone of stealing. This alone earns this film the benefit of the doubt.  The story barrels forward so fast you barely have time to guess what might happen next.  With any animated movie, parents are going to think take the kids,' so `Atlantis' keeps the action coming, giving you something interesting to look at at least once a minute. This film is most definitely built for this, the age of the short attention span. From first frame to last, `Atlantis' is lightning in a bottle. As for characters, there's a whole lot of them. Most seem to be there only to provide comic relief. 
No other North American movie studio has figured out how to beat Disney at their own game. The formula that the Mouse House applies to each animation spectacle they release still works but is definitely showing some rust. `Atlantis' is a bit disappointing in that it doesn't jump up and bite you like some Disney works of the past. The studio raised the animation bar so high with the `Toy Story' films (thanks to Pixar), it's going to have difficulty living up to its own standards. In fact, `Atlantis' isn't as good as `Dinosaur' or even 1999's `Tarzan.' It's not a `masterpiece' (shame on all of you bandwagoners who have said that it is), it won't shake the foundations of the animation world, but it's still worth a look.Grade: B-",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
88,evilmatt-3,Not a bad Disney film,6,25 July 2001,"It's what we've come to expect from Disney: a family friendly movie with a nice story and something for everyone.  Evaluated strictly as a work of film, it lacks substance in a number of places, in technique and more seriously in the narrative.  There's nothing startlingly original about anything here, and thus no reason to see it beyond the mild curiosity stirred up by the trailers (which I have to say were pretty good as Disney trailers go.)  I did find the wild, desperate stab at racial character diversity overwhelming, artificial, and forced most of the time, but the intentions were good and ultimately forgivable (with the exception of the French ""mole"" character, who seemed to provoke in me an irrational rage every time he graced the screen.)  Overall, this is probably one of the better movies to come out in the summer of 2001, although that is not saying very much.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

90,amiranda-39274,"The Heart of Atlantis: Less Songs, More Explosions",9,8 December 2019,"This is one of those movies that touched my soul as a child and to this day every time I watch it, I feel like a kid again. I'm going to cut to the chase, i love this movie, there is not one scene in this movie that fails to put a smile on my face, in my eyes it is perfect. Its in my top 10 animated movies of all time
( which is a very hard list to get on) and I want to convince you why.The story: The movie starts off with an incredible opening showing the destruction of Atlantis which is just enthralling and makes you want to see what has happened to the city. The journey to Atlantis is truly unique, sure its your standard adventure journey to the center of the earth kind of story, but it is done with such captivating visuals and action sequences that make you regret that they cut out most of the journey. But never the less you will be pleased when the explorers arrive in Atlantis. The lore that is used for Atlantis is just fascinating ( the shepherds journal), so much it might cause you to look up real world facts about the real Atlantis, but the movie creates its own lore that is just mind-blowing and makes you eager to learn more, especially about the heart of Atlantis.The Action: The creators were determined to make a Disney movie that centered more on a action packed story, so much they wore t shirts that said
"" less songs, more explosions"" and you better believe they lived up to that label. Not only does the intro throw you right into an action sequence, the camera angles make you feel that you ae actually there. The leviathan attack is still one of the most exciting action sequences ive ever seen, animated or not. And the climax almost feels like your on a rollercoaster, which I feel Disneyland should really have! What gives these action scenes so much strength is that there is a large body count, the beginning shows that only a small part of the city was protected from the cataclysmic event, and it shows that 90% of the Atlanteans died. The crew of the Ulysses, number at least 200 men and women, and only like 30 people survive the battle with the leviathan. And they make sure you know that people died, they show shots of them before they die, and even show a funeral service which makes this movie more mature than most Disney films.The music: Let me just say there are no words to describe how enrapturing the soundtrack of this movie is. Using just instruments, a choir and gorgeous visuals this movie is able to tell a better story than most of Disney's musicals. Every scene is just elevated to God mode with the soul touching music that was composed for this movie. I urge you to listen to the soundtrack on its own.The Creators: I just watched a documentary on the making of the movie, and I could see and hear the passion of the entire crew on how they made this movie. Like the characters in this film, the creators felt like a real family to the point it was touching that they honored this movie to jim varney. The creators took this project so seriously they created an actual Atlantean language and even a model of the Atlantis ecosystem. They also went to an actual submarine to get the right feel on how it would be like to be in one, they studied everything there was to know about Atlantis ad they created a very satisfying yet fictional version of it, which is my definitive version of Atlantis now.The characters:
Every single character that speaks is likeable and memorable. Despite having a large cast, each character is given a lot of screen time that elevates their characterization. Milo, Kida, Rourke, Helga, sweet, vinny, Audrey, Mr. whitmore and mole are all great characters that just make this journey so much fun. The cheesy humor is made into gold by these characters entertaining personalities and quirks, which are just brought to life by their amazing voice actors. Michael j fox being the most spectacular actor of them all. Disney has a fondness for twist villains, and while most fall short, I believe this movie has a successful one. Near the third act their is a betrayal that just hits you in the gut because youve come to like everyone of these characters. The dialogue used in this film is what gives the characters real depth, some of the dialogue are actually ad libs done by the actors. Some of it being in the background, that is just to die for. There are even some badass one liners ( ""Nothing personal"") and hilarious ones as well. "" Tell the chef to break out the butter and bibs, I want this lobster served to me on a silver platter""The animation:
The animation is just mesmerizing to watch in this film, in fact there is so much fluidity and motion occurring in one scene, you might have to rewatch it just so you can witness all of it. The background art is just breathtakingly beautiful, with several camera angles and maneuvers being used to enhance the beauty, which just makes this world feel so real. Although each character was drawn by different animators, they were all designed to match mike magnolias art style, in case you are wondering he is the comic book artist of hell boy, which is why there are similar traits. This movie is a hybrid of cgi and 2d, which is so good I never noticed it as a kid. The most impressive cgi models would have to be the Ulysses and the leviathan, which were just used spectacularly. The final shot is just glorious and it was also considered the hardest scene to make in the entire film. Its a zoom out of the entire city, that uses a combination of hundreds of drawings lined up into one fifteen-hundred-foot-long drawing, and it was totally worth it, its the cherry on top of a delicious sundae.The Magic:
This move is truly a beautiful crystal, that has gone underappreciated for so many years, and in my honest opinion it is one of the top 10 best Disney films, in fact animated films in my book. It makes you feel like your on an actual epic adventure that just continues to build and build. For some this might not be their kind of Disney movie, but for me this gave me everything I could want as a kid, and it showed me exactly what Disney was capable of in its golden years. Yes I am aware of the few problems in the story, like the villains main motivation being greed, which I do feel is contrived and doesn't fit with the rest of the story. I do wish a more complex reason could have been given, but the final battle makes it worth it and its doesn't really affect the rest of the story. The only other thing wrong with this movie, is that its too short, I wish they could have expanded more on some things, and I wish they could have made the animated series, which is why I am grateful for the sequel. This movie posses imagery and other moments ive never seen in any other movie ( The volcanoe sequence) live action or not, which makes this one of the most creative movies ever made. This is most certainly one of those movies that you need to watch several times to catch every detail in every shot and just gaze at the craftmanship. The passion put into this movie is truly heartwarming and I will always be grateful to the creators for making this movie, whether it was financially successful or not, this movie is a masterpiece that I pray more and more people will notice. If you have Disney plus or a nearby best buy please get this movie, watch it and let it touch your soul as well.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
91,Jeremy Bristol,"Steals from a lot of movies, but it's better than Titan A.E. (Spoilers)",7,16 June 2001,"There is a web site dedicated to a comparison between Castle in the Sky and Nadia, two Japanese anime from the mid-eighties(the former a movie, the latter a series).  Maybe somebody should have dedicate a site to how Atlantis is really just a Disney rehash of these ideas.First of all, there's a young man who dreams about finding some mythical place (Laputa, the Floating City in Castle in the Sky, but I can't remember what the boy is after in Nadia) that his father or grandfather died searching for.Secondly, there is some magical girl from an ancient race who (lo and behold) has a magical blue crystal or magical amulet with blue symbols. In all, the magical item allows levitation and is the key to unlocking some great power, but is also what keeps the mythical place more or less alive.Thirdly, there's always a gang going after the power purely for monetary gain, and then there's always some greater evil (in Atlantis, a group of Panzer-like soldiers) after it for the power itself.  They always capture the girl, and the boy has to join the gang to save the girl.There are other similar things: the designs for the flying fish are curiously similar to the Doma pirate gang's dragonfly craft from Castle in the Sky.  The idea of inserting a crystal into something is another common link.Beyond that, Atlantis seems to borrow the subplot from Titan A.E., but at least this time the betrayal had a lead up that made sense (I could name a half-dozen instances in A.E. that contradict the betrayal thing).Still, the animation was terrific, though I would've like to have seen more done with the sub before it gets blown away.  7/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
92,Jeremy Bristol,Another thing--more spoilers,7,16 June 2001,"It also steals a lot from Stargate (especially what happens to Fox's character at the end).  Also, although people seem to like it, the Leviathan is nothing more than a rip-off of the Star Wars Episode One sea creature.More complaints: since when did Norse vikings use english?  When Fox explains how people could mistakenly transliterate (not translate, it is actually going letter by letter, not by meaning) the location of the Shephard's diary as Ireland instead of Iceland, all he does is change the ""R"" to a ""C.""Oh, and about languages--how is it that all the Atlantians have forgotten the how to read their own language, even though apparently they were all alive when the cataclysm happened.You know, having thought a bit more clearly about the movie, you might be better off watching Blue Submarine 6 on video.

The music is awesome, the dialogs are lively and entertaining and the character development is satisfying.

94,EdYerkeRobins,Disney - Songs + Action = Animated Excellence!,8,30 June 2001,"While I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see"".  Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.Atlantis is a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering.  The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached.  The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance.  The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a ""childish"" element that I usually associate with Disney films.  Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about.  Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.Granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney film I've seen in years.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
95,jmmustchin,An intriguing adventure,7,2 September 2018,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire may be flawed and far from perfect, but it's a fun and interesting sci-fi/fantasy action adventure.The movie begins with the sinking of Atlantis thousands of years ago. It is implied to be the result of an explosion, or some such human action. A forcefield surrounds the inner portion of the city, which sinks into the ground as the island sinks into the sea.Skip to 1914, when young Milo Thatch (Michael J Fox), aspiring to be like his grandfather, discovers evidence that a long-lost medieval document revealing the location of Atlantis is to be found in Iceland.Milo then bumps into Mr Whitmore, an old his friend of his grandfather's, who gives him the actual document (called the Shepherd's Journal), which his grandfather had discovered years ago. Milo then embarks on an expedition to find Atlantis, organised by Whitmore. During the submarine expedition, they are attacked by the Leviathan, which in the movie is an ancient Atlantian war machine (yes, a robot). The survivors find an underground passageway leading to the sunken city - which is alive and thriving in an underground chamber. However, some of the expedition members have an ulterior motive, and it's up to Milo to save Atlantis.The movie certainly has it's flaws - mainly in the slightly New Age aspect of the film. However, despite this, it's a fun, funny, and exciting action-adventure about a search for a legendary long-lost city, and its ancient technology.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Sure it did have good vs. evil, 2 people fell in love, and there were other things too but I don't want to give out any spoilers. But the movie did have thrilling yet violent parts to it. It had its good moments and it had its bad moments. And what's real weird but cool is that Joss Wheldon who created Buffy the Vampire Slayer did the story line for this movie. But I would say that what made this movie good was that it had things in it that your normal Disney flick doesn't.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
98,Nigel St. Buggering,Disney continues to evolve...thank you!,8,18 June 2001,"With no cute, funny animals, no musical numbers, and a PG rating, ""Atlantis"" is a big risk for Disney, and I applaud them for finally having the guts to come out from behind the mommy's skirt of their very dependable, very tired formula.  It remains to be seen whether it will pay off monetarily, but creatively, it's paid off handsomely.  ""Atlantis"" is the best Disney animation since ""The Lion King"" (my all-time favorite).The biggest difference you'll notice immediately is the art style.  The character designs were done by Mike Mignola, who is familiar to comics fans everywhere with his Jack Kirby-influenced angular designs.  They work quite well here, and help to reduce the cute quotient that Disney is so famous for.  The look of the film seems more influenced by Hayao Miyazake and Jules Verne than by previous Disneys, and that's a good thing.  It's exciting to watch, a melding of designs that's never been seen on the screen before.  In a word, original; not a word Disney's been connected with much.The plot isn't spectacularly creative (especially if you've seen ""Titan A.E.""), but that really isn't the main draw here.  The look is beautiful, the voice acting is great, the action is thrilling, and the music score (by John Powell) is terrific.If you've been avoiding Disney films because they've become boring and homogenized, this is the one to check out.  I give it an 8.Note to parents: just because it's Disney, don't expect your toddler to sit through it.  This isn't ""Tarzan""; there are no funny monkeys.  What there is is a lot of plot and dialogue.  A couple of clueless moms ruined the movie where I saw it because they brought in three-year-olds, who ended up getting bored and running around the theater yelling.  This is for older children.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

102,Figaro-8,Not a bad effort.,8,18 June 2001,"Disney hasn't made a movie like this since ""Black Cauldron"" 16 years ago, and I'm glad they finally decided to do it again.  Sure there are a lot of plot holes.  But the voice cast, especially Michael J. Fox, is right on the money, as it always is in Disney films.  James Newton Howard, whose score for ""Dinosaur"" was one of the best things about that film, turns in another winner here, although I wish the mixers had turned it up a notch--it's a bit hard to hear in some places.  Visually, this movie is a knockout.  This is only the fourth traditionally animated film Disney has shot in the widescreen format.  (The other three are Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty, and Black Cauldron.  A Bug's Life was also shot widescreen, but that was CGI.)  The expanded 2.35:1 aspect ratio greatly enhances the visual effects and Mike Mignola's character designs.

103,StartingAllOver14,Better than reviewers give credit for,8,9 September 2007,"""Atlantis"" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like ""Atlantis"". I didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, I don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. Even in my country the reviewers weren't positive.""Atlantis"" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's greatest, even I doubt that this film ever will get ""Disney classic"" reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback"" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, I'm just kidding).Well, enough nonsense. ""Atlantis"" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. Even this film it's a PG-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he he).The story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie. The comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual Disney-style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas sequences are pretty impressive. The film is also funny sometimes, even I more giggled than laugh through the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (SPOILERS).The score of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's daring and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive about this film is how they're making the Atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really awesome (SPOILERS OVER)The script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. But luckily there are not so much of them.So do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch ""Atlantis"", cause it's waiting for you...",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

I recall going to see this movie when I was 7 at a drive-in theater.
I found this movie to fun and enthralling. Now 17 years later I find to still be a thrilling adventure, one that does not deserve the negativity it has received from some.The animation is perfect, the voice-cast is great! The characters are fun, diverse and likeable.

105,rastaban3,"Good, entertaining family film.",8,23 June 2001,"""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" was everything the previews indicated it would be.  It is not often you find that.  Most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible.  Not so with this one.  I was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub-plots were not.  The animation was not break through like ""Shrek"" but it was good, none the less.  The plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them.  This keeps you interested.  I found myself enjoying this one.  ""Atlantis"" gets and keeps your attention.  You also have to think a little bit, but not too much.  Once you think about it a little, you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen.The casting was also good.  Michael J. Fox, as Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely.  The gruff natured Commander Rourke was also well chosen with James Garner.  His character reminded me of his performance in ""Maverick"" which I also liked.  I really liked the casting of Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair.  Her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting.  It's just too bad she is a villain.Over all, definitely worth you while (8 out of 10).",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The story is good and it has tons of great visuals and suspenseful moments, and some great characters. I don't know whether or not this was commercially successful, but if it wasn't I'd guess it's because it didn't really have that typical Disney flarw.

107,RodReels-2,Disappointment,6,16 June 2001,"OK, so I love the musicals from ""Little Mermaid"" to ""Hunchback"". That's my prejudice. I even like the cute, furry animals who talk and take on other human characteristics. But I tried to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. After all, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Emperor's New Groove,"" which was a major departure for Disney. And I even rated ""Dinosaur"" higher than most audiences did.But ""Atlantis"" is a major disappointment. Reminds me of Disney's ""Black Cauldron"" and ""Black Hole"" days. For all its supposed sophistication, the animation seems a throwback to those earlier and less successful Disney efforts. There is far too much reliance on human characters, who when carefully examined, are less human than those cute furry animals. Come on, the setting is pre-WWI, and we have a multi-cultural crew (a black doctor, a Hispanic woman mechanic). Talk about your history re-writes.An earlier reviewer remarked that the plot would go over the heads of most children. It would go over the heads of most thinking adults as well. For example, when they first meet the Atlanteans and experience their abilities to speak any of the world's languages, Thatch makes the comment that it's some sort of dialectical code like the tower of Babel. Well for students of the Bible, the tower of Babel didn't involve any kind of code. Those people couldn't understand each other's languages. Babel was the opposite of what happens in Atlantis, but there's never really any logical explanation given as to how the Atlanteans trapped at the bottom of the ocean have managed to learn all the languages of the world. Oh, the movie tries to give explanations, but not logical ones.Ordinarily, I would drop my arguments and say it's just a children's movie, but since Disney seems to be aiming toward making it something more, then logic should apply. And in this case, it doesn't. The entire plot of the Atlantis crystal-curing culture versus the evil white capitalists seems more at home in a bad episode of ""Captain Planet"".",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
108,nealklein,Not quite there,6,18 March 2002,"Animated movies don't need musical numbers to be exceptional (c.f. ""The Iron Giant""). Nor do they have to have marketing gimmicks. ""Atlantis"" missed its mark because it has a case of inconsistent cohesion. Animated films tend to be tight-paced. ""Atlantis"" at least has that along with its excellent animation. In at least one place, the pace is TOO fast, as in the case of the escape from the leviathan which could have been a show stopper like the Tarzan vs. Sabor battle in ""Tarzan"" if the story editors allowed it more time. The characterizations are ... inconsistent. We get a delightful introduction to most of the secondary characters, although Helga Sinclair is a huge question mark. Why is she always looking so annoyed? Why is her facial expression range so limited? Why do we get no background on her AT ALL? And why are there characters as serious or believable as Joshua Sweet juxtaposed with Cookie and Moliere? I liked all the characters, but the fleshing out was uneven, leading to an inconsistency of scenes that work. The chemistry is not quite there.By all means, see ""Atlantis"", but don't expect the clarity or story quality from it as you could expect from other Disney masterpieces.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
109,bgood26,Still lost,4,30 August 2006,"""Atlantis: the Lost Empire"" tries hard to be an exciting animated sci-fi adventure feature, but it turned out to be rather dull. The characters, while well developed, seem to be very ordinary: the geeky scientist/linguist hero, the aggressive military commander, the strong female sidekick, the pretty love interest, the comical supporting cast.The animation is good, but it is not up to Disney standards. The pace is fast enough to keep most interested, but the story gets lost somewhere along the way. (Speaking of story, you can look elsewhere for the plot rehash.) The voice-acting is fine, but the characters facial expression don't seem fitting for the situations they're in. The film just doesn't have the all-age appeal that Disney is known for.Is it me, or is this entire storyline borrowed from Stargate? Isn't Milo just like Daniel Jackson? If you want to see a good animated sci-fi adventure, rent ""Titan, AE,"" which combines traditional 2-D animation with 3-D digital effects. I just can't recommend this.

118,clck2001,Top-notch Disney adventure.,10,21 July 2007,"This is one of Disney's best movies ever made, and also one of their best achievements into the genre of action/adventure. This movie has it all: great characters, comedy, adventure, action, and even some suspense. The creators never take a wrong turn or make a mistake. To some, the plot is quite confusing, but for all of us that have the will to suspend their disbelief, the movie is great fun. Listen for the great James Garner as the main villain, called Rourke, who dies in a way that is a lot like the villain from another great Disney movie, ""ALADDIN AND THE KING OF THIEVES"". There is absolutely no need to endlessly argue over whether or not this movie is a remake of other adventure, fantasy, or science fiction. This is a movie that is a true Disney movie, with dashes of Indiana Jones, Jules Verne, and others. As for those who say that this should have a remake as a live action movie, that would be great. Ricky Ullman would be good, but who would play the other characters? Only major change that should be done, except for transitioning it from animation to live action and the cast, is to make it BIGGER and BETTER!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
119,Jaymay,Disappointing and sloppy,4,17 August 2008,"In the end, ATLANTIS is a specimen form the awkward middle period between the wonderful animated Disney musicals such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and the modern Pixar films.On a story level, Atlantis is just plain sloppy. There are tons of anachronisms in the movie. They set the film in 1914, but almost immediately they create characters who look and talk like present day characters (does a wisecracking teenage latina mechanic sound like someone you'd meet in 1914?!).Atlantis is too easy to find -- the explorers show neither smarts nor courage, and yet they are able to find the lost city where thousands of others have failed.Finally, it's quite amusing how the filmmakers felt the need to stop the action in the middle of the movie to give these long, awkward detailed back-stories to the supporting characters. It is done in such a ham-handed way you really have to wonder what they were thinking.The design of the characters is equally all over the map, with some of them (Milo, Kida) looking very middle-of-the-road, vanilla Disney characters and others (Mole) looking like something out of the Triplets of Belleville.The subject matter is certainly interesting but overall it was a disappointing effort.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
120,freakezette,"Funky Animation, Good Movie",8,3 August 2001,"Well, I think will all the CGI floating around, Disney had given up on being realistic and decided to go for style style style. And they thought ""Hey, while we go for a funky style, lets get completly crazy, get rid of all singing, add some guns and earn ourselves a PG rating!"" The result? Well, it's not the best Disney flick, but it's certainly can be a turning point in what's to come from Disney.The sweet and goofy Milo, who has devoted himself to Atlantis. Through a fated series of event, he is part of an journey to find the lost ladn, and does. They find a magnificent but dying community, and Milo and the J.Lo Shaped Princess Kida are trying to find a way to save atlantis.The best thing about this movie is Disney is more and more getting away from their formula that made them a juggernaut in the 90's. And a PG rating? It almost blew me away, but don't worry, the kids can still watch. It's fast pased, (sometimes too fastpaced), multicultured (Hey, has anyone else seen a black man in any disney movies?) and Astheticly pleasing. And there no singing or talking animals, which is good to see (don't get me wrong, I like the talking fish, candlesticks, racoons, monkey, horsies and duckies as much as anyone else)I don't think it will win Best Animated Movie this year, but this is a good movie and can proudly be added to the Disney Collection.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
121,AS-69,Void of content - but perfect animation,7,17 December 2001,"With ""Atlantis"", Disney is experimenting with its techniques in a new genre, an action movie, probably in order to win a more general audience. Of course, on the level of the plot, you wouldn't expect anything original  or novel from Disney, and, in fact, the story of ""Atlantis"" is as flat and trivial as could be. The events are haphazard and barely motivated and much has been seen somewhere else (e.g., Milo manages to speak a language which has been dead for thousands of years even faster than James Spader did in ""Stargate""; with a short moralistic appeal he manages to win tough mercenaries for his cause ... you get the idea). At the beginning, the film is filled with annoying silly and corny gags. Finally, the characters are extremely poorly developed, even for a Disney movie.This said, ""Atlantis"" is still a movie worth watching, because of its fantastic visual style. From the design of the characters to the beautiful landscapes, the look of ""Atlantis"" is almost overwhelming. This makes ""Atlantis"" an experience despite its non-existing story.Certainly, Disney's animation department is in full possession of state of the art artistic and technical means, but the studio is still lacking a unifying spirit like Walt Disney who has a vision of the whole and brings together all the talents in order to create a lasting masterpiece. Since ""Aladdin"", Disney has failed to create another classic, and I am afraid ""Atlantis"" won't be one either. For this, its story and characters are simply too undistinguished.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Not to say that this was not enjoyable as it was and the story, as usual, will appeal to both children and adults. This adult has seen for too much of his wholesome mulch before, however, and it brought nothing outstanding to a Disney catalogue already burdened with titles not dissimilar to this. Michael J Fox and Leonard Nimoy, amongst others, all make characters believable, but as I said, it has all been done before. A winning formula no doubt, but it would be nice if Disney stretched themselves like they did when making the technological leap to 'The Lion King'.

128,dballred,Multiculturalism Run Amok,4,31 October 2002,"Ever since Disney came out with Snow White, the animation giant has thrived on a plethora of one-dimensional characters to tell a story. In the 1937 classic, for example, each dwarf's psyche could be determined completely by the one word that made up his name.  Atlantis has become yet another tale in this mold. Unfortunately, it had also attempted to add the political correctness of ""diversity"" by trying to include one representative from as many different racial and ethnic groups as they could fit into a submarine within the time allotted. The result has been a distraction from the story as well as a disservice to the various groups it tried to portray. When you assign one-dimensional characteristics to an ethnic group, you create or enforce stereotypes. I give this picture a 4 (out of 10).",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The colors and compositions are lush and elegant; it's as handsome looking as anything to come from Disney.  But looks are everything and ""Atlantis"" is sorely lacking in story and character.  Actually, it's dull and formulaic.  The characters are totally conventional.  When we finally do arrive in Atlantis you'd think it would look amazing, perhaps awe inspiring!  Instead, you get a somewhat psychedelic Mayan/Aztec inspired jungle ruins and a brief battle on scooters.  I could go on and on... why bother?  A wasted opportunity.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
130,RobT-2,"Not half bad, but...",3,16 June 2001,"...it could have been better.  Give the Disney people credit not only for attempting an original story rather than yet another adaptation, not only for chosing a story that demanded a more mature manner than most of their stuff, but for rendering that story with enough artistry to make compelling viewing for the duration of a feature.  Nevertheless, there were enough flaws to partially mitigate ""Atlantis's"" considerable virtues, and the nature of the flaws suggests that the filmmakers didn't know their own film's strongest points.The first major flaw is common among original fantasy movies--the filmmakers tried to cram too much story into too short a film.  (Other victims of the syndrome include films as diverse as ""A Close Shave"" and ""The Phantom Menace"".)  At the very least, they should have allowed the visuals some time to sink in, the better to awe the viewer.  As it is, they barely have time enough to move the story along.  Then too, all that neat Atlantean stuff to look at makes one wonder about the people who created and live among it, yet we never really learn much about the Atlanteans themselves, not even the king and the princess (the two major Atlantean characters).  As few as ten more minutes could have done ""Atlantis"" a world of good.The second major flaw grows directly out of the first--the characters are too shallow, and most of their distinctiveness comes out of their comic aspects.  Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with an abundance of funny characters--indeed, most people ARE funny at least some of the time--but given the short time we get to know these people, we never get to see other sides to them, and the few bits of their backgrounds are told rather than shown (with a few minor exceptions for the main character). Thus, when they finally stand up to the bad guy, it's not because of any strength of character hinted at earlier, but because the story demands it.(To be fair, most of the comedy is carried out well enough.  Special thanks here to Don Novello, whose deadpan portrayal of the explosives expert [matched by an animation team led by Russ Edmonds] stands as the perfect riposte to the manic comic sidekicks which have plagued so many recent cartoon films.)A few minor flaws involve matters of taste, so you're free to ignore them if you like.  First, this is yet another film revealing the heavy hand of ""Star Wars"" among its obvious influences.  At least the dogfights here take place in an atmosphere, so they're not as obviously impossible as the space-based dogfights in ""Star Wars"", but it's hard to believe the technology of 1914 could accomplish some of the things depicted here.  (Maybe the story should have been set immediately after the World War rather than before it, even if it meant throwing out that one line about the Kaiser.)James Newton Howard's music also showed a heavy ""Star Wars"" influence, which is too bad because he's capable of better.  For one thing, John Williams's original ""Star Wars"" music itself derives heavily from early 20th century sources (notably Holst's ""The Planets""), and it wouldn't have been out of line for Howard to draw upon some of them as well, considering the time of the story.  Secondly, the intimations of gamelan in part of the closing credits music suggest a sense of wonder that would have greatly added to the visuals had similar music been used during the film proper.Finally, I'm not sure I like the emphasis (also present in Disney's ""Tarzan"") on colonialist exploitation as a source of evil.  For one thing, it was perhaps less appropriate in this movie than in ""Tarzan"", which had some ecological hooks on which to hang the message.  Also, I consider it retrograde to suggest that the wielding of oppressive, exploitative power is a special sin of gun-wielding white males, rather than a potential temptation for any human being in the right place at the right time.  (The backstory of Atlantis itself, once the most powerful society on Earth [in this movie anyway], suggests a way the latter option could have been rendered.  Unfortunately, this is yet another thing we are told rather than given a chance to see and feel for ourselves.)Nonetheless, the best parts of ""Atlantis"" are still wonderful to look at, and to wonder about.  Too bad that in the quest to make a more ""mature"" film the Disney people chose to model ""Atlantis"" after ""Star Wars"" rather than ""Snow White"", because they had all the story material and artistry necessary for an American answer to ""Princess Mononoke"".",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
131,tonysharp,An obnoxious and rushed effort,5,5 March 2002,"Disney's Atlantis was a large bucket of three dimensional dirt mixed with two dimensional sadness. There was hardly anything good about this film. The animation had hideous flaws, and the story was poorly paced and typical.Everyone was telling me how great the 2D and 3D blended together... Not really...There was a scene where a 2D character was holding a 3D book. The book slid around the character's hands as if it was caked in chicken grease. Would it have killed them to just cel animate the book into the character's hand? How lazy has Disney become?.The movie wasn't a complete wreck. There were some inspired visuals.

132,lossowitz,So this thing is a movie? In a way...,3,21 July 2009,"This movie seems to have all it takes. The story outlines itself clearly, the characters are designed with purpose and there were surely made many sketches to get to this animated scenery.But everybody involved took another road and never did those roads meet.The questions that torment me are so simple that I doubt if anyone directed this movie. It is clueless all over.Why is the story set in 1914? There is no obvious reason nor a subtle one. It could be as easily set in 1950 or 1850 or 1500 so why not choose 2001? The only thing you end up with are steam-engined submarines (??) and high-hatted scientists. There must be some flaw in the story that forced the writers to this era, but I couldn't find it, as there are so many flaws that this solution is plain ridiculous.Why do they go out on the mission in a freighter? Why take hundreds of sailors in a fake nautilus to have them killed off in the first incident that occurs? What's the point the storytellers are making? Why is there not a single stroke of wonder in any of the scientists when the arrive in the underworld? They put up camp, take their steam-engined (!) vehicles and decide to take the roads that they find laid out for them. When they find an ancient pillar of enormous size they blow it up. When Milo arrives in Atlantis he wants to leave as soon as possible because the blind king orders him to. When they get to stay one night, instead of making notes or interviewing or doing research, he hops around with the girl taking almost everything for granted.If the Atlantians have lived for hundreds of years without any contact to the outer world, why do they have special clothes to deter aliens? How can they speak French and English? And how did they lose the ability to read? Do they really need a bespectacled American to decipher the signs that they engraved themselves? The motor fish laying around are unused because the Atlantians just did not find the way to put their hand and crystal together in the right place? They lived hundred of years of stupidity? When the girl is called by the crystal, why does she return to the surface? Why does she get captured by the evil guys so easily? She carries the power of a whole civilization, surely she would be untouchable.Why do the bad accomplices leave their leader so easily in about... uh... twelve seconds? ""Ow, where about to do something bad, let's change sides and instead of sneakily overthrowing the Bad Man, we decide to stay in Atlantis with Milo, so were dead already."" Making a fantasy or science fiction movie asks of the writer a serious attempt to make the story as logical as possible. Impossible or unlikely happenings are only accepted by the viewer if they're explained well and within a logical environment. Here both sides are cripple: things are not explained and the real world is not logical. The story can be scored with the most dramatic Champions League music, any empathy, sympathy, drama is absent.The animation is adequate, but the designs are often plain awful. Sometimes it looks more like a He-man Masters of the Universe-episode than something by Disney. I never have seen anyone with square fingertips, but here everybody has them.The characters are terribly cliché, with some racial and cultural stereotypes mentioned by other reviewers. The jokes are not funny.In the end it seems that there must have been an idea somewhere but it went from hand to hand and everybody had a say, and decisions were made and in the end... Not a lost empire, but a lost film.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
133,ddangtruong23,Disney's messy attempt to be more mature,5,6 January 2015,"The way I see it, this movie was Disney's answer to the successes of Dreamworks and Japanese anime in the beginning of the century. It was heavily action-oriented, has countless deaths (some was even pretty gruesome), and no singing scenes. The animation style was also drastically changed, resulted in something that look a lot more like Dreamworks' than Disney's. Kudos to them for trying, but it seems like they didn't really know what they wanted.First and foremost, the characters are very cliché, and just not fleshed out enough. Most of them have very little screen time. The movie tries to give them some back-stories but those are all pretty ordinary, and provide nothing to the characters. The worst of them is, sadly, the main character himself. The guy started off as a clumsy and weak nerd, who couldn't even drive a truck, but somehow by the third act, he's already become an awesome fighting leader who bosses professional mercenaries around. There's no real character development. All of their conflicts are quickly solved with a few lines. The story is even worse. It's predictable and confusing at the same time. By the first look, you'll already know which characters are going to be the villains, and which are going to turn to the main character's side. The movie also pays zero interest in actual science. Atlantis with Asian architecture? Atlanteans speaking modern French and English? Submarine with steam engine? And worst of all, the mythology of the movie is never fully explained and seems to contradict itself a lot. It seems like the writers just couldn't decide what this movie was. One moment it was all goofy with wacky characters, and the next it was all serious with deaths and explosions everywhere. Then right after those deaths, it turns back to childish slapstick humor like nothing happened. As a result, the movie seriously lacks emotions and motivations.Had this been an usual children-friendly movie from Disney, I may have led it slides, but as an attempt to be more mature, this movie failed horribly. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it has pretty awesome visual style. If you want to see a mature and action-oriented Disney animated movie, I'd recommend Treasure Planet instead of this.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

It has a plot, it has well written, strong, well defined characters. It's not only good, it's fantastic! I couldn't believe how good it was. I kept thinking, ""This can't be Disney, it's far too good."" (And that era of Disney was a bit weak). I started looking at our crew, Milo, a lanky, tousle-haired, braces wearing leader, who isn't a leader, but, is. We have a tough guy mercenary with a questionable moral compass, there's a young female mechanic, who knows more about engines than other people have forgotten. We have a kindly, super intelligent doctor (who is black). We have a female warrior type who brooks no nonsense and could easily (and happily) tie you in knots. They have a nicely steam-punk looking transport. And it is just....amazing. Then, as the closing credits started to run, I saw the name of one of the writers. Joss Whedon. Well. That explains a lot.

137,moonlightreflections,Hey! Mole's a stinker!,4,20 June 2001,"Perhaps nothing is as exciting as the discovery of a new world populated by unique, affable peoples whose cultures are so drastically simpler than ours that they are capable of enjoying the sensuous pleasures of everyday life without a moment's hesitation.  Disney has a notoriety for creating such worlds, and with the exception of their last couple years' work, they have always been some of the most apt at the trade.Unfortunately, Disney also has a notoriety for blatantly plagiarizing from eastern works, and ""Atlantis"" is no exception.  It's easy enough finding comparisons out there without the aid of a well-learned fan, so it should suffice to say that the creators of this movie probably spent a couple weeks watching anime and playing RPGs, and then took all the ideas they must have thought looked cool and applied them to this movie without understanding the principles that made them work in the first place.The primary story is simple enough:  Milo Thatch, a bookworm who aspires to discover the city of Atlantis, heads out on his search after being handed a journal with vital clues in regards to the lost city's whereabouts.  Along the way he befriends any crew member he can find who is not an Anglo-Saxon American, and falls madly in love with the Atlantean princess once he reaches the city.  After a day's stay, the crew commander, along with his storm troopers (all as non-descript as the 30-some-odd white crew members whom Milo never befriended), busts out some heavy-fire artillery and proceeds to steal the Atlanteans' primary life-source, his sole purpose being a meager profit and a place in the history books.The political undertones of ""Atlantis"" remind me of a Japanese RPG by the name of ""Xenogears.""  Just as from the work that inspired it, it featured innumerable religious references that were so preposterously out of place that you couldn't help but laugh whenever the narrative made a religious comment, for it seemed as though the writer had simply opened up to a random page of the Bible for inspiration whenever he was stuck.  Though ""Atlantis"" contains very few religious references, the political ones appear to fit this vein;  you'd be hard-pressed to find a more inappropriate format for a writer to express his other-worldly understanding of the problems that plague society.If this were the only problem with ""Atlantis,"" it'd be a forgivable trait that probably wouldn't hinder the overall presentation.  But since Disney decided to take a more adventurous approach that includes more action than comedy, the movie also fails in a narrative sense.  Everything, from Milo's inspiration, to the journey to Atlantis, to the discovery of its culture, is handled with such breakneck speed that it's impossible to associate with either the characters or the situations.Obviously, you're going to have to retain a young child's interest when it comes to this type of movie, so a quick narrative is an almost unavoidable device.  But it's not acceptable to include every social stereotype that a child has grown up with in this country as a substitute for characterization.  Ignoring the fact that it's historically inaccurate considering the time period that the story transpires in to begin with, the stereotypes that are presented are a bad enough influence to be considered ""politically incorrect.""The paradoxical, or even hypocritical nature of this movie will no doubt sail over the target audience's head.  So I'm certainly going to sleep soundly knowing that the leading child's entertainment company is continuing the American government's plot to brainwash its populace into becoming blubbering idiots.  If you like to live in a bucket, it's perfectly fine by me.The only thing bothering me is this: what the hell is Mole?  Knowing the profoundly insightful messages that are to be found in ""Atlantis,"" it's possibly something much more idiotic than a commentary on the French's hygiene habits.4/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The plot was so stop-and-go in the pacing that I nearly got whiplash: no gradual build-up to the climax, just short action-packed sequences interspersed along an otherwise long and uninteresting journey.There were also a couple of story elements that were entirely too contrived and inconsistent, but I risk spoiling the story for those who have not seen the film yet.Overall, I enjoyed it.

Some of the characters are a little 2 dimensional and unlikeable, but only because they are given few chances to develop. Although there are supposed to be 13 main characters only 2 are really focused on (Milo and Princess Kida) The companies animation skills improve with each film and this is no exception to the rule. Some of the computer animation is very impressive and make the action sequences that much better. However nice animation doesn't make up for a dull script and lifeless characters. spoilers below.Now is it me or are Disney trying to come up with more Gruesome ways for the baddies to die. Usually it involves falling off a building into the cloud never to be seen again. Recently I have seen plummeting into flame, being hung (if accidentally) and in this case being frozen and then chopped into a thousand pieces by spinning blades.Lets hope the next ""Classic"" recaptures some of the flair and originality of early and mid-nineties Disney films 6/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
147,Yodelling Llama,Don't Think,5,7 July 2001,I enjoyed watching this Disney offering.  I only grew angry at some of the subtleties after *thinking* about it afterward (e.g. our young linguist somehow learned to *speak* Atlantean from *text*).  So don't make the same mistake: remember that Atlantis is a *summer* movie; it isn't designed to withstand much thought.,Atlantis - The Lost Empire

I think they picked the perfect actors for the voices of these characters. It had a good plot and a pretty damn good twist.

Some scenescaused me to leave my mouth dropped to the floor.  I could haveused less of the supporting characters, which in a short moviethey did not have enough time to give them justice.  They had fartoo much content alone with the story line then having to shove insub-plots of small supporting characters.  A great movie for kids,adults and families.

My sons loved every minute of this film, and I have to admit that I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie. There are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right. This should go down as one of the Disney ""classics"" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
152,a-73103,So underrated,10,5 January 2021,"Idk why this has such a low score. Kinda is awesome, milo is cute, Audrey is sassy, cookie super funny, sweet is sweet, the only character I don't like is the mole guy and, obviously, the antagonist. For a Disney movie, a very small amount of it is cringy or overly sappy. The plot happens really fast, which I think was fitting. Also made some great comments on how museums often unfairly steal things. Also it was hilarious! I feel like sometimes Disney does this thing where they make jokes in the most intense parts which makes it seem more like a kids movie. This one didn't do that. They joked in all the appropriate parts, the intense scenes were very intense. I think the main thing I liked about this was that it seemed less like something I only really enjoy when I am 5. There were things like guns, explosions, the risk of an entire civilization dying. Sure, some of the plot twists were expected, when has a Disney twist not been expected? All in all I think this is my favorite Disney movie.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
153,davehbrown,"Good looking, but too predictable.",4,3 September 2002,"This was a very unimpressive offering from Disney.Although it may sound laughable to criticize a summer animated release from Disney for being too predictable and paint-by-the-numbers, that's pretty much my biggest problem with this movie. It's basically the same story that was told in 1999 with Tarzan. Just replace Tarzan with Kida, Jane with Milo, and the muscled, evil hunter with the muscled, evil submarine captain. This wouldn't have been too bad, but unlike Tarzan, Atlantis doesn't seem to have any interest in making you care about the characters or what happens to them. Also, the scope of Atlantis is too large. There are many characters and everything that happens to them is really too ambitious to fit in 90 minutes. The result is that the movie races as fast as it can through each predictable plot point so it can tie everything up nice and neat at the end.I do have a couple of good things to say about it. The animation was great. Very detailed, colorful, and imaginative. An excellent blend of CGI and traditional cel animation. It's everything I've come to expect visually in a Disney motion picture.And I found a bit of the story enjoyable as well, mostly in the first 30 minutes. I remember there were several quick visual jokes that I laughed at.Too bad that it had to fall off so badly in the last hour.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

155,glasscase-25919,A big part of my childhood,10,24 April 2017,"Throughout my life, I grew up watching a ton of Disney films both live action and animated and this film was to me awesome since I enjoy adventure films and I also enjoy the fact that Michael J. Fox is in this film. I know not a lot of people talk about it now a days, but I still think about it even though it's been years since this was released in theaters. The thing that really made me fascinated about it was seeing the trailer as a kid back in the early 2000s and the premise itself looked interesting. When I finally saw it in the theater at age 10 in 2001, I had a blast seeing it with my father, nanny (I think she went as well, but I don't recall), and my two sisters.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The characters don't sing, the focus was only on the journey to the Atlantean civilization going through the caves, the course of events is fun and interesting. And so probably some people thought that Disney movies are only about singing characters, and that's not true.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
157,darse,"trite, jerky, annoying",2,18 June 2001,"Since the next three showings of ""Tomb Raider"" were all sold out, we settled for this piece of drivel instead.  ""Atlantis"" is the same kind of low-quality unintelligent money grab that Disney has become famous for in the Eisner era.  I've been scammed out of $25, and I'm going to file a complaint.The first distraction is the jerky movement of the characters, and poor animation throughout.  In the classic Walt Disney features, like ""Jungle Book"", the characters flow in a smooth and natural manner, and as much effort and detail are put into the background as the foreground.  Walt must be spinning in his grave over these cheap factory knock-offs.But the lousy animation is nothing compared to the stultifyingly stupid writing.  I understand that it is being written for a general audience, and that they aim for a four-year-old mentality.  That doesn't mean you have to insult the audience's intelligence.  Children respond better to thoughtful stories than stupid ones.  Unfortunately, Disney has decided that it is too much bother to produce quality rather than crap, and that the consumer will gladly accept getting the shaft yet again.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
158,asticht-2,Disney can do better,3,9 August 2005,"I took my children to see this movie because it is a Disney movie and the focus for their movies is kids right? Not only did this movie not capture my children's attention, but it also felt like a movie where the script was intended for live action but animation seemed the cheaper way to go. The storyline was weak, the characterizations of many of the characters were hard to understand ie: the mole, and the humor which typically is the part of Disney movies that makes them enjoyable for adults wasn't funny. Although the animation in much of the movie was beautiful, and the action sequences were unbelievable in their realism, the animation could not overcome the fact that the story wasn't there. James Garners character as the snake in the grass commander of the expedition was square, and was like watching a Dr. Jekyl into Mr. Hyde transformation. All in all, I feel that Disney tried to make a motion picture where they target an older audience at the expense of their traditional primary audience. Parents should be warned that younger children may not enjoy this movie as it does not follow the traditional Walt Disney style of summer releases. My young daughter whom I have taken to many movies asked me twenty minutes into a 75 minute affair if we could go home. I noticed many children in the audience acting similarly. I have loved Disney movies since I was a child and this is the first one that I can honestly say really stinks.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
159,shinylantern,A divisive mix of disappointment and wonderment.,5,19 August 2021,"It's easy to get swept up in the grandeur of this movie. From the unique and memorable character designs to the jaw-dropping visuals and mesmerizing music, the entire presentation screams ""Blockbuster Epic!""It's such a shame it was made by the same studio that is responsible for the cringily tone-confused ""Hunchback of Notre Dame."" Not that that isn't an overall good movie, but if ""Hunchback"" was a slight failure at an attempt for Disney to draw in an older audience, ""Atlantis"" is an even greater failure that almost makes the viewer weep from how wasted so much of its potential is.Weep in remorse, that is, after initially weeping from the sheer spectacle, heart, and passion of the film.Every frame of artwork and so much dialogue is a testament to how much the animators and writers put into ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire."" While a lot of the humor falls entirely flat thanks to the stereotypical Disney comic relief character, pretty much every character is incredibly funny and likable, owing in part to some brilliantly improvised dialogue--particularly on the part of Don Novello as Vincenzo ""Vinny"" and Michael J. Fox as Milo--and the fantastic chemistry the main cast has together. The animation can only be described as astounding, blending 2D and CG 3D animation so flawlessly that it is almost impossible to tell where one method begins or ends, complimented by a sweeping musical score by James Newton Howard that is not given nearly enough recognition.It isn't too difficult for a multi-billion dollar company like Disney to get the technical aspects of a film right by any means, so of course the area where the film mostly flops is its story. Despite its grand presentation and slightly darker, more ""adult"" tone, ""Atlantis"" only clocks in at the standard family film runtime of an hour and a half, mixing quiet, reflective character-building moments with blistering action that at times comes out of nowhere when the audience would have loved to have spent more time in a particular set piece just to have a look around or use it to build up the importance of the adventure while developing the characters. Speaking of the action, the body count feels unnecessarily high. It's almost as if Disney thought that in order for the movie to be more ""adult,"" they needed to kill as many people as possible when, realistically, more of them would have made it through the journey. And the villain is unfortunately the very first in a long line of Disney Twist Villains (TM), where a likable character is suddenly revealed to be evil and has all of the motivations of a Saturday morning cartoon baddie. There are lots of obvious plot holes that I marvel at how the writers actually thought they made sense. Related to this, which turns out to be a huge plot point, a cool factoid is that the same guy who created the Klingon language created the Atlantean language, blending a whole bunch of different syntaxes together to make a complete and fascinating fictional language that could exist in the real world in a different time.On a side note, I should mention how underappreciated Princess Kida is. She isn't the stereotypical Damsel in Distress like most Disney princesses, yet she isn't an insufferably tough and manly Mary Sue like too many heroines are nowadays. She's mildly ditzy and naive, as she is totally inexperienced with the outside world, and her chemistry with Milo is genuinely endearing, even if their relationship is kind of rushed. But at least they don't actually fall in love right away. It only took you seventy years, Disney!Also, she is by far the most beautiful Disney princess. From the moment she first lifts her mask to reveal her face (and smoking hot bod!) the audience can immediately grasp her personality by her curious expression radiating from her blue . . . Huge . . . Expressive . . . Eyes. . . .I can imagine Kida was a lot of young teenage boys first waifu.In closing, I definitely recommend watching ""Atlantis"" if you want a sharp dose of early-2000's nostalgia and you're willing to turn your brain off to ignore giant plot holes and appreciate a cast of fun characters and a majorly imaginative adventure. Out of all Disney animated movies, this one certainly deserves a remake, whether it be animated (IN 2D, GOT IT, DISNEY???) or a live action blockbuster, preferably as a series of films to properly explore the many incredible concepts and characters that were never quite properly fleshed out.Do it for Kida! <3.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

""Atlantis,"" does just this.  Its not as visually stunning as ""Shrek,"" but it doesn't have to be.  ""Atlantis,"" is a story about friendship, love, discovery, and taming that ""young boy adventure.""  With all those themes, you don't need fancy computer graphics.  This movies delivers with humor and intrigue.  While you're watching, you feel for the characters, and you really want them to complete the mission.Now, I'll answer that ominous question:  Which is better, ""Shrek,"" or ""Atlantis""?  Well, I can tell you that ""Atlantis,"" is more complex, and has deeper themes of emotion.  However, ""Shrek,"" is truly ground breaking in graphics and story line.  I give them both the same grade of A+, however, ""Shrek,"" wins by a tiny bit. Don't let that opinion persuade you not to see ""Atlantis.""

164,amabiliscasa,A departure from classic Disney,6,5 January 2005,"That hits a few speed bumps and shows it, but is well worth watching. Atlantis - The Lost Empire is an imaginative and engaging film about an unfunded linguist who seeks to find the lost city of Atlantis. He is turned down by conventional establishments (i.e. the stuffy museum where he works in the boiler room) and is given his chance by eccentric millionaire Preston Whitmore and a team of explorers. It suffices to say that Milo and company, after much adventure and mishap, discover Atlantis, which is vastly different from anything they expected, and Milo gets more than he expected out of his adventure. I would give this film 6 out of 10 stars - its not great Disney, but it's certainly better than some of the other crap out there. I watch it whenever it comes on TV, which is a good indication of an enjoyable film, I think. It isn't really a film for children. The plot is often hard to follow, and the action may be too intense for very little ones. There is a very sweet romance which grows out of a friendship, so there isn't any kissy kissy to make ""blech"" faces at. The characters are human and funny, and there are some pretty good one liners in here. Worth the time, if you like adventure and comedy.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
165,tonymph,Atlantis: The Lost Classic,8,29 March 2014,"I am absolutely astounded at the negative reviews for this film, both from IMDb and from the critics.I grew up watching this film as a child, and I remember loving just about every second of it. Seeing it again at an older age, it holds up just as well if not better than I remember it. Some Disney films I feel are given too harsh of treatment from critics and I feel should be held in higher regard (The Lion King II: Simba's Pride for example), but if I had to pick the absolute most underrated film (animated or not) to ever come from them, I would have to choose Atlantis: The Lost Empire as one of my top picks.To begin with, the animation is some of the best I've ever seen from Disney to date. The visuals feel so incredibly huge, they look realistic, they move fluently, the textures are amazingly detailed: One could be completely blown away by this just from the visuals alone. The scenes in the Crystal Chamber, the submarine, the fight/action sequences, they're incredible. The designs are something I can commend too. The look and feel of the city of Atlantis is very creative and awesome to look at, and I always got the sense that this was a real lost, living and breathing culture with a coherent society.Something I feel this film gets especially right is the characters: Good lord, every single one of them is memorable. Milo, Kida, Sweet, Cookie, Mr. Whitmore, the King, Audrey, I could go on for a while. Each and every one of them have their own personality traits and all have their individual moments, plus no two are alike. Each and every one of them are likable and I found myself satisfied with each and every one of them. The demolition guy I especially enjoyed. Almost every line he said was hilarious, and his personality is hugely enjoyable too.Speaking of that, that's another thing about this film: Its humor. I can't even begin to count how many moments and lines made me laugh. The writing for the humor is some of the funniest I've seen or heard, and almost every one of the protagonists has a funny line or two at some point. I think the most humorous scene for me were the ones with the demolition guy and Mole. Dear lord are they hysterical both together and on their own.But on the opposite end of the spectrum, I absolutely love the drama that's conveyed throughout the movie. The story is very well written and it held my attention through to the end. It's definitely one of the most serious animated Disney films to date, and the first of its kind to not have any musical songs. Personally, I loved this touch. While I absolutely adore the songs in many other animated films, here I think it was more appropriate not to have any. The actions scenes are spectacular, especially with the final one that takes place. The violence and the gritty realism of everything makes the physics of its world seem closer to that of the real world (Or live action if you will), and I like things like that in animated films. Many characters die (I won't dare say who or why), a lot of depression sinks in for them, they use real guns, the violence is rather high, and I think it's great. (I'm not one of those people who always drool over action and special effects like with Michael Bay films, but I digress). The physics feel real and nothing is particularly cartoony in it, so I'm very glad Disney knows that kids can still handle serious drama like that.And one other thing: The musical score by James Newton Howard is absolutely nothing short of fantastic. It could be because I'm a total sucker for chorus and choir music in movies, but the score here felt completely appropriate for the Atlantian setting. It has quite an Indonesian feel to it at times, while at other moments it has more of a Lord of the Rings influence to it, like when there's the loud choir going off in one of the major sequences. Every track has something to it, and it is one of the many Disney soundtracks I dearly wish I could buy to enjoy its full glory.In conclusion, Atlantis: The Lost Empire is hands down for me the second most underrated animated film to ever come from Walt Disney Animation Studios (Coming in VERY closely behind The Lion King II: Simba's Pride). To reiterate what I said before, I am flabbergasted at the negative critic reviews for it, plus the rating here of 6.7 when that's more than a whole point lower than it should be. Atlantis: The Lost Empire is an absolute gem in the Disney lineup easily comparable to that of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and so forth. It's always one of the first films I think of when I hear someone say they should revive 2D animation for all of these reasons and more.This truly is a lost classic.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
166,igotranover,"This is so bad, I cried.",2,1 July 2005,"I walked into a packed cinema screening when I was younger, expecting a good Disney family film. I walked out vomiting my own intestines. This is the second worst Disney movie ever. Lilo and Stitch topped this one's awful display with the worst story ever.Atlantis: The Lost Empire doesn't just urinate on all of the Disney films before it, it spits on your face and takes your money in like a vacuum. The story consists of an array of plot holes and terrible twists and turns, the characters are disgusting and the script is passable.The Disney corporation is bringing out some absolutely awful films to date, such as: Hunchback of Notre Damne 2, Bedauty and the Beast 3 and Cinderella 2! But, when they try to actually come up with an original movie, they come out with disgraces like Atlantis and Lilo and Stitch.So what's going on with Disney? Absolute bullshit. The old classics like Snow White, Little Mermaid, oh I could go on; changed animated movies forever. But this new stuff mutates cartoon movies into inbred sequels with foamy mouths and a brain the size of a pea.This has to stop, I've got to admit.

Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to character's behaviors. Today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them 'daydream' about the events. That's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago.

169,debbiedowner661,"Great animation, but boo to everything else",5,27 January 2002,"This movie just struck me as odd.  I can't really pinpoint the audience Disney was looking for here.  Because with Disney, one has come to expect a certain spark and liveliness (along with top-notch animation) that is able to capture the attention of even the most inattentive four year-old. Atlantis, however, was made with a more adult audience in mind.  I honestly can't see a child of less than 10 REALLY enjoying this movie.  If a parent bought this for their son or daughter, I can't see the kid wanting to watch it more than a few times.  There just isn't much to rewatch except for the animation.  And unfortunately, just because something LOOKS good doesn't mean it IS good.The main character was a cliché and the usually boisterous Disney supporting cast was lackluster on this outing.  Milo's little band of compadres are unfriendly and unwelcoming.  Their quirks seem to be tacked-on in order to appeal to children, but I personally didn't see how they were all that charming or funny.In addition, the storyline itself would be extremely dull if it didn't have such exquisite animation.  The dialogue wasn't particularly clever, and there were several large gaps/holes in the plotline.  Thus, I can't see the movie being all that appealing to anyone over 14.I see Atlantis as like a ""mature Disney"" version of Final Fantasy.

171,louisa_animaniac,"Man, what a let down!",2,9 February 2002,"Was ""Atlantis"" beautiful to look at?  Yes, it was absolutely breathtaking.  And the music? Just gorgeous.  How about the story structure and the character development........ oh my. Ouch.  The sad truth is that this visually beautiful movie could have been wonderful! It had so much potential! Shall we inspect the problems? (Don't worry, I have at least ONE good thing to say, so bear with me, Atlantis fans)Character Development:  Very poor.  The characters (as cute as some of them are) come across as very shallow and cardboard.  Not a good thing. It's hard to care about what happens to characters like these.
-Pacing: The pace of the movie was jarring.  The first part of the movie seems so rushed as if the directors just wanted to get it out of the way and get to the ""good"" stuff.  They introduce the spectacularly rendered submarine.... and that's all they do with it. Give it a 5 minute long intro so we can gaze on it with reverence... and then it's out.  No more use of it in the story at all! Well THAT was a waste of time!  The timing throughout the movie was just ALL wrong.-Plot:  Nice idea... now if only they could have gone about it in a way that wasn't predictable.  You shouldn't be one step ahead of the movie. There's a big problem when you are!Okay, now onto the ONE compliment I have, and please note that it IS on the visual aspects of the movie..... possible SPOILER ALERT!!The scene where Princess Kida becomes one with the Heart of Atlantis blew my mind. It was SO DARN COOL!  And when she spoke in the creepy voice, it gave me the chills.  WOWIE! Good job on that, fellas.
END SPOILER!!I wanna conclude by saying that if it takes more than 7 people to write the script.... especially one like this... something is VERY WRONG.Oh, and by the way, see ""The Emperor's New Groove"".

I thought it was a wonderful film, the animation was fantastic and blended well with the CGI (something I feel didn't go so well in things like Aladdin) but I'd give even more praise to the characters, who have a depth which makes the film a bit more mature for today's children and helps break the arguably antiquated Disney mould. Disney are trying something new, and succeeding.One thing that sat uneasily with me though, and don't get me wrong, I loved the film, but I got the feeling those responsible had perhaps seen Titan A.E., just as those responsible for The Lion King might just have heard of Kimba, The White Lion. It's by no means a carbon copy, but for one thing it seemed like Gune had more or less been lifted out of Titan A.E. and kitted out as ""Mole"" Hmm... perhaps I'm imagining it.Anyway, it's a great Disney film in my opinion, I especially liked the little details, like the two Coelocanths swimming around in a tank as the mission falls together.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Beware that this is not a children's movie at all, just your run of the mill adventure film, just animated. To be fair, I only watched half of it, maybe it gets better at the end.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
176,DeepGrey,"Not the best animated movie, rent Titan A.E. instead",6,17 June 2001,"I went to see Atlantis with great expectations, remembering such Disney and Toy Story 2. However, I failed to get impressed. Of course, the animation is very   nice, even if I sometimes grew tired of ""Disney-style"" drawing. It is nice they   have a signature-style, yet I would love to see more variety. Anyway, back to Atlantis, I found the story to be way too sweet. It felt too   much Disney, even if we were spared from the tunes. It didn't have a strong   plot, it didn't build the tension, it was just simply flat.  As a bottom line, don't see it for 10$, maybe for 5$ at most. You'd be better to   rent Time Masters, Titan A. E. Or even Ghost in the Shell instead.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
177,Snufkin,First step in the right direction...,8,17 June 2001,"While much else has already been commented on, what is really noteworthy here is that Atlantis succeeds as an animated film for adults.  While there has been plenty here left for the little tykes (leave it to Disney to hedge their bets), it has been toned down from many of their other films where annoying side-kicks virtually up-end the show, stealing it from main characters and/or ruining the film with insipid musical numbers (no offense to musicals, but must they all be geared toward 6 year olds only?)  Atlantis totally avoids the problem and delivers an action packed science fiction tale.  All of this doesn't mean that Atlantis is a good film.  It has so many logistical faults that you eventually must give up and just enjoy it as a movie.  There are also problems with pacing--like so many other animated films, this needs another 10-30 minutes to fully explain the plot and give us a chance to actually enjoy a lot of the brilliant animation that is gone before the eye has really had a chance to register all that's happened.Putting the whole Nadia controversy aside (which now seems doubtful, though there is clearly plenty of anime inspiration), Atlantis shows Disney taking a step in the right direction...a direction that people might actually appreciate once it hits video since probably the worst movie of the summer, Tomb Raider, seems to have stolen center stage this weekend.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
178,MagnumPI,Well-animated and Politically Correct.,1,16 June 2001,"One of Disney's best animation flicks yet.  Maybe it's just me, but I could not fail to notice the political undertones.  Capitalism; baaad,  Military; baaad,  Guns; very, very baaad,  Mysterious blue lightening bolts that kill; okay.  Too bad Disney couldn't have cast George W.

181,marlex,Quite possibly the best Disney film yet!,10,16 June 2001,"When I first heard of Atlantis, I was thrilled. I saw the first teaser trailer on the net and I was hooked. But then I saw the Disney logo at the end and my heart sunk. No... This great movie was going to ruined by Disney. But the more teasers and trailers I saw, I had to admit that it still looked a great film. They did a good job with Lion King and Mulan, they could do it again... So I went. Now I have seen Disney's Atlantis and I can say they did two things with this film. First, they made me belive that somewhere inside Disney, there is a person with brain. Second, they made a movie that beat The Lion King as my favorite ""mainstream"" Disney cartoon. By mainstream I mean their big cartoon-of-the-year animated film (is, Aladdin, Mulan, Lion King, Little Mermain, not Toy Story, Little Mermain II, or 102 Dalmations). Atlantis is quite possibly the best thing they've ever put out. I mean, I loved this movie. I'm 20 years old, and I'm planning on going out tomorrow and buying the soundtrack (which I'll get to in a minute).First off, this isn't your older brother's Disney. Gone are the cheap animal sidekicks and spontaneous songs. Instead, we are given characters, while are funny, are real people whom we can like or hate, depending on which one. Now, I knew this was going to be something different when I saw a tiny thing at the end of one the trailers. It was something I have never before seen in a mainstream (see above for definition) Disney movie. PG!!! This movie is rated PG!! Mulan, with enormous battles was rated G! This is PG!! That opens a lot of door my friends. Believe you me. I would now spend a little time about the music. Like I said before there are no musical-esqe melodies here. In fact, there are no lyrics at all, if you don't count the chanting during several of the scenes. In fact, the music was incredible. I didn't realize at the time, but most of the trailer music is in the movie, and it gets a lot better than that too. Beautiful melodies, great action music, and eerie chants as well. I could feel the anime influence on this. And I can't say how great a thing this is. I hope this a sign of a new direction Disney made be heading. In closing I would to say that this is an excellent film that young children, teenagers, and more can go and enjoy this film.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
182,zaayrdragon,Not a bad 'kid flick' but not a great Disney film.,6,29 March 2004,"So what constitutes a great Disney film?  Well, slick animation, smooth transitions, beautiful and memorable music, and captivating characters. What did Atlantis lack?  Well, slick animation, smooth transitions, beautiful and memorable music, and captivating characters.But Atlantis isn't a bad 'kid flick' - it has just the right amounts of humour and action to keep any child entertained for the duration of the film.  Michael J. Fox does a fair turn as Milo, breathing enough life into what threatens to be a lifeless Nerd-type character.  Mix him up with a cast of caricatures... er, I mean, characters... and you have a good Saturday Morning formula for success.Which is probably why the sequel comes off feeling like the pilot for a Saturday Morning cartoon... but that's another review.The animation style of this movie is yet another step away from good Disney animation.  This fits into the pattern being established by Hercules, The Emperor's New Groove, and Tarzan.  But it's not BAD animation, exactly... just not the clean, classic style we associate with great Disney works such as Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, or the Lion King.  In fact, the much underrated Titan A.E. features more Disney-like animation (and a better plot)!Transitions in this film seem rushed and disjointed.  One scene jumps to the next with almost no transition whatsoever.  We're left with the impression that the events all happen over the course of a day or two.  It's almost laughable.While Atlantis does have a memorable soundtrack - at least, the key themes are melodramatic enough to stay with you - it isn't a Disney soundtrack. Gone are the inane bursts of song during various inopportune moments. Gone are cute diddies about exploration or life in a cave under the sea. Strangely, though, that turns out to be a GOOD point.As for the characters, in spite of some great acting attempts by some great folks, everyone in this film just comes off as a caricature of someone else. There's enough to pique your curiousity, but not enough for you to really develop a liking for ANY of these folks.  Good and evil are too ill-defined for most of Milo's crew, and even the Mole's few shining moments are weakened by a lack of character development.  Cut down the supporting cast by half, and you MIGHT have likable characters.  Instead, you come off liking Milo and despising most everyone else.Overall, this isn't a good Disney movie, but it's an OK kiddie show.  6/10 from me.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
183,stevenhallman16,My favourite animated movie.,10,27 July 2013,"I rated this a little higher than it deserves, mostly because this movie has been with me as long as I remember. I've seen it about 30 times since it first came out. So yes, I'm a little biased. Now that I'm older, I can look at this movie and notice things I never did before. Like the animation, for example. It's pretty good, as you would expect from the creator of the Hellboy comics. The culture created for the Atlanteans is amazing, and even has a language (which I may or may not have tried to learn a few times). I don't get why people don't like this movie. Sure, it's a step away from the the regular Disney formula, but that's not a bad thing.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Then I liked very much films, but I could not understand the plots of many (likely most) of them. I completely got the sense of this. I got the plot, the themes, the character's feelings, the emotions. And I still feel like that now. It is really one of the greatest films ever, as I see it: great animation, great plot, great character, great dialogues, great visual effwcts and photography. I just love it very, very much.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
185,MerianMoriarty,"Dark, but beautiful...a visual masterpiece.",9,25 March 2002,"Visually a stunning film.  Quite beautiful in its premise and in its artificial architecture.  I was quite partial to the scene in which Kida fused with the Heart of Atlantis, and the faces of the kings fell as she walked forward.A good deal of dark humor, and not a sign of that odd let's-all-break-into-song atmosphere.  An old-fashioned but revolutionary animation style.  A very seamless fusion of CG/traditional animation, unlike efforts in ""Hercules"" and its ilk.  Don't let the dark aspects of this film turn you away; it is still Disney, still teaches life lessons, and is still, in its heart, maudlin as any Disney flick before it.A better plot than other recent Disney films, and a fresher look  as well. ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" may be dark...but it is also beautiful; overall a visual masterpiece.  Kudos to Disney.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The direction, the voice acting, the superb design work, and thrilling script make this one of Diseny's best.This is one I took my oldest son to the theater to see and now watch it with my youngest.One of the great things about the film is how end action keeps building, introducing new and dangerous elements instead of wrapping it up quick and dirty. That is what good screen writing is about.I love period pieces and in animation, the possibilities are endless. This team took that opportunity and ran with it. My hats off to them!I'll save a more detailed review about the sequel for that film's page, but to make it fast, that too was very, very enjoyable.Would love to have seen another film this series!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Excellent character chemistry, Incredible characters! The Explosion guy was just awesome, Mole made me laugh out loud, and the cook was so cool! The ONLY negative point about this film was the fact that the road to Atlantis should've been much longer. It was all rushed, with scenes immediately dissolving away. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the main focus of the film should be the expedition, not the events AFTER reaching the lost empire.The team itself, with the cook, doctor, the machinist, the explosion specialist, the crazy geologist and the ultimately sarcastic announcer was just remarkable and great, I don't think I'll ever forget them.Summary: Thank you Disney (For the first time!)",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
188,justicesegrest,Great movie,10,23 May 2017,"Atlantis the lost empire is personally one of my favorite Disney movies, because of the way it sets itself apart from the other Disney movies. Most Disney movies are rather light hearted, and don't have too much heavy material. Though Atlantis the lost empire is appropriate for all ages, it still stands out as more 'edgy' than most other Disney productions, containing death scenes, intense battle sequences, and mild violence.The characters are also pretty likable. The movie follows a young man by the name of Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox, and his expedition to find the empire of Atlantis. He has a lot of personality, and his character is very well animated. He meets several other characters on his journey, and they devealope as the story goes on.In conclusion, Atlantis, the list empire is a must-see, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of animation, or adventure.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
189,Dave-214,Take the kids and go have some fun with this one!,8,20 July 2001,"Disney animators have had fun in creating this movie and their pride shows through bright and clear.  The kids are going to love this one for the action and adventure.  The adults will enjoy the ""20,000 Leagues Beneath The Sea"" and ""Journey to The Center of The Earth"" comparisons that the Disney animators have made throughout the picture.  The animation is ""Disney Perfect"" as is expected and the characters are enjoyable.This one has some scary spots for the really small kids  so parents be ready if you take children under age 5, you may have some reassuring to do quickly.Overall  Kids of all ages (A.K.A.  adults and children) should go and see this movie.

190,HinxLinx,Disney: The Declining Empire,2,24 June 2001,"I heard a really bad rumor before I went in to the theater to watch Disney¡¦s Atlantis. But I still went watch it because I want to see it for myself. What I heard is Disney ripped off a Japanese animate called ¡§Nadia - The secret of blue water"" (Gainax - 1991).Let¡¦s put it aside from our head thinking the fact that whether Disney did it or not, it¡¦s true that the quality of Disney animation is declining. You don¡¦t agree with me? Fine. Remember the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King? Even Hercules, or Tarzan. Think of those animations for a moment, please. Compare Atlantis to those 90¡¦s Disney classics you will understand what I mean by losing quality on their works.Let¡¦s talk about character art. Comparing Milo (the main character), Audrey (the mechanic girl) or Helga (the blond sexy lady), you will find them don¡¦t really match. It seems like characters from different animation. I am not saying they don¡¦t match in the story but the way animators drew them. On the other hand, don¡¦t you think the mask princess Kida wears and how she moves are quite similar to Princess Mononoke?Then how about the story? To me the story seems a bit fast pace. Within 30 minutes of the movie, we already watch the crew found Atlantis. There¡¦s nothing wrong with a fast pace, but a good story requires time to built up the relationship between characters. In this case, that¡¦s why I don¡¦t feel the friendship between the crew and Milo is convincing.Over all, the movie was entertaining, but Atlantis can never be an animated classic as what Disney used to produce. It¡¦s sad that with strong influence from Japanese animation, Disney seems losing the direction of how to make a ¡§Disney style¡¨ animation.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

192,Alncr,Sorely underrated for an actual Classic Animated Action Disney film,10,24 March 2019,"Like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' animated film, it's almost a crime that this movie has also Never gotten the praise and acknowledgement it truly deserves for about 2 decades now.The fact that these are actually Disney made films is a very good thing considering that instead of them being the very typical and kid-friendly ""happily ever after fairy tales and dreams always come true"" stuff Disney is known for, this movie is persistently entertaining with fairly intense action scenes (Especially for a 2D animated film), and some dark and many perilous themes to complete it.I remember seeing this film in theaters on the same year of its release back in summer of '01, and the sound effects and the score being very good and unexpectedly emotional at times.
But the plot is also quite engaging and definitely kept me plugged in all the way through. And even as an adult now, I still enjoy watching this Disney movie a lot and would never turn it down because it's truly a Hollywood animation classic.As a film in general despite it being about a commonly used myth topic, this one should never (with a capital N), be judged by its cover, poster or production studio.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
193,lgsmith007,Good not Great,7,5 February 2002,"An OK movie from Disney.  Seemed to lack the usual magical scenes that most Disney movies have.  Animation was up to Disney standards.

194,Evil_Hobbit,Atlantis the Island in the Sea,7,6 May 2005,"The first time I saw this film was on the airplane. At this flight it bored me to dead. Considering the fact that almost every film is boring on an airplane and the fact that a friend of mine kept telling me this really was a good movie made me watch it again.I absolutely love the work of Hayao Miyazaki. It is obvious that his work inspired this film a lot, and I mean A LOT. Thank god the filmmakers admitted this for else it would be a shameless rip from Laputa: Castle in the Sky. There are some major element from this film that has been slightly altered and placed in this movie.Fortunately the film is not a rip from Castle in the Sky. It has his own story, his own characters and movements. The first half of the film you can barely notice the influence. But it is the climax of the film that has the most resemblance. The crystals, the stone guards etc.So to wrap it up, this is a good film. If you loved Castle in the Sky you will probably like this one to and if you loved this one you will adore Castle. Like Castle it does not have the compelling story or highly developed characters, it is a simple film, with a simple script. Good direction, stunning animation and a great musical score and that makes it a fun ride. 7/10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Atlantis is a bit edgy in this sense, but there are a few noticeable inconsistencies throughout the entirety of film. The characters are quite interesting and likable, however there's no development present. They're on screen for periods of time and do their thing and that's it. I really enjoy the animation. For instance, the character designs are quite nice and there is a lot of detail put into the background settings of each scene. The action sequences are exciting and fun.

I don't think so--at least not for thinking adults.This script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie, that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore. The ""crack staff"" of many older adventure movies has been done well before, (think _The Dirty Dozen_) but _Atlantis_ represents one of the worse films in that motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best. An MD/Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons, if we have not at least seen these before, we have seen mix-and-match quirks before. The story about how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing.Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox, has any depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee, as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head.And while the characters were thin at best, the best part about _Atlantis_ was the voice talent. Perhaps Milo's depth is no thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type, Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the high point. I'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory. Additionally, Don Novello as the demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also notable for one or two well-done, funny lines--but I've always liked Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. Also well done was the Computer Animation. The BACKGROUND animation, that is. The character animation has not been this bad for Disney since the minimalism that drove Don Bluth out the door. The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress.The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously lacks that.I cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense. To add to that, the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness.** SPOILERS **1. Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the ""Coast of Ireland"" should read the ""Coast of Iceland"", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as ""Ireland"", and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the icier island Greenland. By making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated ""letter"", the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had, made the inscription far less trustworthy.2. The Shepard's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying ""in the King's eye"". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the heck did anybody get by the Leviathan. So how could it know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantian? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in Atlantian. So it's got to be some sort automatic writing. Since noone left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained within the movie: Milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the movie.3. The Atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to converse in Europe, anymore than Romans would understand that hard ""c""s or their day became French ""ch""s (pronounced like ""sh""s, no less!)4. Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read, yet now are unable to read what they used to, or operate similar machinery. 5. The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy.5. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in--But ANY OF IT **HARDLY** qualifies her father for Deification!! Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence. Killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress (not a lot killed here, but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody, if they weren't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots weren't there to protect them. A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! 6. Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or ""phases of the sun"" diagram.7. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still does not explain what how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand, even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"". Unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing.8. The crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the ""change of heart"" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with.9. Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. It's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas.
10. The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. The technology is superior to ours, and definitely to early 20th-century. In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into hyperdrive. ** END SPOILERS **Perhaps, the Lost World plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. And pulp stories is part of the ""crap they can't sell adults anymore"", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness.4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps ever lower.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

So how could it know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantian?Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in Atlantian. So it's got to be some sort automatic writing. Since no-one left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained within the movie: Milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the movie.The Atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to converse in Europe, anymore than Romans would understand that hard ""c""s or their day became French ""ch""s (pronounced like ""sh""s, no less!)Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read, yet now are unable to read what they used to, or operate similar machinery.The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy.Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in--But ANY OF IT **HARDLY** qualifies her father for Deification!! Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence. Killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress (not a lot killed here, but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody, if they weren't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots weren't there to protect them.A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis!Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or ""phases of the sun"" diagram.If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand, even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"". Unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing.The crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the ""change of heart"" falls flat. It was a change, and needed to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with.Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. It's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas.The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. The technology is superior to ours, and definitely to early 20th-century. In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into hyperdrive.** END SPOILERS **Perhaps, the Lost World plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. And pulp stories is part of the ""crap they can't sell adults anymore"", anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness.4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps ever lower.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
198,airfigaro,Finally Disney Releases a decent film!,8,26 June 2001,"To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment. The Film had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to.  It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical.  I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan.  Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.One disappointment was the animation.  With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little.  There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
199,lcassidy78,"Great animation, lousy writing",3,20 June 2002,"The animation in this movie was spectacular. I wish I could say the same for the writing. The animation seamlessly blended computer animation with the more traditional methods and created a beautiful new world. The writing was lackluster and filled with cliche after cliche. It's too bad Disney doesn't seem to take as much care with their plotting as they did in the early 90's. After their biggest triumph (commercially and critically, The Lion King is by far the best recent Disney movie), they seem to have taken a big downhill slide. In trying to compete with the eye candy of the totally computer animated movies, they've forgotten that the story is just as important (if not more) than the animation. Atlantis clearly reflects this. I gave this movie a 3 out of 10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

201,All_Seeing_I,"An underrated, entertaining adventure story",7,19 April 2013,"This pastiche of turn of the century adventure stories (specifically inspired by Jules Verne, apparently) has been mostly forgotten over the years, and overall doesn't seem to have a fantastic reputation. I would argue that this is not deserved. That doesn't mean this film is some kind of hidden gem. It is relatively formulaic (though that's to be expected, somewhat, considering what it's trying to do) and doesn't feature much depth of character. But I can forgive that in an adolescent adventure story if there is wit, pace, ambiance, humour, and spirit - which this film has in droves...and which is what I think the 12 year old boys this movie was obviously marketed to are really looking for.I certainly was when I first saw it (at that age), and at that time it didn't disappoint. Viewing it through that lens, it still doesn't today. There is great imagination behind the portrayal of the Atlantean culture, some really comic characters (somewhat surprisingly, I thought all of them were unique and interesting to some degree - with the possible exception of the somewhat bland love interest, the antagonists, and the clichéd king of Atlantis), and a pace that never lets up.If the film were too meandering or bloated, it would have fallen apart, but an awareness of what it wants to be (a straightforward adventure story) helps it succeed. The basic beats of the story are competent to prevent it from losing momentum, and since it never imagines it is a ""great work of cinematic art"", it never bothers bogging us down in poorly thought out character development (a not- uncommon flaw in bloated special effects movies, whose pretentiousness sometimes keeps them from being what would have been a decently entertaining action film...at half the length).The visuals, however, are probably the shining star of this movie. Reportedly there was a lot of work put into developing the Atlantean culture; a whole language was even constructed (courtesy of Mark Okrand, who is famous for inventing the Klingon language used in the Star Trek universe), and the work shows. A lot of the appeal of fantasy movies is their ambiance, and this film gets that.Sure, the film is no masterpiece, but that was less because of what it did wrong than the fact it didn't really go the extra mile character wise. The movie is competent, and has genuinely entertaining elements beyond the basic spine of the story, and for that I award it 7 stars out of ten.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
202,bobbyishilarious,I Loved This Movie!,10,16 March 2015,"I loved this movie! I am and have always been a very big fan of Disney (at least of their animated movies, I'm not such a big fan of a lot of their TV shows both animated or especially live action, or of their live action movies, or straight to DVD stuff). Of all the Disney movies that were animated and which were actually in theaters though Atlantis: The Lost Empire is probably my favorite of all time. I give it 10 out of 10.I know it is not the most popular choice, Beauty and the Beast and Lion King and older ones like Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are, but of my personal picks it is number one even though it's not as popular.It's a great story, a great adventure with a lot of good humor and interest for adults as well, and the voices are all top notch. I love Jim Varney!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
203,anguscastle,One of the strongest from Disney's experimental era,7,24 March 2016,"Whether you love or hate this film, no one can deny the hard work put into it. For starters, it inspired a new language - Atlantean. The animation is also very good (and one of Disney's last to be animated in its classic form before the horrible Chicken Little came along).The characters certainly are easy to engage with, especially the main protagonist Milo who is adorkable and a hard worker. Atlantis TLE is also one of the most original story lines Disney has ever come up with for a while too. It's also very much action-packed and has some humour to.A couple of criticisms I have is that I felt a little bit bored at times so I guess the plot isn't completely solid and the comedy side of it came off as quite gimmicky sometimes (mostly derived by Mole's character). Overall, Atlantis is not the greatest Disney film ever but it certainly is worth a watch and greatly under appreciated.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
204,Mifune77,"Brilliant as a genre movie, but it lacks some depth",9,30 August 2001,"When I saw ""Atlantis"" on this years Fantasy Film Fest in Frankfurt, I was quite amazed. Not because I saw a film I didn't expect that good, no, because the audience, who mostly hate animation at large and Disney especially, began muttering, but then followed the film and mostly liked it at the end!The first I heard was that no songs would be in the film, many people therefore thought it to be something very new for Disney. I didn't think so. The film has no songs, instead it has a very powerful score by James Newton Howard. But if you see the last Disneys, you could feel this shift would come sooner or later. Now here we are: Disney made a genre film, a classic adventure movie, without killing the own genre ""disney film"" they established over the last years, but giving it something more.The background is very detailed. As expected, the best was the smooth animation. The characters seemed to be out of one comic book from the 20s to 40s. But what was rather unexpected (mostly because of the both directors Kirk Wise and Gary Troudsdale, who made the enchanting ""Beauty and the Beast"") was the slim and brilliant action, it used. When I saw the picture, it took some time for me, to get into the film. The story is not that good and the characters a bit to schematic, but when the action started all was forgotten. If you go to see the film, pay some attention the the montage of those sequences!Another very interesting aspect was the end. The film has a climax you wouldn't see in most todays films. The use of pathos and the choir on the soundtrack, when the characters become to know their true identity resembles adventure movies of the 40s --and along with those some of the most entertaining blockbusters, as the Indiana Jones-series or ""The Mask of Zorro"". The directors also knew how to use this climax to lead into the last big action scene (as Roger Ebert pointed out, an outstanding one!).I liked the film as a genre movie, not as a Disney picture. Don't get me wrong, I like animation an love some of the Disneys as much as the films of my personal animation-hero Hayao Miyazaki (whos ""Laputa-Castle in the Sky"" can be felt through in some scenes of ""Atlantis""). But this film didn't work that well on this dineyesque level. The comic relieve characters where not that enchanting, the moral of the story not the center of the film. In fact, ""Atlantis"" seems to have no big moral at all! But as one, who was very depressed after seeing most ""event movies"" of the year, I was glad to have one action adventure to entertain me. This one was ""Atlantis"". I suggest you to see it, if you like such films. Yes, it is animated, but that's just the way it was made. Don't fall in this trap! See the film, enjoy it, as I did!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
205,mtt,A TOTAL RIP-OFF!!!,1,17 June 2001,"If you think Atlantis is a Star Wars rip-off, I kindly urge you to get a hold of LAPUTA.  LAPUTA - a 1986 Miyazaki production, one of my all time favorite anime, has more depth and (definitely) more originality than Disney's recent rip-off Atlantis (after The Lion King).  It was not only a disappointment for me, also an embarrassment to see Disney shamelessly promote this newest release.  After the English-dubbed version video release of Tonari no Totoro and Majo no takkyubin; and the theatrical release of Princess Mononoke (all three from Miyazaki), I was wondering why LAPUTA wasn't being released on video/theater yet.  It's all clear to me now - it's all part of a Disney master plan to blind audiences from the original!  I hate to see Disney stoop that low.On a side note, does anyone else see the similarity between Princess Mononoke and the final piece in Fantasia 2000??  Is it just me, or does that look like another Disney RIP-OFF?  Talk about originality!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
206,Zazie,Unforgivable plot-holes make beautiful movie hard to watch,4,7 July 2001,"I went in really expecting to enjoy Atlantis.  The scenery and the music didn't disappoint me, but there are so many giant plot holes that are so large they prevented me from suspending my disbelief.I'm a veteran science-fiction fan, and I understand that lots of little inconsistencies or inaccuracies need to be overlooked in order for a good story to be told.

I thought it would be like every other Disney movie I'd seen: an overly-gorgeous ""princess"" would be in danger, or someone close to her would, and it was up to the handsome young ""prince to save the day. I was pleasantly surprised. The hero was instead a clumsy nerd who managed to save an entire civilization AND get the girl, a tribal-style woman who could fight for herself. Another thing that won me over was that there was no major love scene. The two never got mushy, but instead had a strong bond that formed from helping one another. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a yearning for something different, non-traditional, and with a crud-load of explosions and action.It's also good to see a nerd get a tattoo.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

As an adult, I thought the non-musical format was a relief (another big Phil Collins or Elton John production and I am gonna puke!).  This was a beautifully animated adventure.  It shows how the Disney animators are willing to experiment and go beyond the 'kiddie cartoon formula'.  There should be more animated films for adults who enjoy then.  Sure, this movie borrowed from many genres - but which movies don't 'borrow' ideas, styles, etc.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
214,stellanoctis,This is the worst movie I've ever seen.,1,3 March 2002,"Disney's ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  Generally, the characters were stereotypes with no personalities.  The only character that was quasi-believable was Milo, until he transformed into a geeky yet butt-kicking version of Indiana Jones. This in itself made no sense.  The other beef I have with Milo is that he has incredibly bad English for a linguist.  Although I realize that the ""swim pretty good"" line was intended for his ""pretty girl"" line, might I mention that any English grammarian/linguist knows that he should instead say ""swim pretty well,"" since ""well"" is an adverb.The plot was entirely nonsensical and full of MacGuffins (Hitchcockian red herrings, only in ATLANTIS's case, without the Hickcockian flair).  The first half drags like no other.  Many of the elements, such as the ""life force,"" Atlantean motor vehicles, and floating crystal thingies were ripped off from Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki's films NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND  and LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY.  The script was poorly written and could not keep my attention.I would also like to comment that Disney was trying to play the field and make a movie for older children and adolescents.  The violence factor is huge and gratuitous in this film.  DO NOT LET CHILDREN WATCH ATLANTIS. Yet, even so, Disney marketed its film with ATLANTIS Happy Meals.  What's wrong with the world?Want to see a real animated movie?  Go watch PRINCESS MONONOKE.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Its amazing the amount of work put into this movie, although i do prefer films with more songs, than just an end title, this film is definately a great hit with me, and is a fantastic adventure based on a well known legend. i love it!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
216,Atlantima,Damn it's good!,10,20 September 2002,"This movie may resemble other movies, but it's the best Disney movie in years. They just took half the advertising that should have been used on it and stuck it on Lilo and Stitch which was just crappy. Do you know how much time they spent researching for this movie? At least 5 years! In this age of crude live action films (Austin Powers, Zoolander) and cartoons stretched into movies (The Grinch, The Rugrats Movie), Disney made an original story, animated it, and cast it with such big-name stars as Michael J Fox, Leonard Nimoy, and Cree Summer. Remember this: if a movie is animated, it most likely means that the production company thought it was worth it to pay scads of animators; if a movie is live action, it takes a lot less work.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
217,Rhade,No no no,3,23 September 2003,"Well, the first Disney movie I saw was 'Oliver & Company' of 1988. Since then I've seen several of them and the one that really caught me back in -91 and still has me was 'Beauty and the Beast'. Several of Disney's movies (Aladdin, the Jungle book...) give you all the basics for a good film, no matter if you're 6, 26 or 46. 'Atlantis: the lost Empire' in NOT one of them.The animation in itself is rather progressive and arty but an ill match with the concept of Disney's annual 'classic to be'. It's the same style in 'Tarzan', in which it worked better but the very cubist animation gets too much when the film is dark to such an extent. I never developed any feelings for the characters, nor the good ones or the bad once (most of the crew play both parts to an extent it seems) and the story itself could easily have been better done.This is the worst Disney film I've seen, spite the great way they show expressions and reactions on the characters faces, and it makes me long for either good old classics like 'Snow White' or brand new thrilling Japanese Anime.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

219,urobolusring,Jules Verne unleashed from his cage via splendid Disney animation,9,1 September 2012,"Disney is at its best when it is busy unshackling classic stories or mythologies with arresting animation, visual and musical pizazz, and perhaps most importantly well-crafted characters.'Atlantis' is Disney at its best, with its sights squarely on the mythos of Jules Verne's classics of high adventure--especially '10,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and 'Journey to the Center of the Earth'. The art and swashbuckling soundtrack allows his visions to truly stretch their wings and conjure up the 'sense of wonder' that made his stories so spell-binding to the people of his time.Disney took a few subtle risks in the movie's other departments. The humor, the drama and the main themes are weightier, more complex and overall more adult than usual; however, the quick-draw wit with references designed for older viewers is coupled with enough well-executed lowball humor to tickle younger funny bones. And it doesn't hurt that the movie packs enough tasteful rip-roaring action to engage anyone who loves the adrenaline kick of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or other white-knuckle classics.Luckily a lot of these strengths carry through on the shoulders of the characters, who are rounded and three-dimensional despite being quite numerous and imbued with the standard ostentatious multiculturalism: a tough-as-nails Latina with a heart of gold; an African-American doctor with a decorated military history; an Italian with a vaguely Russian accent ""busted out of a Turkish prison"" who wants to both open a flower shop and indulge his passion ""to just blow things up""; a tall, broad-shouldered, stiff-jawed American military officer/mercenary-for-hire who values wealth above all else; a blonde femme fatale ripped from classic US noir; a wrinkled, white-haired, disgruntled, chain-smoking and hilariously blunt radio operator who seems to have been recruited from Boston; and our hero, a lanky, awkward but courageous academic who mysteriously grows more buff as he approaches the inevitable encounter with his love interest, a classic Disney princess; the idea such a crew could co-exist with ease in 1914 is...well, quite unlikely without the 'Disney magic'.In the end, all these elements come together to make a Disney classic that, approached with an open mind, ranks high on the list of the studio's animated feats and finally does justice to the vibrant imaginary of Verne and the classic science fictional adventures which he both wrote and inspired.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
220,lithodoray2k,The search for Atlantis is one to repeat again and again,9,1 June 2005,"The movie ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to sit through ""The Jungle Book 2"" or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.The film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories. Films such as ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Monsters Inc."" all do the same, but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney. Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video, and are sequels to an existing successful film. The quality of those films is given way to the profitability. A new era started with ""Atlantis"" following it were ""Mulan"", ""Lilo & Stitch"", and most recently ""Open Range"". The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past.A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including that of young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C.. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis. This was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition, Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. She takes him to her employer, a Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather, and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything. The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch. The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience.The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation. The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images. A feat not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two. The characters are believably human. There are some nice chase type scenes, with lots of action going on. A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get.The creativity of the writers really shines through. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Believable, if by a younger audience, that magic really does exist. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way.Although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic. The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo's nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology. The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even holding roles in leadership. This is not a bad thing. It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to, rather than an all male cast.One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song, ever. A tradition that began with the first feature film, ""Snow White"", and carried on through to ""The Lion King"", almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs. This is great and all, what would the Seven Dwarfs be without ""Hi HO!""? After the millionth time through it'd almost be better without, but this one spares the parent. Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song. I for one am grateful.The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike. It is a film I am willing to watch again and again with my children.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

222,mathmage,An Overall Awesome Movie,9,2 April 2006,"I loved this movie overall. I found the plot entrancing and the characters funny as well as well played and thought out. All the way from the nerdy, glass wearing Milo, to the creepy, ""you don't want to know"" digger called Mole.And trust me, I've seen Castle in the Sky and Miyazaki is one of my favorite animators and artists. But I love it how they used some of their ideas in the movie. From the power source, the crystal and the giant rock protectors. But Atlantis has its own depth within it all. I don't see how you can say that the animation is BAD... I mean, if you say Atlantis' animation is bad, you're pretty much stating all of all of Disney movies' animation is bad. They have the classic hand drawn animations of Milo and the characters and the occasional computer graphics for the fish flying machines and things like that. In total, I think it makes a creative combination and unlike some movies, the computer graphics weren't overstated and obvious to point out.I think most people don't like this movie for the number of deaths that happen. Drowning, fiery explosions, etc. But quite frankly... what kind of little child will focus on that? I will admit, it isn't exactly the first choice for an ideal little children's movie, especially because of all the guns and fighting. and you CANNOT compare it to the Fox and the Hound. I mean the hound had to kill the fox... what kind of... anyway, that's not the movie I'm talking about...I also REALLY didn't mind the random songs that are usually in a Disney movie. I do love a lot of Disney classic songs, *hums hakuna matata* but sometimes, it's just kind of annoying for the adults. I liked the more action type movie, that was less ""Aww. Love. Let's all sing now!!"" but more gripping and leaving you on the edge of your seat, all intense. I personally enjoy watching the main fight scene over and over again. Partially due to all the funny lines...Which brings me to my next point. This movie was just hilarious. It had a lot of one liners, especially from Vinny, that I like to quote frequently. half of the time, this movie had be cracking up.So yeah, I think I got everything... Good animation, action, no songs, and hilarious. yep. I got it all.9.5/10 the -.5 is because of the character death. I agree there was a lot of it, but think about it. All of those people complaining about it... are you children? And if you were a child, then is that really the first thing your mind thinks of when you think of this movie? Jeez.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
223,dg1sek,No more Disney Spirit,5,15 December 2001,"Much too violent, much too much action, special effects,... This is no longer the good old Disney Spirit. I watched this film in ""Le Grand Rex"" in Paris with 1000 other spectators, a lot of kids in the audience. Almost never during the film the kids could laugh.Sad to see that such bad movies can come from studios which such good history.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
224,mushci,Not the best but a very good movie,8,15 June 2001,"I really enjoyed watching ""Atlantis"" even though I wouldn't qualify it as one of the best cartoon movies out there.First of all, I wasn't especially wowed by the animation.  I think that Disney could have definitely done a much better job with that.  The two biggest things, I think, were how the artists drew the fingers and the vistas.  Those were the two main things that could have been drawn better. Otherwise the art was pretty good.I really liked the character of Milo.  I totally got hooked to him as a character and would have totally bawled if he died or something.  This is natural because you want a very likeable hero in the story.  However, the development of the other characters did not go as well as that of Milo. The other characters seemed very 2D, but I thank Disney for leaving out the spunky sidekick and the smart-assed sidekick.  (but by the end of the movie I was getting really annoyed by that pesimistic-not-very-funny woman that always said ""were all gonna die."")  I also thought that they should have thought up a better evil than ""I'm doing it for the money"" kind of thing. That kind of plot is way to overused.However, the thing that made up for the lameness of the evil of the plot was the mythological part of the story.  It was very original and had many twists and new ideas that I would have never guessed.  I think that the mythological aspect of this movie was definitely what made it worth while.The last thing that I must give Disney kudos for is the wonderful pacing of the movie.  Nothing was overemphisized; everything was very consise and to the point and there wasn't too much focus on the romance.
Overall, I thought that Disney did a great job...especially since most of the movies that they have released in the last thirty some years have all been the same formula...guy and girl destined to be in love, cute little animal sidekicks, and so on.  This was a nice change for Disney, a good step for them, and I hope that they keep it up!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
225,greob,Terrible and boring,1,2 May 2020,"A very uninspired plot, boring from start to finish, very predictable and typical.
Lots of nonsensical scenes, poor design choices on the characters.
Animations are not that great, graphics are not impressive either, sometimes even ridiculous.
Voice acting is terrible for most characters, and often doesn't fit the pictures.
Poor attempt at humour, very cringy at times.
Not even entertaining for kids, let alone adults.
Probably one of the worst Disney animated movies sadly.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
226,Marcail,Spectacular break from Disney norm,10,15 June 2001,"As a long time fan of Disney, I naturally kept abreast of the news following this film.  Part of me cringed thinking such a break from Disney styling might hit as low as ""Emperor's New Groove.""I should have never feared.  The film is exotic, moving, and delightful. There is just enough humor to keep the movie going without delving into lunacy.  There are no musical outbursts, but they are not needed.  In fact, they would have detracted greatly from the film.Effects are, as they are meant to be, a tasty blend of computer and traditional animation. This allows warmth through the characters and a true texture to the technological wonders of Atlantis.While some scenes may prove overwhelming for very young viewers (under 8), this is a story everyone can enjoy.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
227,Tigrin,"A good movie, but a little extra work would have made it great.",9,21 June 2001,"Where to start.. well, I thought the storyline was good enough. To those who didn't know better, it seems entirely original. The variety in the characters and the personalities just add to the immensity of color in the film. The script was good, and I can find nothing wrong with that.The animation could have used some work. The characters moved too quickly, I thought - the characters seemed to race from one position to the next without really seeing the movement inbetween. The design was also a bit blocky and overall it just looked rushed and needed a little more work. Like I said, the color throughout the film was so lively and really made the filmOverall, it would have been an extradorinary film if Disney hadn't borrowed so much from certain things... won't get into that. If I hadn't known anything about the controversy, most likely I would have given it an A-",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
228,b-meakings,An excellent film. Grossly underrated.,9,27 May 2009,"I never paid much attention to this movie when I first heard of it, it seemed like yet another Disney flick that didn't quite make it. But I decided to watch it after reading a bit more and finding out that it didn't have singing, which I grew out of long ago. I absolutely loved this film!I think that one of the reasons the film didn't to too well was that it may have been a bit on the mature side and didn't appeal to young children, in that it wasn't the usual fuzzy cartoon they were expecting from Disney. The older people who would have appreciated this the most probably didn't bother because they assumed it was a typical Disney children's film like I did.The film is rather short, only one and a half hours, but it manages to pack in a solid adventure, great visuals and a wonderful, captivating musical score. The characters are voiced to perfection and every scene counts, there isn't a single moment where a scene feels like it's dragging on.All that makes it the more tragic that because this film didn't get the recognition it deserved, a half-arsed 'sequel' was made that pretty much buried a potentially great franchise.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
229,lentr,The bodies pile up...,5,7 July 2005,"In my opinion, this movie was actually pretty darned violent. Not in the sense of intense, scary scenes (LOTS of Disney movies can be pretty scary in their own ways), but in terms of sheer death and non-family friendly ideas. At the beginning we can assume several thousand people are wiped out by an arrogant king's use of a weapon of WAR. Who ever heard of war being a staple idea of how a conflict was caused in a Disney movie? And the Leviathan scene, where a giant swimming robot attacks the sub,while hardly scary at all,immediately destroys about four hundred people (we see several of them trapped to die by drowning as a flood control door is shut in front of them). And then you see the escape ships wiped out one by one by the creature's ""laser"" beams(""We're getting murdered out here!""), and a funeral scene for the dead. Then there's the part at the end where there's that big firefight between the evil humans and the normally noble-and-benevolent-but-pressed-into-violent-conflict-anyway Atlanteans. You see people enveloped by explosions and whatnot.Come on! How is this Disney, family friendly fare? Mass death and destruction wielded with almost scary casualness is not what I expect from a Disney movie. In the old days, most of the death was either shown to be tragic or unnecessary, or justified in the case of the villains. Now, we get this whole thing about ""Hey look kids. That guy just died. Ho hum. On to more special effects! W00t!"" Even I as a young adult am disturbed (just because I'm grown up doesn't mean I'll enjoy ""adult"" feature films) by this flagrant disregard for what Disney used to be. As well as this movie being just kinda bad to me overall makes my vote what it is. Along with the ""violence goes along with fun like best friends"" thing, there's an almost too-typical romance, overused special effects (the new computer smoothed models, while impressive, are just not as charming as the ""classic"" Disney characters), an odd, somewhat PC story (notice how they have to have every race imaginable displayed, giving several superfluous characters that don't seem to impact the story at all) that makes former comrades into faceless monsters, and I'm talking about the guys from the sub that didn't die, who suddenly aren't important and have sterile masks instead of faces that makes it okay to kill them all at the end, as well as the now over-used message that old, alien societies that are ""in touch with the world around them"" are always better and less ignorant than modern, European ""invaders."" We got enough of that in ""Pocahontas."" Ugh. Whatever happened to simple stories of friendship like in ""The Fox and the Hound?""",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

231,The-Phantom-Critic,Pure Crud,1,30 July 2005,"I am going to put this into one word: and that is crud. The movie is set to like what 1900? subs existed, but only in primitive form. Robots? what robots? there were no robots in the early 1900s. No Lasers either. Also, it would have been impossible to even go to a depth like that in a primitive sub of the day..... I will never see this again, although my little brother likes it. I cant stand Milo. or the whole team, because they all seem like they are going to make an enormous breakthrough in science. At the same time, the USA wasn't even wanting to explore, the world, why because we were just in a war with Spain, and that drained our money, big time.

232,lilydoublemmorris,"Not that bad, actually pretty good!",8,30 December 2014,"This film has a bad reputation. I know it didn't make a huge profit, people and critics didn't really like it- can I ask one question?WHY?This film is good! No, really, it's good! If you went to a Disney movie expecting it to change your life, then you shall be very disappointed. But if you just want entertainment, then- great. Let's do it.Good stuff: The lead characters are slight clichés, but they are acted well! The crew on the Ulysses are really well designed and acted. Also stereotypes, but they are sidekicks/supporting characters in a Disney film! What do you expect? I really like how they are all really distinctive in design, they all have their own personality and you get to hear a few life stories too. You get to hear some of their goals, and that's why the twist in the middle is not as bad as people say. It could have been done better, it wasn't pulled off amazingly, but contrary to popular belief, I say that it is not god-awful! It's fine! For example, you understand why some of them want the money from the crystal!Also, Helga Sinclair. I like the blurred morality she's given. Is she a heroine at the end? Or is she still a villain? What about when she shoots Rourke down at the end? Does that make her a heroine? Or is she still a villain, because she didn't do it for anyone else's good, she just did it to get revenge on Rourke. So.... I've been fighting with myself about it.And, this movie is really well animated. It's sort of comic-bookish, and it's different to the normal Disney animation. It's detailed, bold, beautiful, and in my opinion some of Disney's best.Now for the bad stuff: Introduction is a bit long. Would have liked to hear more from the Atlanteans. The whole twist, while not awful, isn't good. Though I liked the supporting crew, there were a few too many and they could have left out at least two of them to have a more focused aspect on the remaining ones. A few annoying plot holes.Basically, I'm not calling this a forgotten masterpiece. It isn't. But it does not deserve the scorn put upon it by critics and people. Because it's actually pretty good, the stakes are high, and you will be entertained.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Everything is related to Nadia. I personally also thought that the characters where underdeveloped, there was a plot, but the plot didn't hold too well. I think that the best way to make this a great movie, for it not to be even a movie. Make it was TV series like Nadia, and it would do alright. I often felt like the story was dragging, oh wait, it was. To me this story was an insult to us anime fans, and a futile attempt to take Hideaki Anno's second greatest masterpiece. This movie is not worth your time, since I wasted a total of 90 minutes watching crap, when I could have been writing. So, do not see this horrible, insulting, movie.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Rewatch it if you saw it before or watch it if you just discovered it.,8,26 November 2019,"I first watched it when I was a kid, and everytime I remember it exists I really get that thought of: ""I really need to watch it again, I remember it as a really good movie"" And it is, really out of what Disney animation studios used to make, much more adventurous and enigmatic and with more action than usual, formula that they would use again in the Treasure Planet movie, also a really good one (nostalgia hitting really hard).The argument at first seems kinda rushed, we come from a Milo that is looking desperately for someone to pay his research to, with the magic of the Deus Ex Machina, get with an almost complete submarine with a complete crew and a plan to reach Atlantis only waiting for Milo.
Then it gets at a better pace, with more information about Atlantis being given and more story background development, which continues almost up to the end of the movie, consistently feeding the curiosity of the spectator.
The artwork is something that really made me think: Am I really watching a Disney movie? Very beautiful, fascinating and somehow, mistifying. One of the strenghs of this movie.If you're going to watch it, get an hour and a half only for it and nothing else.

It's not Beauty and the Beast.  It's not Tarzan. The positives... It's not Lion King.  It's not Beauty and the beast.  It's not Tarzan. For starters the visuals of the movie blew me away.  The increased aspect ratio was a must for this action packed movie.  The animation was very fluid and visually stunning.  I quite frequently forgot that I was watching a ""cartoon"".  And the main reason for that is it didn't have the pranks normally associated with a cartoon.  No talking coffee pots or song numbers from a warthog. Did I mention how strong the action was?  I did a double bill today and also saw Tomb Raider.  If you want action?  Atlantis.  If you want excitement Atlantis.  If you want a movie that your 6 year old and your 15 year old will enjoy.

I kept wondering what new, unbelievable twist of the plot was going to come next.  I found the people animation to be disturbing.  It seemed too sylistic on some characters and too cutesy on others.  It didn't tie together at all.  For example, I didn't like all the angles used in Milo's and the commander's faces, and where was Helga's nose, anyway?  I like some of the vehicle animation, and the drawings of ruins and scenery were quite lovely.  Although I'm religiously liberal, I was really disturbed by all the metaphyiscal and crystal references.  Bunch of hooey, as far as I'm concerned.  And the plot didn't in any way prepare me for it or make me care to even want to believe it.  I thought it was a disappointing movie. Far inferior to Titan AE for example both in story and animation.  And take into account that it's a Disney film, I think it was a terrible failure.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

Kids like simplified cartoon, not the state of the art quality from Dreamworks.

239,Good Ol Buzz,Wow! What an epic canvas on which to paint an animated picture!,8,12 June 2001,"SPOILERS!!!!1914.  Europe is at war.  The U.S. is neutral, but selling arms to both sides of World War 1.Milo Thatch is a lowly caretaker in a museum.  He has an obsession with finding Atlantis, but the museum owners are, umm, less than impressed.  Then Milo is kidnapped by the lovely and dangerous Helga Sinclair to meet an eccentric zillionaire, Preston Whitmore.  Whitmore knew Milo's grandfather, Thaddeus Thatch, and presents Milo with the key to finding Atlantis:  an ancient book called ""The Shepherd's Journal.""  Whitmore sends Milo on a lavishly equipped expedition deep under the ocean to find Atlantis and its most fabulous treasure: the most powerful energy source in the world.This is an adult film.  Parents, be aware of sexual innuendo and accurate depictions of war violence.  The innuendo is subtle but there.  Adults will get a lot more out of this film than will children.The vistas are many and grand.  I wish the film were more--leisurely, so that our eyes could linger over the backgrounds.  Like the wonderful vistas shown in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""Disney is making ever greater strides in the seamless integration of traditional and digital animation.  Just the scene of the submarine gliding for the first time into the depths makes one gape in wonder at their mastery of technique.The mastery of the technique of character animation is foregone somewhat, in favor of some stylization.  We saw that before in a previous film the Paris Disney unit did: ""Hercules.""  The squared off fingertips were jarring in the liquid flow of face, gesture, figure and background.Disney cast the voices well.  Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair purrs dangerously: a perfect sonic villainess.  James Garner (Commander Lyle T. Rourke) puts real disarming down-home charm into his bad guy.  Michael J. Fox does great as Milo.  And Florence Stanley, who voices Wihelmina Bertha Packard, the radio operator, spits out her cigarette butts and sarcasm with just the right edge of resignation and bitterness.The greatest failure of the film is its reliance on the hoary cliche of the Evil White Businessman.  Commander Rourke would destroy untold people and an entire civilization just for the money.  Yes, in 1914 the U.S. was selling arms to both sides of WWI, but the movie makes no capital of this.  Disney even put into the dialogue the phrase ""(ad)venture capitalists.""  Please. The rest of the movie was so stunning and creative, they could have come up with a much more creative motivation for the bad guys.  And so hypocritical: Hollywood is the most capitalistic of American enterprises.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

241,Movie Miss,Amazing Atlantis a break from tradition,8,26 May 2001,"I was lucky enough to see this film at a special preview held at George Street Cinemas in Sydney. It is the story of young Milo Thatch (wonderfully voiced by Michael J. Fox), a likeable historian trying to get funding to search for the legendary city of Atlantis. The other characters are an odd mix of experienced adventurers, each bringing with them a specific skill or talent necessary to succeed on their journey.The mythical and mystical themes are strong throughout, and make for quite an unusual film. Yes, it is a Disney animated movie, but don't expect the characters to break out into song at every convenient moment and don't assume this is just another children's film. Much of the meaning behind many of the scenes will be lost on a younger audience.I found the plot to be very original, with frequent twists and turns that will have you bracing yourself in your seat. It is a fast-paced film with stunning animation sequences, packed with a dazzling display of colour and light, which present magnificently on the big screen.A must-see for any fantasy fan or Atlantis enthusiast that will not disappoint Disney lovers, though it is definitely a break from their traditional films.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

I entered the cinema expecting much - gorgeous images, terrific acting, ambient music and a grand sense of scale. Unfortunately, the movie has none of these. Admittedly, any movie based on the 'lost underwater civilisation' must be good, you would expect. However, instead of opting for Pixar's computer animation, Disney go for normal, 2D cartoony visuals. No, I have nothing against these, but in a movie of this sort, more is expected. The acting is wooden. well, the voices anyway. They are rather monotone, which detracts from the atmosphere. The music is beautiful - when you get to hear it. I think that in only two scenes do we hear music, and even those scenes were short. The scale is big, although the cartoony visuals shrink the sizes of the architecture.In conclusion, a good movie - atmospheric and on a grand scale - although hammy voice acting, cartoony visuals and a severe lack of music push it into mediocre.I give this movie 6/10.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

255,Hayato,A big leap for Disney...,9,26 June 2001,"Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied.  If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of wierd for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too).  As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblence of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc)...The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's 20k Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia).  As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses...As shown in the novel ""Lord of the Flies"", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence.  I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other ""INTELLIGENT"" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters).  As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me.  As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #1 best anime I ever watched even now today.  I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview.  But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis.  Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better.  Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The only disappointment, however, was that the movie had to end. Atlantis was enjoyable through every moment. From the adventure of an action flick, to the fantasy and mysticism captured in beloved past Disney films, it is an understatement to say that this is a success, it is also a beginning for Disney to regain itself if it chooses to continue on this path that does not cut corners and perfects every detail to ensure a fantastic and believable spectacle. The plot is well developed, the characters are lovable (and hateable) the scenery is beautiful, and the music, even without singing, is phenomenal.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
259,wesley-5,A jumbled politically correct mess. Disney's worst animated film in years,1,12 July 2001,"The directing team that brought us Beauty and the Beast as well as The Hunchback of Notre Dame took a serious step backwards with this awful picture. Simply put, this is Disney's worst animated theatrical release since Oliver and Company. Before you even ask me, yes, The Goofy Movie was better.Where this film fails is with the story. Can anyone explain to me where Atlantis came from? No? Neither did the makers of this picture. Or how does the power of the crystal actually provide electrical-type energy? Again, nothing is explained. All we see is a happy, little commune, that is partially destroyed. Then, we see them living years later...surviving with the power of a blue crystal. Yes, you heard correctly.Milo, the lead character is voiced by Michael J Fox who does a good job. James Garner seems to be enjoying his over the top villain. The rest of the cast is shoved down our throats with the exception of Don ""Dr Guido"" Sarducci as an explosives expert. Here the PCism goes too far. It is 1913 and we are told they have hired the ""best of the best"" including an African-American physician and a Latino female mechanic that looks like a badly drawn Rosie Perez. For a minute I thought I was looking at the Clinton cabinet.Then we have the power of the crystal, providing ""life"" to every inhabitant of Atlantis. Alas, we have our new age lifestyle, showing us how utopian we can be. Throw in the fact that they have had flying vehicles for thousands of years. By this time I had already guessed this was a dud.Very little storyline. Weak characters who you don't care about. Silly contraptions. Loads of plot holes. In short, nothing makes sense, no character is worthy of being cared for, and we can all guess the ending. A real snow-job on Disney's part. I want my money back!!!",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

261,djmike-tjg,A new genre for Disney that actually works,10,3 February 2002,"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""Atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of ""The Little Mermaid"" et al.So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's ""Titanic"". Both films feature a boat in some manner.And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichéd Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting. By film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, ""The Little Mermaid"" (A good thing).You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. Correct. You have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. So what does it rely on? Clichés, and lots of them. Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale  need I go on?I don't know why this got to anyone  I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. Alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.But in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent ""Titan A.E."" down. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous Disney outing. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, ""Nadia"", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. Having not seen this anime, I can't comment.With picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended. To me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it. If you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. Heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (*cough*Hercules*cough*).This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

They're all unique and well written in my opinion, plus I love their designs, their all so...attractive.Animation: its so smooth, like, smooth. Everything flows really well and the expressions are fun too. Sometimes I like to look at characters who are more in the back or just not talking, like listening. I like to see how their faces react to what the speaking person is saying.Voice acting: every one of the cast members did a wonderful job, they really bring out already great characters.Dialogue: (I feel like this could fall under characters but I'll make it a separate category) i LOVE the dialogue, everyday i am so tempted to quote any line from this movie. I think the comedy is really clever and well timed.And last but not least, soundtrack: AHHHHHKSJJSHHJSHJBJH I LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK!!!! James Newton Howard did an amazing job in my opinion. I remember when I first watched this movie, I always wanted to hear the swim scenes music, I just thought it sounded so....magical.

263,ascion,Like duck tales,7,20 December 2001,"This movie reminds me to duck tales, which I saw on TV as child: Nearly straight story line and clear personalized good/bad contrast. Disney's problem is that this picture is shown in the cinema and not on TV. A parallelism to this fact is the Star Trek series which moved to the 'big' screen in the late 70's. Fairly good TV stuff, but also as movie it affects just like a long  TV special. Sorry, Disney, but this new direction of making films doesn't fit to a claim to be a movie creator. Atlantis would be a good TV film, in the cinemas it is just a (average) film. I gave it 7 stars.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

The plot was choppy and did not flow well at all, it took almost half the movie to introduce a villain, leaving an unsatisfying conclusion. However the extensive character development and very well written and very funny dialog made up for this. It is certainly worth a once over but subsequent viewings could be replaced with a read through of some of the best quotes. I wish there had been more plot and more development, but with a scope as big as Alantis, they did a pretty good job.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
265,Geoff Foxcroft,Where are all of the Atlantians?,5,20 February 2002,"This movie had so much promise and I have to say I'm disappointed in it. While the animation and colors are absolutely beautiful and really capture ones imagination, the plot and characters make you realize this is just another formula movie.  The plot borrows heavily from the Indiana Jones trilogy and many other classic adventure movies, but fails to turn them into anything original.  Every character in the movie is a standard cardboard cut out of characters we've seen a hundred times before: the nerdy hero who no one will listen to about Atlantis; the eccentric millionaire who finances the expedition; the rag-tag expedition crew who reminded me heavily of the marines in Aliens.  A few of the characters are fun, such as the demolition expert, but over all they are very much stock characters.Though the biggest problem I have with this movie is the lack of Atlantian characters!  Other than background characters, there are only two Atlantian characters who are involved in the plot: the king and his daughter, Kida. I feel the movie would've been much more interesting if the plot concentrated more on the Atlantian people and less on the crew of the expedition.Overall Atlantis is worth seeing for the beautiful artwork, but leaves you feeling cheated because of the unoriginal screenplay and lack of Atlantians.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
266,iki-vanha,I love this film,9,19 November 2007,"There's something in this film that makes it my all-time favorite. At least as an animated film. I love the characters, especially Kida. I think she's the most beautiful of all female Disney characters to date. Maybe I'm just a romantic but there's something special about the relationship between Kida and Milo. Something you won't see in any other Disney film.I know many people dislike this film and say that there's really nothing new about the story and the characters are too black and white. Despite some incorrect details and clumsiness, I think you can find many deeper meanings and thoughts when you really dive into it. I'm not going to specify what those are, I'll leave it for you to find. I, at least, found many of those while watching and afterward when thinking it through. Unlike any other Disney film, Atlantis won't open up so easily which only a good thing. Therefore it's more suitable for older viewers than for the smallest children. Although it depends on how you watch it. Since you can also watch it as a straight-forward cartoon, which it really isn't, at the end of the day.The imagery and scenery are astonishing. The score then is nothing extremely spectacular, yet fitting and at times very touching. I can recommend this film to everyone and if you've already seen it, watch it again then. Just remember to keep your eyes open and you might experience something that brings you to tears and makes you feel more aware of the world around you.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire

My kids loved it however in hindsight I wish I would have previewed it before showing it to my younger son.  He has Autism and some movies upset him.  This one was a bit much for him.  Being a Disney movie I thought it should be ok for him.  Wrong.  Next time I know better.Even though I didn't like the violence for the most part, I did really enjoy watching the movie.  Now a days it seems that the movies have to blow up and kill things to get your attention.  This one does that, a lot!  Kids seem to love it especially my boys.

It seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring.  If these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed.   This is simply an animated movie; nothing more.  If you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed.

I remember watching it when I was younger but not appreciating it the way I do now. The movie is about Milo, a linguist who hopes to finish his grandfathers work and find the lost city of Atlantis.The film is fun for kids but personally I think it's even more entreating for ages 10+. There's diversity and more action then you would see in a regular Disney animated film. And yes I did say that right, it's a Disney film. You won't hear one song in this movie but you don't need to with all of the beautiful work thats put on screen. The way the makers of this movie create the city of Atlantis is unique and beautiful to look at and you will be glued to the screen to learn more about this lost city. I would like to say that if you've watched this film in the past and you're debating on if you should have a re-watch, do it. Because for me this film was more enjoyable once I became an adult and the same can go for you. Lastly, this film is great for kids. It shows them a strong female lead and can really enrich their imagination. Don't miss out on this great and one of a kind movie. 10/10",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
273,jman383,Disney did their Homework!,10,26 January 2005,"Wow, is there really anything bad to say about this movie? I mean, Disney not only surprised me, but they impressed me beyond my wildest dreams. Disney used Plato's description of Atlantis to create a magical and breathtaking scenery, and although this movie is animated, it sure seems real. There are also little name droppings, (if you'll call them that) that caught my ear instantly. For example, one of the character's names is Vincenzo 'Vinny' Santorini, and it just so happens that Santorini is the name of the island that is believed to be Atlantis (located in the Mediterranean off the coast of Greece). Michael J. Fox does a spectacular job as the hopeful and witty Milo Thatch, and Cree Summer is the perfect Princess Kida. Together the two discover the ancient history of Atlantis and help save its people. Despite the fact this Disney Classic is not a musical; it's definitely spectacular, and one to remember. Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise sure read up on the lost continent, and possibly their only flaw was not revealing where the city was located. Atlantis the Lost Empire is a movie for the whole family, with humor for the kids, and the adults. As an Atlantis ""buff"", I give this movie two thumbs WAY UP!

274,cookieluv246,such an undervalued film,8,15 March 2012,"The style and animation is amazing, and the characters and development is probably one of Disney's best. I even liked the villains, very realistic. One of the reasons it was devalued is probably because it was one of those Disney movies that wasn't really for kids. Like The HunchBack of Notre Dam and Pocahontas. The other reason being it was fairly long for a Disney movie. (1 hour and 35 minutes!) A lot of things could go past kids, the same thing could happen for the movie nine. Even if it was still G/PG rated.I wish Disney would make more cartoon films like this for an older crowd. Even knowing it wouldn't be as profitable, it would be very much appreciated. Even if you are a cash cow Disney, you are still loved and respected by many.

But it is not. The jokes, the story are rather similar to Japanese anime's style. Also, the graphical design is quite similar. I personally prefer animes, I think there are much more ideas in their stories than in ""regular western"" cartoons. Atlantis did not fit in the category they said it would be in. Nor has any ""cool"" 3D graphics, what are so much in fashion nowadays. For example, Monster Inc. was a big success, but I think it was rather boring. Not much new ideas and simple story. In the contrary Atlantis has a very good story with a little Indiana Jones feeling. The betrayal of Commander Rurke surprised even me. The characters - by the way - are well formed.

278,jayfoshag,A Really Great Movie!,10,22 July 2013,"I read quite a few of the reviews of Atlantis: The Lost Empire prior to writing my own. I have to say that there are pros and cons I can completely understand. I absolutely love this movie. To date, it is my all time favorite Disney flick. Admittedly, I am a huge fan of Atlantis folklore, so I suppose I am partially biased, however I felt Disney really did the legend credit with this film. I thought the animation was well done, albeit very different than what Disney has done previously. Some reviews compare it to Japanese anime which I can definitely see. This does not take away from the film in the slightest though, considering the sweeping landscape views are incredible. I will admit that many of the characters are predictable and cliché. Although,considering the serious overtone's of this film, the characters add a certain level of humor that truly keeps it rooted in Disney fashion.There are a couple of issues I take with Atlantis, the first being that they turned the legend into something of a magical story. Now, this is not uncommon with Disney movies. Many of the tales that Disney has retold are done with a certain level of creative license. I completely understand this method, since the story has to be entertaining. If the Atlantean Empire really existed, I don't think anyone would expect that the citizens would still be alive thousands of years later. This does add to the appeal of the film. However, I do take issue with some plot elements that went completely unexplained, i.e. the Shepard's Journal. Where did it come from?! How did the tales within it become known?! I am perfectly fine with the existence of the journal, but I really would like to know more of the background. Another issue I take is the fact that Disney wrote the Atlantean's as having a tropical, almost ""rain forest"" aspect. I have studied the Atlantis legend for years, and there has never been an indication that the people of Atlantis were a jungle dwelling people. The legend is based in the Mediterranean world, with the possibility of extending into the Atlantic Ocean. Certainly not a tropical environment. Couple that with the fact that Disney asserts the lost city's location is near Iceland, which makes the tropical idea even more absurd. The final issue I take is the idea that Disney created a magical power source for Atlantis. I understand this works for the premise that SOMETHING needed to keep these people alive. However, (and again I refer back to the writings of the legend) there has never been any indication that Atlantis was so technologically advanced even our own modern inventions would be dwarfed. Advanced for their time? Absolutely. Advanced as far as civilization is concerned? Not in the slightest. Overall, I thought the movie was very well put together. The problems I have are minor and really don't take anything away from the story that Disney is trying to tell with this film. Perhaps it's slightly inaccurate, but most Disney films are for the sake of the audience. I consistently watch this movie over and over because I think they really did a great job.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
279,sharon-gregory888,"Intelligent, Adventurous, and Original",9,26 September 2016,"This film mixes gorgeous animation, an intriguing journey and fascinating characters, resulting in a truly underrated work of art.Set in the early 20th Century, the film stars Michael J. Fox as Milo Thatch, a young linguist who's been delegated to the boiler-room. He's bright-eyed and idealistic, and not given much respect from the academic community. That is, until he's recruited by an eccentric millionaire (played by a delightfully zesty John Mahoney) to join an expedition to find the lost Atlantis. The supporting cast is full of colourful characters: A fast-talking doctor, a sassy teenage mechanic, a bizarre little guy obsessed with dirt, and a demolitions expert who dreams of one day opening his very own florist shop. They're simply fun to be around, and they're given the chance to be themselves without being constricted by the needs of the plot.Marc Okrand (the creator of Star Trek's beloved Klingon language) was actually hired to create the Atlantean language featured in the film. Designed to be somewhat of a ""mother"" language, it takes influence from Indo-European roots. As such, the film is a treat for anyone who has studied linguistics or ancient history. One of the downsides of the film is that the villain is not very interesting or believable. There is very little motivation that drives the villain to do what they do -- at least not realistically. This is really the only reason I would not give this film a ten, as the villain's scheme hogs a good chunk of the climax, and the characterisation feels rather weak.The best part of this film is how much diversity and creativity goes into creating the world. A lot of effort went in to making the world seem real, and it shows. There are so many layers to the story, and every detail makes the story even more intriguing. The artwork is astonishingly gorgeous, and a stark reminder that 2D animation can sometimes be the most powerful and impacting choice. The detail, oh, wow, the detail that went into this film!Overall, it's an exciting and clever adventure, with memorable and fascinating characters. This is an underrated gem that really deserves more recognition for the fantastic work that went into it.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
280,simpsonsquire,My Favorite Animated Movie EVER,10,20 December 2014,"THIS MOVIE WAS A MIRACLE! Back then, Dinosaur was my favorite Disney movie until. Treasure Planet was my next favorite Disney movie until Atlantis called back to me in 2005. I don't know why but this movie seems to get attention a lot especially with the giant rusty Lambda that shows up on posters and some previews where it gets struck by lightning in the middle of the ocean during raging weather, and when it's on a rusty gate with writings on the wall, and water ripple lightings along with it's mysterious and deep dark ambiance. It's weird how I'm the only one who still notices the big Lambda.The idea of the seastorms and thunder sfx are really cool especially on the poster,viking prologue, and the beginning of the movie.The lightning mechanics were well done in the movie. The character development for Milo Thatch was GENIUS. Michael J. Fox did outstanding with his voice. It suited his personality traits so well.I can never get enough of him. Milo and Kida are my favorite Disney couples PERIOD. Blue is my favorite color and this happens to have a lot of blue on it. The fact that this movie was the very first Disney animated sci-fi movie to come out on June 15th a very interesting day to release a movie, made me wanna try and see it. And yet i'm really happy I did. Atlantis may not be may favorite Disney score but James Newton Howard made the music fit so well with the movie itself. Turning it normal life/epic Treasure Planet like music into Deuter like soundscapes music.I love Disney movies without songs. It's really interesting how they relate other B.C cultures and history to Atlantis and also when they used Plato's quote. I like it's action violence and also it's references like 2012, Day After Tomorrow, Avatar, Battleship, and Tron. 2012 and Day After Tomorrow because the natural disasters in the beginning. Avatar because of it's plot, Battleship because of the sci-fi technology and the leviathan scene, and Tron because of it's crystalized circuits on the statues and artistic cracks especially the stone effigies chanting around the Heart of Atlantis. Atlantis was a great Disney movie and it really deserves a lot of recognition, love, and gratitude. All thanks to the stupid box-office intake, Atlantis remains a *LOST*, underrated Disney movie along with the other Disney flops. .The world may not see it's true beauty, but I ON THE OTHER HAND DO! I never ever wanna hear or read the reviews because it's always raining on my parade. But I'm really happy that this movie was even created and I'm happy that I, my friends on deviantART, some of my subscriptions on YouTube, and other random fans can see the good in it to this very day on 2014. Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and James Newton Howard, you have made this awesome animated sci-fi movie possible for the first time I give this 10 out of 10. IF I COULD I'D GIVE THIS MOVIE A RATING OF GOLD. It's all thanks to Dinosaur VHS 2000. Even if the world was disappointed with this film including the box-office, technicality you guys have done a bang-up job and I'am very very proud that this film was even made. Long Live Λ T L Λ N T I S.;-D",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
281,rockblast919,Severely under-appreciated movie,10,18 October 2014,"Maybe it's because it doesn't follow the typical Disney formula, but this fun, interesting, and hits on some relevant points about dreams, ambitions, and human greed. If you're looking for a dashing prince to save a beautiful princess, go watch another movie. If you want a movie that is enjoyable to watch again and again, watch this one. While character development varies, it's not hard to like the characters. Even the antagonists are likable, in the way that only villains can be. The animation style is different than most other Disney films, and personally, I like it.This is one of those movies Disney has kind of swept under the rug and forgotten about, for reasons I don't understand. Kida is not featured with the rest of the Disney Princesses, (even though she is one of many who are actually princesses within their world of origin). This is another nuance I don't understand, and it, sadly, only serves to prove just how under-appreciated this movie is.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
282,graveschelsie,Love it!!,10,10 January 2015,"I love this movie it is one of my all time favorites and I watch it over and over again it is one of the best I have seen at the top of my favorite movie list I recommend all to watch it, it's filled with adventure, comedy, action, and romance and if you don't watch it you are missing it big time and I enjoyed watching it because it can entertain me for hours on end from all the action and new thing that I could learn and I also enjoyed it because of the characters stories about their past kept it interesting also so it was hard not to stop watching it. I wish they would make a third movie because then I can have a whole other adventure to explore.",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
283,pandafreaknanda,I loved the message behind the movie but it should never had being for kids.,10,1 July 2018,"It is a good movie, but is clear not for kids such dark and complex movie.Most of the characters´s personalities are more like a scale of gray instead of black and white! It is not clear who are the good guys or the bad guys making the movie heavy and tense .Children does not see the world with that complexity, for them a person can only bad or only good, not a ""mix of bag""! The hero is a clear male Cinderella, he is a really good character, honest person, alone in the world and working for others that does not appreciate his work and take advantage of him. Almost the whole movie the hero suffers emotional abuse.As a male Cinderella he also has a "" fairy godfather"" represented by an old rich man that just like magic gives him his dream : The jorney to Atlantis! The travel to Atlantis is just unnecessary, boring and it takes 25 minutes of the movie. For me Disney could had cut this part with a song exactly like Pocahontas when John Smith is traveling for the new world.Finally, they arrived to Atlantis and everything start to get illogical. The king/chief refuse the explorers spite of they have been trapped 8.000 years and its society is slowly getting amnesia and disappearing. There is no time to build up the Atlantis´s characters, because it is already the middle of the movie and the actions alredy started. Not only that, you get a unpleasant surprise to discover the characters are alive after 8.000 years of the flood! Meaning that Disney could had built them up at the beggining of the movie since they were going to be alive anyway.After a fast tour around Atlantis, the villans´s personalities show up their true nature that displays some characteristics of mental disosder such as Psychopathy or Narcisism, since they have a need for grandiosity, lack of empathy toward others and believe they are more important than everybody's else.The hero does not fight back over the sabotage and let be clear that the villans are just greedy, evil and selfish looking for fame, power and money over others misery. The cool thing is the hidden message, because the villans could not see the lost the eternal life because they were to greedy to see what was in front of them! At the end the hero reacts and with his incredible-genius intelligence he teaches how to pilot a ancient drone in such incredible 5 min. So the evilest villans are killed and everybody get what they want . The leftover crew did not have a real change of heart and contined greedy , not seeing they lost the eternal life.My conclusion of this movie is that I loved the message behind but it should never had being an animated fiction-action tale or for kids. Please remake this movie but this time not animated",Atlantis - The Lost Empire
