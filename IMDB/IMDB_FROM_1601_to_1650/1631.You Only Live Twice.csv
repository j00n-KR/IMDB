0,MartinHafer,"Behold,,,the ""comic book"" Bond!!!",7,23 March 2008,"By YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, James Bond no longer resembled the Ian Fleming character at all and of all the movies based on the Fleming novels, this one is the least like the book. In fact, other than being set in Japan and the title, the stories are nothing alike. The film is not at all realistic like the books and is a loud proclamation that that Bond is dead as it ushers in a ""comic book"" Bond who is all gadgets and plot holes. While I grudgingly will admit that the Roald Dahl (yes, THAT Dahl--the ""Willie Wonka"" guy) script is very exciting and high on the ""cool factor"", it is also silly and ridiculous throughout.Some of the cool gadgets are the helicopter with an electro-magnet to pick up the baddies in their car as well Bond's own mini-copter. Really exciting stuff--but also the stuff of serials and comics--as was the volcano lair of Blofeld. In fact, for the first time, a Bond villain more resembles Dr. Evil from AUSTIN POWERS than anything else!! While there were too many dumb gadgets and silliness to talk about them all, I'll mention a few that DIDN'T work and were just dumb. First, the death scene and Bond's subsequent launching out of a submarine was so dumb--way too dumb. But worst was towards the middle when the Japanese secret service had the ""brilliant"" idea of disguising Bond as a Japanese man!!! With Connery's nose, height and Scottish accent, this was about as believable as trying to convince everyone that Bill Cosby was Japanese!!! This idiocy sinks to a new low in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE--unfortunately, it only got worse in later films.Despite these many complaints, I still give the film a 7 because it's super-entertaining--more so than the previous film (THUNDERBALL). There are more thrills in this film than two Bond films--too bad the silly plot points weren't worked out--making the film seem like it could have used a good edit.",You Only Live Twice
1,TheLittleSongbird,"For me, this is one of the best of the series",10,18 August 2010,"My vote for the best Sean Connery Bond film goes to Goldfinger, which is also a contender for the best ever Bond too. You Only Live Twice is one of the best of the series for me. Why? Well the cinematography and locations once again are stunning and the music and theme song are really quite memorable. The pacing is brisk, the story is great and eventful and the script is suitably arch. Sean Connery is still his suave and charismatic self, while Donald Pleasance's Blofeld is one of the all-time great screen villains even though most of the time he is unseen. Add to that an explosive climax set in a secret base that is definitive and forever parodied and you have a truly great Bond entry. 10/10 Bethany Cox",You Only Live Twice
2,bkoganbing,Who's Out Capturing The Great Satellites Of Space,5,15 May 2009,"You Only Live Twice was the fifth James Bond film with Sean Connery and the basic premise of it kind of dismays me. After four films with Bond battling SPECTRE and foiling their evil plans, you would think that the powers would consider SPECTRE's involvement in any kind of dirty business on this globe.But that's not what happens here. SPECTRE under the leadership of Donald Pleasance as Ernest Stavro Blofeld has developed its own space technology, courtesy of Japanese industrialist Teru Shimada. They've set up shop on a small Japanese volcanic island inside the crater of a dead volcano that has a retractable dome covering like the Rogers Center in Toronto. And they're going about the business capturing US and Soviet satellites right out of orbit.The tone of this film is set in the beginning at that conference where the sides are accusing each other of heating up the Cold War. But Her Majesty's government says cool down boys, we're sending our best man in. My problem is that I can't believe the two superpowers wouldn't think that SPECTRE's involvement isn't a possibility all on their own.But with Sean Connery on the scene do you doubt that he will bring the truth out and the culprits to his own brand of Bondian justice?I've seen all the Connery Bond films and You Only Live Twice is the weakest of the bunch. Not to say it doesn't have its moments. My favorite is Connery in Little Nell, the airborne equivalent of his Ashton-Martin special car where Connery dispatches some SPECTRE sent helicopters. He also has a nice fight scene with Ronald Rich who is Pleasance's bodyguard. But next to Odd Job from Goldfinger, Rich was a ham and egger.You Only Live Twice has Connery collaborating with the Japanese Secret Service in the person of Tetsuro Tamba and a couple Oriental lovelies in Mie Hama and Akika Wakabayashi. He also gets to deal with Karin Dor, an assassin from SPECTRE all now Bond girls in good standing. Tamba has an army of Ninjas, as skilled with automatic weaponry as they are with martial arts. Had this film been done a few years later, I could have seen Bruce Lee collaborating with James Bond.Now that would really have been a memorable film.",You Only Live Twice
3,Leofwine_draca,Solid addition to the series with a strong and unique setting,7,6 December 2016,"Typical but effective Bond adventure, this time set in Japan to distinguish it from all the others. The movie benefits from the bizarre imagination of Roald Dahl (!) who was commissioned to write the script and who injects some of his own wit, style, and an ounce of darkness into the story. Otherwise, it's business as usual, with a fun helicopter battle, some tense outer-space action (spoilt by some very cheesy model effects - the special effects in the Bond series don't seem to have progressed at all since DR. NO, except by becoming a little tighter) and a good finale, in which Bond infiltrates the enemy base (inside a volcano) and comes face-to-face with his arch enemy Blofeld for the first time.At this point the series was less occupied with screen realism than with out-and-out in-your-face bravado and scenes bordering on the incredible - take that whole ""volcano base"" thing. Other highlights include Bond narrowly escaping from a plane taking a dive and the elaborate ploy at the beginning of the film to convince the world of his death. Would he really go to all that trouble? This is a fast-paced movie with lots of action and near-death scrapes for Bond - love that scene where he is nearly killed by a hidden assassin pouring poison down a thread to his mouth.Sean Connery returns as Bond and is looking a little older this time - although nowhere near as aged as he appeared in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and then NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN. The Japanese supporting cast is very good, especially the two love interests and Tetsuro Tamba as the secret agent ""Tiger"" Tanaka. Donald Pleasence appears briefly but memorably as the hideously scarred Blofeld, a role which was to be played by lots of people over the years. Series regulars Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, and Desmond Llewellyn also put in welcome appearances, along with Charles Gray as an ally. Gray returned as Blofeld in the next Connery Bond! Euro-starlet Karin Dor turns up briefly as a femme fatale. THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU fans may note cast members Tsai Chin and Burt Kwouk as minor villains - I guess they had the advantage of being in Britain when this film was made and so were cast easily.Strangely enough my favourite scene in this movie is one of the least spectacular - namely, the dockyard scene where Connery and his girlfriend are stalked by a gang of thugs. There's a fantastic aerial shot of the bad guys closing in on Connery which I really liked, and the choreography is really good here. The one-liners are cheesier than ever, and among the many (unintentionally) funny scenes is one where Connery has to go ""Japanese"" in order to disguise his true identity - a less Japanese-looking person I can't imagine! In all, good clean fun and a solid addition to the series, unique in setting if nothing else.",You Only Live Twice
4,SnoopyStyle,The Great Japanese Bond,8,13 December 2013,"This is the 5th Bond movie. SPECTRE is at it again. This time they are hijacking the spacecrafts of the two superpowers setting them up against each other. Sean Connery returns as James Bond. The great Donald Pleasence is the evil Blofeld with his white cat.This one takes place in the far East mostly in Japan. That's one of the charm in this one as it goes into a foreign culture more deeply than just simple postcard backdrop. The plot is as outlandish as ever with a volcano rocket base. It doesn't get crazier than that.Sadly, Sean Connery had enough with the character and the hype. After this, he quits the franchise for the first time. It's too bad because this is one of the cooler Bond movie with the Japanese influences and the ultra-cool rocket base. And there is nothing better than killing by piranha and ninjas.",You Only Live Twice
5,Horst_In_Translation,Bond in Japan - great entertainment for slightly under two hours,8,13 December 2014,"It has been almost 50 years now since ""You Only Live Twice"" was released. This was Sean Connery's fifth Bond movie since 1962 and the final one before his two comebacks. It's directed by Lewis Gilbert, not too known by many, but he directed Michael Caine to two Academy Award nominations and directed also two Roger Moore Bond movies in the late 1970s. The script comes from notable children's book author Roald Dahl. A completely different direction he takes here. Apart from the usual Bond movie actors/characters (Moneypenny funny as always wants to be told ""I love you"" by 007, Q and M only got very little screen time and felt on the forgettable side), the cast is fairly unknown here. Two young Japanese actresses play the Bond girls and Karen Dor is included for those who prefer their Bond girls good old Caucasian style. These three are also the only ones who are still alive from the main cast, apart from Connery of course. As for the two Japanese ones, it is a bit interesting here because the one who dies is the one who seems to be way more significant and gets more elaboration. The one Bond ends up with we know nothing about really except that she is the younger and maybe more beautiful from the two. The jokes about her ""pancake face"" (in German, not sure what term they went with in English) and how Bond is not amused at all when it comes to marrying her was one of the comedic highlights here. Thank God there were no gender equality warriors out there back then who could have found this sexist or demeaning.We are pretty lucky Bond did not really die the way we are shown very early in the film. Oh how much fun would we have missed in this movie and everything that came afterward! ""You Only Live Twice"" is probably one of the most macho Bond films. There's some pretty naughty stuff included here, although it is (as you know it from Bond movies) mostly through implications and bait. What is a bit uncommon is that Bond in the end here has a huge squad fighting with him which consists of kidnapped space craft pilots and ninja fighters. Another really interesting fact about this movie are the references to the age of space exploration in the 1960s. Two years after this film came out, Americans set foot on the moon for the first time. Apart from that, the Cold War topic works very well too with the political climate back in the day. It is also not 100% clear if Japan is the actual antagonist here. We have a character mention ""his government"" as the one that basically ordered the global escalation from Blofeld, but it could also be a randomly small country that he presides over. We do not find out. Also, as dangerous as Blofeld may be, it is unlikely he would really threaten the Japanese head of state by implying that he could get fed to the piranhas. These piranha scenes are also fairly memorable with several characters falling victim to them, even if we never see the fish's looks of course.This film gave us the real introduction of SPECTRE and Ernst Stavro Blofeld played by Donald Pleasence, an actor I really like and it's a bit of a pity he did not reprise his role in the following films. This is no criticism on the future Blofeld actors though, even if, especially in terms of looks and also the disfigured face, Pleasence may be my favorite Blofeld of all time. The way he turns his chair and is revealed is a highlight just like how he says the quote that ends up iconic enough to become the title of the movie. Blofeld also delivers the excellent quote that was used for the film's title. Seeing the ways in which Blofeld deals with incompetent colleagues was also highly entertaining for sure, although maybe when he is about to shoot Bond and shoots Osato instead, it is a bit gimmicky. Entertainment over realism, but I take it. Interesting snippet: The actor who plays Bond's unlucky colleague Henderson here (nice metal leg reference, great love to detail in the script), Charles Gray, later returned to the franchise as Blofeld. Also this character's death was done in a pretty surprising manner. Like you did not see it coming one bit as you expected he would just inform Bond about everything, maybe appear on one or two other occasions and that's it, but nope. He was gone far more quickly and in a way considerably less pleasant for the character. This main antagonist Blofeld here has a big blond helper called Hans, who has a tough fight with Bond near the end and who is just as silent as the far more famous Jaws and Oddjob. Kinda sad there is almost nothing really known about this actor Ronald Rich anymore. A bit telling (in a sad way) that here he also only shows up in the credits on the extended list as ""Blofeld's Bodyguard"". But with this movie, he will always be remembered, at least for me. If anybody who reads this, can tell me something about Rich's background and life before and after this film, please contact me under the email in my imdb profile. I am genuinely curious.The movie has many great spy scenes, good fight sequences and lots of wit. In the second half, you can add some action sequences too. However, all in all I think I preferred the first half. The 1 vs. 4 plane fight did not do too much for me, just like the ninja training camp scenes. I preferred the scene in which he has to get free and land the machine after Karen Dor's character left him to die in a plane crash. The character's name was Helga Brandt by the way. She joins Irma Bunt and Rosa Klebb on the list of female henchmen with German names in the early Bond movies, although I find the other two more memorable, if you can even compare her to those because the other two were never in the slightest romantically involved with 007. As for Bond itself, I know there is in every movie a considerable amount of scenes during which his life is really in danger, but in this film here the quantity seems to be especially high, like constant threats and like a champ he gets out of all of them not only alive, but really he seems to be always in control. This is something that maybe nobody depicted as well as Connery. All about his aura. You could say it almost is a bit too easy for him at times to feel realistic, but I would not totally agree. It's also for good reason that a really influential man like Tiger is instantly ready to play second fiddle to a foreign agent. Gotta be a truly capable agent for that. The man just has it and it's the role of his lifetime. Also being called Bond-san is pretty cool honestly. Here and there, we get a comedy moment too. It's usually about witty dialogues really as the action is all about being cool and tough, but Connery has that comedic timing. For example, one moment would be when Bond admits to Dor's character he is a spy, but then says it is about industry and not about politics. I liked the playful approach there. Lying while kinda saying the truth. Connery's Bond just likes to push everybody's buttons. And even more to open those button of attractive female's clothes. Tiger Tanaka realizes this quickly as well in their first meeting by how easy it turns out to get Bond to his hideout. Also a funny moment to watch Bond when Tanaka makes this statement. He sees right through him that women are his soft spot, even if Bonds played by other actors (Lazenby, Craig especially) have suffered more because of their relationships with specific women. Also, Dor's character had sex with Bond, right? And yet she was ready to kill him the next scene up there in the sky? Must not have been the night of her life. Or she was more scared of Osato than we thought. But it is also nothing new really that Bond in one way or the other gets involved with the bad guy's ladies. In any case, interesting that these two both got killed by Blofeld and not by Bond, even if the latter also killed quite a few people in here, but this was probably also to make a point about how much of a serious antagonist Blofeld is. I mean, makes sense looking at how strongly he got featured throughout the franchise over the years, no decades, even now in the Craig movies way over half a century after this one here.To sum it all up, I want to say that I really recommend this film. It is a classic and one of my favorite James Bond movies and it is not deserved that many people tend to forget this one when thinking of Connery's turns as 007. Maybe one reason is that they also do not really remember any of the Bond girls. Also keep in mind what happened in Japan only minimally over 20 years earlier. Probably this being a British film made it easier to avoid conflicts from that perspective. Actually, it is even a Japanese co-production. There are many, many great scenes: the drop of poison (how convenient this happened exactly before Bond meets the new girl), Bond's ""death"" early on, Henderson's death and Bond's way to get to the killers' headquarter, how he is there as an invited guest not much later, the space scenes and many more. I absolutely must mention the rooftop scene when the camera moves up and Bond is chased by these fishermen or I should say bad guy brutes posing as fishermen. Seems like a common disguise as the good guys also talk about pretending to be fishermen before attacking the antagonist's headquarter. These almost 120 minutes are certainly worth watching and be it only to see Connery with an Asian guy haircut in the second hour. Action freaks (and I am not one of them) also get to see a cool little plane that is much stronger than you would think from its looks. All thanks to Q of course. Gun enthusiasts have at least one memorable moment too when Blofeld tells us how Bond is so 100% linked to one specific type of firearm. One thing a bit unusual for the franchise is that really this movie is set from beginning to end in one single country, namely Japan. Well, if you ignore the very beginning that is. Go see this one, for example while you are waiting for the next Bond movie from this eternal franchise, which is fittingly named ""Spectre"".",You Only Live Twice
6,mark.waltz,You shouldn't always assume that the Russians are the bad guys.,8,16 August 2017,"Who is kidnapping the great astronauts of earth? That's what the powerful countries of our planet are determined to find out, and it's up to Sean Connery's James Bond to find out. I wonder if he can find the stranded American astronaut whose oxygen line was cut, presumably dying and floating around in outer space. Of course, the Americans blame the Russians, the Russians blame the Japanese, and the British try to keep peace between these two bitter enemies. Of course, there's more to the story than this, and that's the fun of this Bond entry that has the theme of an old serial with mod 60's twists including a fantastic theme song sung by Nancy Sinatra. Connery is elegant, macho and funny, and I am glad that after a break in the next film, he came back for a few more until Roger Moore was cast. Along the way, Connery beds some gorgeous women, exchanges quips with Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and finds him up against a power starving madman (Donald Pleasance), a villain all in white (with matching cat). This evil man has no qualms about feeding somebody who has screwed up to the piranhas, an insinuated moment where the realization of what you are seeing makes it scarier than if you actually saw blood. Filled with nonstop action and subtle comedy, this is my absolute favorite of Connery's Bond films, the first of the series I recall seeing. Only a segment where Connery is altered to look Japanese is bizarre, simply because he doesn't. The pacing is terrific, however, and that makes the one bad twist simply vanish. It also has a wonderful surreal set which has to be seen to be appreciated.",You Only Live Twice
7,classicsoncall,"""As you see, I'm about to inaugurate a little war.""",7,11 December 2018,"""You Only Live Twice"" takes it's cue from the very first picture in the James Bond series of films in that it returns to a story about the American space program. However unlike it's predecessor ""Dr. No"", it's the malevolent head of SPECTRE who plans to step into the vacuum created by America and Russia annihilating each other over the disappearance of an American space capsule. This time out, perennial Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld is portrayed by Donald Pleasence in a spirited performance that would provide the inspiration for Dr. Evil in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"", courtesy of Mike Myers. Some of the antics in this picture are pretty ridiculous, like Little Nellie with Bond at the controls taking out four attack helicopters, and James Bond (Sean Connery) himself becoming a Ninja master after three days of training! He really could have used a whole week, but I guess time was of the essence. I have to admit though, the camouflaged volcano gimmick was a pretty good one, and Bond's sidekick throughout most of the story was a very eye appealing Akiko Wakabayashi, who also saw duty as a Japanese Princess in ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"". So between the two pictures she's got quite the resume. With your requisite pyrotechnics and massive explosions, the flick ends on a successful note with Bond saving the world once again, while cozying up to his pretty assistant Aki for that late honeymoon rendezvous.",You Only Live Twice
8,gavin6942,Bring on Blofeld!,7,17 December 2014,"Agent 007 (Sean Connery) and the Japanese secret service ninja force must find and stop the true culprit of a series of space jackings before nuclear war is provoked.Say what you will about James Bond, but this film has two great things going for it: Sean Connery as James Bond (the only true Bond) and Donald Pleasance as Blofeld. Why any other actor ever played Blofeld is beyond me.Heck, another great thing: space. Although this film came out two years before the moon landings, it has a pretty cool space theme going on. Well done.",You Only Live Twice
9,lee_eisenberg,you can see why Sean Connery was getting disenchanted with the series,6,30 April 2006,"After ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Goldfinger"" were all so cool, ""Thunderball"" seemed to be getting tacky, and ""You Only Live Twice"" seems even more so (granted, it's still worth seeing). This one has James Bond (Sean Connery) going to Japan to investigate the disappearances of American and Soviet spaceships. Since the superpowers are blaming each other, there could be a nuclear holocaust if Bond doesn't find out the truth. Sure enough, the culprit turns out to be SPECTRE. And SPECTRE's leader Blofeld (Donald Pleasance) looks like he could be Dr. Evil's father, natch.Oh well. The point of these movies is to have fun, and you sure will with this one. If nothing else, there's always a plethora of hot women, and this one even has the two women from ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"". Passable.",You Only Live Twice
10,jboothmillard,You Only Live Twice,10,25 February 2005,"This was said to be the last outing for the actor who played the famous secret agent, created by Ian Fleming, since the beginning, he returned however when George Lazenby did not work out (and again in Never Say Never Again, this can be ignored), this is one of the best of the early films, directed by Lewis Gilbert (Alfie, The Spy Who Loved Me, Shirley Valentine). Basically an American NASA spacecraft is hijacked in orbit by an unidentified spacecraft, the U.S. suspect it to be the work of the Soviets, but the British suspect Japanese involvement, as the unknown craft landed somewhere in Japan. James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) fakes his own death in Hong Kong, China, ""buried at sea"" to give him cover from his enemies, following this he is sent to Tokyo, Japan. Bond is met by agent Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi), assistant to the Japanese secret service leader Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), who takes him to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray), who has critical information about the rogue craft. Henderson is killed before going into detail, Bond kills his assailant and disguises himself to gain access to Osato Chemicals, after subduing the getaway car driver he breaks the office safe and steals documents, Aki helps him escape the security. Stopping at an abandoned subway station Bond chases Aki, but falls down a trap door into the office of Tanaka. Examining the documents they find a photograph of a cargo ship, and a microdot message about the tourist who took the photograph being killed as a security precaution, masquerading as a buyer Bond meets Mr. Osato (Teru Shimada) himself, for any information he can gather. Leaving the office Tanaka helps foil an attack on Bond and Aki from assassins sent by Osato's secretary Helga Brandt, aka agent ""Number 11"" (Karin Dor), Bond and Aki investigate the dock facilities, finding the cargo ship, Ning-Po, was delivering elements for rocket fuel. After seducing and escaping an assassination attempt by Brandt, Bond investigates the area where the Ning-Po was unloaded, in heavily armed autogyro ""Little Nellie"", near a volcano Bond is attacked by four helicopters, but he defeats them. Meanwhile the Soviet spacecraft is captured in orbit by the unidentified spacecraft, heightening tensions between the U.S. and Russia, the spacecraft lands in an extensive base hidden inside a volcano, the mastermind behind the scheme is SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter- intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), headed by ""Number 1"", Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), Brandt is killed by piranhas for failing to kill Bond, Blofeld demands Osato to kill him. Bond is trained with Tanaka's ninjas and disguised to become Oriental, during the night Aki is poisoned in an assassination attempt on Bond, a fake marriage then goes ahead with Bond and Tanaka's student Kissy Suzuki (Mie Hama) (her name is never said). With a lead Bond and Kissy investigate a cave and the volcano above it, the discover the disguised hatch leading to the secret rocket base, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka, Bond slips in. Bond locates and frees the captured astronauts, and with a spacesuit attempts to infiltrate the spacecraft, ""Bird One"", but Blofeld spots him and he is taken to the leader, the reserve astronaut is sent to pilot. While Blofeld reveals himself to Bond, and Tanaka, Kissy and an army of ninjas surround the base, Bird One closes in on the American spacecraft in orbit, Bond manages to open the hatch and let in the ninjas. As battle ensues Bond escapes Blofeld and his henchmen, gaining access to the control room he activates the rocket's self- destruct before it reaches the American craft, American forces stand down, finally Blofeld activates the base's self- destruct system before escaping, the surviving ninjas, Tanaka, Kissy and Bond escape as the base and volcano explodes. Also starring Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Tsai Chin as Ling, Chinese Girl in Hong Kong, Alexander Knox as American President and Burt Kwouk as Spectre 3. Connery desired to quit the franchise, but he still delivers a good performance as the cool and suave super spy, the supporting cast are all good, especially Pleasence who stays hidden behind the white Persian cat until the final half and with his scarred eye is suitably sinister, the action sequences are all exciting, especially the Little Nellie sequence, and there are great things to see, a brilliant spy adventure. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Art Direction. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 7 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for the title song by Nancy Sinatra (Frank's daughter), and it was number 90 on The Ultimate Film.

11,Tweekums,Bond in Japan,9,25 August 2011,"When an American spacecraft is captured in orbit the Americans are quick to blame the Russians; British intelligence has another theory however; they believe that Japan was the base for the attack. Shortly after attending his own funeral Britain's best agent, James Bond, is on the job. When he arrives in Japan his contact tells him that he believes a major Japanese industrial concern is involved but he is murdered before he can go into details. Luckily Bond follows the assailant's trail back to the offices of Osato Industries where he steals some documents from a safe. They include a photograph that Japanese Intelligence ultimately track to an island. When Bond flies over the island he sees nothing but volcanoes but four attacking helicopters suggest that something must be hidden there. Japanese intelligence chief 'Tiger' Tanaka sends his ninjas to the island along with Bond who has been made up to look Japanese and been 'married' to a local girl as cover. He hasn't been there long when he discovers where the threat is coming from inside a volcano! Once he has discovered this he and Tiger's men don't have long because the Americans have launched another rocket and have announced that any attack on it will be considered an act of war and they will retaliate against the Soviet Union if anything happens.This is another great Bond film; SPECTRE's scheme is once again bigger than anything they have done before and we finally get to set the sinister 'Number One'; Ernst Stavro Blofeld; played this time by the excellent Donald Pleasence. His lair under the volcano is one of the most iconic of any villains and provides the setting for a great final confrontation. Before that there is plenty of action including a fight in Kobe docks, a ninja training camp and the famous fight between Bond's 'Little Nellie' autogyro and four of SPECTRE's helicopters. Of course no Bond film would be complete with out a bevy of beautiful women and this is no exception including Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama and Karin Dor as agent Aki, Bond's 'pig-faced' wife Kissy Suzuki and SPECTRE agent Helga Brandt respectively. The other most notable actor is Tetsuro Tamba who did a good job as Tiger Tanaka.",You Only Live Twice
12,BA_Harrison,"Bond's turning Japanese, I think he's turning Japanese, I really think so (NOT!).",6,23 September 2012,"Ever since Mike Myers mercilessly mocked You Only Live Twice in Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, it's been impossible to take this particular Bond adventure seriously; but to be honest, the film was always pretty ridiculous in the first place, stretching plausibility further than ever before in an effort to up the ante in terms of crowd-pleasing spectacle.The basic plot is solid enough—SPECTRE steals US and Russian spacecraft in a bid to start a war that will turn Japan into the world's leading superpower—but the excess of silliness on display virtually turns this into self-parody. A giant lair, complete with monorail, hidden inside a volcano; a ninja army; Little Nellie, a stupid looking auto-gyro that proves unbeatable in an aerial battle against four regular helicopters; Bond posing as a Japanese fisherman: all a far cry from the rawness of the first two Connery movies (no surprise then that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, author of many a classic book for kids).As a fan of all things Japanese, I enjoy the setting, the karate, and the women, and Blofeld's piranha filled pool is a cool touch (every self-respecting megalomaniac should have one), but its not at all surprising that You Only Live Twice marked the end for Connery as Bond (at least for a while), the star being replaced by George Lazenby for the secret agent's next adventure.",You Only Live Twice
13,moonspinner55,"""This organization does not permit failure...""",7,16 May 2009,"007 adventure par excellence! German villain Blofeld (scary, monotone-voiced Donald Pleasance--with a facial scar) is responsible for the hijacking of missiles in space; attempting to pit the U.S. with the Russians, he runs afoul of James Bond while at his base of operations in Japan (the cavernous mouth of an inactive volcano). Sean Connery's Bond dresses as a Japanese native, trains at a Ninja warrior camp, and even gets unofficially married! There's a neat sequence involving an attempted poisoning of Bond while he sleeps, and the entrance to Blofeld's elaborate laboratory is eye-popping (as is the interior). Slow-starting film does have an incredible production design (only some cheesy explosions and the paltry glimpses of the volcano at night handicap it). Tongue-in-cheek entertainment, coupled with the standard cartoonish sadism (such as the piranhas swimming in Blofeld's pool), makes for an exciting ride. Not the best of the series, but certainly well up to par. Gleaming title song, warbled by Nancy Sinatra, almost as memorable as the movie itself. *** from ****",You Only Live Twice
14,edwagreen,You Only Live Twice-Once in A Lifetime More than Enough **1/2,6,25 May 2009,"No wonder Sean Connery was becoming disenchanted with the James Bond films. He correctly saw that the plot was being less emphasized with the emphasis put on technological gimmicks.We had a fascinating plot here. Spectre keeps interrupting space flights so that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will ultimately go to war and Spectre will pick up the pieces.This theme is greatly understated and instead we are subjected to the usual chase scenes on the ground, in the air, etc. Explosives abound in this film and the women really take it on the chin.What's this business of Bond actually marrying in the film? How does Moneypenny really feel about that? Amazing that Lois Maxwell stayed in the series despite the lackluster recurring role that she had. I guess you can chalk that up to the contract system and the good old American dollar.Donald Pleasence appears as #1 and is very highly effective in this sinister role. His low, calm voice with a German accent is appealing as he attends to wreak havoc on the world's stage.",You Only Live Twice
15,BandSAboutMovies,James Bond saved me,8,5 April 2020,"The fifth James Bond film, You Only Live Twice is the first Bond directed by Lewis Gilbert, who would go on to make The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. And, perhaps most importantly, it seemed like it would be the last Bond film for Sean Connery.On Her Majesty's Secret Service was to be the next movie, but that would have meany searching for snowy locations. Instead, the Bond team decided to make this story first.Roald Dahl would write the story using the book as a very loose inspiration, which he felt was just a travelogue with no story.American NASA spacecraft Jupiter 16 has been hijacked from orbit by SPECTRE, who are being paid by China to start a nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile, James Bond has been killed and buried at sea.What?It's all ruse, as Bond is in Japan to find out where SPECTRE is hiding and what their next move is. This involves him working with Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi, King Kong vs. Godzilla), a Japanese female ninja, who is in the employ of the Japanese Secret Service. Tiger Tanaka, of course, is back as the leader of the Japanese agents. After Aki is killed, Bond teams with Kissy Suzuki (Mie Hamada, King Kong Escapes), an agent who he is ""married"" to after receiving plastic surgery to appear Japanese.Wait - Bond gets surgery on his eyes to look Japanese? Yeah. It was 1967.Teru Shimada plays Mr. Osato and Karin Dor plays SPECTRE agent Helga Brandt, two of Bond's enemies. But the real big bad finally shows up, five movies in, as Blofeld is revealed as Donald Pleasence. Ironically, Charles Gray is in this as Dikko Henderson, but he'd end up playing Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever.By the way - Osato's bodyguard that fights Bond is pro wrestler ""High Chief"" Peter Fanene Maivia, grandfather of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.I had a really emotional reaction to the end of this movie. Obviously, we're living through some trying times, but the final of this, as Blofeld is finally revealed and he runs through his base, shooting his own men to escape just as it explodes, leaving Bond and Kissy to try to escape their duties for just a few minutes alone...I found my face wet with tears. The meta realization that Connery wanted to run from Bond in the same way that Bond wanted to escape his MI6 hit me.Could things ever be this perfect again? This month of Bond films has been a catharsis as I deal with multiple life-changing events - the loss of my company, my wife's worsening back, my father's mental condition and hell, the potential end of all there is. I try not to let my real life come into here all that much, but I wanted to share a gorgeous moment with you, when James Bond did what he did best, if only for a few seconds. He saved my world.",You Only Live Twice
16,Coventry,Bond  favorite Bond!,9,10 March 2016,"When I was around 11 or 12 years old, my dad and I watched all the James Bond movies that were released then (which was up until ""License to Kill"") in a period of just a couple of days. Although I liked almost every single one of them, the one and only that instantly became my favorite one in the series! I mean, what wasn't to be loved about this awesome movie?!? The utterly cool sequences of space capsules being swallowed – literally – by bigger and monstrous rockets, the fantastic villainous headquarters hidden inside an inactive volcano, the exciting scenes at the ninja training camp, the cool aerial battle between 007 in his silly little yellow toy-airplane versus various heavily armed black helicopters, the pet piranhas, and – most of all – the portrayal of the ultimate evil mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld by the inimitable Donald Pleasance. Now, 25 years and yet another 8 new Bond installments later, I can still shamelessly admit that ""You Only Live Twice"" still stands as my personal favorite Bond movie and – even though Sir Sean Connery will probably disagree with me – it's undeniably the most entertaining one of the entire series. Through the eyes and ears of an adult viewer I can add more good reasons to love this movie, actually, like for example it features on of the top three greatest theme songs (courtesy of Nancy Sinatra) and an action-packed screenplay penned down by another one of my childhood heroes, namely Roald Dahl. The plot of ""You Only Live Twice"" is easily summarized Criminal organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E, led by the scar-faced and cat-loving psychopath Blofeld, is well on track to evoke a third World War by alternately abducting a US and then a Soviet space capsule from within a secret base camp on a Japanese volcanic island, and then counting on the fact that these two stubborn world powers will blame each other. Luckily the intelligent British government suspects there's more going on, and so they send their best agent to the Far East. In order to fulfill his delicate mission, 007 first has to fake his own death and then literally must become a Japanese warrior. ""You only live Twice"" is another fast- paced and spectacular Bond-adventure with beautiful exotic filming locations, lots of pleasant hi-tech gadgetry (cigarette gunfire, anyone?) and plenty of action. The Bond girls in this one are all Oriental, evidently, so whether Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama rank amongst the most beautiful 007 bed partners or not entirely depends on your own personal taste. My major complaint now is that I remember Pleasance's role in the film to be bigger When I was 12- years-old Donald Pleasance must have made such an everlasting impression on me that he forever remains the embodiment of James Bond villains",You Only Live Twice

20,hitchcockthelegend,"Bond-san, Blofeld, Asian Delights and Production Value Supreme.",8,1 May 2012,"You Only Live Twice is directed by Lewis Gilbert and written by Roald Dahl. It stars Sean Connery, Tetsuro Tamba, Teru Shimada, Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama, Karin Dor and Donald Pleasence. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Freddie Young.Bond 5 and Connery once again tackles the role of 007. With American and Soviet space craft mysteriously vanishing from space, both nations are laying the blame at the other's door. Sensing a nuclear war could break out, M assigns Bond to Japan to investigate if there might be a third party stirring the hornets nest. Teaming up with the Japanese secret service, Bond uncovers evidence that SPECTRE is behind the plot to pitch the East and the West against each other.This organisation does not tolerate failure.Thunderball had broke box office records for Bond, gadgetry, outlandish stunts and a quip on the tongue had proved most profitable. It was planned originally that On Her Majesty's Secret Service would be number 5 in the series, but a change of tack to go for You Only Live Twice as the story gave producers Broccoli & Saltzman the scope for a giganticus enormous production. However, it may be set in Japan and feature a Bond/Blofeld conflict, but Roald Dahl's script bares little resemblance to Ian Fleming's source novel. Although a massive financial success with a Worldwide gross of over $111 million, Bond 5 took $30 million less than Thunderball. Strange since this is a better film. Can we attribute the drop to it being a space age saga? Maybe, the rebirth of sci-fi was a few years away, and of course Bond had lost some fans who had grown tired, like Connery, of 007 relying on gadgets instead of brains and brawn to complete his missions. There was also the rival Casino Royale production, as bad as it was, to contend with, while the spy boom created by Bond had been overkilled elsewhere and was on the wane.Extortion is my business. Go away and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy. True enough that You Only Live Twice has flaws, though they are far from being film killers if you like the gadgets and hi-techery side of the franchise? Connery announced once production was over that he was leaving the role of Bond behind. He had been close to breaking point after Thunderball, but finally the media circus, typecasting, the fanaticism and the character merely being a cypher for outrageous sequences, led Connery to finally call it a day. His displeasure shows in performance, oh it's professional, very much so, but the swagger and machismo from the earlier films has gone. Although Dahl's script tones down the ""cheese"" dialogue and unfolds as a plot of considerable World peril worth, characterisations are thinly drawn, making this reliant on production value and action sequences. Thankfully both are top dollar. And the ace up its sleeve is the long awaited face to face meeting of Bond and Blofeld.The firing power inside my crater is enough to annihilate a small army. You can watch it all on TV. It's the last program you're likely to see.Ken Adam's set design is fit to grace any epic in film history, as is Freddie Young's photography around the Japanese locales, Barry lays a beautiful Bond/Oriental score all over proceedings and Nancy Sinatra's title song is appealingly catchy. The action is excellently constructed by Gilbert (helming the first of three Bond movies on his CV), with the final battle at Blofeld's volcano crater base full of explosions, flying stunt men, expert choreography and meaty fights. Along the way we have been treated to Ninjas, Piranhas, poison, aeroplane peril and the awesome Little Nellie versus the big boy copter smack down! Then there's that Bond/Blofeld confrontation. Well worth the wait, with Pleasence visually scary with bald head (setting the marker for bald villainy to follow in TV and cinema it seems) and scar across his eye. Pleasence is also very low key with his menace, which is perfect, we don't want pantomime and the scenes with Bond work wonderfully well.It made less than the film before it and it has fierce critics in Bond and Fleming circles. But it's a Bond film that pays rich rewards on revisits, where the artistry on show really shines through in this HD/Upscale age. 8/10",You Only Live Twice
21,Theo Robertson,One Of The Best Bond Movies,8,23 July 2005,"I notice this movie has warranted much criticism and some people have gone as far as dubbing it as the worst of the Connery Eon productions ! What you mean it's worse than DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER ? I don't think so and it's certainly better than than THUNDERBALL which spends most of its time with Connery - Or more likely a stuntman - submerged under water . At least with this movie we get to see Connery's manly handsome features I do agree there are certain flaws to the screenplay . One is the plot which lacks logic . Spectre are manipulating the superpowers into starting a nuclear war ! Can anyone see what a ridiculous idea this is ? There is some historical context to this since Mao thought because of the large population of China if there was a third world war his country would come up trumps and if I remember correctly he stated in the mid 1960s that "" Even if we lose 300 million of our citizens China would still survive "" which just goes to show that he wasn't perhaps the cleverest of people . It's insinuated heavily without being spelt out that China is paying Spectre to cause the war but what is Blofeld getting out of this apart from 100 million dollars in gold bullion ? At least in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME you can understand why the villain would want to see a nuclear holocaust but Blofeld seems entirely ignorant that you wouldn't be able to trade or spend anything after world war three .There's also a few other little irritants . Much of the movie is beautifully paced but Bond's burial at sea is again illogical and holds up the story . I mean why don't the Royal Navy just dump a weighted down dummy into the sea and come to think of it doesn't the "" Bond is dead "" charade just seem entirely stupid in the first place ? How if Bond was alive the Hong Kong police say he was dead ? Were they part of the conspiracy ? For an intricate plot it seems to involve a ridiculous number of people for it to work effectively . Same as the Bond pretends to be a Japanese fisherman subplot . Couldn't the Japanese secret service just land him on the island via boat instead of putting him in a ninja training camp ? There's also something else that is totally unexplained : Bond rescues two Soviet cosmonauts and an American astronaut then one of these characters disappears from the narrative when Bond and the two others knock out the Spectre spacemen then these two characters likewise disappear from the story . It might sound anal of me but I was very annoyed that I never found out what happened to the three space kidnap victims Despite these flaws YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is a tremendously entertaining movie . As I said from one or two unnecessary elements ( This would become a serious problem in the latter movies ) it's beautifully paced and contains some great set pieces with special mention going to the chase scene on top of a warehouse and this is the movie where we finally get to see the face of Blofeld . Again I notice that some people aren't all that impressed with Donald Pleasence's performance but I think it's an excellent portrayal of a megalomaniac , he's aloof and attached , almost Hitlerite and compare it to the campy style other actors have played him in Perhaps not as good as DOCTOR NO or GOLDFINGER but this Bond film is much better than most other in the franchise",You Only Live Twice

It's got loads of action scenes - ""Little Nelly"" and her heavily armed aerobatic battles being one of the better ones. The beautifully delicate Akiko Wakabayashi provides the glamour - though little of substance and Donald Pleasence - armed with some peckish piraña fish - turns up as the scheming arch enemy just before a series of disappointingly set-piece battle scenes at the end of what had, up until the last 15 minutes been a more sophisticated and intriguing film that relied more on subterfuge and mystery, as well as a decent soupçon of Japanese culture (including some interesting bathing/wedding traditions that our ""James"" joined in with, heartily).

24,Bunuel1976,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (Lewis Gilbert, 1967) ***",7,24 November 2008,"Solid entry in the James Bond saga – Sean Connery's fifth appearance as the secret agent in a row (his last, in fact, until DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER [1971] and, eventually, the non-series entry NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN [1983]) – featuring a lovely title tune by John Barry and Leslie Bricusse sung by Nancy Sinatra.The relocation to Japan for the main action (resulting in impeccable photography courtesy of the renowned Freddie Young, who also contributes an inspired aerial shot of our hero at the center of a rooftop chase/struggle) adds much-needed novelty in the exotic department – though characters tend to be less well developed as a consequence. Tetsuro Tamba is imposing enough as his 'sidekick', but the all-important Bond girls have no distinguishing features – save for Karin Dor, a typical femme-fatale-ish villainess who manages to trap Bond in an unpiloted plane. Similar expansiveness was shown in Ken Adam's elaborate design of Ernst Stavro Blofeld's headquarters, hidden within the crater of a Japanese volcano; other attention-grabbing devices include Bond being 'killed' in the prologue (thus explaining the title), while he's later given an Oriental 'countenance' and even made to 'marry' a Japanese girl (an irrelevant undercover attempt, as it happens – since there is very little interaction between Bond, his local allies and the enemy before the final confrontation in the volcano interior)!Its plot involving the abduction of space shuttles belonging to the U.S. and Russia, in the hope of provoking a war between the major powers, again plays on the fears of nuclear annihilation palpable during the Cold War era. Incidentally, this is the first time Blofeld himself steps in as chief villain (played with appropriate menace by Donald Pleasence – with a handy piranha-filled stream underneath a sliding bridge to replace the pool-sharks from the previous installment, THUNDERBALL [1965]). By the way, Charles Gray (Blofeld in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER) appears in a bit here as Bond's ill-fated contact in Japan! The most prominent gadget invented by Q (the ubiquitous Desmond Llewellyn) in this case is an artillery-equipped mini-chopper – employed in a sequence whose filming unfortunately cost an aerial photographer his leg!; there's also a memorably violent brawl which has Bond and his opponent lashing at each other with heavy living-room couches! The show, then, is climaxed by one of the most spectacular action bouts in the entire saga – for which Bond recruits Tamba's ninjas to fight the minions of SPECTRE; Blofeld, of course, is allowed to go free this time aroundsince he'd be involved in at least three subsequent direct matches with 007. Given that director Gilbert lived up to the challenge of ably following in the footsteps of Terence Young and Guy Hamilton, it was only natural he'd be asked to helm further Bond adventures – though, by the time THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977) and MOONRAKER (1979) came along, Roger Moore had firmly established himself in the role.",You Only Live Twice

27,zardoz-13,James Bond Nips Blofeld in the Bud!,8,11 November 2008,"James Bond heads off for Japan to avert World War III in ""Alfie"" director Lewis Gilbert's ""You Only Live Twice,"" the fifth entry in the Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli 007 series from the 1960s. ""You Only Live Twice"" resembles a souped up version of the first Bond adventure ""Dr. No"" in that it involves SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion) again. This Bond introduced a number of firsts of the franchise. First, this represents the first time that audiences saw 007's previously anonymous nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. British character Donald Pleasance took over the role at the last minute when Czech actor Jan Werich fell ill and had to be replaced. Second, there are no scenes set in the United Kingdom. Bond doesn't receive his usual briefing in M's office. Third, the movie differed even more from the novel than earlier efforts. Fourth, Sean Connery had grown fat and sassy because he is no longer the lean, wolfish secret agent that he was in ""Dr. No."" Fifth, the producers hammered home the dangers of cigarette smoking in three scenes. Sixth, this is also the first time that we see Ian Fleming's super spy decked out in his naval uniform. Indeed, ""You Only Live Twice"" served as the template for the military, World War III Bonds such as ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" where our protagonist donned his naval togs. Sixth, 007 never introduces himself as ""Bond, James Bond."" The action opens in outer space as U.S. astronauts are space walking when a mysterious space craft approaches them and its nose cone opens and engulf the American capsule and cuts the lifeline of the astronaut. Since ""You Only Live Twice"" took place during the Cold War, the Americans accused the Soviet Union of this abduction in outer space. His Majesty's government isn't convinced that the Russians hijacked the American spacecraft. The action cuts to James Bond in bed with a Japanese beauty that is really setting him up for a hit squad. Before she lets the killers into her apartment to shoot our hero, she promises Bond that she will give him the very best ""duck."" Pressing a button on the wall, the mechanism closes the bed in which 007 is strewn up into the wall and a couple of machine-gun toting thugs break in and pepper the bed with a hail of bullets. When British authorities arrive, they find an unconscious Bond in the sack with blood on the sheets. As it turns out, the killing is nothing more than a ruse to throw Bond's enemies off the scent while he goes in foras M (Bernard Lee)his most important mission. The Americans are teetering on the edge of war with the Kremlin and the Kremlin has scheduled a space flight of their own.The scene where Bond's shroud encased body is dumped into Tokyo Bay in a mock funeral is too cool. As his body settles on the ocean floor, scuba divers swim up, retrieve his body, and take him onboard a submarine where M awaits him with his mission orders. After Bond is told that this mission is ""the big one,"" he is fired out of a torpedo tube in the ocean and swims to the mainland where an operative of Japan's Special Intelligence Service. Bond meets with a British official, Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray of ""Diamonds Are Forever""), and learns that the head of Japanese S.I.S., Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba of ""The 5-Man Army"") has his own suspicions about a giant industrial concern, Soto Chemical Corporation. Before Bond meets Tiger, he has an encounter with the villains after they murder Henderson. Bond kills the killer and masquerades as him, despite the fact that he is clearly taller than the killer. Anyway, he bundles himself into the back of the sedan driven by another Osato person and winds up in the giant building. The villain who carried him inside is shocked when Bond surprises him and one of the best hand-to-hand combat scenes in the entire series plays swiftly with Bond wielding a couch to knock the villain down. Afterward, our hero plunders the corporation owner's vault and discovers that fishy things are going on near an island. It seems that an innocent American tourist took a photo of a cargo ship and ""was eliminated as a precaution."" Tiger assembles an army of Ninjas at his castle training ground andvery improbablyBond masquerades again as a Japanese fisherman to reconnoiter the island where the ship is seen. Tanaka sneaks Bond onto the island as a newlywed of a local girl. They discover a cave that contains poison gas and later learn that it gives access to the volcano. Meanwhile, the suspense mounts as the United States launches another spacecraft and threatens to go to war with the Soviet Union if their space capsule is abducted. Matters aren't helped when Blofeld capsule gobbling spacecraft swallows a Russian space capsule. The big, bang-up finale in the volcano where Blofeld has his headquarters as well as a rocket launching site is deliciously outlandish stuff.Indisputably, ""You Only Live Twice"" qualified as the most outrageous of the Bond movies at the time and you have to realize as you watch it that much of what occurs is incredibly far-fetched. Nevertheless, the stunning Japanese scenery, the invigorating fight sequences, and Blofeld's mind-blowing headquarters in an extinct volcano overshadow many of the unbelievable scenes. As another Bond directorGuy Hamiltonused to say, you have to watch these extravaganzas with your mind turned off because too many incredible things occur. John Barry's orchestral score ranks as one of the most memorable and Nancy Sinatra's song is one of the best.",You Only Live Twice
28,Boba_Fett1138,One of the most entertaining Bond movies.,8,21 March 2006,"It's not the best but it most certainly is one of the most entertaining Bond movies to watch. Because of that reason, ""You Only Live Twice"" is one of my favorite Bond movies.Basically the movie is just simple silly fun. The story is very simple and at the same time also totally unbelievable but also because of this the movie is extremely entertaining to watch. As an action movie this movie is really great. The movie is truly filled with many spectacular, if a tad over-the-top action sequences. Most action sequences don't even make sense that they occur in the movie, once you really start thinking about it but that is all part of the charm of this entertaining movie. It's a very imaginative movie that has some unforgettable sequences in it, that are both thrilling as well as spectacular.The movie is mostly set in the culturally rich Japan. It works as a perfect backdrop for the movie and the strange unusual culture helps to make the movie an imaginative filled one. Also sequences like with 'Little Nellie' and the end fight set in the hollowed-out volcano add to the adventurous and imaginative feeling of the movie.Ken Adam is also one of the reasons why everything in the movie works so well. As a production designer he made the right backdrops for the story and made several elements of the movie work out surprising well, such as mainly all of the sequences in the hollowed-out volcano.Also the musical score by John Barry and the cinematography by Freddie Young are worth mentioning.Sean Connery is good and fun as always as James Bond and he still showed good form in this movie. This time Ernst Stavro Blofeld was played by legendary actor Donald Pleasence. He takes the movie to an even higher level. He plays the best Blofeld out of the long series of Bond movies, along with Telly Savalas who played the villainous character in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".This is a fantastic fast paced, action filled movie, that has some spectacular and unforgettable sequences in it, especially toward the ending.

James Bond suggests in this flick's first scene that Asian women ""taste different,"" a nifty foreshadowing of that particular one-night stand's fate later in this film (which could be subtitled ""But You Bed Bond Just Once""). Less neat are the many lapses in logic and continuity here, such as when Bond and ""Kissy Suzuki"" must abandon their boat in the poisonous sea cave, leaving them to climb a volcano in just the clothes on their backs. When Bond learns that the SPECTRE launch pad is inside this peak, his human fly suit and case of Weaponized Cigarettes (an oxymoron, of course) conveniently materialize out of thin air. (Meanwhile, he dispatches Ms. Suzuki to outdo Diana Nyad by swimming 100 miles to Honshu, during which unprecedented feat a SPECTRE helicopter strafes at her in the big dark sea, despite lacking any night vision equipment--none of which makes sense to anyone, except maybe pro wrestling fans.) Donald Pleasance as SPECTRE's #1, Ernst Stavros Blofeld, is a dead ringer for Vladimir Putin, so if YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE hits too close to home respecting today's headlines, you can always get your next Roald Dahl fix at his chocolate factory instead.",You Only Live Twice

Most people like him, or at the very least respect him. I've seen virtually all of the old Bond movies, I saw them on TV just a few years ago. I haven't liked any of the newer ones, so I haven't bothered to watch any Bond movies made later than Goldeneye, as I think that was so much below average for Bond that it could get. But anyway; after not having seen them in a long time, the only Bond movie that stands out in my memory is this one. You only live twice. Why, you ask? Maybe it's better than most of the other old ones; or maybe, it's the very definition of Bond. Who could portray a witty gentleman agent better than Sean Connery? The movie has the perfect match of in-jokes, typical Bond gadgets, Bond girls, cool locations & action. It also has noticably fewer unrealistic scenes(shootings, for example) than most of the later films(even of the old ones). It's about as action packed as most of the other old Bond movies, and all of the action scenes are exciting. The plot is pretty good, though it seems a bit dated now.

But hindsight shows that this is the first of the films to feature the formula plot which went on to dominate Bond movies for years afterwards - SPECTRE comes up with some nefarious plot to set the superpowers at each others' throats. That's it. That's your plot, folks. It made no sense then, it made no sense in any of the many subsequent Bonds which used it, and it makes no sense now.Didn't stop the movie being hugely entertaining, though.The sad thing is that this is the last of the films to carry genuine echoes of Fleming's original novel, namely the Japanese location, Kissy Suzuki (and Tiger Tanaka and Dikko Henderson), as well as Blofeld's private island. It is just that Bond's motivation here is to prevent Blofeld's plan to start World War III rather than revenge for the murder of Tracy at the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.With the benefit of 40-odd years' hindsight and great over-familiarity with You Only Live Twice, I wonder what an adaptation of Fleming's novel would have been like? Great score from John Barry, by the way.",You Only Live Twice
32,Uriah43,Manages to Entertain Fairly Well,7,21 May 2013,"An American spacecraft in outer space has been swallowed up by an unidentified flying object. The Americans blame the Soviets. The Soviets deny the allegation. In the meantime, ""James Bond"" (Sean Connery) is set up by an attractive Chinese woman named ""Ling"" (Tsai Chin) and is murdered. Or at least that's what MI5 wants the world to think. From the information they have been able to gather the unidentified flying object has touched down somewhere near Japan and that is where James Bond is sent to investigate. But he only has a short time because the Americans are planning on launching another rocket and have warned the Soviets that they will declare war if anything happens to this one. At any rate, rather than go into great detail on what happens next and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this film probably doesn't receive as much attention as some of the others in the James Bond series. Personally, I enjoyed the location, the music and the way Mie Hama (""Kissy"") looked in her white swimsuit. Be that as it may, while it may not be the best James Bond film ever produced, it manages to entertain fairly well and I have rated it accordingly.",You Only Live Twice

Turns out to once again be the work of criminal organization SPECTRE, who hope to gain world domination by the provoked war between the superpowers. Bond must go undercover in Japan to investigate, and in order to do that, must make the world believe that he has been killed.Donald Pleasance makes an amusing Blofeld, the first time the viewer gets a look at him, though considering his later penchant for disguises and decoys...can we really be sure?

35,Aaron1375,Overall entertaining,8,22 November 2002,"This Bond flick is pretty entertaining, but it probably had more relevance back when it was first put out than it does today.  SPECTRE is capturing US and Russian space ships to try to get both sides to go to war against each other.  Britan feels the mysterious ship that captures the two countries rockets took off from Japan.  So James Bond is sent on the case, but he is then apparently killed, though this is not really so, it is staged to try and throw people off (hence the title).  The movie has some really entertaining scenes as Bond goes through Japan to solve the case which leads him to an island and a volcano base and Blofeld the mysterious leader of SPECTRE played superbly here by Donald Pleasence.  Some of the effects in this one are kinda bad and some of the story could use some work, but all in all an enjoyable flick.",You Only Live Twice
36,Wuchakk,James goes to Japan,8,1 October 2013,"""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) takes agent 007 to Japan where he seeks the secret SPECTRE installation responsible for literally stealing space capsules and threatening war between the USA and USSR.This 5th installment in the franchise upped the ante with the action & spy-stuff and is more dynamic than the previous ones. Speaking of the spy aspects, they're often over-the-top here to the point of being cartoonish. Another reviewer criticized the film in this regard -- pointing out that it was this film more than any other that gave the Austin Powers movies the most material to spoof -- and he was right. One scene, for instance, brought to memory that Gilligan's Island episode where Gilligan had a dream of being Agent 014 (remember the soup spoon?). No wonder the franchise got goofier in the 70s -- it was the next logical step.Disregarding the ""Yeah, right"" spy shenanigans, ""You Only Live Twice"" has everything you'd want in a Bond picture -- the action, intrigue, gadgets, beautiful women, spectacular locations and larger-than-life villains. The story is interesting enough that it keeps you absorbed and even builds suspense as the film goes from one action scene to another, culminating in the explosive climax. It was understandably a huge hit in 1967.The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot mostly in Japan, but also England, Spain and Gibraltar.GRADE: A-",You Only Live Twice

It didn't start great with Dr. No, it got a bit better with From Russia With Love, to be good with Goldfinger and Thunderball. So I was expecting it to get even better but it turned out to be disappointing. I would rate it the same as From Russia With Love. The story is just not that good, the special effects rather disappointing (even for 1967), and the Bond gadgets not very original. But it's the story that is just not good enough. It's still James trying to solve a major problem, and that while conquering as many women as possible. He's still a bit sexist, and the women still beautiful but a bit naive, nothing new here in this OO7 movie. Up to the next one! On Her Majesty's Secret Service...",You Only Live Twice
39,SimonJack,Space race is setting for this James Bond film,8,23 September 2017,"This is the fifth of the James Bond series with Sean Connery as Agent 007. The progression continues with global travels and exotic locations. This time, much action takes place in Japan and its islands, after visits to Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Bermuda, Spain and Norway. And, for complimentary allies for the big battle scene that has become common in the Bond films, this one has Ninja warriors. ""You Only Live Twice"" has a nice, intriguing opening. And, it has more advanced technical weapons and toys for Bond to use – or play with, as he often seems to be doing. This film has him using Nelly, the super mini-helicopter assembled from a carton, and with super firepower. The film is also a good reminder about smoking being hazardous for one's health. The scenery in Japan is beautiful. For as tight and secretive as Tanaka's Japanese secret service was supposed to be, it was interesting that he should have two moles inside from the dastardly SPECTRE. The plot for this film was especially intriguing at the time of the film's release. In 1967, the U.S. and Soviet Union indeed were in the space race – as though one might dominate space. The use of film clips of the U.S. and Soviet launches of the orbiting space flights was very good. The artwork in special effects of the SPECTRE spacecraft gobbling up the American and Soviet space capsules is very good, and humorous. Each time it showed that, it looked as though the predator was an alligator swallowing a big bullet. This was a fun and very entertaining film in the James Bond series.",You Only Live Twice

41,ShadeGrenade,Bond turns Japanese!,8,15 April 2010,"I regret not having seen 'You Only Live Twice' in a cinema. I first saw it on I.T.V. in the autumn of 1977. My enjoyment was ruined by the fact I'd seen 'The Spy Who Loved Me' at my Odeon only the day before. It felt like watching the same film twice.The first four Bond films had grossed millions, inspired hordes of imitations, and become an important part of '60's pop culture. But for how much longer could the series last? Critics questioned its long-term viability; with each new movie, costs rose astronomically, the books were starting to run out, and anyway, Connery was talking about quitting. So surely the end was in sight for 007?'Twice' was based on one of Ian Fleming's last works. A thoughtful if morbid story of death and revenge set in Japan, it was unfilmable as it stood, hence a new plot was devised. Harold Jack Bloom did the first draft before giving way eventually to Roald Dahl. With the Moon landings only two years away, it made sound commercial sense to do a space story. Bond's death is faked to convince his enemies he is no longer a threat ( an idea possibly pinched from the 'Matt Helm' picture 'Murderer's Row' ). SPECTRE ( Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Revenge & Extortion ) is plotting to start World War 3 by stealing American and Russian space capsules. While the super powers argue amongst themselves, the real baddies are holed up in a volcano in Japan. 'Twice' presents us with our first look at arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. I have to say I found him a hit hammy, and you can see why Mike Myers chose to burlesque him in the 'Austin Powers' movies. Connery sleepwalks through the story, his boredom with 'Bond' visible on screen. Akiko Wakabayashi is impressive as 'Aki' of the Japanese Secret Service with Mie Hama barely adequate in the role of 'Kissy'. German actress Karin Dor smolders as SPECTRE agent 'Helga Brandt'.With so many imitations around, Eon decided to outdo them all in terms of gadgetry ( love the rocket-firing cigarettes and safe-cracking device! ) and lavish spectacle ( the car chase, helicopter battle and climactic fight in the volcano rocket base ). The film is at its best in its quieter moments, most notably the death of Aki ( she is poisoned as she sleeps ) and Bond's chat with Henderson ( Charles Gray ) has some witty lines. The fight at Kobe docks is great though, with Bond chased across rooftops by killers. Lewis Gilbert, fresh from 'Alfie', handles it all well enough, but there's no getting away from the fact that this is a Bond movie without Bond. Though 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ) stars a different Bond, it is a far superior film. The real star of 'Twice' is Ken Adam, whose production designs are outstanding, particularly Mr.Osatu's office and the volcano. John Barry contributes another memorable score, with Nancy Sinatra singing the memorable title theme.In a break with tradition, M's London office is not featured, instead Bond is briefed aboard a private submarine. Bond tells Moneypenny that he took Japanese at Cambridge. Anyone familiar with the books will tell you that he never went to university. Great entertainment, but a step-down after the superb earlier movies. Fortunately, by the time 'O.H.M.S.S.' appeared, the Bond knock-offs had all disappeared from sight, leaving 007 as the sole survivor of the '60's spy boom.",You Only Live Twice
42,JamesHitchcock,A film with a lot going for it,8,20 November 2007,"I was at primary school when this film first came out, and I recall being baffled by the title. Surely, I thought, it should be ""You Only Live Once"". When I shared my doubts with a classmate, however, he pointed out that the title was an accurate one; you do indeed live twice, once on Earth and once in Heaven. As one might expect from a Bond film, however, this one is not concerned with the heavenly afterlife. The relevance of the title to the plot is that Bond fakes his own death in order to trick his enemies into believing that he is dead.The plot, in fact, is fairly straightforward by Bond standards, and, unusually, most of the action takes place in a single country, Japan. The international terrorist organisation SPECTRE have developed their own fleet of spacecraft and use them to capture various American and Soviet space probes, hoping to provoke a war between the superpowers which will lead to SPECTRE achieving its aim of world domination. (There are hints that the organisation is in league with Red China, which by the late sixties had quarrelled with its former Russian allies). As with a number of the earlier Bond films, this one has a markedly patriotic tone, with the calm, pragmatic British trying to keep the peace between the quarrelsome, hot-headed Americans and Russians. Predictably, both the Yanks and the Commies fall for SPECTRE's plans; only the British Secret Service realise what is really going on, and dispatch their top agent Bond to Japan to investigate. Once there, he discovers that SPECTRE are operating from a huge base hidden inside the crater of an extinct volcano.SPECTRE were the villains in all the films of the Connery/Lazenby era, with the exceptions of ""Dr No"" and ""Goldfinger"". (They were to play a much smaller role in the Bond movies of the seventies and eighties). In previous films the head of the organisation, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, was a shadowy, faceless figure. Here we actually see his face for the first time, played by Donald Pleasence. This was the start of a tradition of having Blofeld played by a number of different actors, something explained away by making him a master of disguise who frequently resorts to plastic surgery. He also seemed to have a different personality in each of his incarnations. In ""OHMSS"" Telly Savalas played him as a crude thug with ludicrous aristocratic pretensions. In ""Diamonds are Forever"" Charles Gray (who appears briefly here as a Bond ally) plays him as a cold, supercilious English gentleman. Here, in ""You Only Live Twice"", the diminutive Pleasence plays him as ugly and scar-faced but camp and insinuating, constantly stroking a large white Persian cat. (The cat was also to reappear in later films). Pleasence's character was the obvious inspiration for Dr Evil in the ""Austen Powers"" films.This film has come in for some criticism on this board, but I have always regarded it, alongside ""Dr No"" and ""Goldfinger"" as one of the best of the Connery Bonds (which mean it is one of the best Bonds full stop). Although by 1967 Connery was getting dissatisfied with the role, he remains professional throughout and his dissatisfaction does not show in his performance in the way that it does in his next Bond film, ""Diamonds are Forever"". My only criticisms would be on minor points; for example, neither of the Bond girls Aki and Kissy Suzuki is built into a rounded character in her own right, unlike say Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger"" or Solitaire in ""Live and Let Die"". There is no memorable secondary villain along the lines of Oddjob in ""Dr No"" or Jaws in ""The Spy who Loved Me""; both the Japanese businessman Osato and Karin Dor's Helga Brandt are fairly colourless.""You Only Live Twice"", in fact, has a lot going for it. The plot, of course, is implausible, but that is true of all the Bond films. The fact that the film is set in a single country gives it a thematic unity lacking in most other films in the series, even if that unity does depend to some extent upon stock Western clichés about Japanese culture (sake, kimonos, samurai swords, ninjas). It has one of the most iconic villains in Pleasence and two of the loveliest Bond girls in Akiko Wakabayashi as Aki and the adorable Mie Hama as Kissy. It has a fine theme song, sung by Nancy Sinatra, and John Barry's hauntingly romantic musical score; together with ""Moonraker"", also composed by Barry, this is perhaps the best music from any Bond film. It has one of the great Bond sets, SPECTRE's headquarters inside the volcano. (Designer Ken Adam could normally produce something spectacular in the way of sets for Bond films, but he surpassed himself here). It has a couple of great action sequences (the ""Little Nellie"" scene and the finale when Bond's ninja allies storm the volcano HQ). What's there not to like? 8/10",You Only Live Twice

Plus, the hot girls don't have the funny names in this one. How much of a drag is that? Well, still, I can't deny that still this had a good plot to it.James Bond is back and must save the world when spaceships are hijacked. He is now in Japan and has a few accomplices with him, including his new beautiful Bond girl, Aki. Can they together prevent this spaceship from going into a nuclear war? You'll just have to see. Over all, this isn't a bad James Bond flick, it's filled with a lot of action and suspense.

44,DKosty123,Understated Bond Film,7,6 October 2006,"When I first saw this in a drive-in in 1967, the opening sequence of this with Bond being shot did not make a big impression as this is the first Bond film I had ever seen. After the credits, the snatching of a space craft made an impression as it looked very much like the simulations CBS used to broadcast of the real flights. While this plot & some of the special effects seem a little dated & far fetched now with the passage of time, Sean Connery is great as his usual Bond self in this one. Donald Pleasance is very effective as the heavy Blofeldt, one of several actors who took a turn at it.This Bond film gave me an appreciation for the scenery in Japan used and in the beauty of a Japanese actress who takes a back seat to no one. The save the World from Word War 3 between the US and USSR being plotted for by Spectre is the plot. Using a supposed volcano on an island as a space rocket base was quite a feat at the time of it's release.The scenery of 1960's Toyoko, Japan are very nostalgic now. The thing which makes this Bond a little special is the understated way the humor is handled. Using ""I Love You"" as a password for one thing. Of course, the irony of the line ""This can save your live - this cigarette,"" is still pretty effective. All the regulars in the series are here with Q much in evidence. This one is still a very pleasant diversion for a rainy afternoon.",You Only Live Twice
45,KineticSeoul,Ninja Bond,6,28 January 2016,"Despite this not being one of the classic Bond films. It's actually quite exuberant when it comes to the total package. Sure there isn't that many Bond action sequences, but it's just really amusing and the direction of this film really can suck you into it. Despite it being quite lame during certain parts of it, I mean there is a spaceship in the beginning in space that hijacks a American NASA spacecraft in the beginning of the film. And James Bond trains with ninjas and disguises himself as a disguises himself as a Japanese to accomplish his mission. Also the super-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld's headquarter is located inside volcano. So yeah, some aspects of this movie can be quite campy and humorous, but it's still quite an entertaining Bond flick. Sean Connery was the Golden Guy in Hollywood when this film came out and there was a lot of hype going for this movie before it even came out. After this movie Connery decided to step down from the Bond role and hang up his character's trademark weapon Walther PPK. Maybe because of the money issue or he just got tired or the role and the pressure which lead to conflicts with the producers or maybe a mix of all those issues. Anyways this is also the first film where the super-villain and James Bond's arch-nemesis Blofeld finally shows his face with his trademark Nehru jacket or Mao tunic and white cat. I appreciate this movie for what it is, because it actually tried to take some risks by making the setting take place in japan. It's also the film that introduced ninjas to the west, so Bond basically brought ninjas to the audiences or at least make it big during the 60's. Overall this installment is still a worthwhile watch, especially if you enjoy the Bond franchise for what it is.6.9/10",You Only Live Twice
46,OllieSuave-007,Bond goes to Tokyo.,8,25 June 2007,"This is actually the first James Bond movie I have watched. Being one of the most recognizable fictional characters in cinema history, Agent 007 holds a special place in my heart, for I parodied him in a college skit; fun times, and it was voted the best skit in the class.Here, Bond (Sean Connery) teams up with the Japanese Secret Service and their ninja force to find and stop the culprit behind a series of space-jackings before nuclear war is provoked. In this film, we get to see Ernest Blofeld for the first time, though he is played by a different actor in each film. The best treat of the movie is having Bond team up with Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) and Kissy (Mie Hama) of the Japanese Secret Service. His comprehension with both women were touching and effective, though I wish Bond was given more screen time with Aki; it would have been great to see them fighting the bad guys side by side. In addition, it was, unfortunately, clear that Connery himself was becoming disenfranchised with the series, for he showed a lack of emotion while pairing with each of the Bond Girls. This film, as with any other Bond film, was full of action and contains some of Q's best gadgets - a cigarette that can kill a person on the spot! This film pretty much drags in the middle, but otherwise, an pretty entertaining film with a great climatic battle.Grade B",You Only Live Twice
47,thesar-2,Watch Once: It's Not Twice as Nice,3,3 March 2013,"Bond is 1 for 5.In my ""Bondathon,"" I am watching all the Bond films in order, leading up to the newest one. I'm on #5 – You Only Live Twice, and Bond seems to be striking out all over the place.Each one, with the exception of the one great one – so far – Goldfinger, seems less memorable than the last one. It's probably because they made them in record time; some so quick, two were released in the same calendar year. And to think, more people complained when all those ""Friday the 13th"" films came out, practically back-to-back in the 1980s.From what I recall, and mind you, I just saw this, this cheesy film set in Japan (yes, much like the other cheesy series set in Japan. You know, the one about the giant radioactive lizard) involves Bond transforming himself into a Japanese ninja (no joke) in order to infiltrate a fake volcano and the just-now-seen-villain: #1, or Blofeld. Okay, #1: Bond looked as Japanese as I do straight. And #2, Blofeld looked as straight as I do Japanese.I digress, the movie begins with James's death and with the exception of the following 10 minutes or maybe another minute or two later, it's a quickly forgotten excuse for the title. Effeminate Blofeld, who physically tortures his white cat while petting it a thousand and one times – poor kitty! – wants to cause a war between the giants and then, I guess, profit from it. Sorry for the spoiler there. It's only a 45-year-old movie after allThe positives I came up with for this movie:  Everyone spoke English, so no subtitles!  Austin Powers will be a must to revisit once the series viewing has completed.  Bond always ends up in the water, but that doesn't mean he's washed up. Or  The Crazy 88 scene is a great inspiration to future filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.  The toy helicopter was great symbolism to prove this was, in fact, made for kids.  ""Spy"" Bond finally uses an alias. Way to go for finally adhering to Spying Rule #1.I won't 100% criticize this movie; it wasn't terrible, just completely forgettable. A throw-away little boy's fantasy movie – I'm guessing they made these more with little boys in mind, than any adults.I was ready to give up, but I know it has to get better in this series. And I will drudge On(to) Her Majesty's Secret Service(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",You Only Live Twice
48,lost-in-limbo,Bond goes East.,8,19 September 2009,"This particular 007 entry (which was intended to be Sean Connery's last before he would agreed to return one more time for his sixth shot as 006 in 'Diamonds are Forever (1971)' and lets not the forget the unofficial 'Never Say Never Again' in 1983) was the first Bond film I encountered and from that it has always remained a total favourite. ""You Live Only Twice"" we see Bond travel to the land of the rising sun (Japan) in what is quite an expansive concept (dazzling set-designs with spectacular non-stop action) and very well-budgeted effort that lingers on a extremely comic-book-like tone (thanks largely to Roald Dahl's industriously well-guided screenplay that plays its cards close to the chest) with its characters, atmospherics and set-pieces that for me would make it one of the most creative and exciting inclusions to the series.Bond heads to Japan racing to uncover the true mastermind behind the space-jacking that could see another world war, as British sources believe that the mysterious rocket ship which has seized American and Russian space shuttles originates from there, but those countries believe otherwise than each other for the acts.Couple of things which made it more the memorable would be that it's the first chance we get to see arch villain SPECTRE Agent #1 Ernst Blofeld's face, than just the hand stroking the cat although the first hour we get enough of that. It's a devilishly meaty Donald Pleasence who just seemed the part of Blofeld. Now who didn't love the hidden lair that was in an inactive volcano, and of course Blofeld's pool of pet piranhas. The inventive gadget novelty was really making a mark, just look the deadly mini-copter named 'Nelly' and the dangerous effects of smoking around others. Strangely enough the (witty) script seemed to spit out a few self-knowing quips involving cigarettes, which became rather odd. Director Lewis Gilbert (who would go on to control the very similar in story-structure ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and then following that the plain goofy ""Moonraker"") does a tersely capable job with a fast moving pace that shifted from one well organized set-piece to another (like the chase on-top of a rooftop in a fishing docks that's masterfully captured by cinematographer Freddie Young) to finally finish on a barnstorming climax (with none other than ninjas) and then a familiarly fitting final frame. Sean Connery might look a little tired (a bit funny trying to make himself look like Japanese under make-up), but remains just as charismatic and fittingly lean when it came to getting down and dirty (Bond and his tussle with Blofeld's massive henchman Hans comes to mind). The bond girls shape up nicely in the form of Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama and the stunning German redhead Karin Dor. Tetsurô Tanba was good as Bond's Japanese counterpart. Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn treat us to their iconic roles. John Barry's classy music score has a smoothly oriental touch, which can get actively copious when called for and theme song ""You Only Live Twice"" is enticingly sung by Nancy Sinatra.",You Only Live Twice
49,Robert_duder,Script keeps Bond fresh...another adventure takes Bond to Asia,8,6 May 2008,"I think one of the biggest things that has kept the Bond franchise alive for longer than any other series is that they never fail to keep things interesting. Ian Fleming wrote the books as diverse as they come and You Only Live Twice might not be the best Bond but it does open a lot of plot and takes some very nice twists and turns. Some say that this film was the disenchantment for Sean Connery and that it became campy and corny to some degree but I think that is exactly what the Bond series has always been. The campy humor and even Bond himself is a little bit cheesy and I think You Only Live Twice continues on that tradition and adds a little spin by putting Bond into the Asian setting. The film starts off with a bang having Bond fake his death. We discover more about James Bond and a little bit about his navy history. There is plenty of action and beautiful women and scheming SPECTRE agents and I think the highlight of You Only Live Twice is the fact that we finally get to see #1, the mysterious head of SPECTRE who has been nothing more than a hand petting a cat in the earlier films. Add in some training to Bond by a clan of Ninjas and you've got a classic Bond film campy or not.I still stand by the fact that Sean Connery is the ultimate James Bond. He is just always suave and beds the ladies like no one else. It's almost annoying now how often Connery ends up in bed with random women. I know it's a Bond staple but really it gets in the way. Connery does seem a little blah about the role but he still gives it his all and is as fun to watch as ever. The terrific Donald Pleasence is deliciously evil and looks terrific as the mysterious head of SPECTRE and doesn't actually make an appearance until the last half hour of the movie. He is a little campy as well but the scar is very cool. There also isn't much of a final battle between him and Connery. Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell return to their perspective cameo roles that made them famous as Bond's boss and flirtatious secretary. Akiko Wakabayashi is the Bond girl and she has much less of a role than some of the other Bond girls and yet her and Connery have excellent chemistry together.You Only Live Twice is epic in scale going from space to the waters of the Pacific to Japan. It has everything that makes the Bond films great including the trademark humor and Bond camp. The pure scale of the SPECTRE hideout inside the volcano is very cool and the Ninja attack is something to behold. This was years before the special effects of nowadays and it's easy to tell what a grand scale this was. The Ninjas and the SPECTRE agents battling makes the film worthwhile alone and is truly stunning to watch. Regardless of where on the scale You Only Live Twice is to you if you're a Bond fan or you want to see the Bond films then this one is one that you won't be disappointed in.

50,Lejink,"A funeral , a wedding and James Bond...",6,10 November 2010,"Britain's ITV channel is showing the Bond films in sequence on a weekly basis and I'm not complaining. Watching them on a cold dark winter's night allows me to indulge in escapism for a couple of hours at any rate and while the law of diminishing returns was starting to apply (Connery quit the series after this outing), there's plenty to entertain here.The topical mis-en-scene here is the Space Race between the USA and Russia which the dastardly Blofeld, here incarnated by Donald Pleasance, manipulates to his own fiendish ends, as ever. Our man in Japan, James Bond, goes undercover by going underground and underwater, in a manner of speaking, before resurrecting to save the day, barely 5 seconds from catastrophe.Sean Connery looks just past his physical best in the part, not helped by often wearing loose-fitting clothes, accentuating his middle-age spread, but otherwise he carries off the part with his customary aplomb, with the laconic one-liners getting that little bit more risqué as the swinging sixties progressed. All of the Oriental support ably support him, while the afore-mentioned Pleasance's presence is much delayed, perhaps too much of a cliché to be truly effective.There are of course any number of pretty women to be assuaged, although the chauvinism does jar at times, even allowing for Japanese attitudes towards their womenfolk. No problems with the fight scenes and particularly the action sequences, with at least two Bond classics present and correct - the ""Little Nelly"" helicopter shoot-out and my favourite, Bond's seemingly never-ending escape from the harbour ambush, with two superb flop-falls seeming to see him home-free, only for our hero to get kayoed from the shadows. The kitchen-sink as usual, is thrown at the conclusion in the volcano, with it seems, a cast of thousands shooting it out on the massive set.Freddie Francis' photography is superb, a virtual travelogue for the far east and director Gilbert mixes up perspective (some of the high-vantage shots are brilliant), although he's occasionally guilty of poor rear-projection work. Unlike its predecessor ""Thunderball"" where the sub-aquatic action bogged down the pace, here most of the action is either on or high above the ground and the film's the better for it. And to top it off, there's John Barry's sweeping title song and some of his finest incidental music, particularly his ""space"" music.Connery skipped ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", only to be lured back by a big pay-day for ""Diamonds Are Forever"", one of my very favourite Bond features - it's on this weekend, guess who'll be tuned in?",You Only Live Twice
51,ElMaruecan82,"1967 was a groundbreaking year, but not for the ""James Bond"" series...",7,4 December 2016,"""You Only Live Twice"" is the only James Bond movie I ever recorded on VHS, and by the law of statistics, it was naturally the one I saw the most, but my connection with the film is only limited with these nostalgic trivia and if I have a soft spot for this 'Bond', I guess it is only because it grew on me ""by default"". Said differently, I wish I had recorded ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"" or ""Goldfinger"" which are far better than the last Connery's Bond of the 60's. But don't get me wrong, the film is far above average, and average by Connery's standard is still good enough.First of all, let's give it the credit it deserves, in terms of special effects, it is quite impressive. You can tell that the series reached maturity judging by the art-settings and pyrotechnics. I read that some critics thought the idea of a spacecraft hi-jacking another one was ludicrous, but the scene showing the unidentified vessel literally swallowing a spacecraft had nothing to envy from a classic of the next year, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". That opening scene was well-done, and it was followed by other promising moments: a tense reunion where US diplomats throw the ball back at their Soviet counterparts, and Bond having an intimate moment before being gunned down in his bed. This is not the first time they try to fool the audience and the title is enough of a hint, so I doubt many then-viewers watched the opening sequences with concerns about their favorite Secret Agent's life. And speaking of the title, whatever rating I give to the film, there's one star owed to the magnificent score by Nancy Sinatra, there's something so hypnotic, sensual and strangely morose about this song that makes it unique in Bond's discography. But let's get back to the film, Bond is supposed to be dead. The film goes on the same joke and even features a funeral ceremony, where Bond's body is dropped to the sea, and this is where he's intercepted by a submarine and can be assigned his new mission. Sometimes, I love the Bond films for their opening sequences only, the mission is never as interesting as the little debriefing from M and a flirting session with Moneypenny. In ""You Only Live Twice"", the mission isn't as interesting as the setting in Japan, Bond must find out which mysterious country or organization is trying to ignite a war between USA and Russia. This is where the film really takes off and while there are many good things to appreciate in this first part, it's the immersion in the Japanese culture that provides some of the best moments, especially the trap door sliding leading to the meeting with Mr. Tanaki and the following massage session in his house, oddly enough, one of my all-time favorite Bond scenes.We all noticed Connery's athletic body and hairy chest in the previous films but it is quite uncommon that the physical attributes actually influence the dialogues. You can't tell if Ian Fleming wrote Bond with Connery's features, but it gave a realistic touch that the masseuses would indeed be fascinated by the hairy chest. Bond stops being a standard hero, but a character also defined by very specific physical attributes. I liked that part, and all the macho innuendo. Those were the days!After that, Bond encrypts a document stolen from a crooked Japanese businessman named Osato, and meets with the beautiful secretary Helga Brandt. I don't remember much from the first time I saw the film (I was twelve) but I remember very well that I had watched enough Bond films to know exactly what was going to happen. Ever since ""Goldfinger"", I knew the Bond movies always featured three Bond girls, two had to die, and the last one was kept for the final kiss, so I already knew the poor Aki would kick the bucket and poor Brandt would die in a way or another. But this isn't the best vintage of Bond girls anyway and the film kind of loses its pace during its middle section. To give you an idea, I remembered most of the film, but I had totally forgot about the helicopter chase, and I guess what it says is that many scenes could have belonged to any Bond film, which is the worst compliment you could give. Pussy Galore could only work in ""Goldfinger"", Red Grant was too serious to even work for Goldfinger but in ""You Only Live Twice"", the film needed to get straight to the final setting because that volcano headquarters was the highlight. But it's too short for the film's own good.Indeed, the climactic sequence finally confronts Bond to his archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played by a scary Donald Pleasance, but nothing really emerges from this confrontation, except for a few chitchat, and many opportunities to eliminate Bond, except that, for some reasons, Blofeld's priorities were to dispose of his useless henchmen, making useless points before killing Bond when someone could rescue him. Since I mentioned Red Grant, I remember that he refused Bond's plea for a cigarette, Blofeld accepted. That he'd fall for a trick that didn't fool a henchman says a lot about how overrated this villain is. Or maybe he was just victim of this weird feeling of rush and urgency that couldn't exploit the climactic setting to its fullest.""You Only Live Twice"" isn't the freshest Bond, but at the very least, it's one of the Top 10 best of the series, marking the last Connery appearance, as he was afraid to be typecast and felt it was time to live twice a second cinematic career.",You Only Live Twice
52,richardchatten,Bond-san,5,28 August 2018,"Roald Dahl's name on the script should have meant a wittier and more grotesque adventure than this; although the car full of goons plucked off the road by a giant magnet and tossed into Tokyo Harbour is classic Dahl. The action scenes are often spectacular but inclined rather obviously to have been achieved with stuntmen by the second unit, with Connery's close-ups clearly matted in later, heightening the sense of a star wandering in and out of his own movie.The characterisations alotted most of the supporting cast tend to be bland, and the leading lady is bizarrely replaced with a new one during the interminable 'Ninja Training School' section that further postpones our first proper meeting with Donald Pleasance's flesh-crawling Blofeld in his lair (which resembles a more megalomaniacal version of the launching pad beneath Jeff Tracy's swimming pool from which Thunderbird One used to emerge).An extremely large cast of speaking parts includes several well-known actors whose contribution bizarrely goes uncredited (including Alexander Knox as the US President), while others like Burt Kwouk as 'Spectre 3' are plainly dubbed.",You Only Live Twice
53,bowmanblue,You only have to watch the second half,7,13 June 2014,"Despite enjoying Connery's Bond, I hated the previous outing (Thunderball). Therefore, I'm severely glad they upped their game with 'You Only Live Twice.' However, in my opinion, it does take its time getting to the good bits. The first half feels like Bond wandering round Japan, stumbling into one hostile situation after the next.Luckily, once he figures a few things out (roughly around the halfway mark) the film not only picks up, but continues to set the template for many of the Bond movies to come.For a start... we have the return of SPECTRE, who are up to their old tricks again and trying to start a new world war between America and the USSR. Not only that, but without this film, you would never really get as many Bond spoofs (Austin Powers, I'm looking at you). It's here that we catch our first glimpse of (Donald Plesence's) Blofeld - a baddie creepy enough to be imitated numerous times, but never outdone. Also, we have the first supervillain's 'lair.' Since You Only Live Twice, it seems that every baddie who's hell-bent on world domination has his own hollowed-out volcano, but you saw it here first.The action is non stop in the second half, but, because it's so original, it won't get boring (anyone who's seen Transformers 2 will know that constant action doesn't equal a good film). Plus we see Bond helped out by a small army of (disposable) goodies (a situation repeated in Roger Moore's Bond era).If it wasn't for the first half being a little slow, I'd say that You Only Live Twice is up there with the best of Connery's era. It doesn't quite top Goldfinger in my opinion, but it's definitely worth watching if you like your Bond, or just want something to cheer to on a Saturday afternoon.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",You Only Live Twice
54,ThomasDrufke,Dead Man Walking,6,2 October 2015,"I think You Only Live Twice suffers from the same mistakes that Thunderball made, which is trying to too much different. The first three Sean Connery Bond films are each terrific in their own right but they follow the same structure just in a slightly unique way. With You Only Live Twice (YOLT), I once again felt like I wasn't watching a Bond film at all.This film takes Bond all the way out to the Japan area and closer (but really farther away) to the inter-workings of Spectre. I'm on record saying that I have grown tired of seeing the leader of Spectre teased and teased in each film without any actual payoff. We get that here, but the Japanese structure gives this film enough uniqueness to hold me off one more time. Why it took them so long to reveal who is behind Spectre is beyond me, but I just think this and Thunderball were missed opportunities.The problem is that I can't help but think the reason to bring Bond to Japan was to appeal to a broader audience. That's fine, but if you lose the fans you had in the first place, it does no good. Another strange thing about YOLT is that much like Thunderball dealt with underwater sequences, this film dealt with space exploration and Spectre's interest in capturing American spacecrafts. It's just too out there for a James Bond film.But unlike Thunderball, YOLT only has maybe one cool action sequence and music that isn't as fresh or exciting as Thunderball. Although the climax of the film does give us action packed thrills and our first look at you know who, it doesn't save the rest of the film for me. The Japanese aesthetic ends up growing tiresome after you spend 80% of the movie there. I wish the franchise would have integrated the more interesting characters back at MI6 at this point in the series. Understanding that Bond is a man coming back from the dead in this story, I wish the films themselves would do the same. Return to what made the franchise so exciting and entertaining. +Spectre finally unveiled, sort of+New aesthetic+Ambitious-But the change to the setting seemed forced and money oriented-Silly at times-Why space?6.1/10",You Only Live Twice
55,cricketbat,"Good Bond, but not great Bond.",7,26 January 2020,"You Only Live Twice used to be my favorite Bond film, probably because it was one of the few that I actually owned when I was younger. However, I have to admit that it's not as strong as some of the other ones. The story meanders around a little too long and feels repetitive. The explosive finale is impressive, though, and the Japanese setting is beautiful. This is still ""good Bond,"" it's just not ""great Bond.""",You Only Live Twice
56,lesleyharris30,"A Fun, Extravagant Bond,",8,4 September 2016,"You Only Live Twice is a great movie with a well developed plot and a good cast. It is a very fun film in the 007 franchise as we see James Bond team up with Japanese agents to take down an organisation that have been destroying spacecraft. It has a sense of humour and never takes itself too seriously, which makes it an easy, relaxing viewing. It is, on the other hand, very typical, it does not really offer anything new or exciting to the franchise, which is why I chose to give it an eight over a nine. There is an overly large focus on gadgets, to a degree that it comes across as lazy writing. Bond rarely uses his own skills to get out of certain danger, as he has a gadget specifically made for the peril he is in almost every time. Sean Connery still shines in the lead role, even in his fifth portrayal of the character, his wit, charisma and screen presence is still highly evident, as well as stellar chemistry with love interest Mie Hanna, he holds the whole film together and makes it worthwhile. It is certainly flawed, but the imperfections of You Only Live Twice can be easily overlooked as it is an enjoyable, action packed installment of the James Bond franchise. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate the disappearance of an American spacecraft. Best Performance: Sean Connery",You Only Live Twice
57,CuriosityKilledShawn,The dumbest Bond plot of all.,6,9 April 2006,"Bond fakes his death to become a ninja and stop SPECTRE from profiting from WWIII after a series of space-jackings. What the hell? There's not many actions scenes. Sure there's the helicopter dogfight and a couple of chases. But not much else. Women are objects, fisticuffs are plentiful and plot developments hokey.YOLT has not a chance in hell of being taken seriously. I mean what's the deal with that big metal space shark that gobbles up US and Soviet rockets? The physics of it coming back down to earth standing straight up are laughable. And of course, the bad guy lair just HAS to be in an active/inactive volcano. And nobody knows it's there even though it must have taken a million men and 86 gillion parts to build. But never mind about that.Like before, the finale has all of Blofeld's men (that's the ORIGINAL Dr. Evil for all you kiddies) dressed in the same colored outfit fight the good guys, who are dressed in a different colored outfit. So it's really easy for brain-dead audiences to tell who's winning amid the incredibly fake fighting and blowing up.Between the mind, short-lived and sporadic action scenes, Bond does loads of plodding around, investigating, making minor discoveries. Not much excites or interests.It does have pretty photography and some nice scenery. But, in my opinion, it's a below average Bond adventure.",You Only Live Twice

59,kenjha,Stupid,6,24 November 2007,"All Bond films are stupid but this fifth entry is more so than the ones that preceded it. The plot is totally mindless - basically just an excuse to show a bunch of silly gadgets. Why does Bond turn Japanese, go through Japanese combat training, and have a wedding ceremony when he makes no use of any of it? Also, the elaborate scheme to have the world believe he is dead is rather silly when he then walks around without a disguise. It's understandable why Connery was ready to turn in his license to kill, what with the same plot repeated from ""Dr. No"" to this and beyond. On the plus side, the women are attractive as usual and there is a somewhat haunting theme that complements the Bond music.",You Only Live Twice
60,The-Sarkologist,It seems Connery is starting to get a little sick of Bond.,7,27 January 2013,"Finally, in this movie, we actually get to see what Ernst Blofeld looks like, though I have noticed in the next two movies that he appears in he does not have that rather strange growth around his eye. I suspect that by this point in the series, Bond is getting to the top of the Spectre organisation, as in the previous films he had really only been dealing with Blofeld's executives, but in this one it seems that Blofeld is directly in control of the operations from his hidden base.Basically somebody is stealing space craft and the Americans blame the Russians and the Russians blame the Americans. However the British, who are sort of acting as intermediaries, notice that the mysterious space craft is landing somewhere in the Sea of Japan, so decided to send James Bond (after his death had been faked in Hong Kong) to go and find out what is going on.It seems that Connery is getting a little bored with the series by this time (it is the fifth Bond movie he had been in) as his lines are nowhere near as sharp, and his style is nowhere near as good as what it was like in Thunderball. As it turns out this is the second to last official James Bond film that he appears in (and the only reason that he does appear in Diamonds Are Forever is because he was made an offer that he could not refuse).The entire movie, with the exception of the opening pre-credit scene, is set in Japan, though it is interesting to see Tokyo and Hong Kong in the late 60s. Hong Kong looks nothing like the skyscraper studded city that is does now, and neither does Tokyo. I guess back in the sixties they really didn't make buildings as big as they do now, but then again, the Empire State Building was probably still the highest building in the world. However, I get a little side tracked here, so I must say that it is a pretty good Bond movie, though it is a shame that Connery's interest in the character was beginning to wane.",You Only Live Twice

The best things about this movie is Nancy Sinatra's title track and the set designs including the huge hollowed out volcano. Even Donald Pleasence appearing as Blofeld isn't enough to bring this movie above average. Sean Connery is James Bond screamed the poster, but in could have read James Bond is Sean Connery, as it would appear that is all audiences wanted from him. With the exception of Marnie (which was considered at flop at the time) which no doubt was helped by a Hitchcock movie, none of his work outside of Bond made a dent at the Box Office. During the filming in Japan, it was announced that Connery would retire from the role of Bond after this movie.You Only Live Twice stopped the run of the latest Bond movie grossing more than the last.

66,johnnyboyz,"No second chances here, merely an entry dripping with cynicism and bloated spectacle that does very little.",5,24 July 2013,"And so here begins the first of several of its ilk. No, not a disappointing and often entirely frivolous Bond escapade whereby the success of the franchise thus far had gone straight to the producer's heads – where the idea of a decent spy thriller consisted of pretty people in pretty locations. No, for that had already happened for the first time in the last entry: Thunderball. Here, we witness that indelible instance of an manned craft of either American or British nationality isolated somewhere out on the open sea; below it or indeed in orbit around planet Earth getting snapped up by an intruding force or an outside agency – something suddenly rearing up and ruining whatever perfect synchronisation the craft was previously engaged in when it ought not even be there.The image would go on to open many-a Bond film over the years, two of which were director here Lewis Gilbert's other entries - some were better than others but almost all of them better than You Only Live Twice. Here, the process of swallowing up a space ship by another craft is built to through a crescendo of noise and panic, drowning out the pleas for help from the astronauts and the orders from the ground base - you can see why it was called upon time and time again in the future. The opening is a rousing and dramatic way to open the film, a film of which eventually peters out into being anything but.We all thought Sean Connery's James Bond was dead at the commencement of the last entry, didn't we? In opening at a funeral, with the man's initials on the side of a coffin as a room of mourners looked on, the worst was certainly insinuated. This was, of course, until a cheeky reveal saw him watching from on high at the ensuing service alive and well and with eyes for the widow, no less. Here, Lewis Gilbert goes a gear up and formally shoots Bond dead in a Japanese hotel suite – a night with one of those dangerous young women too entwined with the world of espionage to be wholly on 'the level' eventually catching up with the man and causing him to come unstuck at the bereft of global news. Bond's murder is, of course, bogus – a stunt utilised to have Bond's enemies think he's dead but it is largely unnecessary in the grander scheme of the narrative and, for me, is a gross misuse of the sorts of imagery one should use reservedly. British intelligence has the craft which swiped the opening shuttle landing in China, and with the Americans blaming the Soviets and the Soviets furious at the accusations with the British refusing to commit to a side, tensions are high. The next shuttle is due to be launched in three weeks thus establishing a deadline.So what does Bond do with this new lease of invulnerability that sees him dead and seemingly out of the picture? Why, only journey to the heaving metropolis of Tokyo and walk around its busy streets. Once there, there's some decent interplay involving important contacts in Tokyo and those whom would desire things to stay as mysterious as they are; a neat infiltration sequence upon adopting the identity of an enemy that leads Bond to a company headquarters and further answers. Bond's female accomplice this time is initially Aki (Wakabayashi), a character who has the annoying habit of appearing in her sports car precisely where and when Bond needs her when he needs rescuing. She is introduced after Bond makes contact with a Japanese secret service member named Tanaka (Tamba), a man who brings Bond into his domain via a trap door in an abandoned subway station which leads directly to his office – it is all very clumsily done. I suppose in what is somewhat of an iconic instance, this is the first time Bond genuinely does battle with that of Blofeld: the chief villain behind the SPECTRE organisation whose meddling, up to this point, in international affairs and such was the very reason for Bond travelling adventures to even happen. His appearance is ultimately disappointing, it isn't the explosive reveal twinned with the consequential drama as Bond goes up against his nemesis that it might have been.Whilst being too bogged down with uninspiring supporting characters and poorly written scenarios, this is the first Bond film one really senses is concerned with how to deliver an exterior experience more-so a filmic one. Historically, there can be little denying that Bond is even in Japan for anything else but a monetary reasoning; whether it be in trying to 'crack' the Asian market much like monolith European footballing franchises do-so today, or in just trying to cash in on his popularity over there, the whole idea of setting the film in Japan does leave a consistently bad taste in one's mouth. In this film, Bond is indeed quite literally 'Japanified', but for what reason? Later on, the film gets bogged down prior to the final assault on the villain's lair with needless sequences depicting Bond integrating himself with Japanese custom and going off somewhere so as to ""act"" like a married Japanese. No matter that World War Three is on the brink of erupting; no matter that millions will die. ""We must act quickly, Bond-sei"" reiterates Tanaka, but things certainly crawl along to a warm, cosy pace. Then there is the inclusion of 'Little Nellie', Bond's one-man helicopter complete with 'how to construct' montage, which exists purely to sell merchandise. ""It's a child's toy!"" cracks Tanaka. Of course it is, but it'll sell. ""Why not take mine, Bond-sei?"" Well, why not indeed? The resultant chopper dog-fight between SPECTRE's own is very much underwhelming. The film is, in fact, very much underwhelming and one of the sadder, lesser entries in a series that is otherwise quite enjoyable.",You Only Live Twice
67,filipemanuelneto,The film where Bond marries the first time,7,31 March 2016,"Directed by Lewis Gilbert, produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and with a screenplay by Roald Dahl, this is the fifth 007 franchise film, who reached, after ""Thunderball"", a huge peak of popularity. As in previous films, this movie adapts the characters created by Ian Fleming to an issue or problem of the current time, in this case the space conquest, held by US and Soviet Union, and the danger of Cold War, skillfully exploited in the film.In this film, the English agent is in charge of investigating the disappearance of an American spacecraft, apparently abducted by another vessel that re-entered the Earth's atmosphere over the Sea of ​​Japan. In the country of the rising sun, it will collaborate with local intelligence to investigate a chemical industry, concluding that is linked to SPECTRE, an association that he already knows very well. However, disappears another spacecraft, this time belonging to the Soviets, which increases the tension between the two countries. In order to investigate under-covered, Bond will need to take on a second life and identity, infiltrating among the people to discover the enemy base and fulfill his mission.The film has the usual Bond recipe: exotic locations, beautiful women, lots of action and strange and expensive machines. One of the most famous is Little Nelly, a small collapsible helicopter, armed with several gadget's whose Bond uses against his enemies. One of the most popular and iconic scenes is the apparent death and maritime funeral of Bond, an act of MI6 to give more freedom of action to their agent, whose body is quickly rescued by a submarine. Other notable scene are the abduction of each space vessel (US and Russia), swallowed by the larger SPECTRE's ship. In this film, for the first time, we see the face behind this powerful criminal organization: Ernest Stavro Blofeld, with his famous white cat. This film is also the first where James Bond gets married, although the marriage was part of his disguise. The agent, one of the most famous womanizer's in cinema, will only marry again (this time for real) in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".This film has inherited from the previous its central cast, who plays not only Bond but the characters M, Q, and Monneypenny. To the actors who embodied these characters will join Akiko Wakabayashi (in the role of Bond-girl Aki) and Mie Hama (in the role of another bond-girl, Kissy, with which Bond marries); Donald Pleasence incarnated Blofeld, the villain and Tetsuro Tamba played the chief of the Japanese espionage, Tanaka.",You Only Live Twice

Both countries believe the other is at fault, and so nuclear war is on the horizon if the problem isn't solved, so work out the logic and it's clear SPECTRE must be involved.The film opens with Bond getting shot and killed in Hongkong, but it's not a hard sell, or all that shocking of a scene. Pretty anticlimactic, really. Anyway, the move was a PR one by MI6 to keep Bond off the radar. He travels to Japan quietly to investigate where the rocket is coming from, where he encounters the somewhat mysterious love interest Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi)and teams up with Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tanba) and his village of ninjas to infiltrate SPECTRE's base, which they discover to be in a crater.The sensitivity to Japanese culture, or lack thereof, is one of the troubling parts of this film. Tanaka has a line about how women come second in Japan and oh how wonderful that is, plus Bond gets made up to look like a Japanese man, which includes ripping the trademark hair off his chest. That and the Space Race stuff makes this one of the least timeless ""Bond"" films.One of the other highlights of ""You Only Live Twice"" is the reveal of No. 1 himself, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasance). He comes off a little silly, but that could be because he was the basis of Mike Myers' Dr. Evil character from ""Austin Powers."" Pleasance is obviously a terrific actor and makes Blofeld an intriguing bad guy. His lair, designed incredibly by Ken Adams, contributes to the diabolical genius motif. It's so interesting how the ""Bond"" films, in particular this one, shaped the very framework of heroes vs. evil geniuses. So much of what we now know to be cliché began with ""Bond."" ""You Only Live Twice"" is either ""Bond"" at its most fun or ""Bond"" at its silliest. Everyone is bound to have a different opinion on that idea, but the truth is probably somewhere in between. I personally would give it a 7.5/10 here if I could. Certainly it would be nice to see the films stay true to a more serious, espionage tone, but it's the ridiculous that makes this fifth film most memorable.Whichever way you see it, ""You Only Live Twice"" holds an important place in the ""Bond"" canon.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

72,Anonymous_Maxine,"Good action, as well as one of the better stories in the Bond series.",7,7 August 2001,"What you have in You Only Live Twice is Sean Connery back as James Bond, and he is basically trying to prevent the outbreak of World War III, which later becomes a very common theme in Bond films. It seems that there is some sort of mysterious space craft in the Earth's atmosphere that swallows up orbiting, manned spacecraft, instigating accusations on the planet below. At first, the USA got a ship swallowed, and accused the Russians, informing them that another ship would be put into orbit within a month and if anything happened, it would be considered an act of war. The situation is complicated when the Russians also send a ship into orbit that gets swallowed. Obviously, Britain disagrees from the beginning that the Russians were involved, given the object's landing point (the Sea of Japan area), and they send one of their agents (Bond, of course) to the vicinity to investigate. In this installment, Bond actually gets an edge on the enemy because they think he's dead. In the beginning of the film, he is shot in bed in a scheme to fake his own death, hence the title of the movie. While You Only Live Twice has one of the more interesting stories of the Bond films, it also has some of the most outlandish situations. Some mad scientist seems to have built himself a secret lair in a volcano, from which he launches this mysterious object into space, with the objective of causing a war between the United States and Russia. It's the old `take over the world' theme, and it really doesn't work very well here. Obviously, Blofeld, the madman villain bent on world domination, was the subject of the majority of Dr. Evil's look from the Austin Powers films. The outfit, the scar down the side of the face, and of course, the ever-present cat, which Blofeld strokes constantly in true Dr. Claw form. Donald Pleasance, who is entirely unrecognizable as Michael Meyers' psychologist in John Carpenter's horror classic Halloween, makes a very good villain in this installment, even if his motives are clichéd and questionably sought. Also notice the irony that Pleasance was a main character in that movie, in which he struggled to kill the murderous Michael Meyers, and then 30 years later, his look in You Only Live Twice is copied by a hilarious comedian named Mike Myers, in a film that begins in the same year this film was made! While a great many of the situations of this film are highly unlikely  particularly those that deal with Blofeld's lair as well as his seemingly infinite power  You Only Live Twice is still one of the more interesting Bond films and, of course, it does star Sean Connery, who is by far the best Bond. On a trivial note, this is one of the few Bond films in which he never introduces himself in his infamous way (`Bond. James Bond.'). We get virtually the exact same ending as we saw in the excellent Dr. No, which suggests a need for some innovative scriptwriting, but the film still entertains, despite it many excesses. Not nearly among the best, but this is still signature Bond material.",You Only Live Twice
73,FiendishDramaturgy,Probably my favorite Connery installment,7,27 April 2008,"With Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama borrowed from TOHO Studios (yeah, the guys who made Godzilla so famous), away we go. Bond pretends to marry a beautiful Japanese gal and entrenches himself deeply inside the culture in another effort to thwart SPECTRE.This is a competent entry in the franchise, and takes itself far less seriously than previous installments, making for a much lighter, more fun event. However, with the lighter feelings, also comes a dialed-in performance by Connery. I can understand why he tried to retire the franchise, but he should have given it his all as long as he was cashing and spending Broccoli's paycheck...and THIS is my FAVORITE of Connery's Bond flicks.Frankly, I was happy he was not to be in the next Bond, and still believe today that Lazenby got a raw deal.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",You Only Live Twice
74,elshikh4,"Awfully Absurd, Uninterestingly Silly, and Dully Overrated !",1,15 August 2009,"A story about love, hope and self-discovery.. Naaaa, just kidding! It's another Bond, but not a classic, it's rather the classic Bad Bond. While it failed at making me complete it for nearly 3 times, there had to be a fourth one to be able to censure it sincerely!Screenwriter Roald Dahl claimed that the producers strictly enforced the formula that was established in the series' previous movies, so he wrote his script to it, and never took the job seriously. Well, IT SHOWS! It's all absurd, and not even amusing. The triviality is unbearable this round, especially when it sneaks into the movie's elements. It has maybe the record number for the image's goofs, and the goofy time, in all the Bond movies. And if the movie's makers were that negligent or stupid, then I'M NOT. There are endless mistakes to a degree where you have to think that the whole movie is one big mistake!The first hour gives you the feeling that this was made by all stoned people. Review this painful sequence with me: The Tall Connery disguises as the short Japanese killer who stabbed the British officer, and the killer's fellow driver never notices in no way?? Bond goes with that driver to the company, where he unlocks a safe to take what's in it, so what exactly he was stealing? And why?? Although the Japanese men knew about his breaking in, but they got to meet him peacefully the next day??? His Japanese partner rescues him, and despite that the building's guards shot him so closely, nothing hit him! And last but not the least, the image of this partner as the driver changes from cadre to another; she's on the right side sometimes, then on the left for other times. As you see, the dope was kicking!It's hard to figure out what the Japanese disguise has to do with the plot. And Connery' make-up?? That made him the most weird Japanese ever (tall, bows his head, and completely laughable!). Why all the LONG sequence about his marriage?? Why the marriage originally?? The movie transforms there into TV show about ""Weddings of Nations""! There are spaceships that land in volcano bases without ANYONE seeing ANYTHING?! Little Nelly fight sequence was so inserted, not to mention pathetic; for instance, the pilots of the attackers planes were all one!, but with the famous jazz music, it seemed wholly like a Bond dance in the swinging 60s; strangely, it summarizes the 60s' Bond and this movie's kind of fun perfectly!The scene where Blofeld has Bond at gunpoint, and then kills his henchman, really makes you want to cry! Number 11 falls for Bond in half a minute (if only life was like this!), however she attempts to kill him dully by putting him in a falling plane (what about one bullet?!). Q didn't do, or say, anything. I couldn't understand clearly why the first Japanese girl had to die wrongly? So they come with a new girl, ""Mie Hama"", who eventually did NOTHING by the way! And the ending just mimics the end of (Dr. No - 1962), and (Thunderball - 1965); it's natural that Connery got board, and wanted desperately to leave, or not doing the same idiot thing over and over again!(You Only Live Twice) is the first Bond movie to deviate greatly from the source material. So it's not Ian Fleming to blame. Yet, nothing is original except its stupidity. Ironically, the only outrageous scene, in the right spirit for Bond, where a helicopter grabs a car of Spectre with a magnet, was an idea conceived by Dana Broccoli, wife of producer Albert R. Broccoli. OH MY GOD, so apparently this script didn't show by itself one attractive thing at all!The special effects were poor to a cheesy extent, and if you think not, just remember the space shuttle! I couldn't believe myself when I saw the shot at the end in which the camera filmed the lair from outside the volcano, where it was added on another stock shot for a real explosive volcano emitting lava. This was so Ed Wood and extremely shameful for what's supposed to be a British big production! Actually, it doesn't need thinking to understand that the money paid over the huge sets was more than the attention paid to make anything serious or coherent!This is undoubtedly the worst performance and role Donald Pleasence ever did. He was a joke, an awful one to be precise. For more ordeals, you'd have great music, cinematography, and maybe direction. But as tragic as it goes, this was wasted and deepened the gullibility of the movie in disgraceful paradox.It's nothing but absurd non-stop action, so that's simply why it's one of producer Albert R. Broccoli's favorites. I have a British friend who deems it the best Bond! How can anyone love such a thing?! It's burnished rubbish, well on second thought; it's not that burnished!",You Only Live Twice
75,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,3 November 2020,"Yeah... forgotten isn't it?Maybe it's forgotten because they try and turn Sean Connery into a Japanese man to hide him and he just ends up looking like a harry chested Leonard Nimoy.Or maybe it's forgotten because little choppers are more Roger Moore than Sean Connery.Whatever the case, it starts off pretty strong and then falls apart at the end. The first half of the movie is Connery Bond, and in places it's almost surreal in it's imagery.... but it ends up with 007 Leonard Nimoy, and that is just a shame.I can't really hate on the movie, because parts of it are seriously good. I just can't get disguised as a Japanese man 007 Leonard Nimoy with a harry chest out of my head, and that is really the memory that stays with you decades after watching this film.But, if you can get beyond that, it's still a pretty darn decent 007 film.",You Only Live Twice

As a sort of middle ground between the action-suspense romanticism of Goldfinger and the cheesy, over-the-top camp of the Roger Moore era, You Only Live Twice often seems conflicted and goofy, uncertain of its own identity like an adolescent whose voice is changing. Sean Connery remains convincing as the suave ladies' man with a cool head under pressure, but it's hard not to snicker a little when he climbs aboard a tiny yellow toy helicopter and proceeds to mow down a fleet of full-sized enemy choppers with ease. Our hero is also beginning to show his advanced age during the infrequent fight scenes around the middle of the picture, with nameless henchmen constantly going out of their way to stand in the way of his slow, looping thrown fists. Bearing an armload of blush-inducing racial stereotypes, a cast so one-dimensional it might envy the depth offered by a sheet of plywood and an endgame that would rival any Saturday morning cartoon, it should come as no surprise that this episode provides more fuel for the Austin Powers parodies than any of its brothers.

The principle villain, the iconic Blofeld, doesn't even make a full on screen appearance until the final 15 minutes, and even by early Bond standards, his motivation is undercooked. Donald Pleasance is great, but the film needed far, far more of him.But there are a few fun sequences, the Japanese travelogue is nice and Blofeld's full scale volcano lair is AMAZING.",You Only Live Twice

The script is a return to a 'From Russia with Love' type plot in which SPECTRE, backed by Red China, enters the space race by playing off the Russians and Americans... The agent of his plans is a specially designed Intruder rocket which captures spacecraft and returns them to SPECTRE chief Blofeld's secret Japanese volcano hideout...To trick SPECTRE into lowering his guard on British Secret Service activities in Japan, Bond manages to fake his own death... Under the eye of SPECTRE agents, he is given a proper Naval burial at sea aboard a destroyer in Hong Kong, and his body is sent to the bottom of the harbor where a team of frogmen recover it and bring it to a waiting submarine... Bond, wearing his full Commander's uniform, is alive, thanks to a special aqualung, and he reports to M aboard the submarine...To avoid further detection, he is placed in one of the submarine's torpedo tubes and fired towards the Hong Kong shore to investigate the missing satellites... His contact is Henderson (Charles Graywho later played Blofeld in 'Diamond Are Forever'), who informs Bond of Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), the youthful head of the Japanese Secret Service... Tanaka forged a strong working relationship with Bond The centers of his operation were an underground Tokyo HQ with its own subway train, an ancient castle, and a training school for his Ninja forceAlthough the film does develop a flavor for the Far Eastwith its beautiful women, emerging technology, and ancient customsthe movie's story is a less than compelling one Impressive set pieces take over center stage at the expense of a sustained dramatic structure And ""You Only Live Twice"" jumps up from villain to villain, escapade to escapade, until the final assault on the volcano rocket base puts 007 up against Blofeld for the first timeIn spite of pushing aside a bowl of oysters, and drinking his favorite martini 'stirred, not shaken,' plus Russian vodka and Japanese sake, Bondlacking his usual charm is given little to do in the story The women in the film are actually much more interesting than him Aki and Kissy are the advance guard of the new Bond girlless breathless females who have more equality on the firing line In other words, they hold their own with Bond and help him out of more than a few scrapes with deathAki (Akiko Wakabayashi) is 007's guardian angel in Tokyo She drives an exotic Toyota 2000 sports car, and wears fancy Western outfits Kissy (Mie Hama) managed to resist Bond's advancesat least until the mission was accomplishedHelga Brandt (Karin Dor) turns out to be totally unaffected by Bond's charm...

82,barnabyrudge,"Outrageous James Bond escapade, enormously enjoyable despite being nothing like the source novel.",8,28 September 2005,"An entertaining and fast-paced fifth entry for Sean Connery as James Bond, You Only Live Twice audaciously (and cheekily) chooses to ignore the plot of the original novel and instead hurtles along its own merry route. Working from a screenplay by children's' author Roald Dahl, director Lewis Gilbert fashions a thoroughly enjoyable slice of escapism, brimming over with witty dialogue and outrageous action sequences.Following the ""swallowing up"" of an American space shuttle in orbit by an unmarked enemy shuttle, the U.S angrily accuses Russia of stealing their spacecraft and threatens to declare war if any similar incidents take place during their forthcoming launch. The British remain unconvinced that the Russians had anything to do with the crime, as they suspect the enemy shuttle (the one which swallowed up the American craft) actually came down somewhere in Japan. James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to Japan to figure out what is going on before it's too late. He quickly establishes that his old adversaries SPECTRE are the masterminds behind the scheme, but try as he might he cannot trace their operations base, which seems to be concealed in a remote volcanic region. Aided by the head of the Japanese Secret Service, Tiger Tanaka (Tesuro Tamba), Bond races against the clock as Armageddon beckons in an effort to find the criminal lair and put an end to SPECTRE's sinister plot.You Only Live Twice is totally different to the first two movies in the series (Dr. No and From Russia With Love) because it is intentionally extravagant and far-fetched. This is more a continuation of the style of Bondage we came to know and love in number 3 (Goldfinger) and number 4 (Thunderball). If anything, this one reaches an apotheosis of sorts in terms of ludicrous set pieces. Connery is brilliant as Bond (he had really had his fill of the character by this point, but was professional enough to hide his boredom while the cameras were rolling). Also, Nancy Sinatra belts out one of the greatest theme tunes ever to grace the series. And Ken Adam deserves to be showered with accolades for his amazing set designs, the pinnacle of which is the volcanic base used by SPECTRE (to this day, it remains the best baddie's lair ever seen in a movie). You Only Live Twice might not be one for the purists, but for anyone wanting to be exhilarated and entertained it really hits the mark.",You Only Live Twice

The evil Bleaufart is the epitome of the modern bad guy, a villain emulated and parodied ever since. As in the most Hollywood movies, you do not want him to be your employer. There is action in Outer Space, the ocean, a village, a training camp, dogfights in the air, and an all out shoot em up inside a dead volcano pitting armies against each other.

Only three satisfying action sequences and Ken Adam's masterful sets keep ""You Only Live Twice"" somewhat diverting.American and Russian astronauts are disappearing in space, and 007 (Connery) suspects SPECTRE. To avert nuclear war, he is ""gunned down"", shot through a torpedo tube, and sent to Japan, where a supposedly extinct volcano guarded by deadly helicopters captures his notice. Can Bond and his ninja allies stop Blofeld (Donald Pleasence) before it's too late?A rare Bond film running under two hours, ""You Only Live Twice"" is grievously rushed. It's the first consciously campy Bond film, though not in a fun way. Screenwriter Roald Dahl, he of the famously twisted sense of humor, seems to enjoy sending up the movie's emerging formula in ways designed to test a Bond audience's indulgence. A key contact is ridiculously killed within five minutes of introducing himself. Bond is ""turned Japanese"" by a bevy of beautiful women in bikinis.Yet Dahl doesn't provide anything humorous for Bond to say, just ""bon appétit"" when throwing an assailant into a piranha pool or ""cheers"" while dumping another behind a recessed bar. ""What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this,"" he asks Karin Dor when she pulls a gun on him, looking as bored as that line reads.Connery may or may not have let a miserable shooting experience affect his performance - it's hard to tell with Bond so minimized by plot contrivances and gadgets.The best that can be said for director Lewis Gilbert is he brings the right focus to the film's real star, set designer Ken Adam. Adam's famous million-dollar set, a hollowed-out volcano with helipad and monorail, is a worthy centerpiece for the explosive finale, but Adam's other sets, like the offices of bad guy Mr. Osato and good guy Tiger Tanaka, impress as well. You get excited just seeing Bond in them, feeling some of the same vibe the first four 007 films put across so effortlessly.Pleasence was the first actor to play Blofeld, and clearly the model for Mike Myers' Dr. Evil. His projection limited by an obvious height gap with Connery and a long scar running across the side of his face that allows him to move only one eye, Pleasence never establishes much menace despite the promising build-up he receives. ""Kill Bond! Now!"" is his signature line, and he's about as one-note as that. Ironically, future Blofeld Charles Gray is also on hand here as a Bond ally. (Alas, Telly Savalas, the best of the Blofelds, is not in sight.)I like the scene where Bond in his mini-copter ""Little Nelly"" does battle with four attacking copters, and another where Bond uses a couch as a weapon. The ninja attack is a great capper, too. In scenes like those, Connery looks in his element. But too much else is marking time between ludicrous, underbaked setpieces, with Bond looking confused if not disinterested. ""You Only Live Twice"" has the polish of earlier Bonds, and is not as bad as some later ones, but just doesn't stand up on its own.",You Only Live Twice
85,I_Ailurophile,"Big on flaws, short on value",3,8 January 2021,"If one were to rate the James Bond films from best to worst, 'You only live twice' surely isn't the very worst, but it could never hope to make even the top ten. This is at best an extremely mixed bag, and at worst, schlock unworthy of your time.There's something to be said for how YOLT is more memorable than many of its brethren, but unfortunately that's not necessarily a point in its favor. The plot is mostly serviceable, though with some scenes that are at best too silly to be believable. I'm ambivalent on Nancy Sinatra's titular theme song, but it does define the palate for John Barry's score, which is quite good, as usual. While some of the tropes of the 007 franchise are just as tiresome and overused here (especially Bond's lousy attitude towards women), we also see a Bond film that popularized tropes in the public imagination that are extravagant and silly (though admittedly fun, as guilty pleasures): the villain's lair built inside a volcano; the trap door over a moat filled with man-eating piranha.Sean Connery isn't my favorite Bond, but the cast does also include beloved series veterans Desmond Llewelyn (Q), Bernard Lee (M), and Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny), and it's a pleasure to see Charles Gray make an appearance, however brief. That said, one of the great highlights of YOLT--and to be honest, probably the primary reason to watch it--is Donald Pleasence as archvillain Ernst Blofeld. Even if any given picture is overall less than satisfactory, Pleasence alone is usually worth at least one view, and so it is here. His performance is understated, yet perfect, giving the mastermind a quiet malevolence and defining the character's appearance for moviegoers. To that point--cheers to the costumers that worked on this film!Unfortunately, the highlights of 'You only live twice' rather end there. Pleasence is great as Blofeld, but the credit goes to him as an actor, and not to the writers, in whose hands the role is wasted. For being a criminal mastermind, Blofeld and his underlings bungle the operation, needlessly exposing it: first by killing a photo-happy tourist who took a picture with an unassuming cargo ship in the frame, and later by firing rockets at Bond as he surveys otherwise inconspicuous islands from above in a Build-Your-Own-Gyrocopter. The ""evil genius"" doesn't work very hard to keep his ""secret lair"" concealed.And then there's the lingering issue throughout Bond films of interacting with cultures outside the series' primarily British-American purview. When does appreciation, or admiration, cross the line into appropriation, or exploitation? That's not for me to decide, but that the treatment of Japanese people, and their culture, in 'You only live twice' makes me a bit uncomfortable and gives me pause, which alone says much. And I only just found out that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, as well known for his children's books as for his racism, which rather tips the scales in a particular odious direction.To summarize: for my money, the pleasure of seeing the great supporting cast, and what fun is to be had in an over-the-top spy flick, is outweighed by the usual excesses of the series, the questionable screenplay, and the dubious approach on screen toward another culture.Again: This isn't the worst Bond movie. But it's definitely not the best, and I think the need to watch 'You only live twice' effectively comes down to how much you want to dive into the franchise. Watch with tempered expectations.",You Only Live Twice
86,ferbs54,Spectacular!,10,20 June 2018,"We now come to the one and only film in my personal Top 10 list that is not a perfect motion picture; indeed, ""You Only Live Twice""--the 5th outing in the currently still ongoing James Bond franchise, the longest-running franchise in the history of cinema--is very much a flawed film, with several moments of head-scratching stupefaction that might make the viewer wonder if he/she is witnessing a fever dream that 007 is having while lying in some tropical hellhole (and the lyrics of the film's beautiful theme song DO give us the words ""this dream is for you....""). It is not the most violent and groundbreaking Bond film; that would be the first, ""Dr. No."" It is not the film that hews closest to its Ian Fleming source novel; that would be the second, ""From Russia With Love."" It is not the most perfect 007 film; that would be the third, ""Goldfinger."" It does not have the remarkable trio of gorgeous ""Bond girls""--Lucianna Paluzzi, Claudine Auger and Martine Beswick--to be found in the fourth outing, ""Thunderball,"" and it does not feature the most tear-jerking and heartbreaking moments in Bondom, as does the sixth,""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" But what ""You Only Live Twice"" DOES feature is action, and spectacle, and color; it is the biggest, most lavish film of the franchise, and despite its flaws, it has been the favorite of mine and many others (for example, Mike Myers, who blatantly used it as his template for the Austin Powers films) ever since it opened in June 1967. I have often told people that the first six Bond films are the only ones that really matter, and that all the others (18 others, at this point) are just for fun. And ""You Only Live Twice,"" it seems to me, despite its many flaws and detractors, might be the most thrilling of that initial sextet. All five of the initial Bond films appear on my personal Top 100 Movies list, by the way, but this is the one that holds a special place for yours truly.Near the beginning of this 5th Bond outing, M tells 007 that ""this is the big one,"" and boy, do those words ever ring true. This is the first film in the 007 franchise that completely threw out the Ian Fleming source novel that it was based upon, only keeping the Japanese backdrop, and while Bond purists might object that this movie has nothing to do with Fleming's 1964 vision (which dealt with Bond investigating the Japanese suicide gardens of one Dr. Shatterhand, rather than S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s hijacking of Russian and American space capsules in an effort to precipitate WW3), and that the film is more sci-fi/adventure than the sexy spy thrillers that Ian Fleming had made popular, the fact remains that this Bond masterpiece is both the most visually spectacular entry in the 56-year history of the franchise, as well as the culmination of the four Sean Connery episodes that precede it. Sure, there are some things to carp about in this story, and many inconsistencies. Bond takes a martini that is ""stirred, not shaken"" (!), he conveniently has a safecracking device in his pocket just when he needs it, he magically has a ninja outfit under his fisherman's shirt and so on. But the movie is presented with such panache, and there is so much local Japanese color and scenery, and the sets are so very spectacular (there's that word again!), that these little slips just pale into insignificance. The battle at the end of this film, with ninjas pouring into the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. volcano lair, is one of the most exciting sequences in the history of Bondom; perhaps in the history of the action film. The Bond girls this time are both beautiful AND interesting, and Karin Dor makes for a sexy Bond enemy/lover. (In Bond movies, female enemies make for very strange bedfellows!) We finally get to see Ernst Stavro Blofeld in this outing, and Donald Pleasence does not disappoint (although, granted, he is NOT the Blofeld that Fleming had described). I have seen this movie at least 50 times since it first opened in June '67 (I saw it three times in its opening week alone!), and still thrill to its superb drive, color and action. The movie also features perhaps the loveliest of the Bond theme songs, sung by Nancy Sinatra, and all in all is a smashing entertainment package.Some personal background history: Back in June '67, my father dropped me and my buddy Dave off at the (sadly long extinct) Prospect Theater in Flushing, Queens on a Saturday afternoon; the first weekend after ""YOLT""'s opening. Dave and I had been friends for a short time, having, uh, Bonded back in day camp after discovering our mutual love of the Ian Fleming novels. We sat through the film two times in a row that afternoon, and as I said above, I saw the film again before the week was out. Back when I was a kid, I could think of no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than watching the first four Bond films on the big screen, at the (now sadly defunct) Queens Theater, which would often show them as double features. Though I was a preteen, for some reason, my parents felt it a safe proposition to just drop me off there for four hours while they did their thing (shopping). I must have seen those first four Bond movies in every possible double feature combination before ""YOLT"" premiered, and was thus well primed for this big event. The film blew Dave and I away that first weekend, and today, over four dozen viewings later, I still watch it with undiminished enthusiasm. What can I say? This movie brings out the kid in me, and makes me feel like I'm 12 again. And there is SO much to love in this film, despite the flaws mentioned above. The opening scene, in which Bond is ""killed"" while in bed with the gorgeous Tsai Chin (one of the few Bond actresses who would reappear, many years later, in another role; this time in ""Casino Royale""); Bond's burial at sea, with its beautiful underwater photography (reminiscent of the recent ""Thunderball"") accompanied by a truly gorgeous piece of never-used-again background music; the vastly underrated fight that 007 has with a Japanese guard (played by Samoan wrestler Peter Maivia, who, five years later, would become the maternal grandfather of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson!) in the Osata Chemical Company building; that wonderful car chase, culminating with a helicopter-assisted ""drop in the ocean""; the fight at Kobe dock, accompanied by the rousing ""YOLT"" theme song; the battle that Bond has over the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. volcano hideout in his ""Little Nellie"" gyrocopter (an action sequence that resulted in the real-life partial loss of a leg for the actual gyrocopter cameraman); the death of Helga Brandt (played by German actress Karin Dor, with whom I have been enamored to this day, and whose recent passing saddened me greatly) in Blofeld's piranha pool; the death of Aki, Bond's beautiful Japanese ally, by poison; and finally, that monumental final battle between the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. forces on one side and 007 and the ninja forces of the Japanese Secret Service on the other. This final segment, as I mentioned, very well might be the most visually spectacular (I keep coming back to that word!) sequence in the history of the action film, to this very day, and continues to amaze this viewer over half a century later. And while I'm on the subject, that colossal volcano set, designed by Ken Adam, is just absolutely remarkable, with its functioning monorails, spaceship landing pad, built-in observation windows, sliding crater-lake top and so on; a set that cost $1 million on its own to construct (ridiculous money to spend on a film set 50 years ago), and put together the old-fashioned way...with no green-screen special FX or computer enhancements.I have perhaps been remiss in neglecting to mention the contributions of Akiko Wakabayashi (Aki) and Mie Hama (Kissy, although her name is never mentioned in the film itself), both of whom are lovely and appealing; along with Ms. Dor, still another Bondian trio of female pulchritude. And the film's script, by children's author Roald Dahl, of all people, is a clever one, with any number of witty lines, despite its inherent flaws. Although many have complained of Sean Connery's apparent lack of enthusiasm in the film, and his visible boredom with the James Bond role at this point, I must confess that I have never been able to discern it on screen. Nor can I understand the ""Maltin Movie Guide""'s assertion that the film lacks ""clever and convincing crisis situations""; are they kidding?!?! The film is filled with nothing but! Anyway, I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. This film might be the only one on my Top 10 list that could be called a ""guilty pleasure,"" but my love and enthusiasm for it remain undiminished after half a century. The last time I watched this film was on its 50th anniversary, in June of last year, and I do believe that I'm about ready for another look. Arigato!",You Only Live Twice
87,ShootingShark,Fantastic Glamorous Exotic Thrilling Crash-Bang-Wallop James Bond Action Adventure Classic,7,5 September 2011,"A US space capsule is swallowed up by a mysterious craft and the Americans blame the Russians. British spy James Bond is charged with finding the truth, but when the same thing happens to a Soviet ship global conflict is threatened. It's almost as if someone were trying to provoke World War Three It's probably foolish to try and pick a favourite James Bond film, since so many of them are so much fun, but I think I'd have to settle for this one. It's really the perfect movie to see when you're twelve years old, and every time I see it it makes me feel that age again. It's escapist entertainment of the very best kind, with sensational action, glamorous and exotic locales, sexy mysterious women, a villain to end all villains (this dude doesn't steal gold, he steals spacecraft, and his secret base is in a volcano with an electric roof, its own monorail and a piranha pool for disposing of incompetents - that's a serious bad guy !), an incredibly cool hero to match and the fate of the world at stake. Roald Dahl's script just races along - it's a faked burial at sea one moment, corporate intrigue the next, a ninja army after that - the action is breathless but never stupid or complex. This is an idealised world where everything is perfect, from Aki's white Toyota 2000GT to the temperature of the saki Tanaka serves Bond, but it's a joyous fantasy world you can't resist. There are so many things I love about it, but best of all I think are Ken Adam's production designs, which almost defy description. The volcano set, built at Pinewood Studios, is probably the most amazing in any movie, but everywhere looks stunning (I wanna live in Tanaka's house) and combines with the terrific Japanese locations in Tokyo, Kobe, Kagoshima, or the incredible Himeji Castle (also featured in Kurosawa's Ran) where the shinobi training camp is. The movie is also a terrific example of continuity work; Blofeld's base is really five different places - locations on the Kyushu coastline (the village), the mountains of Anadalusia (the helicopter chase), the Pinewood set (the base interior), tropical seas in the Bahamas (the swimming/raft scenes) and special effects model work (the rockets) - I defy anyone to spot the joins between these in Freddie Young's sumptuous photography, sadly his only gig from the Bond series. Equally spectacular is stuntman / action director Bob Simmons' amazing work - the last twenty minutes as the heroes storm the volcano is simply outstanding in every detail. Although Connery went on to play Bond twice more, he was never better than here - handsome, suave, amusing, cool under fire, astonishingly unfazed by the sheer scope of the picture. The two Japanese damsels, Wakabayashi and Hama, are both gorgeously exotic, with flame-haired German actress Dor (check her out also in Hitchcock's Topaz) a great counterpoint as the delicious Helga Brandt, who meets with a fishy end. Tanba is great as Tiger, the Jap secret service boss, but best of all is an incredible Pleasence as the definitive bald-headed scarred cat-stroking uber-baddie Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who simply oozes villainy from every pore and truly makes us believe he would want to start a nuclear war. The final icing on the cake is John Barry's tremendous score, with its lush strings, brilliant use of the Monty Norman guitar theme and supercool title song, performed by Nancy Sinatra. I know James Bond films need to be taken with a pinch of salt, and are probably more than a little over-promoted, but this one really is the cat's pyjamas. It's just full-on entertainment from start to finish, and this is what movies are really all about. It represents a glorious age of sixties cinematic excess, a charming yet cheeky, relaxing yet thrill-packed adventure world we can all get lost in whenever we want to. Outstanding.",You Only Live Twice
88,Spondonman,The Bond Wagon Goes East,7,23 December 2012,"I first saw the 5th Connery Bond film one sunny evening in 1967, and at 8 years old I thought it was marvellous and perfect. Next time as a teenager I was horrified I'd wasted my time twice, but now over the hill I've just watched it with a more balanced point of view. It's entertaining nonsense.Trillionaire crackpot has convoluted plan to set Russia and America to mutual destruction and take over the world afterwards – apparently forgetting what China would've had to say about that. British secret agent James Bond is in Japan to follow the leads and bring the real culprit to justice – or is he in Japan mainly to widen the appeal of the already massively successful Bond franchise? There are many action scenes and romantic, or rather, sexual clinches along the way with many continuity problems and plot holes too, although none of it matters much: this is pure escapism. Favourite bits: the opening and closing credits with the slinky score; the clunky fight scene in Osato's HQ with the handy statue; the auto-gyro vs helicopters aerial fight scene; Aki's poisoning; and with a surprising lightness of touch the marriage to a woman with the face like a pig – Mike Oldfield even borrowed the tune to use in his Tubular Bells 6 years later.It needed Gerry Anderson for the special effects, and maybe the weapon-proof Prince Of Space for baddie-despatching qualities because Connery obviously couldn't handle more than 10 at a time. When his moment came Number 1 baddie Blofeld's character was rushed – his enemies were de-fleshed but he himself could have done with being fleshed out a little more to be a bit more cartoony. Overall a notch down from Thunderball but still an engrossing adventure especially if seen with rose-tinted spectacles on.",You Only Live Twice
89,davidmvining,The best Blofeld and a great action ending make it all work,7,29 January 2020,"This movie is a few things just under the surface, and not all of them work. However, the surface is just a solid James Bond adventure. We have all the typical elements and a plot extremely reminiscent of some of the other films, but it's entertainingly packaged and delivered.I think one of the keys to the film's success is that it balances the ridiculousness of its premise well against its tone. Using a relaunchable rocket to swallow up Gemini capsules in space is ridiculous, but it's presented without irony or tongue in cheek. The design of the ship is simple and somewhat believable while the plot behind it ends up making sense (though sending missiles to destroy the American and Soviet spacecraft might have been a cheaper and faster method for SPECTRE to use).Bond's mission is to fake his death (for no other reason than to justify the movie's title and some vague notion that people won't be looking for him) and then investigate the splashdown site of the rocket that swallowed up the Gemini craft (really, called Jupiter craft, but they're Gemini). It's just off the coast of Japan, so he goes into the country by being fired out of a submarine's torpedo tube and walking onto the coast. He meets the Japanese secret service contact Tanaka and works with him to meet a British contact who gets quickly offed. Bond uses his super spy skills to put on a jacket and surgical mask so that the Rock's grandfather can take him up to a swanky office where they will get into a fistfight and Bond will beat him to death with a sofa. Bond then finds evidence that takes them to a small island off the coast of Japan where he gets to use Q's latest invention, a little helicopter with rockets.It's really the village where the movie's problems pile up right on top of each other. The movie's a travelogue of Japan to a certain extent, and the village is where the movie pretty much comes to a halt to observe Japanese culture. There's thin justification for the minutes spent making Bond sort of look Japanese and marry a local woman, but it really should have cut most of it. It's nice to see how a Buddhist wedding plays out, but it doesn't really belong at the end of a Bond movie's second act. It was such a slowdown that my appreciation of the film really started to wane.And then Bond got to Blofeld's lair. We'd seen the set before, but I never really appreciated how big and practical it was until Bond showed up and started snooping around. He's back to doing his job instead of sort of falling in love with a local Japanese women he met five minutes earlier, and his job is to go up against Blofeld.Blofeld up to this point in the franchise, has been a shadowy figure of little interest. He sat behind a half screen in Thunderball giving ominous directions on extortion but little else. As played by Donald Pleasence in You Only Live Twice, though, Blofeld is far more interesting, though we only end up seeing his face in the final minutes. The performance is creepy and off putting. He's also smart and willing to do whatever is necessary to win. He is willing to go very large to reach his extortion goals, and that includes capturing American and Soviet spacecraft and provoking a nuclear war from which he will profit. Blofeld here is great.And the action is really good, too. The huge lair provides a great canvas to build a very large action sequence with dozens of performers. It's well staged and exciting with clear goals, a clear view of who the two sides are, and the background for the real action which is Bond going after Blofeld.It's a solid adventure, and a real step up from the meandering and boring Thunderball.",You Only Live Twice
90,Spleen,Yoooou ... on-ly live twice ...,7,16 December 1999,"Or so ... it seems:One time for yourself,And one for your dreeeeams-Oh, please.  This marks the first of the `how the hell do I work THAT phrase into the title song' Bonds.  I notice they didn't even make the attempt for `On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.  I wonder what would have happened if they had ...How dashing and sexy his verve is!As steady as basalt his nerve is!On Her Maaaaaaajesty's secret service!Seee-cret ... service ...Anyway, despite the impression I may be giving, I utterly deny the charge that this is the first silly James Bond movie.  Do you really mean to say that the swimming pool nuclear generator in `Doctor No' was drawn from life? That Goldfinger's plan to irradiate the gold at Fort Knox was in any way sensible?  I think the only Bond movie, EVER, with a CHANCE of escaping the charge of silliness, was `From Russia with Love', which I admit is one of the best.  And sure, the cat-stroking Blofeld IS a cartoon.  But how much of this is due to his re-appearance in VASTLY inferior Bond films, and to the fact that he (unlike, say, Goldfinger) has been so effectively parodied? (No, not Austin Powers.  Dangermouse.)  He at least has enough menace to justify his presence on THIS occasion.  The line that people are unable to resist quoting is evidence of that.Dahl's script is both clever and unusually lucid, and the lair under the volcano is one of the very best of all Bond sets: not in the least bit claustrophobic, it doesn't drain the excitement out of the final battle by confusing us about where everything is.  The Bond babes didn't do much for me this time around, but perhaps that's a matter of taste.  Wherever the boundaries of Bond's golden age are drawn, this one had better be inside them.",You Only Live Twice
91,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,I Only B@rfed Twice,3,24 December 2020,"Was this supposed to be a straight-up Bond film or a satire? Connery being buffed up to pass as Japanese. The Bruce Lee training. The arranged marriage ceremony. The fake honeymoon with an actress that looked as fake-Japanese as Connery did. And to top it off their hike up the mountain side, whatshername in a bikini and decidedly non-sensible shoes. How did she even keep those on after diving off the boat in the cave? Maybe they used the same movie glue that kept Connery's hairpiece on.And then she runs back down the mountain to summon help. Hey, I'm no geography expert but I'm thinking that a little elevation and no sun = too cold to be running around in a bikini in Japan.It was all so ridiculous I can imagine moviegoers bursting out laughing at the audacity of it all. Conceivably the most ridiculous Second Act of any Bond movie in the whole putrid series.On the other hand, if you watch it as a travelogue of Japan, you can enjoy the ride. I wouldn't be surprised to learn the whole thing was sponsored by the Japanese Tourism Board. Made me want to visit.",You Only Live Twice
92,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Did Roald Dahl even read the book he was supposed to be adapting here?,7,30 December 2007,"In this, Connery's fifth (and, at that time, final) turn as Bond, his death is faked, and he's sent to Japan to stop SPECTRE's plot to start WWIII, by hijacking American and Russian space stations in deep space, pitting them against each other.What SPECTRE has to gain by starting WWIII is not explained in Roald Dahl's gadget-ridden screenplay. Although there was a threat of WWIII, there was no real sense of danger or excitement, or urgency, in the story.Indeed, the screenstory has only a ghost of the plot of Ian Fleming's novel intact, (the Japanese setting, some of the characters, the oubliette, the Nightingale floors) and the film, after a good first half, devolves into a kiddie movie, riddled with continuity and simple logic errors, amazing coincidences, and more gadgets than a toy store.Ken Adams' much lauded set design looks, to me, like little more than a pre-fab warehouse.Connery does well, despite clearly being bored with the more juvenile screenstory than previous dealt with in a Bond film. He looks like a sweaty, hunched over Moe Howard in the mock wedding/ cover. After the car chase, foot chase down the subway, and the fall through the oubliette, we find out that the person responsible for said chases is Tiger Tanaka, Bond's intended contact? Why didn't Tiger just send a car to pick up Bond and drive him there and then let him in the front door? The film, shot wholly in Japan, looks exquisite; a major asset to the film. As is the beautiful music score.Overall, I enjoy the film, but few of the positives of this film can be attributed to Dahl's screenplay, and it loses a lot when watched on the small screen.",You Only Live Twice
93,brando647,The Most Fun of All Connery's 007 Films,9,13 September 2013,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is, without a doubt, my favorite 007 film with Sean Connery in the lead role. I know that alone is enough for some to immediately disregard my views on the franchise, but I can't help it. Maybe it's because I was younger when I first saw it and the goofier elements appealed to me, but this movie is a guilty pleasure that I proudly embrace. The movie was produced at a time when Sean Connery was growing tired of the role and the world was still in the midst of a massive 007 frenzy. The four previous movies had become box office gold, and this gave the filmmakers and studio the confidence to throw even more insanity into the mix. There's a good deal of WTF in the fifth Bond movie but it's still a fun adventure with my favorite secret agent. In YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the entire world is on edge when an American space capsule goes missing while in orbit. The Americans immediately assume the Russians were responsible. Soon, a Russian space capsule disappears and the Americans are blamed. The British, the only rational minded nation in the movie, decide to actually investigate the events and place their most effective man on the mission: James Bond. The search for answers begins in Japan where Bond finds a connection between the missing space capsules and a Japanese chemical corporation. After faking his death to get his enemies off his trail, Bond explodes onto a mission that will bring him face- to-face with the man behind the space capsule thefts and, in fact, the mastermind behind most of his previous missions.The fifth 007 movie is where the series started to go off the rails. With each adventure, the James Bond franchise was put in a position of out-doing themselves with each successive film. Or, at least, that's what they appear to have believed. In YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the action is amped up to all new levels when Bond joins forces with the Japanese secret service and, since this is a 007 adventure in Japan at a time when cultural stereotypes were still a fad, ninjas! YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE has Bond immersing himself in Japanese culture to fade into the background as he quietly moves from one clue to the next in locating the missing space capsules and their astronauts. This involves a bit of ninja training in a ninja school and an operation to help Bond appear more Japanese which involves shaving his chest hair, pinning his eyes back, and giving him a wig. In retrospect, I'm pretty sure the whole thing comes across as a tad racist but it's absurd in its execution. The ninjas join 007 in a massive final battle in the most iconic of super-villain lairs: a hollowed-out volcano. The production design on the villain lair here is some of the best. You can tell the Bond movies where raking in some nice box office totals because the producers went all out for the finale. The volcano lair looks great and serves as a perfect setting for dozens ninjas to repel down from the ceiling for battle while the villain's color-coded henchmen rain gunfire down on them. There's one thing you definitely can't deny about this movie: it's ambitious.But THUNDERBALL had a jetpack! How do you beat a jetpack? With a militarized gyrocopter, of course. Little Nellie is probably the most memorable aspect of the movie for me. Looking back on YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, it's the first thing that comes to mind. The 007 theme kicking in as Bond engages in battle over a volcano with four full-sized helicopters from the tiny cockpit of Little Nellie, and schooling them with his over-zealous array of weapons, ranging from flamethrowers to heat-seeking missiles. Did I mention this movie was sort of over-the-top? It's just so much fun though, and that's what I love about it. Sure, the first two movies were bona fide spy films and GOLDFINGER was iconicbut this remains my favorite Connery/Bond film for just how out-there it gets. As an added bonus, this movie features what I believe to be the greatest on-screen depiction of 007's original nemesis: Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Blofeld, seen for the first time without obstruction, is portrayed by Donald Pleasence and it's the most recognizable version of the character in the series. Blofeld would go on to be played by other actors in later films (including Charles Gray, who plays MI6 operative/007 contact Henderson in this film) but it's Pleasence's calm demeanor, scarred visage, and pet cat that would be forever remembered and eventually parodied in the form of Mike Myers' Dr. Evil.My love for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE probably isn't the popular opinion, but for anyone who dares claim it was the worst of the Connery films, I have three words for you: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Regardless, I love it. The Japanese culture (and the ninjas), the epic volcano battle, the humor, and Sean Connery pretending to fly a tiny gyrocopter against a projected screen it all comes together for the most fun of all Connery's adventures as secret agent 007.",You Only Live Twice
94,Gislef,"""Stirred, not shaken?!?""",5,15 December 1998,"Screenplay writer Roald Dahl sets the formula for many Bond movies to come: huge super-villain bases, incredible chase/stunt sequences, and SPECTRE's hands-on approach.  On the other hand, he seems unfamiliar with Fleming's work or any of the movies that have gone before.  Having Bond accept a martini ""stirred, not shaken"" is an inexplicable lapse.Overall, You Only Live Twice is a credible effort, but falls apart on two particulars:  Donald Pleasance's inexplicable miscasting as Blofeld, and the huge padding (even by Bond movie standards).  Bond gets a photo connecting Osato to SPECTRE and locating the bad guy's island HQ...and he then spends the next half hour investigating Osato to figure out what his connection to SPECTRE is.  Duh.  Blofeld is also incredibly dumb:  he stops to shoot Osato rather than Bond, then leads Bond out the escape hatch and _then_ tries to shoot him (and fails, naturally).  Double duh.

(PG)After faking his death, James Bond (Connery) travels to Japan to investigate the hijacking of American spacecraft, stumbles upon typically elaborate and unbelievable SPECTRE plot. The seams of the formula were starting to show in this fifth outing; overly reliant on gadgets and extravagance, with a few too many culturally outdated moments for comfort (Connery is even ""turned Japanese"" at one point). Plotting is weaker than usual, though most of the first half presents an engaging spy yarn, and the second half may give way to implausibilities and silliness (ninja army training!), but it does feature Ken Adam's magnificent volcano lair sets and an impressively staged climactic battle. Pleasence finally provides a face for ultimate 007 nemesis, Blofeld, but the actual performance is a little underwhelming for such a monumental figure in villainy (weirdly, Gray, who has a small role here as a British Intelligence officer, would play the character in ""Diamonds Are Forever""). Screenplay by Roald Dahl; barely resembles Ian Fleming's source novel beyond a few incidents and character names. Nancy Sinatra sings the title tune.66/100",You Only Live Twice

I especially dislike ""Live and Let Die"" and (shutter) ""Octopussy"". I also think ""OHMSS"" is great even with that ""George Lazenby"" fella. A more basic storyline and the only new major gimmick is a baby helicopter. It reminds me a lot of ""Dr. No"". Flawless restoration in 2015 is a huge bonus! A few flaws easily forgiven after 39 years include b/w stock footage with scratches and ""Aki"" wearing almost nothing-to speak-of. A Bikini and a cotton wraparound are insufficient ""cover"" while dashing up a mountainside or on a combat mission. Her skin would have been ripped-to-shreds! The Japanese location photography is most enjoyable and done with ""respect"" for the culture. Typical shoot 'em up ending is inevitable. Most (not all) 007 missions end in explosions and fire.

97,MartianOctocretr5,Typical Bond vehicle,7,19 September 2006,"The title derives from Bond faking his death, so he can go on another spying adventure unsuspected. This plot twist really adds little (other than the catchy title), since it could have been utilized in any of his many adventures. In fact, it's the very kind of trick his adversaries would expect him to pull.But the film, while not being the best of the Connery era episodes, is still complete with the unique spy weapons, pursuing enemy agents, gorgeous women, exotic locales, and chaotic violence that made the king of spy guys so fun to watch. It also sports my personal favorite Bond movie scores; haunting yet elegant music that accentuates and fits well any type of scene where it's used during the movie.Instead of globe trotting all over, agent 007 carries out his mission mostly in one place, Japan. He is given a ""secret identity"" (Bond with a secret ID? Wow!) Part of his cover involves having a beautiful wife. Somehow, Connery doesn't seem to mind this, or feel too bad about another girl he had working with through the first half of the movie, who ends up the way any woman he's involved with ends up when the enemy spies catch up with her.There are some cool scenes ever present with these high tech villains that Bond has to deal with; I love the entire mountain top that's a disguise for a base! This is great spy stuff; no wonder the Bond movies inspired so many imitators. The guest bad guy is a sinister Donald Pleasance, looking more insane than usual, holding a fur ball cat everywhere he goes.Fun and distinctly Bond over the top action.

The first hour really sucks you in. So many things happen. Bond meets an informer, he's killed by assassin, and 007 kills the assassin and takes his place and that leads him to Osaka company.
What really makes this extravaganza stand out are great set pieces like the volcano lair, beautiful shot of Japan, it's culture captured really well and a very enthusiastic supporting cast.

The Americans and Russians blame each other at first and World War 3 nearly breaks out but Bond learns these disappearances are the responsibility of SPECTRE and Blofeld. Bond then ends up at the volcano where a base has been constructed inside it. During the final battle, Blofeld escapes and blows up the base, Bond blows up the capsule responsible for gobbling up the spacecraft and then escapes with the Japanese agent he fell in love through all of this.

While the first few films in the franchise proved smash successes, establishing a formulaic template which appeared a sure fire route to ticket sales, (suave Bond! beautiful women! dastardly villains with fiendish master plans! jaw-dropping stunts and gadgets!) as producers attempted to up the ante with all successful components, each 007 film began to feel more cluttered, patchwork, and deprived of the edgy spark which made the character a success in the first place. This trend hit a gruesome apex in You Only Live Twice, which exemplified all of the successful elements of the Bond series to gaudy excesses, replacing the gritty realism which once so fully captured the spirit of the character in his first few screen incarnations, replaced instead with a Technicolor cartoon and all of the complexity one would entail.You Only Live Twice comes across as one of the most dated 007 films when viewed in a contemporary context, as the film seemingly attempted so hard to hammer the spirit of the sixties that it remains firmly entrenched within the decade. From the now paltry but at the time impressive special effects (the rocket devouring rocket which was mimicked so tasteful in The Spy Who Loved Me here is simply laughably poor) and ludicrous gadgets to Bond's casual sexism being intertwined with cringe-worthy racial remarks, few Bond films have dated as poorly. Here it becomes readily apparent that the producers of the Bond franchise had learned to accept their character and formula as a sure thing to easy money, this inherent confidence leading to a slew of astounding creative misfires that more careful consideration would filter out. The entire ""Bond becoming a Japanese man"" sequence is just wrong in every way, but the film's lazy, ham fisted screenplay by children's author Roald Dahl makes such jaw dropping lapses in credibility seem second nature, making the film only memorable through its forays into poor taste. However, the film's lavish sets and production design are flooring even in a modern day: Blofeld's volcano base is such an expansive work of creative genius and vision that it cannot help but enthrall - while it may hold true to the spirit of the Bond series getting increasingly overblown, the larger than life sets are one example where such an aim works. Unfortunately, the normally reliable John Barry's musical score is a rare misfire, a chaotic, clashing mishmash which entirely fails to capture the intoxicating beauty of the Japan locations. Similarly, the normally reliable Nancy Sinatra's title track similarly seems unmemorable and uninspired, a spirit the opening credits her song is played over reflects (yes we get the volcano innuendo, but repeating it over and over makes it less clever...). The action sequences, normally a highlight of a 007 film, also fall prey to the film's senseless excesses, proving a serious deterrent to the overall quality of the work. Far too long and with nothing exhilarating or suspenseful to their name, these interludes appear to be simply showcasing the film's vast budget and accomplishing nothing positive in the process - the absurd and astoundingly boring ""Little Nellie"" gyrocopter chase being a perfect example. The film also tragically marks the hardly subtle tiring of Sean Connery of the Bond series, as the star who once dripped charisma and a suave sense of underlying threat delivers a monotone, firmly autopilot performance which can be considered nothing less than an almost criminal disappointment. In contrast, despite typically being cast moreso for their appearances than acting abilities, Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama deliver charming and spunky performances as Aki and Kissy, the two mysterious Japanese women Bond continually crosses paths with. Similarly, Tetsuro Tamba is pure class as Tiger Tanaka, Bond's dignified Japanese contact. As the finally revealed criminal mastermind of the first few Bond films, Donald Pleasance may carry an iconic look as scarred antagonist Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but his cowering, minute form and wavery voice fail to instill the character with more than an ounce of menace. Similarly, Karin Dor does her best with a femme fatale clearly ripped off Thunderballs's Fiona Volpe, but while carefully purloining her mannerisms and general appearance she neglects Volpe's trademark feisty menace.While the film still caries the endearing charm of the other Bond films of the sixties and fans of the series will no doubt find elements to nostalgically cherish, for those unfamiliar with the 007 franchise You Only Live Twice would make for a resoundingly poor introduction and more likely serve as a deterrent to seeking out more promising Bond films. While the film is not an entire waste, it wavers so closely that only those willing to forgive a stunning slew of lapsed judgement and misplaced budget may find a film worthy of watching.-5/10",You Only Live Twice
101,Sirus_the_Virus,A dull Bond film.,5,9 September 2009,"The first Bond film Dr. No came out in 1962. I wasn't that crazy about it. Then in 1963, they released the second Bond film From Russia with love, which I did indeed love. Then in 1964 they released Goldfinger, which I didn't like as much but was still a great movie. Then in 1965 they released Thunderball, which wasn't the best but had a lot of excitement. Then in 1967, they released You only live twice, the dullest and perhaps worst Bond film I have ever seen. I have a huge problem with You only live twice. Actually a few big problems with it. There isn't much excitement, like Dr. No, I didn't understand the plot. There isn't a ton of dialogue. You only live twice is just sort of boring and makes you yawn. It's a forgettable Bond film that only has two good things. One is that Donald Pleasence does a good role as Blofeld, who is a popular Bond villain. It's a shame that you only see Pleasence in the film for a short while. It breaks my heart to say this but I give You only live twice a thumbs down. After seeing such good films before, You only live twice disappoints.You only live twice:**/**** The Plot: Unknown.",You Only Live Twice
102,RNMorton,First Class Bond,10,28 November 2003,"Okay so I lied when I said Diamonds was my favorite Bond movie.  This one has been growing on me for several years.  Duty calls James to Japan, where the men come first and the women second.  Lots of action, Bond gets a little culture shock and an attractive and savvy partner, all the good stuff is here. 10/10",You Only Live Twice
103,Beta_Gallinger,"Not quite as good as ""Goldfinger"", but better than ""Thunderball""",8,19 June 2008,"Watching the James Bond movies in order, I was very impressed with ""Goldfinger"", but since ""Thunderball"" came right after that one, that was the one I watched next, and that was a disappointment, a significant drop from the classic 1964 film, even inferior to the first two. After that, I wouldn't have been surprised if this fifth installment in the franchise also turned out to be lacklustre, knowing that like ""Thunderball"", it was over two hours long, and I noticed that it had the same rating on IMDb. However, while many viewers may consider both ""Thunderball"" and ""You Only Live Twice"" disappointments, I'm going to have to disagree.While an American space capsule is in orbit, a mysterious larger spacecraft comes along and forces it inside! The U.S. suspects that this is a Soviet spacecraft, which could lead to war! However, the British have evidence indicating that the mysterious spacecraft landed near the Sea of Japan. So, James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. S.P.E.C.T.R.E., lead by Ernst Blofeld, are once again the culprits, but it is unbeknownst to Bond where the hijacked space capsule is, and after another one is hijacked the same way, this time a Russian one, Bond must track down S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s secret launch site before they hijack another spacecraft (the next American one will be going into orbit soon), as another space hijack will probably mean the beginning of World War III! Basically, I didn't like ""Thunderball"" that much because a lot of it bored me. I don't know exactly why I found this fifth Bond movie so much better than that one. I guess a major reason for this is because no scenes in the film tend to drag as much as certain scenes in ""Thunderball"", such as certain underwater scenes in that film. Most of this film managed to keep me intrigued, with the action and sometimes unexpected happenings. The scene where Bond flies in a small helicopter called ""Little Nellie"" and finds himself in a battle is certainly a memorable one, and it's not the only one. Also, like some of the previous films, this one has some humour, maybe more so than before, including the scene where Bond and Q meet in Japan, as well as some of the talk about cigarettes.This fifth installment in the James Bond franchise is a little different from the previous ones, maybe less realistic. Sure, ""You Only Live Twice"" has its flaws, I think I noticed some illogical things, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining, and I think it's best not to look too far into the film, as it has a lot of make up for the flaws, everything I mentioned above. I haven't read any of the books, so I don't know, this particular one might be more disappointing to those who have read the book, but I personally don't have much critical to say about it. I will just say that the hot tub scene really shows how sexist these early Bond films could get, just to warn viewers, especially female ones. So, while this Bond film may not be as good as ""Goldfinger"", I think it comes fairly close, even though I'm sure many would strongly disagree. Apparently, ""Thunderball"" was the most successful of all the Bond films starring Sean Connery, but it seems that most of them are superior, including this one, in my opinion.",You Only Live Twice
104,vip_ebriega,"Old school Bond, but still one of the most fun Bond movies.",8,8 June 2007,"My Take: Another fun Bond entry. Great Bond, fun villains, neat gadgets, and enjoyable action. ""You Only Live Twice"" is business as usual for Bond. Not much new, and Connery seemed bored playing his role (explaining his disappearance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""). There is a lot to like in this film. Connery in ""You Only Live Twice"" is easily comparable to FROM Russia WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER, but as Bond, he already has established that he is the best in the business and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE does give him much to do. This film does carry the original tradition of Bond. This time around, Bond is sent to Japan to investigate the disappearances of American space shuttles. While the United States suspect it's Russian interference and threaten to retaliate, the Brits faked 007's assassination, in order to clear the way for Bond to investigate what really is going on.Some areas of YOLT are pretty campy (some of the patterns for the AUSTIN POWERS parodies are pretty evident), but the camp is part of the fun. It's a throwback to the good ol' not-to-be-taken-seriously adventure espionage fun. This is formula Bond, but loaded with great action, neat gadgetry (""Little Nellie"" is one of the most beloved Q gadgets) and the glorious sets by the one-and-only Bond veteran Ken Adam make it another high-flying, if not exactly groundbreaking, Bond adventure and one of he series' more fun entries. Rating: **** out of 5.",You Only Live Twice
105,one9eighty,"In Japan, men come first, women come second",5,23 July 2020,"For his fifth outing, Bond must work out who is responsible for space piracy - yes, that's right! An American space capsule is swallowed up by what is believed to be a Russian spaceship, which could provoke the cold war into action. Bond must work with a Japanese Secret Service agent to uncover the truth and stop war from taking place. What he does not know is that S.P.E.C.T.R.E. number 1, Ernest Stavro Blofeld is secretly masterminding events from an inactive volcano. Even without me mentioning the Bond name, looking at that plot of the film, it has to be a British double-o agent film - or an Austin Powers style parody :DThis film is directed by Lewis Gilbert, taking over from Terrence Young. The writing team has also changed, with Harold Jack Bloom and Roald Dahl (yes that Roald Dahl) coming in. Despite those major changes, the faces we know, and love are present - Sean Connery is Bond, Bernard Lee and Desmond Llewelyn return as ""M"" and ""Q"", Lois Maxwell is Miss Moneypenny. Add to this Mie Hama as Japanese Agent Kissy Suzaki, Donald Pleasence as Blofeld... oh and look out for Charles Gray (Henderson), Burt Kwouk (S.P.E.C.T.R.E. #3), Michael Chow (S.P.E.C.T.R.E. #4), and even Peter Fanene Maivia (a wrestler known as ""High Chief""... grandfather of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson).
So what do you expect from a Bond film then; gadgets - check; criminal mastermind with ludicrous lair - check; smooth but dangerous Bond - check; femme fatales - check; action and fights - check; a intro song, sung by top talent - check (Nancy Sinatra FTR); a lovely John Barry score - check; ninjas... err, well it wasn't expected, but, err, check? So, really you are getting what you might expect from a Bond film and some more too.This is undoubtedly a fun Bond film, but it is also very over-the-top in many respects. S.P.E.C.T.R.E. starts looking flimsy and silly at times, action sequences are added for fun rather than a plot vehicle, even Connery himself doesn't seem as solid as he did in other outings. I've mentioned Austin Powers in my opening paragraph and this film is without a doubt one of the influences of the Austin Powers films - this Bond is very tongue in cheek, there are a lot of clichés in the film, at times it cheesier and hammier then a cheese and ham sandwich. Despite the potentially perceived negatives I have just written, I can forgive the film, it's Bond after all, it's an institution in British film, it's entertainment rather than a politically or emotionally moving story - and this film feels like the comic book version of what four previous films have been building up nicely. For me though it's a little bit of a step in the wrong direction - one that would ultimately lead the franchise in a different direction than the previous films had been signposting that things would be heading. Is that bad then, not necessarily, change can be good after all, it's just not what I, and not what some of the audience in 1967 were expecting.""You only live twice"" is a decent enough film, I wouldn't say it's as good as a ""Goldfinger"", but it is still an entertaining way to pass a few hours on a bank holiday weekend. The film is still family friendly so don't worry if you have kids running around while this is on.In terms of Bond films this is a 6 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 5 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
106,Stampsfightclub,A more engaging plot with more comedy,8,23 October 2006,"There has been many arguments over the years over who actually is the best Bond but I have always felt Scottish Connery has had the best lines and stories to clarify his position as he best Bond ever.Connery (The Untouchables) is fantastic as the cocky, mischievous sex driven secret agent who is assigned to help out the Japanese.A Bond film with a few twists, usual action diversifies itself from other Bind films because it is easy flowing, understandable, and most importantly likable.I'm not a huge fan of the Bond genre. However this 1967 spy film was enjoyable because for once the action isn't blown out of proportion, the story is more realistic, the acting and jokes are great, engaging characters, a few twists which will keep audiences interested.Having the film set mainly in Japan is great as audiences can have an aspect into the Japanese lifestyle, how they feel about marriage, jobs, violence, and sexuality and for me I found it engaging learning about their different lifestyle.The story also has great comedy. Watch out for the scene with the helicopter and the big magnet which I found pure genius! The story is fast flowing with usual conventional Bond style plots including car chases, sex, death, mystery etc to keep the audiences interested.A conventional Bond film but enjoyable nonetheless.worth watching for great acting and enjoyable action scenes",You Only Live Twice
107,DarthBill,So lame that even the combined awesomeness of Connery & Pleasance can't save it,5,5 August 2012,"PLOT (or lack thereof): When SPECTER gets up to some naughty space shenanigans it's up to good old James Bond to thwart them - and to do it he has to make a stop in Japan, be put through some ""Yellow Face"", etc. Painfully weak, underwhelming and overlong entry in the James Bond series was the next to last hurrah for series starting lead Sean Connery, who had grown tired of the role and franchise by this point, and his unpleasant clash with the Japanese press didn't help his mood either. While his performance is not outright terrible - it's one of the few things that makes the film mildly bearable - you can tell in some scenes that he obviously doesn't want to be there, and with a plot this ridiculous who could blame him? I'm not sure which is more absurd - the NASA shenanigans or trying to pass off a 6-foot-2, 200 plus lbs Scotsman as a Japanese fisherman. Besides Connery, the only other things in the film's entry are some passable action scenes, Karin Dor, the first German Bond girl (sadly underused), some lovely Japanese scenery and the late Donald Pleasance as the first on screen incarnation of Blofeld (and the basis for Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers films), imbuing the series early signature villain with a silky, soft spoken slithery quality that gives you the feeling that he is an intellectual, if not physical, match for the hulking yet light-footed Connery. Sadly, not even the combined awesomeness of Sean Connery and Donald Pleasance can make this worth repeat viewings. When all was said and done Connery made his first go at leaving the series, which sadly meant he missed out on the superior entry ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" with the controversial one time Bond George Lazenby. When Lazenby failed to follow up Connery was lured back for one last official entry, 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"", which somehow managed to be even worse than ""You Only Live Twice"", for no better reason than they offered him a ton of money (some of which he donated to a Scottish charity), and then he made one final go with the unofficial ""Thunderball"" remake ""Never Say Never Again"". It's really a shame that Connery never had a proper send off as Bond, but alas, those are the breaks.The title theme is okay but nowhere near the iconic class of the Goldfinger, Thunderball or even the Moonraker theme.",You Only Live Twice
108,jamesraeburn2003,"""Fifth in the series.""",10,19 April 2004,"One of Sean Connery's best outings as James Bond following the disappointing Thunderball (not a commercial failure by any means, but the special effects and gadgetry undermined the rest of the plot). In this feature Bond fakes his own death in order to carry out his new assignment without any hassle from the opposition. He is sent to Japan in order to discover the mystery of US and Russian rockets being abducted by another spacecraft in mid-air. Naturally, the east and west powers are accusing each other and it looks like turning into a nuclear war. Bond's investigations lead him to an extinct volcano, which has been taken over by SPECTRE who are behind the series of abductions with the intention of starting a war so that they can assume control of the world. You Only Live Twice (adapted by Roald Dahl from Ian Fleming's 1962 novel) has plenty of inventive action including Bond's portable helicopter ""Little Nellie"" that fires mines, rockets and flame throwers and there's an exciting helicopter chase that was actually shot in Spain although the story is set in Japan. Ken Adam's sets are uniformly impressive - the volcano set was constructed at Pinewood Studios in England and the whole set cost more to build than Dr No did to make. The film is also unique in that it's the first time we are formally introduced to cat loving SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasance). This film improves on Thunderball in that here, director Lewis Gilbert does not allow the gadgetry and special effects to sideline the plot corners (which are nonsense of course) but it's fun and there's ace cinematography from renowned cinematographer Freddie Young. Interestingly, during production of this film, Sean Connery announced that this would be his last Bond film and as a result he was replaced by Australian model George Lazenby for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). However, after Lazenby turned down Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Connery was finally lured back to the series and would play Bond again in Never Say Never Again (1983), a remake of Thunderball that wasn't part of the official series.",You Only Live Twice
109,petra_ste,Bond-san,6,2 October 2014,"Even seen after many years, You Only Live Twice inspires a strange sense of familiarity right from the start - when you remember Robbie Williams' hit Millennium borrowed its theme from Nancy Sinatra's catchy opening song.Then you have Donald Pleasence's bald, diminutive Blofeld, who has become the template for endless super-villain spoofs with his weird robotic accent, fluffy white cat, volcano lair (with a piranha pool, no less) and ludicrous procrastinations to kill 007 when he has the chance. It's a campy portrayal - for example, his ""Kill Bond! Now!"" line seems delivered by a malfunctioning cyborg - but at least a memorable one: the worst sin a Bond villain can commit is being boring (Quantum of Solace).Interesting how this is one of the rare Bond adaptations where the movie is less preposterous than the source material. In the book, Blofeld builds an exotic garden with poisonous plants to instigate suicide tourism - and then, in a sublimely kitsch note, struts around it clad in a Samurai armour.It's unfortunate Connery seems below his par - not still Diamonds Are Forever or Never Say Never Again bored, but he appears to have lost a certain spark, the infectious vitality which made him memorable in the first movies of the series. His Bond's success at disguising himself - a burly, heavily-accented Scotsman pretending to be a Japanese fisherman - might be more improbable than any hi-tech gadget, but that's suspension of disbelief for you.6,5/10",You Only Live Twice

Thunderball was possibly a slight falter compared to the previous two, but You Only Live Twice was when the Bond series really lost its footing. Each one tried to 'top' the last in a sense and by going more outlandish the films just got weaker. You Only Live Twice has a fraction of the witty quips Thunderball has but far more action. But this film does feature one of the most excellently delivered lines:""Goodbye, Mr Bond !""The plot is extremely outlandish and it would be futile to try and point out all the holes,so I won't. Either way a hollowed out volcano is preposterous to any mature viewer and the ending sequence is comical. But on the flip side, that's where much of the film's entertainment value lies. A sizable portion of James Bond fans were kids under twelve and to an eight year old James Bond and ninjas fighting in a volcano is the coolest thing. That's how You Only Live Twice really excels.

Bloefeld and the base left enough of an impression to be the key inspiration for much of the Austin Powers movies (see Dr. Evil).

With each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War, Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE.A good race with time on Japanese soil is very fun, unlike an unconvincing conflict of power in the universe. Unfortunately, beside some sequences from Japanese culture and tradition, this movie did not offer anything new. Of course, some beautiful young women, who cannot resist, seems a bit tired British agent, appear in the movie. However, the magic of previous films is gradually disappearing. This is a ruthless and somewhat confusing adventure that glorifies some unconvincing ideals.The plots are rather confusing, especially when focus is placed on an electronic device. The dialogues are pretty poor regardless of Japanese influence. A tense atmosphere goes beyond the limits of good taste in the second part of the film. However, a final battle has improved my impression to a certain extent.Sean Connery as James Bond is too nonchalant in this movie. Although his performance is at a high level, when it comes to action sequences, his tiredness is visible in relationships with women.Akiko Wakabayashi as Aki, an agent with the Japanese SIS who assists Bond and Mie Hama as Kissy Suzuki, an Ama diving girl and Bond's wife, look fresher than their man. Tetsurō Tamba (Tiger Tanaka) is a better version of Felix Leiter as head of Japanese secret service.

116,qormi,"Implausible, But Fun",8,9 March 2009,"This was an ambitious Bond film. Made at the height of 007 popularity, it came right after Thunderball, which was a tough act to follow. Connery gave it his best. He was at his most buff in this one; he gained a lot of weight, but looked toned and athletic. He resembled an NFL star - big, but light on his feet. It was very fast-paced, but the plot had a lot of holes, not the least of which was SPECTRE's ability to hollow out a volcano, drain a crater's lake, replace it with an artificial metallic one, and build a launchpad to rival Cape Kennedy without anyone noticing.That said, there were many other implausiblities as well. By the way, why doesn't somebody just shoot Bond if they want to get rid of him? SPECTRE is very inept in the ""off Mr. Bond"" dept. The Japanese girls were very hot; they must have scoured the country for the ones that had the prerequisite 38"" bust. The redheaded villainess was sexy despite having had her makeup applied with a masoner's trowell.Some parts were unintentionally funny, like Bond having plastic surgery done on his eyes to look more ""Japanese"". The surgical team consisted of four bikini clad women. Then, he was all set - a 6'2"", 235 lb. Japanese fisherman.Donald Pleasance as Blofeld was the prototype for Austin Powers' ""Dr. Evil"". When he says, ""Goodbye, Mr. Bond"", it's classic. Ron Rich as ""Hans"" was a very menacing henchman and the fight sequence with Connery was first-rate. The ninja attack was very well done.All in all, it was an exciting, fun Bond flick. Nancy Sinatra's theme song was beautiful.",You Only Live Twice
117,timdalton007,Twice Isn't The Only Way To Live,6,6 March 2007,"Following on the success of Goldfinger and Thunderball comes this film, bigger in both budget and scope then those two films. It also proved to be Sean Connery's last outing for four years and the so-called end of the ""classic"" Bond films in the eyes of the general public. Yet this film is not in the same category as the three films (From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball) that preceded it. While it certainly has an epic feel to it the film lacks believability in terms of its leading man, its story, and its action sequences.Sean Connery was so beguiled by the press while making this film he quit after this film. The pain and disillusionment is evident in the performance. Connery seems to sleep-walk through out the entire film. He barely acts at all and the result is dull to say the least. This is not the Bond of previous films. This is a bored and dull Bond who seems better off dead as he appeared at the end of the teaser sequence. In short this is perhaps the worst of Connery's performances as 007.The film's two girls give Connery his best moments in the film. The beautiful Akiko Wakabayashi is the main love interest of the film and her death towards the start of the film's third act is the one good shock moment of the film. The other girl, Kissy who is played by Mie Hama, isn't quite as good as Akiko and we really never get any feeling of character depth in her part. This is a shame since she occupies the entire third act without hardly an interruption.The film's villain is finally revealed after two films without a face. Donald Pleasence creates a classic villain in the first full on-screen incarnation of the Blofeld character. Yet Pleasence is a dull villain. He spends the majority of the film just handing out orders at random and that is pretty much all he does. He does get one moment of physical force but wastes it. Why this villain is classic is beyond my understanding but he has, unjustly, become classic.The rest of the cast is a bit of a mixed bag. Tetsuro Tamba is virtually flawless as Tiger, Bond's Japanese backup and he is a true pleasure to watch. Blofeld's two henchpeople Osato and Helga Brandt, played by Teru Shimada and Karin Dor, feature quite a bit in the film and their death scenes are classics for two very different reasons. Charles Gray, a future Blofeld, gets a nice moment as a MI6 contact in Japan and it's a shame we don't get to see more of him since he is a lot better here then in his later Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever. Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, and Desmond Llewelyn all give good performances in their roles but this certainly is not their best work.The action sequences in the film are a really mixed bag. The vast majority of them serve little or no purpose plot wise and seem to be used just to string the film along a little bit further. This is especially true of the Little Neelie battle sequence over the volcano's. Whiel this is a visually stunning sequence, their isn't a lot going on besides Bond pushing a few buttons. This is also true of the massive battle in the volcano lair. The sequence is exciting to watch but one wonders by the end of it how much of it was necessary. The action sequences in the film really serve no purpose in that respect and hurt the film in review.The story of the film is many things but great is not one of them. How the plot of one of Ian Fleming's best novels became this part sci-fi film, part action epic is beyond understanding. The villains plot just lacks credibility in a way that the previous films did not and that is despite good special effects. The writing itself isn't bad but the story is. Not to mention the fact that the story became dated almost immediately which doesn't help the film four decades later.The rest of the production elements are the great things about this film. Ken Adam's production design is amazing to say the least. The volcano lair is a truly mesmerizing set to look at even though it does lack believability. Adams design is incredible in every single set and is aided immensely by the Japanese locations. It is in those locations that the breathtaking work of Freddie Young shines brightest. This is a film that is carried by these visual elements alone and it is a shame that neither got Oscscars for truly spectacular work. The film's special effects are good even if they are not up to modern standards. They don't hurt the film four decades later but they don't help it either. Then there is the music of John Barry. Barry created one of his best scores, Bond or otherwise, for this film. His intriguing blend of Oriental themes into the traditional Bond music is a delight to listen to. His use of the ""007 theme"" during the early part of the Little Nellie sequence is classic as is the space march theme. Add on to this a top notch main title song by Nancy Sinatra and a dazzling credit sequence from Maurice Binder and the result is a classic element in a not-so-classic film.Overall You Only Live Twice is carried by two things: its visuals and its music. In terms of acting, action, and writing this is about as dull as Bond films come. Yet it is the sheer power of the visuals and music that make this film watchable. If nothing else it proves that these two elements alone can (nearly) save a film.",You Only Live Twice
118,FlickJunkie-2,"All the ingredients, but Connery's heart wasn't in it",7,4 February 2001,"This was the fifth in the Bond series, released in 1967.  Producer Albert `Cubby' Broccoli had quite a challenge on his hands outdoing the runaway success of `Thunderball'.  He undertook to surpass it by increasing the budget, trying more elaborate gadgets and stunts (an ultralight heavily armed one man helicopter being chased by 4 other helicopters), gargantuan sets (a launch pad inside a volcano) and exotic locations (Japan).  At almost $10 million (that's about $50 million in today's dollars), this was one of the highest budgeted films at that time.  The launch pad set alone cost over $1 million to build.  Despite great box office results, ($110 Million worldwide in 1967 dollars) it fell short of Cubby's ambitions to exceed `Thunderball' financially ($140 Million worldwide) and it proved to be lackluster among the early Bond films.Although having established himself as a pop icon in his 007 roles, Sean Connery was tired of being James Bond.  Before the release of this film, he announced his intention to retire from the role.  His lack of enthusiasm was evident throughout the film and his onscreen demeanor lacked verve.  He didn't even show much interest in the love scenes, looking more bored than passionate.  The critics declared that this would be the end of his career and the end of James Bond films, probably the worst twin predictions in the history of film.  As it turns out, Connery returned to the role twice more in 1971 (Diamonds Are Forever) and 1983 (Never Say Never Again).I have a great deal of respect for Sean Connery, indeed he is one of my favorite actors.  His Bond films set a standard that was never equaled by any of the actors that followed.  However, his performance in this film displayed so much ennui that it bordered on unprofessional.This film had all the elements necessary to make it one of the better Bond films.  It finally gave a face to Blofeld, and though the choice of Donald Pleasence was roundly criticized, I liked him in the role.  The story was intriguing.  Astronauts and their spacecraft were being abducted by a rogue predator ship that was gobbling them up whole.  Bond was dispatched to find out who was behind the plot.  The screenplay written by Roald Dahl was full of clever double entendres like Aki's (Akiko Wakabayashi) great line just as Bond swept her into his arms, `I think I will enjoy very much serving under you.'  It had majestic locations and great photography.  However, the elements didn't gel, mostly because of Connery's Bond fatigue.Overall, this was a good Bond film, although it could have been much better but for Connery's malaise.  Still, the story was stronger than contemporary Bond films, which have resorted to nonstop action and visual effects with flimsy scripts.  I rated it a 7/10.  If you want to see Connery at his best, see `Goldfinger' or `From Russia With Love'.",You Only Live Twice

120,Bogmeister,BOND#5: Kill Bond! Now! says Blofeld Revealed,7,29 May 2007,"MASTER PLAN: foment World War III between the U.S. and Soviet Union by stealing some orbiting space capsules. Bond almost gets into outer space in this one, literally a step away (he'd finally make it in the much later ""Moonraker""). And that's where the teaser begins, a reflection of the anxious space race between the super powers during the sixties. This film also reflected how 'hot' the Cold War was at this time, when seemingly the slightest provocation could cause a devastating escalation - precisely what SPECTRE, notably Blofeld, wants. We thought SPECTRE played its ultimate hand in the previous ""Thunderball."" Here, instead of just stealing nuclear warheads, the sinister organization gobbles up entire space ships, a blatant attempt to establish itself as a new super power - a 3rd one - following up on the hints in the previous Bonders. Expectedly, there are fantastic special FX for the time to convey all this ambitious power playing. This marked a shift to all-out science fiction, although traces of traditional espionage remain. The teaser is actually divided into two parts, with the 2nd half devoted to another 'false death' for Bond (see From Russia With Love's teaser). Nancy Sinatra sings over the credits and at the end, a more languorous and lyrical effort than the bombastic tempos in previous films.Bond spends his mission in Japan in this one, since this is where it appears the criminal space craft originates from. In a slight deviation of protocol, M and Moneypenny have also set up quarters in this area, in a least likely spot. Many of the early scenes convey this sleight of hand, where nothing is as it appears to be, but then the plot starts to meander a bit. Despite some fine action bits, notably against a burly Japanese thug and a unique long shot of Bond's rooftop struggle, the middle act comes across as almost a travelogue of the Orient's better scenery. It's nice to look at, yes, perhaps the most exotic of the Bonders, but on the slow side, a conceit which would plague many of the future Bonders. Q shows up with his contribution, a miniature helicopter, which almost seems like an advertisement for the company who made this weird prop, though there is an impressive aerial battle against some standard helicopters when Bond attempts some scouting. Similar to the use of sharks in the previous film, this has a pond of piranha, always a guaranteed crowd pleaser, accentuating the outrageous aspects of Bond villains. To the film's credit, several fine Japanese actors were cast, including a couple of Bond girls (another film company might have cast white actors in all the main roles, despite the Japanese setting). I especially liked the poignant oriental-flavored musical score during Bond's wedding, though this entire subplot makes little sense. There's even a tragic tone to one of the character arcs, though Bond accepts this like a good soldier, a sign of Connery's less energetic approach by this time.The casting of uber-villain Blofeld, however, was not very inspired. The actor Pleasence is always excellent and actually lends himself very well to eccentric villainy, but it didn't quite work here. After sensing the power emanating from this mysterious figure with the reverberating voice in ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball,"" one can't help but be unimpressed by Pleasence's limited stature, both physically and vocally. He actually reminded me of a stunted version of another comic book villain, Baron Strucker, introduced a couple of years earlier in the 'Sgt.Fury' Marvel Comics. The fact he shows up so late, a la Dr. No style, was probably just as well. His bodyguard, the brute henchman, doesn't speak and functions merely as a tall combatant for the now standard mano-a-mano with Bond towards the end (tho their walking towards each other was a stylistic triumph). Connery himself appeared noticeably older than in the previous Bonders; though still physically fit, you sense he was past his prime - not desk-bound just yet, but slowing up, and his lack of jovial sarcasm during Q's lecture denoted a little too much seasoning by this point. This does have a spectacular finish, with literally a hundred attacking ninjas on the greatest Bond set so far, underneath a fake lake in a volcano. Bond would return, but Connery would not, in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service.""

122,LebowskiT1000,They just get better and better...,9,15 April 2003,"I'm almost inclined to say that the series gets better and better as I go down the line of sequels.  I liked ""Dr. No"" quite a bit, ""From Russia With Love"" about the same, ""Goldfinger"" was awesome, ""Thunderball"" was equally good and now here we are at ""You Only Live Twice"".  I guess now that I think about it, I can't say that I liked this film better than ""Goldfinger"" or ""Thunderball"", but I probably liked it the same.Sean Connery of course plays the perfect James Bond, always good to see him in the role.  I was very happy to see that the support cast regulars were all back (Desmond Llewelyn, Lois Maxwell, and Bernard Lee).  The rest of the supporting cast was good as well.  I was quite surprised to see Donald Pleasence in the film as the antagonist.  Donald did a fine job with his role, although I'm not sure if I was very fond of his voice...not sinister enough, but I can deal with it.The story was quite interesting and pretty well thought out.  I always liked the idea of a third-party attempting to make two super-powers fight each other thinking that each other is responsible for what the third-party did. There are of course a few things throughout the film that I didn't like, but I won't get into them (because I don't want to give away anything to those of you that haven't seen the film).When reviewing a Bond film, I feel it's required to talk about the cool gadgets used in the film.  The gadgets in this film are pretty cool, although there aren't a whole lot of them.Another requirement of reviewing Bond films is the women of the film.  The women in this film were nice, but nothing spectacular.All in all, I thought this was an excellent fifth installment to the Bond series, and hopefully the later installments can live up to the quality of the first 5 (read my reviews and find out...if I've written them by the time you read this).  If you liked any of the previous Bond films, or just like the Bond films in general, I would definitely recommend checking this one out.  I hope that you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",You Only Live Twice
123,cariart,"Connery's First Swansong as Bond, Big, yet Campy...",6,5 April 2004,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, follow-up to the most successful 007 film of the franchise, THUNDERBALL, was the end result of Eon Productions' decision to take advantage of Japan's nearly fanatical love of 'James Bond', and desire to bring him to their country for the next 007 adventure. Although ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, to be shot primarily in Switzerland, had been planned, the Japanese offer was too good to pass up, so Sean Connery, instead of appearing in the most ambitious and dramatic Bond story ever made, would make his first 'farewell' appearance in the weakest, most far-fetched 007 story, yet.Ian Fleming's novel, written as his health was failing (only one more Bond novel would appear, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, published posthumously), was more introspective than his previous works, with Bond facing a mental breakdown, his apparent death, and fatherhood for the first time, and would have been nearly impossible to film. So Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman brought in legendary author Roald Dahl (""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"") to create a story, retaining only the title and character names from the Fleming work. Dahl's 'take', while providing lovely views of Japanese culture and folklore, science fiction elements, and a huge climactic battle, revealed an embarrassingly obvious lack of knowledge of 007 lore (at one point, the Japanese Secret Service, supposedly fluent of all of Bond's habits, brings him a martini ""stirred, not shaken""), and one sequence, in which the hirsute, 6'2"" Connery is 'disguised' to pass as Japanese, so outrageous that it appears nearly campy.As the film's villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld would make his first fully visible appearance (his hands, caressing a Persian cat, had appeared in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL), and 62-year old Czech actor Jan Werich was cast in the role; when illness forced him to bow out, veteran character actor Donald Pleasence was called in, but even shaving his head couldn't make Pleasence look 'formidable', so a long scar was added, creating a ""broken egg"" look...and the short actor, dressed in a Nehru jacket, still looked silly (a fact not lost on Mike Myers, when creating 'Dr. Evil' for AUSTIN POWERS). When he shouts, ""Kill...Bond!"", you nearly expect a henchman to shout back, ""Kill him yourself, shorty!""  There ARE beautiful elements in the film; Ken Adams' Volcano set, the biggest standing set ever constructed, to that point, is astounding, and the climactic Japanese assault on it ranks as one of the greatest action scenes, ever; Charles Gray (later to play Blofeld, in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER), has a nice role as a doomed Bond ally; the dock chase, as Bond is pursued by ever-growing numbers of Japanese thugs, is remarkable; and John Barry's haunting score, with Nancy Sinatra's rendition of the theme song, ranks as one of his best. But campiness is all too evident, as well, in 'Little Nellie', the toy-like mini-helicopter that takes on Blofeld's private air force; in the patently artificial-looking space scenes; and in a bizarre sequence, as a carload of bad guys are lifted off a highway by a giant magnet, and dumped into the bay (guess an interrogation wasn't planned).For Sean Connery, who looked tired and out of shape, the filming was a most unpleasant experience, hounded 24 hours a day by the Japanese press, and referred to as 'James Bond' rather than his own name at official functions. As he had already hammered out an agreement that this would be his last Bond movie (he was totally burned out in the role), he grit his teeth, finished the production, and moved on.But what a shame it was that it had to be with this film, and not ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE....",You Only Live Twice
124,Aylmer,Far from perfect but still my favorite Bond,7,6 August 2019,"I loved this movie especially as a teenager upon first viewing many years ago. It's one of the more over-the-top entries in the franchise with plenty of plot holes and contrivances but it stays out of the campiness of the later entries. Overall, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is just a barrel of fun and set the standard for the series... so well that it was essentially remade as both THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER.Reasons I love this movie so much:1) The space scenes. John Barry was still years away from composing the music for THE BLACK HOLE or STAR CRASH, but really found a great sound to set the tone for the loneliness and magnificence of space. The special effects in these scenes hold up really well and the mystery of the unidentified spacecraft gives the film a lot of welcome tension, played nicely seriously.2) The action. Connery looks a little tired of the part, but he's also quite comfortable in the role like a familiar old friend. He handles the fisticuffs nicely but director Lewis Gilbert throws in enough creativity to keep things fresh and non-repetitive. The fight on the docks, the helicopter battle, and of course the raid on the villain's lair work as some of the best action scenes of the late 60's.3) The Japanese setting. This film has a strong Toho connection with the casting of the two leading ladies from KING KONG VS. GODZILLA along with a dubbed Tetsuro Tamba. I love the look into Japanese post-war culture from the Western lens in a way we seldom got to see during this era. Connery has great chemistry with all his Japanese costars especially Tamba who might be my favorite of all his allies. Even the expository scenes with the two of them chatting at a secret bathhouse is fun to watch and makes espionage look so cooperative and exciting.4) The production design. Ken Adam went all-out in his set designs, especially with the astonishing volcano base for the film's villains.What doesn't work?1) The script is completely full of holes and contrivances. There's plenty that doesn't make sense, but makes for a great shared viewing experience with friends. Mostly these goofy elements float by pretty seamlessly on first viewing but don't hold up under scrutiny. Why does Specter capture the spaceships rather than just shoot them down? How'd they build this giant base in the middle of Japan without anyone knowing? Why do they have to keep sending helicopters out of it to go patrolling around (it serves no purpose other than to lure James Bond in)? Also what was Connery hoping to accomplish disguising himself as a Spectre astronaut? Why didn't he give the job to one of the actual astronauts he'd rescued earlier?2) Connery has to have the most hopelessly unconvincing makeup as a Japanese person while undercover that I've ever seen. I can only imagine the actor didn't want to undergo hours in the makeup chair, but he makes Joseph Wiseman from Dr. No seem completely convincing by comparison.3) Donald Pleasance as Blofeld. I feel his personality and reveal come as a major letdown after all the build-up in the previous Bond films. He's just not scary at all and they'd have been better off with someone more unemotional like Wiseman or Dawson from Dr. No.4) It's just a tad too long. A lot of fat could have been trimmed out such as the ninja training and some of Bond's wandering around. The pace sags a bit when he goes undercover on the island I think especially owing to having to start all over with a second Bond girl relationship, which I think they shoehorned in just to put more women in the film.Overall it's a very enjoyable film to watch with friends as the flaws just make it all the more fun. It's unfortunate that the series got so goofy quickly after this one with the odd bright spot here and there. Still I'm happy Connery gave us 3-4 classic Bond films and a couple ""okay"" ones as I think his balance of macho, charming, and childishness lent itself best to the character.",You Only Live Twice

Someone who would later become Blofeld, Charles Gray was also wonderful as Henderson. The two Japanese Bond girls were OK, but not very memorable. The death scene wasn't very saddened either.John Barry provided us with some nice parts of the soundtrack, but there didn't seem enough of it. The introduction of the Space March was great, as long as the 007 theme and the traditional James Bond theme.The visual effects were good and bad in this film. The volcano set was wonderful and so detailed. The rocket did let it down with its cartoon like image and the obvious stock footage of lave stood out, but this could be excused due to the age of the film.It's an enjoyable Bond film to see, but has some flaws on making it a great Bond film.

128,jhaggardjr,James Bond Goes Japanese!,9,30 December 2000,"""You Only Live Twice"", the fifth James Bond adventure, is one of Sean Connery's best 007 films. Most people say the first three movies in the long running series are the best. Now I'll admit ""Goldfinger"" is (in my opinion) the best 007 movie, but I think ""You Only Live Twice"" is better than the very good first movie ""Dr. No"" and the excellent second movie ""From Russia With Love"". ""You Only Live Twice"" takes our favorite British spy to Japan, where he tries to figure out why several space capsules have mysteriously disappeared. M, 007's boss, thinks that the missing capsules landed somewhere in the country known as ""the Land of the Rising Sun"". Bond gets assistance from a Japanese sidekick (Tetsuro Tamba), and a pair of gorgeous Japanese women (Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama). They try to take down the bad guys, lead by the infamous Ernst Stavlo Blofeld (in the first of three 007 appearences). Plus, Q and Miss Moneypenny come in for their usual brief appearences along with M. And there are the gadgets. The big gadget in ""You Only Live Twice"" is a little mini-helicopter Bond calls ""Little Nellie"" that's equipped with, as Q always says, the usual refinements. There is plenty to like about this Bond film. One of the best things about it is the Japanese locations. They're fascinating. Plus it has an interesting cast of actors (who are mostly unknowns with the exception of the late Donald Pleasence as Blofeld). Everybody is very good here, as is Connery of course. ""You Only Live Twice"" is Connery's second best 007 movie. It's fast-paced, funny, and entertaining.***1/2 (out of four)",You Only Live Twice

130,dfle3,Change of scenery works...,7,15 July 2010,"5th of 23 Bond moviesAfter seeing a few Bond movies I got a bit sick of a frequent locale for the franchise...the Caribbean. Not sure, but this one may be the only one set in...Setting: Japan Plot: Manned orbiting spacecraft are disappearing after being approached by a mysterious spacecraft. The Americans blame the Soviets for their missing property...and if a Soviet manned spacecraft goes missing, well, this could be World War III fellows! Pre-title theme sequence: Check. You get the gun barrel sequence followed by a depiction of what happened to the orbiting American spacecraft. Bond appears later. His sequence makes this pre-title theme sequence one of the most memorable in the franchise.Title theme with guest artist: Check. Nancy Sinatra's song belongs to the Golden Age of Bond movie themes...not like the disposable pap that's been around in the post- Roger Moore era of Bond.Q: Check.Silly female character names: Um...no? Massive oversight? Reading the credits I noticed a character called ""Kissy"". Can't really recall her, despite seeing the movie last night.Sexism: Yes...and no. Western women might find the depiction of subservient Japanese women demeaning. When a Japanese woman takes a comment by Bond on how Asian women taste, she suggests that they taste the best...James makes the cool comment that they ""just taste different"". On a meta-level, you do get the odd scenario of a supposedly Asian masseuse (?) looking rather Western. Think that that woman giving Bond a massage was identified as Jeanne Rolant in the end credits. Maybe a budgetary issue? Odd.Bond as wine snob: Check. Bond compliments his Japanese host ""Russian vodka. Well done!"". Later Bond groans and pulls a face when confronted with ""Siamese vodka!"". And you just know Bond is the most 'civilised' man in the world when he can say to his Japanese host ""98.4 degrees Fahrenheit is the correct temperature for sake"". Hmm...he must be an aristocrat or something, right? Good thing his Japanese interlocutor can spot his class ""For a European you are exceptionally well cultivated"".End teaser: Check. Not sure if Australia's George Lazenby was always going to play Bond in the next film, or if Connery aborted his Bond career soon after this movie was made.Things to watch out for: * Famous children's author, Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay, according to the opening credits.* The pre-title theme sequence features a scene which would be remembered in the later Roger Moore Bond movie ""The spy who loved me""...similar scene, but in a different setting.* Ninjas! * Moneypenny offers Bond the book ""Instant Japanese"" (by Masahiro Watanabe and Kei Nagashima) but he suggests he doesn't need it, as he took a first in Oriental languages at Cambridge University.* Some of the incidental music is good and interesting...especially one part with an oriental sounding instrument.* Mr. Tanaka ""Tiger"" is the head of the Japanese Secret Service.* Mr. Osato's ""Kill him"" is a great line. Wasn't this referenced in an Austin Powers movie? * Interesting henchmen. Oh yeah...there are none. If you could call one of the characters in the movie a henchman, you almost feel inclined to ask him whether he likes oysters! * NINJAS!!!* Hokey special effects...reeks of 1950s style sci-fi movies! The look got more sophisticated when Roger Moore went into space as James Bond in ""Moonraker"".*** For those who think that the Bond franchise went a bit silly under Roger Moore's tenure...well, how about this...the head of the Japanese Secret Service thinks it's a good idea to make Bond look Japanese!...for emphasis ""!!!"". It must be said that Connery is a credit to his race...cf. Mickey Rooney in the rather awful ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"", where he brings disgrace to so many people, not least himself.* A rather bored looking Bond in his final scene in the movie. Maybe Connery had stuffed himself with food a bit earlier? Why not shoot later on? Furthermore, Connery ends his first stint as Bond with his most wooden delivery of a line...his last for a while. Seriously, would it have been too much trouble to do another take? In the movie ""Troy"", I don't care how much Brad Pitt was paid to star in that, but sheeesh, I sure as taxes would have gotten him to do another take (or more) of his scene with Hector's father in his tent.

131,Al_The_Strange,You Only Live Twice Review,6,21 September 2015,"After so many plots unraveled across four classic films, James Bond would finally reach the top and confront the head man of SPECTRE, in You Only Live Twice.This time, Bond's mission takes him to Japan. It starts off hard and fast, as he fakes his death, and then struggles to escape death in a constant string of confrontations and encounters on foreign soil. When Bond has to infiltrate a secret volcanic lair, he resorts to the ultimate cover: marrying a Japanese girl, while learning ninjutsu and getting facial surgery. It all adds up to a big, explosive battle in the middle of the volcano. As always, there's gadgets (the biggest thing being a small DIY helicopter with loads of weapons) there's ladies, and there's danger galore.The story follows the original novel just a little bit, but the book will always have the edge because it has one important dramatic angle that the movie misses out on: the theme of revenge. The book was a pretty intense struggle, because it follows immediately after On Her Majesty's Secret Service. If you know what happens in that story, then you know how driven Bond becomes to finding Blofeld and making him pay. Also, Bond actually became a ninja and infiltrated a castle to get his vengeance - how cool is that? The movie misses out on many of these opportunities, and instead keeps the tone light and fluffy. It takes some pretty ridiculous turns, including a useless subplot involving a rocket that steals other rockets in space. The only thing that makes this feel special is that he fakes death and assume a disguise, but it never reaches a level of significance that affects the plot much. For Bond, it's just business as usual.This film is made with decent photography. One thing I think it weird though is that most shots, especially during the fight scenes, are taken from really really far away. Editing is okay. Acting is fine for what it is: Sean Connery seems to give a more tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Bond, but his presence is still welcome. Donald Pleasence plays the villain pretty dryly, but his mere presence and look is iconic. I have no complaints with Akiko Wakabayashi's, Mie Hama's, or Tetsuro Tamba's performances. Writing is okay, but most of the jokes fall horribly flat. This production has good-looking locales. Some of the props, costumes, and special effects appear cheap. I was never a fan of Nancy Sinatra's theme song, but the music score is alright.You Only Live Twice is enjoyable, but also lightweight, silly, and rather shallow.

Set around the one location for the majority of the film, you may also be mistaken this drags a lot, it doesn't though and becomes a solid plot which moves and throws you off the scent of predicting what is next to happen, I felt this was firmly an OK film, and here is why.The story is pretty absurd and as said, for this to work, the villain would literally have to be the richest man ever, but in general, this is good fun. It has a good mix of fighting and charm to be a Bond that portrays all the hallmarks of the series yet also introduces a new side to Bond where he actually does some good spy work. I loved the gadgets and sets in this which in the story make it great to look at also.Sean Connery maybe falls slightly from his first four roles and this is far from his or the series best, but Connery still manages to churn out an entertaining Bond and with all the kind of crazy things in the plot he deals with it well. Donald Pleasance does a fine job as the villain and his strange grace coupled with his evil side make him a very diverse villain who you just can't predict what he'll do next.This Bond to me seemed more talky than the previous instalments, and with the author Roald Dahl writing the screenplay it is no surprise the dialogue is strong. I said before about the sets because in this film you see them more than any other film and Ken Adam does a fine job especially with the Volcano scene(you will see what I mean), he just masterfully makes these little sets without having to use special effects used in modern cinema.The main problem with this film is that it is very dull and very little happens in the middle and towards the end, with Bond doing his spy stuff right it is fair to say, although he also never engages the audience and watching him mull around with his Japanese friends affects the plot intensely. It could also be said this was one of the first of Bond to contain the over use of humour, but I think it depends on the viewer if they like the Bond humour used.Bond fans should be pleased by this and those who's favourite is Connery shouldn't be put off him with this piece, although nowhere near the quality of the first four. People in general may find it like I did, dull, but you may also have a lot of respect for Bond here as he doesn't fly around the world constantly and stays on one plot in one place, like a real life spy.Overall I give this a 6/10, a solidly OK film that is not near to being Good, but escapes being just OK. With this you have to enjoy the subdued story to enjoy it because if you go in expecting what he did in Thunderball, Goldfinger etc then you will be bitterly disappointed. One more thing to say is that this is Connery's last role as Bond where the comedy isn't overused so savour it if you dislike the more humorous route that Bond went down In the 70's/80's.",You Only Live Twice
134,majikstl,"""You drift through the years. And life seems tame""",7,11 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. It's a nice twist on a cliché, especially since the plot involves 007 faking his death to go undercover. Of course, the mystery is just why he'd have to fake his death, since he was frequently going undercover anyway. Oh well, this is a movie where it's best not to ask too many questions. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: ""Oh no, they've killed James Bond -- again."" We're not fooled; it's amazing that the forces of SPECTRE are. 6 points.Opening Credits: Images of geishas and Japanese parasols are superimposed over a background of bubbling lava; an intriguing juxtaposition of the violent and the tranquil, the natural and the civilized. The parasols also suggest the sun, radar screens and spider webs. Clever work by Maurice Binder. 7 points.Theme Song: It's a catchy little tune sung by Nancy Sinatra during her oh-so brief tenure as a pop star. It has a dream-like quality and just a hint of Oriental flavor. Not a great song, but not too bad either. And it is a suitable love ballad, considering James gets married -- well, sort of. 7 points ""Bond, James Bond"": Sean Connery is back in fine form after coasting through THUNDERBALL. He's been given a few one-liners worthy of his dry wit and situations suitable for his casual determination. Though his transformation into a typical Japanese farmer is not that convincing, shaved chest or not. 8 points.Bond Babes: The bevy of Japanese women on display are suitably ""sexy-ful!"" But, in the Asian tradition, a bit passive and don't make as great of an impression as most Bond girls. However, Akiko Wakabayashi as Aki is most appealing and amusing. Curiously, Mie Hama is cast as the drolly named Kissy Suzuki, though her name is never actually mentioned in the film. Very strange. 8 points.Bond Villain: Finally, we get to meet Ernst Stavro Blofeld face to face and it was certainly worth the wait. As embodied by Donald Pleasence with a scarred face and a manic stare, the first glimpse of Bond's famed foe is iconic in its simplicity and its intensity. It is Pleasance's one and only turn as the legendary villain, though he is given very little real screen time, probably even less time than his cat. Which it is just as well; standing next to Bond he seems a little bit wimpy and it looks like he could turn out to be a whiny little troll. Yet he makes a great first impression -- just ask Mike Meyers. 9 points.Bond Baddies: As Bond Babe/secretary/assassin, Karin Dor as Helga Brandt is more cold-blooded than alluring and ultimately she proves to be a better secretary than a Bond Girl or an assassin. Her exit from the movie is most memorable. 7 points.Plot: Once again, SPECTRE hopes the Russians and the Americans will get mad at each other and go to war. This time it involves stealing orbiting space capsules right out of the stratosphere. The blame game is one of SPECTRE's oldest tricks, yet neither the Commies nor the Yanks ever seem to catch on. But then again, with all those satellites and spy contraptions, neither side can even figure out from where SPECTRE's rockets are being launched. Thank goodness for those clever British figuring these things out. The story is silly, but dependable. 6 points.Production values: The villain's sinister lair is hidden inside a dormant Japanese volcano, though you have to ask yourself how, in one of the most densely populated counties in the world, could anyone build such a huge fortress, large enough to house a rocket silo, without someone noticing. Doesn't Japan have any sort of building code? Oops, there I go asking questions again. 8 points for size, minus two for a lack of logic, equals 6 points.Bonus Points: Minus 5 points for killing off Aki. This is the start of an unfortunate trend in the Bond films of introducing a Bond Girl whose sole purpose is to bed Bond then die, so he can seek revenge. Her death serves no other purpose.Summary: Roald Dahl of Willie Wonka fame is the primary screenwriter for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE so maybe it should be no surprise that the film is a bit Wonky. Blofeld's volcano lair has an amusement park feel, Bond meets Tiger Tanaka via a funhouse slide, a tinker toy helicopter (Little Nellie) is the series' newest gadget and a carload of baddies get dispatched via an electromagnetic helicopter ride. Fun stuff, to be sure, but for better or worse it makes for the series' first great leap into fanciful science fiction.Bond-o-meter Rating: 66 points out of 100.",You Only Live Twice
135,michaelarmer,You Only Shag Four,8,25 March 2020,"This is another very well made Bond film, Sean Connery is up to his usual high standard, and he is ably abetted by Donald Pleasance as Blofeld, it's got all the usual trademarks, good direction, good photography, good music, and good action, particularly the Helicopter battle. It helps that they actually filmed in the places they were supposed to be at, adding quality and authenticity and with Chinese or Japanese actors, the only downside is that they were dubbed. The title song is good, by Nancy Sinatra, but not the best.Bond Themes: - Live Intro, Silhouette Titles, Casino scene, M, Q & Moneypenny, Spectre, Cars (not Aston martins, Toyota 2000GTs instead), no Belly dancer, no Train scene and no Felix Leiter as well. Henchmen - Hans, played by Ronald Rich and someone who was just a getaway driver but turns out to be well hard, Peter Fanene Maivia from Samoa, also Miss Brandt played by Karin Dor (also a Bond Girl). Gadgets : Little NellieBond Girls, there were 4 in this one, the first was in the Hong Kong intro, Ling (no. 16) played by Tsai Chin (Hong Kong), next was one of two main ""Bond Girls"" Aki (no.17) played by Japanese actor Akiki Wakabayashi, and very nice too, unfortunately she gets killed later. Then it was Miss Brandt (No.18), played by German actor Karin Dor (a very good actor), she was a baddie, and Bond tries to turn her, but it does not work, she tries to kill 007, making her a Henchwoman as well, but she gets it later, and lastly in this film Kissy (no. 19), the one he marries, and the best looking, she wouldn't have him at first but he nailed her at the end.And about that marriage, Bond is supposed to have only been married once, in the next to Tracy (Diana Rigg) but he gets married here, it's said to be a fake marriage, but I don't see how, they went through the whole ceremony, the only thing that was fake was his name and his toupee, (I know its make-believe, I am just on about the characters and story), so for me Bond has been married twice and committed bigamy in OHMSS, unless they have annulled it.
Oh and in one scene Henderson asks Bond if his Martini/Vodka is ""Stirred not Shaken"" and Bond agrees, so for true it does not matter how he takes it.Anyway, it's another solid effort from Connery and the Bond Team, not the best but not far off, I would have given a 9 had they not dubbed most of the oriental's.",You Only Live Twice
136,malkane316,Quick Review!,9,25 January 2005,"After the very poor Thunderball came this, in my opinion the best Bond film. SPECTRE hijacks a number of rockets to try and begin WW3 by forcing the US and Russia against each other. However, Bond is sent to Japan to stop them once more, and together with an army of ninjas, infiltrates Blofeld's base, the interior of a volcano, and a massive battle begins. And we finally see Blofeld's face! The stunts here are easily the best in any Bond film up to that point, and the massive set in the volcano is as breathtaking now as it was then. We see more of Blofeld, and understand why he is SPECTRE's no.1, played perfectly by Pleasance. His piranha room, and the scenes which take place around it are ingenious. The gadgets take a stronger part in the film, with the Little Nellie copter being one of the best in the series. Again Connery is excellent, but the rest of the cast all perform well too. Kissy Suzuki is a strong woman, but could have been given more to do, and the character of Tiger is also a good one. The final battle scene is exhilarating, with explosions going off everywhere, bullets flying off camera, and hundreds of extras fighting. The script by Dahl is more light-hearted than previous films, but has many dark and tense moments. Bond gets married, but his wife is poisoned in bed and dies, further proof that Bond will always be alone. The ending makes sure that the audience will be screaming for more. 9 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
137,charchuk,Laughably silly,4,24 March 2007,"It's easy to see why Mike Myers used this film as the primary target for spoof in Austin Powers. It's one of the silliest and most laughable Bond flicks, and a further step down in Connery's series. 007 pretending to be Japanese? Are you kidding me? The Japanese scenery is nice, but geez, the way Japanese culture is exploited for the purpose of the film is staggering. The wedding in the middle, which not only slows the film down to a crawl, furthers the chauvinistic mentality of the film. One Bond girl is discarded and replaced by another almost immediately. Although that's usually how it happens in Bond films, the fact that both are 'good' Bond girls and 007 seems not to even notice makes it much worse. Luckily the action scenes are pretty good, and Donald Pleasance gives an iconic performance as Blofeld, so it redeems the film somewhat, but this is still one of the worst Bond flicks I've seen.",You Only Live Twice
138,theshadow908,Entertaining Bond film.,8,12 January 2007,"This is the 5th entry to the James Bond series. Russian and American space shuttles are being stolen from outer space, and the two countries are blaming each other. World War III seems imminent, and James Bond is sent to Japan to find out where the shuttle stealing space ship is coming from. Bond finds out that SPECTRE is behind the theft, and towards the end of the movie, the face of the mysterious leader of the SPECTRE of the organization is finally revealed, as well as his name...Ernst Stavro Blofeld. This Bond movie is really good, and after three SPECTRE involved movies, it's nice to finally see the face of Bond's arch-nemesis.Mainly the reason why this is such a good Bond film to me is because the style of the story is a lot like Goldfinger, though not quite as good. What I mean is that the story gives action and plot a perfect balance. James Bond is as cool as ever, killing armed guards in one moment and bedding a beautiful woman in the next. His mission in this movie is pretty cool. I think that this is the first time I've ever seen James Bond really go undercover, as in by changing his appearance as well as his name. Blofeld makes for a pretty cool villain, especially when you consider that Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies is based off him, or at least this movie's representation of him. The opening song by Nancy Sinatra is one of the best Bond songs there are.Sean Connery plays James Bond as well as he ever has in this movie. It's actually awesome to see that through five movies Sean Connery hasn't changed his portrayal in any way. Donald Pleasance is awesome as Blofeld, in fact out of all the people to play him, he's the best.You Only Live Twice is a great entry into the James Bond series.

The film, is, for lack of a better word, completely bonkers. From Bond disguising himself as a Japanese by combing his hair and eyebrows differently (!) to the legendary volcano base, by way of Bloffield's face and the ludicrous but inspired Nellie VS helicopter fight, 007 has never been so divorced from reality. This makes for fun such as can not be found anywhere else in the series, bar maybe Goldfinger.Sean Connery is at his pinnacle as Bond, never letting the focus getting away from him, even during some samurai action that will have you reeling with laughter. He will be sorely missed throughout the rest of the series, though other actors gave 007 some unique and often interesting touches (Moore's candid humor, Dalton's darkness...).This might well be as good as Bond gets, which is saying a lot.

Sean Connery sleepwalks his way through this one and the barebones screenplay (by Roald Dahl, no less) fails to provide any of the swell hero-villain interaction that enlivened `From Russia With Love' and `Goldfinger'; Donald Pleasence as Blofeld barely gets any screen time. There are no memorable Bond girls either. For all its supposed sophistication, its appeal to the adults of the Sixties is dumbfounding: rogue spacecraft appear out of nowhere, confounding NASA and the U.S. and Soviet militaries who can't seem to pinpoint the launching pad; Bond is taught the ways of the ninja in a matter of days; and when an assassin inexplicably infiltrates the secret ninja camp, the heroes express relief that they will be leaving the camp in two days.

143,bluesman-20,The writing is on the wall for James Bond.,10,4 July 2010,You only live twice was the beginning of the end for James Bond. This was the first Bond to borrow the title from the book but discard the books plot. Instead the movie concentrates on a giant ship that steals the capsules of Russia and the States pushing them to the brink of war. SPECTRE is behind it. With the opening scenes giving us the death of James Bond(Again this was done in from Russia with love) The movie sinks a little bit lower it becomes apparent that 007 had his death faked so that SPECTRE can breath easy knowing the one man capable of stopping them is dead. But that ruse soon becomes blown as Bond makes the scene in Japna This Bond film has two saving graces one as always is the wonderful job done by Sean Connery despite the fact that he was fed up and tired and wanted out from Bond he gives a good performance here and the saving grace? Doanld Pleasence as Blofeld he oozes evil.

144,mnpollio,Quality definitely starting to slip in the series,6,23 March 2007,"Fifth in the Bond series and the quality is definitely starting to suffer, although it still is head and shoulders above its imitators. The plots were starting to become more outlandish, with the villain operating from out of a phony volcano and some outer space paraphernalia thrown into the mix. The Asian locales provide the requisite dose of the exotic.Bond: For the first time, Connery looks bored in the role, so it is no surprise that he would depart after this film. He goes through the paces, but one gets the feeling that he was beginning to feel trapped by the role.The villains: Donald Pleasence becomes the first in a series of three actors to essay the role of Ernst Blofeld. He is instantly forgettable and never seems much of a menace to any of the players. Karin Dor does not fare much better as a sultry villainous who beds and then tries to vanquish our hero.The women: Akiko Wakabayashi is the headliner as Bond's initial helpmate Aki. She is quite appealing, so her sudden demise at the two-thirds point in a bungled assassination attempt is both surprising and leaves a bit of a bad taste. Mie Hama comes on board as the sexy and more than capable Kissy Sazuki, but she has limited time to make an impact.The more ludicrous elements seem amped up in this entry and the filmmakers were not quite slick enough to expertly meld them into the formula as yet. Many of the cartoony aspects lampooned later emerged from this film - villains using piranhas, bizarre rocket contraptions, deformed bald baddies plotting world domination from silly hideouts, etc. There are still things that work. Nancy Sinatra's title track and John Barry's score are both lovely. The action moves along at a reliable clip. It also features two of the series more memorable moments: a suspenseful set-piece involving an elaborate poisoning and a genuinely erotic Japanese bath sequence with modest camera angles and carefully placed obstructions preventing any obvious nudity from Connery or his Asian colleague.",You Only Live Twice

Contains some of the franchises most electrifying action sequences and special effects work (the gadgets in this film are simply awesome). Arguably the true star of this movie are the fantastic set designs by Ken Adam, the unsung hero of the early JB films. Every single set in this movie, especially the awe-inspiringly massive SPECTRE volcano base, is breath-taking in it's creativity and imagination. I also love the great on-location shots in Japan and John Barry's score is one of his best. So with all these elements, what prevents this movie from being a great JB entry? Two things... 1) The plot is very convoluted, messy, and not even remotely plausible. The initial set-up of James Bond faking his death becomes pretty meaningless after the first 20 minutes and the sequence in which James Bond LITERALLY turns Japanese feels like complete time-killer. 2) Around this time, Sean Connery was starting to lose his enthusiasm for the role that made him into a superstar and it shows in his substandard performance. He is far from bad, but the dashing playboy-esque charm of his previous performances feels sadly absent from the proceedings.

151,jonathanruano,You Only Live Twice - A Review,8,24 June 2010,"After ""Thunderball,"" Sean Connery reprises his role as a more human James Bond in ""You Only Live Twice."" This film's main strength is Sean Connery as the protagonist. He has the stature, the charisma, the wit, and the energy to make Bond fascinating. If you look at the actors coming after Connery, their performances as Jame Bond are pale copies by comparison. The experience of watching ""You Only Live Twice"" made me nostalgic for the scenes which made the older Bond films work so well. There is one great scene where Bond tries to get information from Henderson (Charles Gray) when all of a sudden the informant freezes. I will let you guess what happened next. Another scene shows Bond exchanging penetrating glances with Osato's attractive secretary Helga Brandt (Karin Dor). That is one of the more erotic moments in this movie. In other words, ""You Only Live Twice"" understands that a movie can be exciting while having the confidence to remain quiet and subtle.Finally there are the action scenes. A chase through the harbour which is viewed largely by helicopter and works so well because, let's be frank, young Sean Connery almost always looks impressive when he is fighting bad guys. Then there is a scene with Bond in ""Little Nellie"" which is just as much fun to watch. The only sour note is the ending sequence which contains an obligatory battle scene (which was first introduced in ""Goldfinger"" and has unfortunately been repeated again and again and again in almost every single Bond film ever since). But this criticism is only a quibble because there is so much more of ""You Only Live Twice"" to like.But I have forgotten to mention something: the plot. ""You Only Live Twice"" is about a secret criminal organization's attempt to spark a nuclear war between the USA and the USSR and taking over the world. It may seem a little dated now, but frankly it was very topical back then and it is still very interesting today. As a side note, ""You Only Live Twice"" has such great villains that Mike Myers believed that it was a good idea to bring them back to screen in the Austin Powers series. Donald Pleasence's really evil looking Blofeld with the strange eye, for example, was the obvious inspiration behind Dr. Evil.",You Only Live Twice
152,antagonist117,A steep drop-off from Connery's previous outings,3,17 June 2013,"After four energetic performances as 007, Connery seems oddly distracted and detached in ""You Only Live Twice."" The script does him no favors, with plot holes galore, empty chatter in place of the pointed barbs of the previous film, and recycled stock characters. The villainous redhead in this movie, for example, is a barely-there copy of the villainous redhead in ""Thunderball,"" and a silent German strongman is a soulless riff on Robert Shaw's character from ""From Russia With Love"". The on-location Japanese scenery is nice, the title sequence is among the best in the series, and Donald Pleasence creates a new, iconic look for a Bond villain, but these strong points do not elevate the movie into the pantheon of must-see Bond flicks.",You Only Live Twice

There are some great ones (Goldfinger,Diamonds Are Forever,Thunderball) some awful ones (View to a Kill, Living Daylights, Octopussy), and those that are not great, not awful, that you can still sit through and enjoy.""You Only Live Twice"" falls into this last category. The fifth in the series, (it allowed Sean Connery to walk away from the role for the first time)it is interesting to watch, but parts of it are not very good. Connery seems to be going through the motions as well. And, I especially did not like all of the dubbing that was done.There is enough good action, car chases, gadgets and of course good looking women to keep the average James Bond fan happy. But the plot is not interesting enough. Perhaps that is due to the end of the cold war, but I never found this movie to be that engaging.

154,rparham,"Not quite worth seeing ""Twice""",7,12 November 2006,"If you can imagine the James Bond movie series as giant hot-air balloon, then You Only Live Twice was the first pin prick that would let a little bit of the air out so as to not let it fly so high. While by no means the worst entry in the series, You Only Live Twice was one of the more unfocused Bond films and, as with the weak points of Thunderball, is just a bit too big for its britches.You Only Live Twice finds James Bond (Sean Connery) killed before the main title sequence by a pair of gunmen. Well, not really: it's all a ruse to get some of the heat off of Bond's tail after rubbing the crime organization SPECTRE the wrong way too many times. With his newfound ""after-life"", M (Bernard Lee) dispatches him to Japan to investigate a possible launching site for a unknown rocket ship that is capturing American and Russian space launches in orbit. In Japan, Bond meets up with Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), the head of the Japanese secret service, and his associate, Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi), and begins investigating a large Japanese corporation, headed by Mr. Osato (Teru Shimada) that is transporting liquid oxygen, used to make rocket fuel. Bond eventually discovers that Mr. Osato is merely a front for SPECTRE and they are the ones behind the rocket kidnappings.You Only Live Twice took Bond to a new, somewhat exotic locale, Japan, and the film's focus on this aspect of the plot seems to be something of its undoing. You Only Live Twice spends a rather extensive amount of screen time going through the motions of James Bond being in Japan: here he is at a Sumo wrestling event, here he is at a Japanese bath, here he is at a Japanese training camp for ninjas, etc. Some of these scenes are not bad in and of themselves, but don't add up to the most satisfying whole. As with Thunderball, You Only Live Twice is a film that feels just a bit too long, and you find yourself wondering if some of it could have been clipped here and there. Lots of little plot developments feel superfluous to the film as a whole and just seem like padding to make it an ""epic"" sized film.However, while You Only Live Twice has some elements that seem a bit underwhelming, there is plenty of good stuff here. Connery is again in good form as Bond, there are some nice action sequences throughout, and this film really shows off Ken Adam's amazing production design. You Only Live Twice is something of a benchmark for the elaborate villain's hideout, and the staple by which most Bond films of the future would be graded against in this element.On the Bond girl front, You Only Live Twice is a mixed bag. Aki is a decent foil for Bond, and at times their relationship is actually touching. However, the introduction of a female character for the second half of the film, Kissy (Mie Hamma), proves to be a bit counter-productive and Bond and her never connect in quite the same way as Bond and Aki. There were also gadgets a plenty in You Only Live Twice after they were toned back a bit in Thunderball, most memorable being a small helicopter flown by Bond midway through the film.You Only Live Twice was the filmmaker's attempt to have Bond explore a locale as part of the film, not just use it for a backdrop to the action, and this was not quite the right move to make. You Only Live Twice is a decent Bond adventure, but the first one where some of Bond's luster was tarnished a bit.",You Only Live Twice
155,dobbin-4,Bond strikes again,7,15 December 2008,"In this film we see Bond fake his own death for more elbow room on his cases, and we then see him on a mission in Japan hunting down Bloefeld and his evil plan to cause was between USA and Russia.This film again has the Sean Connery style all real fans of the series love and have always loved. He again owned the role and showed everyone he is one of the best Bonds the world will ever see.As for the Bond girl, we have a Japanese one this time, to suit he is in the Japanese country, and she does a good job doing what all Bond girls do best in the early Bond's and that is to be Bond's girl.Bloefeld is a great bad guy and always has been. From not actually seeing his face in FRWL and seeing about half his body in Thunderball he is the real Bond villain, he has it all the wit, the evilness and most of all in an early Bond film, he has the power to get away with what he wants to, unfortunately for him Bond is on the job when he activates his plans.As for this movie compared to the others, this is quite good and I definitely like it more then Dr. No and Thunderball, but this film is not up to the task set up to by FRWL and ""Goldfinger"".Overall, most Bond film fans will like this is they have already not seen it and look for the hilarious scene where Bond is meant to look Japanese and yet he does n't look or sound Japanese at all. Think of the character's disguise in Team America and you will know how bad the disguise is. Anyway that is just a bad bit for a good movie. I rate it 72%.",You Only Live Twice
156,vranger,Bond slips another notch,7,3 April 2009,"After the first three truly excellent Bond films (Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Goldfinger) the series slipped a notch with Thunderball and a major notch with You only Live Twice.Space capsules are mysteriously gobbled up, giving the series something to steal in the mostly silly The Spy Who Loved me a decade or so later.The movie's attempts to pay homage to plot points in the book turn out silly ... Bonds rather pointless ninja training, for example.If the 'scuba war' at the end of Thunderball wasn't bad enough, the movie has the ninja vs bad guy war at its climax, taking that sad and silly trend to a level that would spoil many a later Bond film.Still, most Bond films are worth even repeated viewings, and despite its flaws, this one is no exception. The music alone is enough to enjoy a sitting of the film.",You Only Live Twice
157,BumpyRide,A Little Nellie of a film?,6,16 August 2006,"All previous Bond movies tried to follow the books as best they could when adapting them to the screen. Along came YOLT and the original novel was completely tossed out the window. This was a bad decision and from here on, most of the Fleming novels used the book's title and that was it. Very little remains from the book in this version besides taking place in Japan and some of the character's names are recycled for the film. Agreed, the novel is a bit dreamlike and odd, you either like it or hate it, but the movie version is essentially eye candy. The Spectre volcano base is very cool (with the end scene going on a little too long), with some nice touches thrown in here and there. This is not the worst of Connery's Bond, that honor will go to DAF. This movie has all the spy gimmicks one could hope for in a Bond flick, but the essential story is very shallow indeed.",You Only Live Twice

Donald Pleasance is always fascinating (Blofeld), but the entire plot isn't wired together very well. Plenty of beautiful Japanese women, but Sean doesn't seem to be enjoying it much.  A 5 out of 10.  Best performance = Donald Pleasance.After THUNDERBALL the entire series was going downhill, but nothing compared to the later botched efforts with Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan.  George Lazenby actually wasn't too offensive in his one effort (OHMSS).  This is still worth a watch, though and isn't horrible.  Past 1965 the entire idea of Mr. Bond was becoming dated.  Great scenery though and gorgeous chicks!",You Only Live Twice

It's so modern with all the gadgets it is the only movie in which James doesn't drive a car. It's the first to have Asians as Bond girls and it's definitely a hit. It contains so many gadgets, considering the first movies until this one, this was pretty much the gadget trenddetter.Sean Connery played James Bond his best in this one, I admire him a lot. Then again, this film does carry the original tradition of Bond. This time around, Bond is sent to Japan to investigate the disappearances of American space shuttles. While the United States threaten to retaliate, the Brits faked 007's assassination, in order to clear the way for Bond's investigation.A beautiful movie, worth watching even after 50 years.",You Only Live Twice
160,MF210,"Despite its flaws (There are quite a few), I still enjoyed it",8,10 January 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Out of all Connery's Bonds this is the one that is rather hidden. The first four films he did were most famous. Diamonds Are Forever is famous for being one of the worst Bonds and for Connery's huge salary. But You Only Live Twice is rarely mentioned. Thats too bad because it is a highly enjoyable Bond. You only Live Twice contains exacly what Bond Fans expect: A Fast-Paced Plot, Great Action Sequences, Beautiful Girls, and some Nice Locations. All of these mix together well. This film is not without problems, but there is so much good here that make this an enjoyable Bond. One of the weaknesses has to do with the plot. The space scenes are more than a little hokey. They always seem to stick out. Sometimes the score makes them better than they deserve to be. In Goldeneye, there was a space related weapon that seemed to work much better in that film.
Another weakness is the lack of a good villain. Donald Pleasance does an ok job as Blofeld but nothing that standsout at all. The make up makes him look more intimidating than he should be. A minor problem has to do with the script. The script was written by Roald Dahl. For the most part, he does seem to understand Bond. But there was a one liner that was excruciatingly bad (""Just like a drop in the ocean""), what kind of a one-liner is that. Connery could not even deliver it straight which makes it stick out. One thing that I liked in You Only Live Twice was the nice relationship that developed between Bond and Aki. It also ends on an ironic note. That was something I had not seen much in a Bond Film. I was pleasantly surprised by You Only Live Twice. There was a bit of Japanese flavor in it that interested me. A very underrated Bond Film.",You Only Live Twice
161,welhof1,Not the same Connery to me,6,16 December 2019,"I watch these films for Bond and Connery was just missing something in this film. He seemed to just mail it in and lost a lot of the charisma he had in the first few films.The plot was pretty far out there but it was entertaining. The Bond girl was kind of forgettable, we never really got to know her.The helicopter fight scene and the villains lair made up for the movies shortcomings though.",You Only Live Twice
162,carologletree,One of the Funnest and Most Action-Packed of the Series,8,7 January 2016,"This film, in my opinion, is a big improvement over the decent but hugely disappointing ""Thunderball."" Known to be the film that ""Austin Powers"" has parodied the most, this film is quite a thrill ride.The production sets were magnificent. The scenery in Japan and Spectre's volcano lair were absolutely breathtaking. Director Lewis Gilbert really has a thing for epic set designs. John Barry's music score is some of the best he has ever done and just really adds to the whole thing.Another stand-out is that Bond finally comes face to face with Blofeld, who is played in a chilling performance by Donald Pleasence. In my mind, he is easily the best Blofeld. Sean Connery is great as usual, although it really does show that he was getting tired of the role at this point.The action scenes were nothing short of spectacular, with the best being the Little Nellie chase scene and the climax in the Spectre lair. Add to that an atmospheric, romantic theme song by Nancy Sinatra and you have a fun movie all around.The only thing that drags it down is the 30 minutes spent on making Bond Japanese; it felt quite perfunctory. Also, the Bond girls were a tad on the weak side.Other than that, I can't complain. This is a fun, exciting, and explosively entertaining adventure that remains one of my personal favorite James Bond films.RATING: A-",You Only Live Twice
163,LuboLarsson,Sean Connery is James Bond,8,10 November 2002,"This Bond film was the first of the huge set, big budget 007 adventures, and its great fun. Although Sean was about ready to hang up his licence to kill in 1967, he was fed up with constant media intrusions and perhaps felt he deserved a bigger pay packet from the Bond producers. I don't feel this affected his performance though, he's still great in YOLV, which is a much better film than Diamonds are Forever which he returned to make four years after this one. This film has an amazing Volcano set, and Donald Pleasence makes a great Blofeld. The music is fantastic and the theme song would later be sampled by Robbie Williams for his No 1 song ""Millenium"". Also the Japanese Bond girls are great too, if you liked this Bond film then check out The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker which have a similar feel to them.",You Only Live Twice

Sadly, this time with tired look, unattractive Bond girls (except 31-year old Helga Brandt, played by Karin Dor), less humor lines and a story that drags at the end. On the other hand, it got interesting locations, one of the most expensive sets used until than and an Eastern touch. Plus there are some minor faults included, such as...Why didn't Ernest Blofeld killed the 007, when he got a chance?So, after a climax with first three Bond's, Thunderball and You only live twice, were a little disappointment for me. Sure, they are still enjoyable from time to time, but they simply cannot compete with the first in the series, and that's why a little lower rate6 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice

I was really impressed by the film architecture and the bomb shell hall in particular! The sense of power transferred to architectural design was very eminent, also the bureaus of Dr. Blofeld etc were very interesting, as well as the designed gadgets and user interfaces. Colors, shapes - everything was there. Truly a master of his craft, Mr. Adam.I won't refer to the rest of the film, just this being said: it was a classical ""Bond"" film, entertaining, fast paced and moody. The action sequences are not too much over the top and Connery is great at being ""Bond"". I loved it all the way.",You Only Live Twice
166,C22Man,One life is enough for Bond,7,7 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Sounds nicely mysterious and fits the context of the film.Pre-Titles: A US spacecraft gets swallowed by a larger unidentified craft and we then cut to Bond in bed with a girl in Hong Kong as he is seemingly killed. This is a pretty causal opening, you'd think Bond's apparent death would be shocking but it isn't exciting or shot with any particular suspense. The space scenes haven't date well and there's also a lack of tension with them.Theme Song: Nancy Sinatra does a good job with the title song, but once again it is John Barry's work that stands out. The string section adds elegance to the song and that main hook just gets stuck in your head making this a memorable theme.Plot: After the US spacecraft is taken, the Americans blame the Soviets and a third World War becomes a possibility. It is believed that Japan is where the spacecraft came from and, after faking his death, Bond is sent there to find out who it was. This is a relatively simplistic plot in all honesty, but it works due to it being easy to follow and because it feels like there is a real global threat if Bond is unsuccessful. The problem is that the film slows down in a number of areas to the point where you almost lose interest in what is taking place.James Bond: Sean Connery is on auto-pilot here and looks completely uninterested with the material he is given. He's visibility aged since Thunderball and had clearly got bored with the role. Bond looks exhausted throughout the film, doesn't deliver the lines with any real wit and takes an even more slapdash approach to his work than usual.Bond Girls: Akiko Wakabayashi is decent enough as Aki. Though the character is underwritten, but she has chemistry with Connery and has a natural charm that makes her likable. Mie Hama is very dull as Kissy. She gets involved in the action, but has even less development, the relationship with Bond comes off as only being there for the ending and they don't even mention her name. Villains: Donald Pleasence shows up as SPECTRE leader Blofeld and despite limited screen time he does a good job. His interpretation of Blofeld is of a sinister mastermind with a ruthless approach and a cold monotone voice to go with it. He isn't much of a physical match next to Bond and he might be a little too eccentric, but he certainly has a creepy quality to him and is memorable. Karin Dor is excellent as femme-fatale Helga Brandt, she is believable as someone who could seduce Bond and she has an attractive presence on screen.Support: Tetsuro Tamba is good fun as Bond's Japanese associate Tanaka. He brings a lot of charm to the role and gets in the thick of the action, convincing as both a friend and a top-notch agent. Bernard Lee is as good as always, whilst Moneypenny and Q also get some decent scenes here and there.Action: The action is decent but nothing truly special. We get some car chases, many fist fights and suitable bits of espionage which are all serviceable, yet none of them contain much excitement or are shot all that well. The scene with the Little Nelly aircraft is fun, but it has no sense of danger to it. The climax is enjoyable for the sheer amount of people involved and how overblown it is, but like Thunderball, it suffers from too much going on.Score: John Barry is as good as ever when it comes to delivering a score filled that evokes exoticism and danger. Many tracks have an oriental sound to them which is perfect for the Japanese setting and creates a lot of atmosphere for certain scenes.Production Values: Ken Adam deserves the applause for his superb set work here. Blofeld's volcano lair is an absolutely fantastic design and looks as grand as anything ever put in the series, perfect for such a big antagonist. The editing isn't great here and as said many parts of the film are really slow. There is a general lack of energy about the film, the excitement that the previous films managed to craft is clearly waning at this point. The whole section were Bond gets married and becomes 'Japanese', and it's as dumb as it sounds, is incredibly boring and adds nothing at all to the plot. Author Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay and despite a few good lines there a no bits of dialogue that stick with you. It's nice to see some Japanese culture, but not if it gets in the way of the story. With that said, setting it in Japan was a very good idea as it allows us to see Bond within yet another new environment.Conclusion: You Only Live Twice is pretty much the ultimate just okay Bond film. There are a number of impressive moments, but there are a lot of very dull moments too. At this point the films were running out of steam and it frequently shows. As said Connery is completely uninterested here and most of the action is uninspired which harms the overall quality. For all the good aspects like the location, sets and Pleasence's sinister Blofeld we have bad aspects like the weak Bond girls and the tediously slow pace. It has its memorable moments, but it just isn't that enjoyable or engaging compared to what had come previously.",You Only Live Twice
167,Mikew3001,A classic exotic James Bond adventure,10,30 September 2002,"""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) is the fifth James Bond movie and one of the best of the whole series. Sean Connery has to fight against his arch enemy Blofeld in Japan, who is stealing Soviet and American rockets by capsules in space to blackmail the governments and cause a new world war. Of course 007 appears to show the strength of Vodka Martinis, macho behavior and the English empire and to fight against his long-time opponent.Filmed in Japan in the summer of 1966, this movie was the first big mainstream film to introduce Japanese culture and lifestyle to Western audiences. You see plenty of beautiful landscapes and shores, the pulsating life of the big cities, night clubs and industrial areas, traditional wedding and tea time ceremonies, massages and conversations, ninja fighters and kung fu tricks, and of course many beautiful Japanese girls. The films takes much time to present the Japanese culture and sometimes rather appears like a (well done) tourist documentary. Even Sean Connery is camouflaged as a Japanese fisherman after his faked death and looks rather like Mr. Spock without ears in this outfit.Lewis Gilbert's direction, the photography and the editing are brilliant as ever, with plenty of rapid-cut fighting scenes, car chases and martial arts action. Nancy Sinatra sings the seducing and psychedelic title theme, and John Barry's great score contains strong influences by Japanese and Asian music. Sean Connery shows one of his hottest 007 performances, and the rest of the cast like Donald Pleasence's Blofeld, Tetsuro Tamba as Tiger Tanaka and Germany's Karin Dor as dominatrix Helga Brandt is also outstanding.The plot itself drifts a bit too much towards b-movie science fiction - a development which increased in the following movies until the Star Wars' influenced space age adventure ""Moonraker"" in 1979, before the whole series switched back to more serious cold war and political/economical thriller plots with ""For Your Eyes Only"" in 1981.All in all, ""You Only Live Twice"" is a classic James Bond adventure with a great scene where Kissy Suziki climbs up a volcano just dressed in slip and bra. Unfortunately Connery left the series in 1967 to get into more serious roles apart from his popular secret agent image. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan returned to South East Asia later on with their Bond roles in ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" (1974) and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" (1997).",You Only Live Twice
168,movieman-200,A Sense of Bordom Permeates This Bond Flick,5,12 June 2005,"You Only Live Twice (1967) is the last film Sean Connery made under his contract with United Artists. By then the strain of having a legion of fans who believed the blur between the flamboyant fantasies of Bond and congenial reality of its star was beginning to wear thin on Connery. As an actor he yearned for the opportunity to branch out. Believing that this would be the last time Connery played Bond, producers Cubby Broccolli and Harry Saltzman fashioned an elaborate swan song for their star. It begins with the apparent murder of Bond inside an Asian brothel  an awkward plot device that is quickly jettisoned for a focus on intergalactic high jacking. Bond journeys to Japan to investigate and is almost immediately the target of lavish assassination attempts from a Japanese industrialist, Mr. Osato (Teru Shimada) and his diabolical femme fatale, Helga Brandt (Karen Dor). Eventually Bond teams with underworld titan, Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), whose connections get Bond on an island that is seemingly populated by harmless fisherman. What Bond discovers is that the island is actually a hub for Blofeld's space hijacking apparatus. Director Lewis Gilbert does his best to make all the elements work, but Connery  looking much older and more bored in the lead  is simply going through the motions on this occasion. Even his venerable interactions with Q (Desmond Llewelyn) lack their usual spark of disdainfully playful banter. The MGM/UA DVD is rather disappointing. The anamorphic widescreen image is both dated and riddled in age related artifacts. Colors are, on occasion refined, but for the most part exhibit quite a bit of fading  especially during outdoor sequences. Matte shots do not appear integrated but rather look very artificial and one dimensional. Whites are generally more yellowish than white. Blacks are more deep gray than black. Fine details are rarely present. The audio is mono. Extras include documentaries, audio commentaries, promotional junket materials and the film's theatrical trailer.",You Only Live Twice

He stands out as a very cunning and threatening villain, whilst at the same time being sort of over-the top and campy, staying true to the franchise's roots.Whilst thist is by no means on the same level as Dr. No, From Russia With Love or Goldfinger, it could be comparable to Thunderball, and is a good adventure movie on its own, that is not to be missed.8 out of 10!",You Only Live Twice

That's why soon after the enormous ""Thunderball"" hit EON begins to work on the new 007 adventure -""You only live twice"".For the first time in the series many elements of the plot are invented by the screenwriters themselves, who mainly keep from the original book the title and the context -Japan-. The film is directed by a new entry in the 007 world: Lewis Gilbert, an expert British maker of war and adventure movies, who enjoyed an international smash the year before with ""Alfie"" (a comedy about a London playboy with Michael Caine). Ten years later he'll lead two other Bond epics -""The spy who loved me"" and ""Moonraker"".Screenplay is written instead by Roald Dahl, the famous writer of fairy tales and books for children (he's the author, among others, of ""The chocolate factory""!).

To me it's a poor effort which failed to satisfy my expectations. Bond seems to be out of element when training to be a ninja, and the ending climax wasn't anything special with the obligatory skirmishes and explosions. But the film isn't completely hopeless, it just isn't even near the best Bonds.",You Only Live Twice

I used to consider it one of the weaker Bond efforts, but I've found myself enjoying the film more each time. The idea of Bond in ninja school is still a little hard to swallow though and the rear projections come off quite poorly, but John Barry's vigorous score and Ken Adam's astonishing sets more than make up for them. The special effects do look pretty cheesy from today's viewpoint, but I'd argue they weren't any better in ""Goldfinger"" and besides they just add to the fun. Some of the dialogue is delightfully witty, as well, and Karin Dor's Helga Brandt is surely among the series' most luscious women.",You Only Live Twice
174,rjsf96,An Exotic Adventure,8,1 October 2015,"If there were any worries that Bond's adventures would become a dull routine exercise then 'You Only Live Twice' put them all to rest. It is an instalment that offers a unique location, even more wickedly cool gadgets and the first on screen appearance of the leader of SPECTRE – Blofeld.James Bond allies with the Japanese Secret Service to find out who is hijacking American and Russian spacecraft. In order to avoid a potential third World War from taking place.Despite a Director usually taking prominent credit for the finished feature film, I believe that this time around the credit must go to production designer Ken Adam. Blofeld's iconic volcanic lair would be nowhere near as great without his involvement. It is the stand out of the film and a work of pure genius. The scope of which has to be commended.The location of Japan grants the fifth film of the Bond series freshness. The exotic locale makes everything that was once old feel new again; from the sprawling streets of Tokyo to the calm fishing village. The sight of these settings is sure to leave you in awe.Blofeld's on screen debut is the grand introduction that the evil megalomaniac deserves. The best kept secret of 'You Only Live Twice' is that his appearance is spared until the end. His scarred deformed face is horrifying and only adds to his vicious manner.The score remains a unique piece of work which is familiar and yet nothing that John Barry has ever produced before. The soundtrack has an oriental feel which only makes it stand out more so. We are further rewarded with countless amazing views of Japan which does wonders for the photography of the film.The only element that could be considered a let-down is the sudden dramatic switching of the apparent lead Bond girl. We grow accustomed to Aki and her personality. The sudden shift in women grants the film no favours. The relationship that Bond has with the second girl is weak and forgettable in comparison with Aki. Heck, I can't even remember the second girl's name for the life of me, so what does that tell you? The relationship acts as a waste of precious time and if it serves any other useful purpose then I have yet to discover it.'You Only Live Twice' ups the stakes and is a welcome improvement after the less than stellar 'Thunderball'. It deviates enough from the standard formula to feel fresh and amidst the flurry of Bond films it is not likely to be forgotten any time soon.",You Only Live Twice

176,stp43,The Best Of The Connery Bonds,9,5 October 2003,"Possible spoilers.You Only Live Twice is perhaps the most exciting of the entire Bond series, featuring some of the best fight scenes, some of John Barry's strongest scores, and a surprisingly strong premise, leading to extra tension that works quite well.The film has one of the very best sets ever built for a Bond film, the mammoth volcano crater within which the villainous SPECTRE is hiding, perpetrating the most audacious plan ever conceived by the world's largest criminal syndicate.  Within this vast underground lair, SPECTRE proves that it does not tolerate failure in one of the most gruesome scenes ever done in any film, the execution of Agent #11 via a pool of pirannha fish, an execution that serves three purposes - to silence a failed agent, to give a surviving agent motive enough to not fail again, and to help persuade two officials from a foreign power employing SPECTRE to seriously consider a monetary demand made by the organization's leader.Donald Pleasance gives audiences the first view ever of Ernst Stavro Blofeld.  Much is made of how Mike Myers has lampooned Pleasance's Blofeld in the Austin Powers films, but this undersells the effectiveness of Pleasance in the role.  He commands the role of Blofeld, making him one of filmdom's most memorable villains with the scar above his right eye, the monotone voice, and the ruthless nature.  That Blofeld as played by Pleasance is shorter than James Bond in the meeting between the two proves surprisingly effective; Blofeld's stature drops somewhat, but his comparative shortness only makes the irony involved in his command of SPECTRE more effective.Setting the mood of the film is the prologue - in most Bond films the prologue is only tangenitally related to the larger story, but here it serves as the story's opening act.  Jupiter 16, a manned US space capsule, is in earth orbit under the tracking of stations in Hawaii and NASA HQ in Houston.  A UFO the appears, and approaches Jupiter 16; suddenly the UFO opens its nosecone and swallows Jupiter 16; highlighting this scene is John Barry's music cue and the presence of Gerry Anderson veterans Ed Bishop and Shane Rimmer as Hawaii CAPCOM tracking operators.The US blames Soviet Russia for the hijacking of Jupiter 16 and vows that a scheduled launch in three weeks will not be interrupted, even though the British (here personified by a strong performance by Edward Mulhare) believe that the UFO landed in the Sea of Japan.  To investigate the matter, James Bond is assigned, but first he dies - an elaborate ruse to persuade SPECTRE that their arch enemy is out of the way.James is infiltrated into Japan, and his investigation envelops the movie in the strongest example of one of the signature strengths of the Bond novels - the novels sought to introduce the reader to foreign locales about which the reader generally knew nothing; the films made a similar attempt, but for the first time in the series the foreign locale truly becomes the film's co-star.The cinematography is among the very best in the series, from the neon skyline of Tokyo through the spectacular lushness of the countryside; among the best shots is the celebrated aerial view of James running from and beating up pursuing dock workers at Kobe.  Also effective is the sky battle involving Little Nellie, a favorite of Major Geoffrey Boothroyd's machines from HMSS' Quartermaster Branch, complete with James' wittily dry code indicating the machine's successful baptism of fire.The SFX work in the film does not look impressive today, but one can live with its cheapness compared to SFX work even ten years later.  The space scenes are for the most part decent; it is launching and landing of the UFO and some travelling-matte explosion FX that presented John Stears with trouble - the cheap-looking FX work in The Guns Of Navarone's climax looks better than the climax here.The climatic action scene is among the bloodiest battles ever put to film, an all-out killing frenzy made even more gruesome by the screams of men dying - an angle too often overlooked in action movies.  More than a few likely found this angle extremely unpleasant, but to director Lewis Gilbert's credit he included it here, adding some much-needed realism to the engaging fantasy elements of the film.And it all adds up to the best of the Connery Bonds, combining the best action sequences, the best setting, and the best overall production values to that point in the series.",You Only Live Twice

However he gets more than he bargained for when he finally comes face to face with SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who is in the process of instigating a nuclear apocalypse which will allow SPECTRE to emerge as the dominant world order...Sean Connery's fifth and supposedly final Bond outing is, in my less than humble opinion, one of the series' best instalments. With it's breathtaking volcano set, terrific John Barry score and top notch action sequences, YOLT is an absolute blast!(no pun intended). The Japanese locations are beautifully photographed and with a script by acclaimed children's writer Roald Dahl, this is one of the more surreal Bond adventures(of which there would be many). Donald Pleasence makes for a superb Blofeld and Connery seems to be enjoying himself. The climatic battle in Blofeld's elaborate volcano lair is just insane and truly spectacular in it's own right, so much chaos!. The stunts and special effects in this sequence alone never cease to amaze me and the bodycount is staggeringly high. An exhilarating foot chase around Kobe docks and the airborne melee featuring the Little Nellie Gyrocopter are also worthy of high praise, even if the effects in the latter are a little clunky. Oh and there's also a brilliant car chase in which are car full of nasty gunmen is amusingly disposed of. After all, it's just a drop in the ocean really.As a child I always wanted a model of Blofeld's volcano lair, in fact to this day I still long for one. YOLT is one of the reasons why I love the Bond franchise so much. True and unapologetic escapism! 10/10",You Only Live Twice

179,glenn-aylett,A return to form after Thunderball.,9,12 March 2012,"Thunderball was a bit below par, but You Only Live Twice was a welcome return to form and was the first non Japanese film to feature ninjas, who make up a convincing army to take on SPECTRE in Blofeld's volcano hideout. Not a dull moment in the film, which sees Japan as the main location, and Bond sees off a variety of enemies, though the most memorable is the fight with Blofeld's massive bodyguard Hans.Also Blofeld was never better when Donald Pleasance played him. At last viewers found out what the head of SPECTRE looked like when he faced the camera instead of stroking a cat, a horribly scarred individual who wouldn't look out of place in Doctor Who and with a sinister, quiet voice that befitted a megalomaniac intent on holding the world to ransom.Of interest, the minor character Dikko Henderson, who is Bond's contact in Tokyo and who is murdered early on, was played by Charles Gray, who went on to play Blofeld in Diamonds Are Forever.I still think Sean Connery was right to quit as Bond after You Only Live Twice as he was approaching his forties and knew he could only play a superfit secret agent for so long. Also this was an excellent way to go out as the huge budget was well spent and the standard of the sets, even 45 years later, look good. A top notch theme tune by Nancy Sinatra rounded off what is a very entertaining Bond.",You Only Live Twice

Sean Connery comfortable in the role and not yet tired of it.  And, at the centre of it all, the ultimate version of Blofeld in a lair carved out of a volcano.

181,Katz5,Austin Powers' favorite Bond,6,6 April 2021,"Yeah baby, that's all you need to say.....Mike Myers looked to this Bond film for inspiration. This is pure 1967, right down to the sets, the costumes, and the Nancy Sinatra title song. The first Bond movie that has its eye on space domination (perhaps the debut of Star Trek on TV the previous year had something to do with it), although the villain's lair is inside a hollowed out volcano. By far the most cartoonish Bond of the '60s, and Connery famously said ""no more"" after the movie was finished. Things would get more serious for the final Bond pic of the decade.",You Only Live Twice
182,mmuggi,New director Lewis Gilbert,7,7 May 2020,"Sean Connery is back for the last time (this time) as James Bond, who is once again facing SPECTER. This movie is the first time to see Ernesto Blofeld. The action takes place by the fact that an unidentifiable spaceship swallows an American spaceship, causing Americans to believe that the Soviet Union is behind. This also happens during the filming of one of the Soviet Union spaceships, which is why the two great powers begin to accuse one another. SPECTER is obviously behind, with the intention of launching World War III.This film subtly taps into the space race, without even mentioning it. The pace is better in this movie, and enough is explained that you can follow the action. There are more Gagdets in this movie than there were in the previous one (Thunderball), which I asked for. Fortunately, Sean Connery was not burdened by the urgent Japanese photographers. Japan is a great location. The fight scenes are excellent, except for the one against Blofeld's primary Henchman, which could be solved by simply shooting him. Sometimes fight scenes are superfluous.There are several things that pop into your eyes suddenly. James Bond walked all the way up to the volcano, without bringing anything. But as he crawls into the volcano, he suddenly puts on a gray suit, with suction cups to crawl in with. His makeup also disappears on the way up there without being mentioned. Blofeld could not identify Bond simply from his Walther PPK, as several in the film universe have used this gun, as well recognized Mr. Osato not Bond, though his face had been in all sorts of papers due to his ""death"". Then there are obviously cameras in outer space and around the air, how else is it explained that you can both look at a screen, that the car is taken off the plane with a magnet, OR even more, how you can over a screen watch the spaceship be engulfed.A movie that fits the plot and pace better for me, but with some awkward plot errors, as well as minor errors. Sean Connery is good as James Bond and we see Blofeld in person for the first time. It was a breath of fresh air with Lewis Gilbert and Roald Dahl.",You Only Live Twice
183,marydm-43470,Sublime cinematic escapism,10,15 February 2021,"Remember when movies could just be fun, fun, fun? When woke PC nonsense had not yet sucked the joy out of commercial blockbusters with no pretensions other than pure unadulterated cinematic escapism? When for a couple of hours and a few bucks you could leave all your worries behind and go enjoy watching improbable people doing improbable things and be ever sooo willing to suspend all belief in reality?
Glorious, glorious, glorious 007 flick! Cliches, racism, sexism etc abound but it's all done so tongue in cheek and so consciously over the top, only a pure grump would not ride along with the shenanigans. A bunch of girls in pink bikinis giving the men service in a Japanese bathhouse; Another girl in a white bikini, freshly emerged from a swim in the sea like an improbable Venus climbing the sides of a volcano, returning barely covered in a shirt short enough for her bikini bottoms to go on showing, then losing the shirt again and running for her life in said bikini while Blofeld blows up the world and all hell breaks loose. It would be so easy to dismiss this as sexist or a white man's fantasy about Asian chiks, but listen carefully to the lines these girls have and that notion evaporates. These girls are steel magnolias as capable of physical action and cheeky repartee as the men. In fact, in this film, the girls have some of the best dialogue.
More recent Bond iterations have bought into the whole PC caper and are not nearly as good in terms of pure entertainment. This sort of movie just couldn't get done nowadays. More's the pity.
PS. I'm a woman BTW, and ever since I watched this movie as a young girl I've coveted Blofeld's super luxurious grotto. Still do, imagine whiling away Covid quarantine in such a place!!!

184,daviddaphneredding,Was Japan ever as exciting?,10,13 March 2015,"Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli did, I personally feel, outdo themselves in this, in my personal opinion, their best James Bond (007) cinematic extravaganza ever. The opening had all the standard characteristics of a James Bond film: Miss Moneypenny (played very well by Lois Maxwell in her very brief cameo appearances) futilely flirts with him, M played by Bernard Lee briefs him on his next assignment, and this is after he is ""killed"" in Hong Kong, then committed to the sea at his burial service.(One night several years ago my wife and I were watching this movie by means of the video tape, and after watching the scene of Bond being committed to the sea, I told her that the rest of the movie was a flashback about his career, but she did not believe me.) The color was beautiful, particularly in one of the early scenes where in a busy section of Tokyo the neon lights were causing to shine brightly some letters of the Japanese alphabet. The storyline too is basic and standard: in this particular case, American space ships are being captured/swallowed up by Japanese space ships, but no one believes this, but do believe that the Russians are responsible for the swallow-up, and therefore, a full-scale war twixt Russia and the U S is eminent while, concurrently, Japan will be a world power, conquering space for military purposes. The mean Blofeld is played so well by Donald Pleasence, and to say he is ugly is, in his isolated case, bordering on a compliment. As always, time is of the essence. Will the possible full-scale war be avoided? I'll let the reader(s)/ viewer(s) discover this. Again, the color is beautiful, the main star Sean Connery performs excellently, as do all the other main actors in the movie. This United Artists movie, filmed at Pinewood Studios in London and on location in Japan, is worth the time and money.",You Only Live Twice
185,CalDexter,The one where Bond goes Japanese...,7,30 June 2007,"You Only Live Twice is another Bond classic, the one where Connery as 007 travels to Japan to investigate the disappearance of American and Soviet spacecraft and indulges in Japanese culture.This is of the best Bonds for unintentional laughs as well. The big fight scene between Bond and a Sumo henchman in Osato's Industrial office quarters is hilarious (especially when Bond uses a leather sofa as a battering ram)as is some of the vivid action scenes in the huge battle climax in Blofeld's Volcanic lair.Sean Connery sleepwalks through the role and expertly hides the fact that he was truly tired of the role that had made him a Hollywood star, but still he delivers. All standards on this fifth entry are above par, and the title song by Nancy Sinatra is one of the most beautiful ever.Top Notch!",You Only Live Twice
186,henrymadman,Connery at his Best.,10,28 September 2007,"You Only Live Twice is a 1967 spy film. It is the 5th film in the James Bond series, and the fifth to star Sean Connery as MI6 agent James Bond. The film's screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, and lightly based on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel of the same name.In the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Russian spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit. With one side blaming the other, and an American moonshot just a few days away, Bond goes undercover on a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators, bringing him face to face with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. This film reveals the features of Blofeld, who was previously a partially-unseen character.After its release in 1967, Connery stepped down from the role, leading to the hiring of George Lazenby for 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Connery later returned officially, one last time, in Diamonds Are Forever (1971). You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me and 1979's Moonraker, both starring Roger Moore.You Only Live Twice became the quintessential example of the spy film particularly with the super villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld and his aspirations of world domination and extravagant lair in a volcano. As a result the film has been parodied greatly perhaps most prominently by the Austin Powers series and the scar-faced Nehru suit wearing Dr. Evil but also in music. The backing soundtrack to the film was used by British singer Robbie Williams in his hit Millennium .",You Only Live Twice
187,cordaro9418,James Bond in Space...,6,10 September 2008,"OK, so 007 doesn't actually get to space till Roger Moore's 'Moonraker', but it's still pretty close.With the Cold War in full swing and the Space Race fueling the fire, Bond saves the world, one Apollo mission at a time.The plot is sluggish and a bit convoluted, relying on old tricks of the trade we had just seen in Thunderball, but it does set a pace and gets us there in one piece.Highlights include Donald Pleasence' delayed debut as Blofeld (if only he remained in the role), awesome use of production miniatures and some well done action... only to be outdone by lowlights such as Bond turns Japanese, Bond gets married, and 007 falls into a crappy Japanese SIS booby trapped floor trick.Tied with Moore's 'Moonraker' as soft Bonds, but still neither of them rank as the worst. Connery's second softest effort behind 'Diamonds are Forever', playing a role he just didn't want anymore.Epic in length, plan the bathroom breaks.",You Only Live Twice
188,98nurdinm-1,"BIG sets, BIG bangs, BIG movie",7,13 January 2005,"This is probably one of the best Sean Connery 007 films. The script, written by Roald ""Charlie And the Chocolate Factory"" Dahl is superb. It is the first instance where the film's storyline was not completely taken largely from the book's original storyline. All Dahl kept from Fleming's original was the Japanese location and the presence of Ernst Stavro Blofeld.To fool the agents of SPECTRE, Bond fakes his own death in China. He plans the timing just right, as Cold War tensions are reaching boiling point between America and the USSR. Both super-state's spaceships are disappearing into thin...well, space! Both countries blame each other, but the British - ho, ho - believe that an unidentified spacecraft landed somewhere in Japan. Bond goes to investigate with the aid of Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), the ""M"" of the Japanese Secret Service, and one of his agents, Aki (Akiko Wakabyashi). After investigating businesses run by SPECTRE's cronies, Bond infiltrates the volcano lair of Bolfeld (Donald Pleasance). Blofeld is been payed a rather large amount of money by the Red Chinese to provoke a war between the USA and the USSR. Bond defeats him, but the SPECTRE leader escapes before he can be caught...EYE-CANDY: Akiki Wakabyashi is very good as Aki, the tough agent, though we rarely see her in any action other than behind the wheel of a car. When the character of Aki dies, her replacement, Kissy Suzuki, played by Mie Hama, ""marries"" Bond in a very beautiful ceremony. I must admit, I prefer Hama to her predecessor, and she proves herself to be an excellent swimmer, but the way she shoots a gun in the final battle scene shows how very untrained Japanese women were in these affairs. The Fiona Volpe of this movie is played by Karin Dor, a red-haired seductress named Helga Brandt. In a harrowing scene, she pays for her mistakes by been dumped in Blofeld's piranha pool. Ouch.BADDIE: Donald Pleasance is extremely sinister as Blofeld, and, like Joseph Wiseman's Dr. No, makes his presence felt even though he is only seen in the final third of the movie. Dhal gives him some wicked lines to say as well, which he performs with relish, giving the true insanity behind this most evil of characters. It's just a pity that many cannot watch this movie without images of Mike Myers' Dr. Evil.OVERALL: A very good movie that packs in the beautiful locations, beautiful girls and beautiful set pieces in all the right places. It gives you all the ingredients you need for a decent Bond film. Plus we even have a little cliffhanger at the end of this movie. After all, who knows where Blofeld has escaped to...?",You Only Live Twice
189,freewillyfan,You Only Live Twice,7,1 November 2019,"You Only Live Twice is the fifth Sean Connery Bond film. This film is one of the weaker of the Connery films. The villain was decent but not in it a lot and the Bond girl was forgettable. Sean Connery looks bored in this film which is too bad. Also the part were he has stuff done to look Japanese was stupid in my opinion. Still, through there are good scenes and I do really like the final act and the location in the volcano.6.8/10",You Only Live Twice
190,TimBoHannon,Sean Connery's First Death,6,29 March 2008,"The filming of ""You Only Live Twice"" was very arduous for lead actor Sean Connery. The Japanese press gave him no privacy, only referred to him as ""James Bond"" and constantly followed him and wife Diane Cilento. He had to eat his meals in his hotel room, deal with photographers circumventing police checkpoints, and one deplorable incident when some reporters followed him into the restroom. Upon being asked if he found Japanese women attractive, he replied no, possibly to anger the press. Midway through filming, he announced his intention not to return for a sixth movie.Connery's immaculate first four performances made him great. To this day, the consensus opinion is that he remains best of the six actors who played the part. This time, he is not. He says the lines he has to say, takes the steps he has to take, he kisses the ladies he must kiss, but there is no emotion, no enthusiasm, and no illusion of the first time. When he says ""Yes, this is my second life,"" his voice betrays his boredom. Faced with imminent execution, he vapidly asks, ""May I smoke?"" the same question he asked Grant in ""From Russia with Love."" If his delivery in that film is a ten of ten, this film's scores a two or a three. He even looks indifferent in the love scenes. Those dang ugly Japanese women! Right, Sean? The script, written by an-out-of-his-element Roald Dahl, may have been another factor. The characters are boring and the redundant dialogue lacks life. One film after Eric Pohlmann declared ""SPECTRE is a dedicated fraternity whose strength lies in the absolute integrity of its members,"" we are ""blessed"" with Donald Pleasance and ""This organization does not tolerate failure."" Instead of poison tipped shoes or a nifty electric chair, there is a foot pedal that drops a bridge into a piranha pool.An Intruder Rocket literally swallows up an American space vessel. The British believe the rocket touched down in Japan, but the Americans naturally blame Russia. No spacecraft of that size could realistically touch down without being detected, even with the technology of the time. Secondly, the idea that one spacecraft could perfectly engulf another at those speeds is laughable. Instead of investigating as MI-6 does, the Americans only take pictures.Arriving in Japan, Bond cons an assassin into taking him to Osato Chemicals. He next meets up with the annoying Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), the head of Japanese Intelligence. Together, they investigate the situation and at length find a link between Osato (Teru Shimada) and SPECTRE.Shoddy action scenes and even worse transitions between them define most of the movie. I had great expectations when I first saw it, but the excitement never came. For instance, the miniature helicopter sequence has nice aerial dives and swoops, but the weaponry and the crashes look so fake that my father, who was in his twenties in 1967, could only shake his head and mutter ""Phony baloney."" There are two Bond girls, played by Mie Hama and Akiko Wakabayashi. Wakabayashi's Aki is lively and beautiful, but Hama's Kissy is a disaster. Her voice even sounds like another Nikki Van Der Zyl voice-over job. Using her for both Honey Rider and Domino was bad enough. Also recycled is Robert Rietty, who voices Tanaka.Those are minor offenses compared with the two worst characters. Tanaka got on my nerves so much that I wanted to strangle him. His ninja training grounds are sorely out of place and only make the film slower; the same can be said of Bond's plastic surgery to look Japanese.Then, there is SPECTRE # 1, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Pleasance). For you readers who have seen Austin Powers, Dr. Evil is no exaggeration. Pleasance turns in a performance much more worthy of the Batman television series than a serious movie. His ridiculous scar, helpless mannerisms and dorky one liners only reinforce his caricature. In the 21 Bond films, only Charles Gray and Steven Berkoff play worse villains.The shots of the Intruder Rocket, which are supposed to be exciting, highlight the worst visual effects in the series. The climax, a shootout between Blofeld's men and a ""modern ninja"" army (?), acts as the only saving grace, but Pleasance's acting constantly undermines it.I did have one moment of genuine joy. Bond melees with Blofeld's bodyguard and then pushes him into the piranha pool. After their chow is finished, he smirks and quips ""Bon appétit!"" It is the last moment of brilliance in Connery's tenure.Thankfully, the producers would correct their mistakes and return to form for a strong sixth entry, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" Most importantly, they were to soon hire a lead actor with enthusiasm for the part, and bring in Telly Savalas to make Blofeld scary again.",You Only Live Twice
191,pninson,Leaving Fleming Behind,6,25 January 2008,"The fifth James Bond film is the first to dispense entirely with Ian Fleming's plot, retaining only the Japanese locales and a few names. Perhaps as a result, this entry has a cheap, flimsy feel compared with its predecessors. It strives for the bold, bombastic energy of GOLDFINGER AND THUNDERBALL but falls short of the mark.Little of the plot makes sense, even for a Bond film. In order to justify the title, Bond's death is faked in the opening scenes, so that his enemies will give him some breathing room. Of course he launches into action immediately afterwards, so his ""death"" has no real impact on the plot, other than giving Blofeld the chance to say, ""You only live twice, Mr. Bond."" However, there are a lot of pluses. Connery is still spot-on as Bond. The pre-credits sequence is breathtaking and the music is excellent, as is Nancy Sinatra's performance of the title song. There is some genuinely spectacular photography throughout, and the story does jell about halfway through, once Bond's mission begins in earnest.Donald Pleasance is probably miscast as Blofeld, but his performance is excellent nonetheless. The super-villain's volcano complex is one of the best of the genre, and the closing action sequences are well done. Testuro Tamba is engaging and charming as Tiger Tanaka, head of the Japanese secret service.The Bond series returned to Fleming in the next picture, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, one of the very best of the series. After that, unfortunately, Fleming's stories went out the window, and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is the template for the formula that followed: exotic locales, gorgeous women, breathtaking stunts, and just enough plot to keep you occupied.",You Only Live Twice
192,Gerardrobertson61,Bond turning Japanese,6,28 December 2019,"Not one of my favorite Sean Connery Bond movies, but still worth watching.

193,MadReviewer,"Not Quite ""Goldfinger"", But Still A Great James Bond Film",8,1 June 2001,"While not the `perfect' James Bond film (that honor belongs without question to `Goldfinger'), `You Only Live Twice' is perhaps the most clever Bond film ever made.  Crackling with razor-sharp dialogue, thrilling action, and some unpredictable twists, `You Only Live Twice' should be required viewing for the current producers of the Bond franchise  it proves that it is possible to meet all the typical requirements of a 007 film and still be original. Only the abrupt, off-key ending of `You Only Live Twice' keeps the film from being an all-time classic . . . still, it's undeniably a great movie, and one of the best Bond films of all time.The film is about how James Bond saves the world . . . oh, you knew that already?  Fine.  `You Only Live Twice' begins as an American spaceship is snatched out of outer space by a mysterious craft.  The American government blames the Soviet Union for the disappearance.  The Soviets, of course, deny their involvement.  As the two nuclear superpowers begin an escalation towards nuclear war, the British Secret Service investigates the possibility that a third party may deliberately be trying to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and the USSR, a third party located somewhere in Japan. The British Secret Service puts their best man on the mission  Bond.  James Bond (Sean Connery).With apologies to the wonderful work that Pierce Brosnan has done in the most recent Bond films, Sean Connery IS James Bond.  Period.  No one else since Connery has mastered his air of cold, suave arrogance.  `You Only Live Twice' is a perfect example of the way-cool attributes Connery brought to the Bond character.  In `You Only Live Twice', Bond seems acutely aware of the fact that he is the best spy in the world, but he never brings attention to that fact  he just assumes other people know it.  Connery also plays Bond as a spy first and foremost, but he's also sure to make Bond a ladies' man and a man of culture.  There's a neat little scene in the film where after fighting and vanquishing a villain's muscle-bound goon, Bond celebrates his small victory by helping himself to a drink from the villain's bar . . . and then promptly insults the villain's taste in vodka. The script also makes subtle mention of Bond's well-to-do upbringing and his education  small things like this have been sorely missed in recent Bond films, and it'd be nice to see such moments resurface, if only in a small way.  The bottom line is, Connery plays Bond in such a way that he manages to be ruthless, arrogant . . . and incredibly charming.  It's difficult to pull such a combination off, but Connery does it so effortlessly, it's simply amazing.The script for `You Only Live Twice' was written by Roald Dahl of `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' fame, and he infuses the film with a wit that's rarely been seen since in a Bond movie.  The dialogue between 007 and Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) absolutely sizzles with tension and wicked sexual innuendo; the acid remarks by Q (Desmond Llewelyn) to Bond about his latest and greatest gadgets are at their all-time best; and the interplay between Bond and the various villains and femme fatales  the evil Mr. Osato (Teru Shimada), the sexy and seductive Helga Brandt (Karin Dor), and especially SPECTRE leader Ernst Blofeld (Donald Pleasance) are all wonderful.  (`Oh, the things I do for England,' Bond mutters under his breath as he seduces Helga Brandt.)  The plot, for the most part is pretty good, too  most of it actually makes sense, and it's infused with enough unexpected twists to keep things pretty lively through most of the film.  The only weakness of the story, in fact, is its ending  it's not bad, but it simply screeches unexpectedly to a grinding halt, as if either the producers suddenly ran out of money, or as if Mr. Dahl simply ran out of ideas and wanted to wrap things up fast.  The ending isn't awful, but considering how sharp and energetic everything else had been in `You Only Live Twice' up to its grand climax, it's slightly disappointing. The action sequences in `You Only Live Twice' are so-so  they probably looked great when the film was first released, but they don't hold up well to the test of time.  The car chases and fights all look painfully staged  granted, they are staged, but most modern films manage to make the audience forget that little nugget of truth.  For example, there's a scene where a helicopter drops a huge industrial sized-magnet onto a car, and lifts it high into the air.  However, the film keeps cutting to a stock shot of Bond as this unfolds, so you never actually see the car get lifted  one minute, it's rolling on the ground; the next minute, it's in the air (and nowhere near the road it was just lifted from).  Nit-picking, to be sure, but it's a clumsy sort of camera cut you usually only see in direct-to-video releases today.  If you take the action sequences for what they are  the best late 1960s film-making had to offer  they're fine, but they simply look mediocre at best decades later.Finally, a side note to any fans of the `Austin Powers' series of films  this is THE Bond film from which Mike Myers took most of his Bond influences.  Dr. Evil's underground bases are scarily close to the underground SPECTRE base in `You Only Live Twice', and as for Dr. Evil . . . well, Dr. Evil is the Donald Pleasance version of Ernest Blofeld.  Mike Myers manages to capture every single one of Pleasance's quirks as Dr. Evil, from the costume and the facial scar right on down to Pleasance's weird shuffling walk and the odd way he pronounces `magma'.  Dr. Evil is literally Pleasance channeled through Mike Myers' body, pure and simple, which is absolutely hysterical to watch  as well as a tad bit disturbing.  Watch `You Only Live Twice', and then go watch the `Austin Powers' films . . . you'll definitely know what Mike Myers' favorite James Bond film must be. 
`You Only Live Twice' comes very close to rivaling `Goldfinger' as the best 007 movie ever made.  As it is, it's still one of the better Bond movies, it's possibly the most cleverly written Bond movie, and it's still extremely enjoyable.  Grade: A-",You Only Live Twice

Recruited by a secret Japanese intelligence unit Bond joins forces to stop S.P.E.C.T.R.E yet again.This far from perfect script is fashioned into a passable tale, but is really driven by the effects. Director Lewis Gilbert misses the mark on storyline and the flow suffers as a result. The Little Nellie sequence is well worth the wait. Support is weak and the editing is ham handed, not the best outing for this franchise.Three stars(of 5.)",You Only Live Twice
196,ntvnyr30,An unfairly pilloried Bond film,8,3 August 2007,"This is one of my favorite Bond films, possibly because it's one of my earliest memories of seeing it on TV. It seems as though this film has been neglected over the years--in lieu of earlier films like ""Thunderball"" and ""Goldfinger."" ""You Only Live Twice"" is much better, in my opinion, than ""From Russia With Love"" which drags for a fairly significant period.First off, the opening song is absolutely one of the best Bond songs ever--right up there with ""Goldfinger,"" ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" and ""Nobody Does it Better."" Second, the opening scene is awesome, as we are lead into thinking that 007 is dead.Thirdly, this film has the distinction of--at least facially---introducing Ernst Stavlo Blofeld. In my mind, Donald Pleasance IS Blofeld!!! I love 007's intro to Blofeld, when we discover the meaning of the title of the film.There's just one thing I don't understand or has been discussed in the ""goofs"" or ""trivia"" sections. When 007 first meets Henderson, Henderson makes Bond a vodka martini, but stirs it rather than shakes it--the opposite way that JB prefers it. Bond said after tasting it that it was ""perfect."" Was Bond just being a gentleman by not correcting his host's prep of his fav drink? Or was this an oversight?Oh well, still a great film and one of my favorite Bond films.",You Only Live Twice
197,hedgehog-10,One of my favourite bond films.,8,17 April 1999,"A crisp dialogue is well acted. The film has a good balance between action scenes and dialogue.

198,Theflyace,Bond Month #5: Mike Meyer's Austin Powers fodder,4,30 September 2013,"Oh boy I have been dreading this one. This is a Bond film that I truly despise and find really overly silly. I wish that the Colonel from Monty Python would come in and stop the film from getting too silly. But here we get a lava pit full of trash and gimmicks. Like my title suggests, this is the film where Mike Meyer's got his material to mock in Austin Powers (I might include these films if time permits over the course of the month) The story (written shockingly by Roald Dahl, WHAT????!!!!) entails SPECTER stealing two spacecraft (one American, and one Soviet of course) to hold for ransom or create war between the two rivals (the delegates of whom are made out to be absurdly childish compared to the British) Bond must travel to Japan to find SPECTER's hidden base in a volcano (pretty good move, right? Fellas?) and destroy it before anything can happen. We are also treated (by that I mean letdown) to the reveal of Number 1, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.This one is bad. Sean Connery is so bored in this film it's not even forgivable. The Bond girls are immediately forgettable. The only thing I remember about them is one of them has a kick-ass Jaguar convertible. Blofeld, hidden in the shadows until now, is finally revealed. Esssentially, think of Dr. Evil if he was actually taken seriously. Donald Pleasance isn't good at all, making this built up monster into a sweet little man with a really funny voice. Even his cat hates him in this movie, I'm not kidding take a look and you'll see.Let see, there are all of two things in this movie that are beyond exceptional. One is Tiger Tanaka. he is one of the better Bond male allies, and one of the few that survive the end of the movie. And then there is the giant volcano set by Ken Adam. AMAZING. GENIUS. HUGE. IMMENSE. This set is that impressive people and it looks so real.Besides that, this movie is not very good. Some people love it, some people like it, I'm one of the people who really doesn't like this one. Its just one I find so bland its not even passable as tongue-in-cheek. Watch Austin Powers, its much better in terms of plot and character than this ""stright-faced"" film. But with this film, next, we're onto On Her Majesty's Secret Service!!!!",You Only Live Twice
199,The Spectacular Spider-Man,"""You only live twice, Mr Bond.""",6,5 October 2008,"It's hard to take this film seriously now, and not think of Dr Evil and Mini-Me performing Just the Two of Us. But it shows just how much effect this particular Bond movie has on popular culture. YOLT is virtually the template for how the general public see Bond, for better or for worse.Of course, it's also hard to take the movie seriously when the main Bond girl is not even named. Where the fifteen minutes before the climax are Bond doing nothing in a Japanese village.The first mis-step of the Bond series, this. YOLT ticks all the boxes necesary for a Bond film, but does so mechanically, without the flow of Goldfinger or the excitement of Thunderball. Lewis Gilbert, who essentially directed the same Bond movie three times, is competent but uninspired. His main man Connery is oh-so-clearly bored, as he has so little to do.This movie came along when the spy mania of the 60s was at a peak, and with numerous films and TV shows (Mission Impossible, Man from UNCLE) all chasing Bond's territory, the Bond team felt they had to simply be bigger than everyone. You Only Live Twice is so big that it dwarfs Connery, he is almost as much a spectator as the audience.It's a film that bores me. The opening 'Bond gets shot!"" is effective, but from then on (the sea-burial/he's alive really gag is where Bond started to become very self-consciously silly/camp) it's just autopilot. Whereas previous movies had efficient and strong spy/espionage plots, YOLT barely has a plot, it's just an excuse to string together a series of set-pieces. At times, with Connery running around after nameless Japanese women, you wonder if the director knew what was going on.One of the central concepts of Bond, and it's an effective one, is that the films move so fast, and are so entertaining, the audience doesn't have time to realise any flaws in logic or plotting. Most Bond films get away with this, YOLT draws attention to it. YOLT virtually says to the audience, ""No, we don't have a plot or substance for you, but look at this car being dropped into the sea by a helicopter."" It's weak...I mean, it's acceptable in that it's a Bond film of the classic era, there is spectacle and some great music. But it is just a collection of scenes, not a proper narrative. It's thankfully no Diamonds are Forever, but it's very, very average compared to the four movies that came before it.",You Only Live Twice
200,moatazmohsen78,The best novel for Fleming and best film in the series,7,30 April 2006,"Ian Fleming wrote this novel at the time of softness because of great feeling with the spirit of romance in the events of this story.He made a good mixing in this story between love,adventure and interesting.This film was the best one in the series of Bond,s films because of the same reasons of the literature text increasing another element for the success of this film is the musical element by John Barry who was succeed for his musical comments in different situations.This film made a spotlight on the cool war between U.S.S.R and U.S.A especially in the branch of space war that the two countries were succeed until now in this branch.The best scene in this film was (the scene of Japanese wedding) when bond married to Japanese girl which was the including point in this operation by good acting and adapted music in this situation.That is the cleverness from Fleming and the director to made an explanation for the habits of the others.The best scenes in this film were the good nature of Japan with magnificent hills and fantastic oceans and shores with good portrait.",You Only Live Twice

The three abducted astronauts that Bond frees from their cell in the Spectre Volcano Base just disappear before the Ninja attack and presumably perish when Blofeld blows everything up at the end. They were not shown swimming out of of the base with Bond, Akika and his few surviving Ninjas. Why? And why didn't Blofled kill Bond along with the Japanese magnate, instead of having Bond come down with him to his getaway rail car, only to try to kill him then and be foiled by Tanaka, again at the last second? And how the hell did Akika manage to get word to Tanaka and his ninjas about the Spectre volcano base so they could attack in force in such a short time?",You Only Live Twice
202,varuna12,Living this film once is enough to be honest.,5,9 May 2017,"Y O U . O N L Y . L I V E . T W I C E (1967) - Living this film once is enough to be honest - - James Bond is dick! -!!!!There are couple of spoilers!!!!One can argue that they did it all the prevent a nuclear world war. But it is just sad to see super dedicated footsoldiers of SPECTRE and in this film's case, the 100 'modern ninja warriors' die like they didn't matter. The SPECTRE chaps are always so dedicated in defending the evil deeds set by their masters, especially after they,the masters have ran away leaving the SPECTRE chaps to continue to fight and die and fall like flies. I wonder whether SPECTRE pays anything to their families. Some kind of compensation. I hope they do. Respect to the fallen 100 'modern ninjas' too in this case. Now lets talk about the film. Sean Connery is at it again, on 'Her Majesty's Secret Service' which incidentally is the name of the next film in the series. He plays 'James Bond' again with codename 007. I think James Bond is a bit of a dick!At 1:16:05 Aki dies but at 1:17:50, the dickhead 'James Bond' is already trying to figure out how ugly or pretty is 'fake-mission' wife is going to be! You look at his expressions and you just want to slap him with a wet slipper on face!I think Bond is just an asshole who gets lucky every time. He happens to be there to meet Mr. Henderson when he is assassinated. Bond, being Lucky yet again to be there now chases the assassin and kills him and pretends to be him. In doing so, he manages to get to baddies' headquarters which is actually a 'front' for SPECTRE. And the story begins. What if the assassin had killed Mr.Henderson before Bond had arrived to meet him? Then? There won't be this story. There are few other 'Lucky happenings' that happen to happen just when Bond is there. And this is a pattern that is there in all the Bond films. I hate it.Let's talk about screenplay and the story. Can somebody please tell me why the hell was Bond carrying knee and hand suction pads? Why? Where was he carrying them under the kimono? And why was he carrying them? He had not yet found the hidden volcano lair? Total Bullshit!I just hate the typical formulaic pre-climatic fight between Bond and a strong baddie who is always the villain's sidekick, 'Hans' in this film. A tall, lanky, bulky chap who is shown only twice in the entire film, he is brought to fight Bond even when his masters have died or left. Why would you fight like that? What for? I can give myself a counter argument which would be that he is one of those super dedicated SPECTRE chaps! But it is a bit unrealistic. Its formula!Can some one please also tell me why would 'Number 11' take the hassles of pretending to be a traitor to Mr.Osanto and SPECTRE by escaping with Bond from the Osanto headquarters to an airport or airstrip somewhere, to get where they would have had to drive, find a plane, refuel it, check it for safety and then fly it to the middle of nowhere so that 'Number 11' could deceive Bond and try to kill him by leaving him stranded and stuck in the plane as 'Number 11' jumps out with a parachute! Why? Why go to all this trouble to kill him like this? Why? When you already had Bond in front of you, tied to a chair at place where 'Number 11' would be safe and have backup baddies! Why?SIMPLY RETARDED!The only saving grace for me in this film were the pretty Japanese girls, a few beautiful cinematic shot and the music which starts in the beginning. I happen to like this theme the most and it was absolute pleasure to hear it every now and then.A mediocre film with crappy sensibilities. All I can say is that the plot of the film, the concept, the idea that SPECTRE would somehow cause a nuclear war between US and USSR by deceiving them both is amazing, it the execution and the filmmakers' sensibilities that lets this film down big time.My ratings: 5/10 *****Watch it if you are not too bored!!!I must add that I loved the hidden-under-volcano set! Loved the grand scale of it and how it was designed.",You Only Live Twice
203,dieseldemon85,Connery seems bored,7,30 August 2019,"I have always liked this film. It isn't in my top ten but it is very good. The story is good pitting U.S against the Soviets in disappearing shuttles one blaming the other,in attempt to start war. This plan is once again a S.P.E.C.T.R.E plot. First time we see Blofeld played wonderfully by Donald Pleasance. My personal favorite though was Telly Savalas. Neither of the Bond girls are really memorable,John Barry's score is good and an almost dream like song by Nancy Sinatra. My biggest issue with this film is Connery. I know at this time he wasn't getting along with the producers,and it does show. He kind of sleepwalks his way thru this one. 7",You Only Live Twice
204,Dock-Ock,Welcome to Japan Mr Bond,9,26 September 2001,"You Only Live Twice is pure Comic Book entertaiment. James Bond is very much the superhero character he was in Goldfinger, and every scene is like a panel in a Comic Book and filled with entertaining excitement. In truth, it is though the feel and style that was vibrant throughout Goldfinger [1964] leapfrogged the dull Thunderball [1965] and found it's way to Japan. Twice is a beautiful looking and sounding addition to the Bond movies, and one is glad Sean Connery didn't really resign from the role of Bond and did indeed Live Twice.By jettisoning most of Ian Flemmings original story You Only Live Twice, in wich an amnesiac Bond Hunts down Blofeld in Japanese castles, Broccoli and Saltzman have ridden themselves of the same problem evident in Thunderball : Slow Movement, Uninterested Audiences. Thunderball may have been a success, but this was probably due to the Bondmania wich raged through the mid sixties like a giant inferno. Luckily for the fans of the eye popping spectacles the Bond series is famous for, You Only Live Twice contains no such problems of dreary moments of boardom. In its place we have a Space Age actioneer written by childrens author Roald Dahl, and an entertaining and swift director in Lewis Gilbert, who seems more suited to Bond than any director yet.It has been said before, but the real star of the show is Ken Adams sets. His wondefull Volcano set wich Blofeld uses is one of the most memorable in Cinema history. Add to this the Japanese sets, the Submarines [M's Offices], Tanaka's Lair, and the real sense of Japanese authenticy. Adam deserves an Oscar for this movie alone. For his total contributions to Bond and other movies, there is no Award yet created.Donald Pleasence makes a very creepy Blofeld. He is perhaps the ultimate Blofeld. His scenes with the other cast members show the complete acting skills of a fine actor. Twice also contains one of Desmonde Lywellyn's funniest performances as Q,and one of Q's finest creations, the Little Nellie Helicopter. Little Nellie is every Bond fans dreams, personally i think it would be lovely to soar above rural England in Nellie, let alone Japan! Some guys have all the luck! Twice also has one of John Barry's most beautiful themes,and songs sung by Nancie Sinatra.The only real let down this time is Sean Connery. He makes any Bond film look good, but this time doesn't look as though he is enjoying himself all that much. This is a petty bacause Twice itself is a very impressive and enjoyable Bond movie, with some of the best sets, Action sequences and Acting in the entire series.",You Only Live Twice
205,Tobeshadow,Bond vs. Proto Musk!,8,30 October 2021,"Connery is certainly past his best here, and his frustrations at playing the character for a fifth time are evident in places, but the production design, exotic locations and all round execution of the classic Bond formula are all top notch.Despite surpassing Thunderball for scope and budget, this one has always felt a bit more slick and has all the elements that make for a great Bond film, with perhaps the small exception of questionable Asian prosthetics. Another time indeed!This film has always felt like the end of the first wave of Bond. Due to George Lazenby taking over the role for OHMSS in 1969, this was the last Connery film of the 1960s and by the time he returned for Diamonds Are Forever, it was 1971 and things had changed massively both culturally and politically.It's rather enjoyable that Elon Musk has made this film seem far more realistic with his reusable Space X rockets and it's still an absolute treat to watch over 50 years on!",You Only Live Twice

208,rneil95,Not Particularly Good or Bad,5,5 November 2013,"After taking a year off after the release of ""Thunderball,"" James Bond returned to the silver screen, this time with Lewis Gilbert taking the helm as director. Following four solid movies had to be tough, and while ""Thunderball"" wasn't as great as the first three films, it never made any serious missteps. But, it was bound to happen sometime, and with ""You Only Live Twice,"" that time has come. To be fair, it's not a bad film, and there is some really great stuff in here. Some of the content of the film could be considered iconic, but there's a lot of weak stuff that bogs it down.After a bizarre opening set in space, we get MI6 orchestrating a scenario in which Bond fakes his own death to turn the attention of SPECTRE away while he investigates the disappearances of U.S. and Soviet spacecrafts. The film plays a lot on the Cold War tensions of the time, as previous films have, but once again, SPECTRE is pulling the strings and Bond is dispatched to Japan to find out what they're planning. Based on the premise alone, this is definitely already treaded ground, and there's only so much they can do to avoid feeling like it's just ""been here, done that."" The biggest problem with this movie is the characters. Nearly everyone is forgettable here. The henchmen, allies, Bond women, none of them really leave any notable impact. The exception to this, however, is the brilliant Donald Pleasance as the often heard, but never seen Ernst Stavro Blofeld. This is an iconic villain performance that stands out as one of the best in the series. His unforgettable look, sinister delivery, and cold menace allow for a really great villain, but he is sorely underused. It's a testament to his performance, though, that he managed to be the standout given how little he is actually shown on film.The other star of this film, for me, is production designer Ken Adam. His volcano lair set is probably the pinnacle of his accomplishments, giving us the ultimate evil hideout. As a matter of fact, once the film makes it to the volcano lair scenes onward, it's much better. That being said, it takes quite a while for the film to get to that point. The plot meanders about for quite a while, and Sean Connery isn't doing us any favors here. He seems bored, clearly having no further interest in doing Bond films for any other reason than for the paycheck. His heart's not in it, and that definitely leaves the viewer with a sense of apathy while watching it.I don't think ""You Only Live Twice"" is a bad film, in fact the good aspects of it are really quite good. It just feels like nobody was really invested in it this time around, except for Pleasance and Adam. I really want to like this film, I really do. I just don't think it has all that much going for it, not adding anything new to the formula, but at the same time not doing the formula as well as it could be done. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either. It's just not particularly memorable.",You Only Live Twice
209,DMP-2,The worst Bond film,2,11 December 2000,"This film was horrible. Its that did just after they had the mega-hit THUNDERBALL (1965). Especially since this was going to be Sean Connery's last. I will say the movie does instances of genius, for instance the fact that (maybe spoiling) Blofeld laboratory was in a volcano. Also Donald Pleasance gave an ample performance as Blofeld, the next 2 actors would heavily overshadow him, Telly Savalas (On her Majesty's Secret Sevice (1969)(the best), and Charles Gray (Diamonds Are Forever (1971). Pleasance only stands above John Hollis (For Your Eyes Only (1981), who had such a short role its hard to articulate whether he was better or worse. This film is missing so much, its evident they were looking for hit quick, which is what makes a bad film. It happen again in Man With The Golden Gun (1974), its predecessor Live And Let Die (1973) was subtle hit. They used that and made that. Same thing happened after the mega-hit The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (Just a little better than this movie) did make a lot money, but only because the hype behind it. Which is why this made so much. It rare occasion when a bad movie makes millions. Still, I recommend you see it, all Bond films should be seen and owned, Because its not just YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE its, JAMES BOND 5.",You Only Live Twice

The film is home to one of the best sets in Bond history (the inside of the volcano). The villain Blofeld is one of the very most liked villains in any Bond film.

Some criticism has been leveled at the script, but I think it's one of the best. Roald Dahl, people? This movie serves up appropriate and welcome helpings of M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, and cool gadgets. Japan makes a lovely theater of action (I believe this was the first time I ever saw a ninja!), providing glimpses of sumo wrestlers, beautiful gardens, a Shinto wedding, and some rudimentary (compared to today's films) martial arts. And the sets! Lord have mercy - a hollowed-out volcano? With ninjas? And piranhas? And Blofeld's kitty? Really, just great buckets of fun. The Bond gang were at the top of their game here.

It's the classic James Bond formula, which keeps evolving.
More bad guys, action, one-liners, gadgets, girls, things exploding way too much for no reason and everything you would expect from a Bond movie.
This time his adventures bring Bond to Asia and it mostly takes place around Japan and it's exciting.It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days to understand Bond better and watch how the movie series has evolved over time.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a Bond movie, but it's not a bad thing at all and it's very enjoyable even after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 1960s vibe of Japan works extremely well.This movie feels quite refined out of the early Bond movies and personally I liked Goldfinger more but this one was pretty good too.
Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it. Personally, after watching Goldfinger this feels like not the greatest one of them all and not the worst one it's somewhere in the middle around 8 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone familiar or not with the Bond franchise but it wouldn't be my first choice.",You Only Live Twice

214,sterlinrivera-2000,Yet Another Great Bond Film,9,5 January 2020,"You Only Live Twice is like From Russia with Love. I don't love it, but I do like it a lot and is still a great film to watch.The movie is about spacecrafts going missing during the Cold War, and British intelligence finds out that one of the crafts have landed in the Sea of Japan. James Bond (Sean Connery), who has faked is death and is believed to be dead, is sent to Japan to investigate the craft. He also gets help from Tiger Tanaka and a beautiful woman, Aki.You Only Live Twice was very good. Sean Connery did another great job as Bond and the woman that played Aki did a pretty decent job. I really liked the story, and how some of the film takes place in space and most of it took place in Japan. The pacing was also great for an hour and 55, and had some really good action sequences that make you wanna keep watching the film.All in all, You Only Live Twice is yet another great example of a great James Bond film.",You Only Live Twice
215,tonynworah,Bond Lives Forever,8,25 January 2011,"You Only Live Twice marked the part where Bond movies lost their realistic plot (Not that they were that realistic anyway) and delved into the realm of fantasy bordering on science fiction. It also was the first film to be radically different from the novel in its story line and plot. The only similarities are the existence of Japan, the Japanese secret service and Blofeld. In the novel, the mission had nothing to do with the Space Race between the superpowers that was the central theme of the movie. Probably because of this, YOLT has been a source of debate about its entertainment value. While most Bond fans agree about the excellence of films like Goldfinger, Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, YOLT generated a lot of negative criticisms.Despite all this, YOLT still brought in a hefty profit and impossibly remains one of my favourite Bond movies.Here, the stakes are even higher than that of Thunderball. The stake is World War 3. The catalyst for this threat to world peace is a spacecraft of unknown origin that has hijacked a US Space capsule in space. The Americans predictably accuse the Russians of the theft which Russians deny. The US Government then announces that they will be sending another spacecraft in 3 weeks and that if this one is stolen as well, they will declare war on Russia.When the British announced that their satellites picked up the Unidentified Flying Object going down the seas of Japan, nobody believes them. It is now up to them to send their white knight in the form of Agent 007 to find those responsible for the theft. Because of the high stakes and the time pressure, British Intelligence needs Bond not to be distracted by his old enemies. So they fake his death and the world hears that our beloved hero was assassinated in Hong Kong.Bond travels to Japan where he forms an alliance with Tiger Tanaka, the Head of the Japanese Secret Service, Tiger's competent (and of course female) agent called Aki, and naturally the Ninjas. In Japan, he uncovers SPECTRE as the real people behind the hijacking but then the pressure shifts to high gear when a Russian capsule is hijacked in a similar manner as the US space capsule. Now the Russians accuse the Americans who in retaliation (and illogically) decides to bring the launching date of their next rocket nearer. And threatens immediate war if their property is hijacked-again.The future of mankind now rests on Bond and his Japanese alliance. And also on Q to give Bond the gadgets which he will use to accomplish his mission. The gadget is one nifty toy like helicopter that is actually a killing machine, incongruously called Little Nellie.Notwithstanding the silliness of the plot, the action is tight, fast paced, the story is simple to follow and very exciting. The directing was excellent, the cinematography driven with the rich pictures of Japan and the haunting theme song by Nancy Sinatra was outstanding and still remains one of my best Bond themes.The only let down was impossibly Sean Connery. Sean Connery gives an average performance, certainly nothing as good as in his previous movies. Having announced his resignation from the Bond movies, his lack of enthusiasm showed and got worse in Diamonds are Forever. Tetsuro Tanba who plays the Tiger almost steals the show from Connery. Kudos should also be given to Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi). She displayed the correct balance of competence, humor and vulnerability that made her a delight to watch. Her exit from the movie was one of the most moving and tragic deaths of a Bond ally.But the most memorable character in YOLT was Ernst Stravo Blofeld. Finally, the film makers decided to show his face and it was worth the wait. Donald Pleasance who played Blofeld with chilling effect is easily the best Blofeld ever. Safely ensconced in the amazing artificial volcano where he is hatching his plot for world domination in tryst with what his presumably the Chinese, his soft voice, his blank but menacing expression, his white cat, his pool pf piranhas that he does not hesitate to use with chilling efficiency, Pleasence created a villain unrivalled by any in the Bond series. He had a screen time of maybe only 15 minutes but in that small time, he totally dominated the film and his verbal stand off with Bond was the most climatic in the movie. Why he did not reprise his role in the other Bond movies that featured Blofeld has always been a mystery to me. I believe that the Bond franchise suffered because of his absence. In fact when reading the Bond novels, the image of Blofeld is Pleasance and nobody else.In one of their last scenes in the movie (which is almost my favourite), a captured space man's space helmet is removed to reveal Bond. In response to Blofeld's query about the reports of his death, Bond quips, ""Yes, but this is my second life"" In an emotionless monotone but with a subtle hint of menace, Blofeld chillingly assures him, ""You Only Live Twice Mr. Bond"".But Blofeld was wrong. Bond Lives Forever.",You Only Live Twice

219,Reef-Shark,Perhaps the most energetic Connery film,7,1 April 2009,"You Only Live Twice is a Bond film only Connery could have pulled off without the film falling into the lowest pits of camp. In a movie that includes spaceship eating spaceships, a miniature attack helicopter, a man-eating piranha tank, rocket-bullet firing guns, and pistol toting ninjas; this is a case where only Sean Connery's charm could save a film from being dominated by its cheese...Even when he's wearing poor make-up to make him ""Japanese."" The film begins with James Bond's untimely death, but don't fall for that trap! That clever Agent 007 has faked his own death and funeral at sea so as to pull away from the evil SPECTRE organization, which is now operating out of Japan. What could they do in Japan? How about attack American and Soviet spacecrafts and send to Cold War in to an all out nuclear war between The United States and Soviet Union? That sounds evil enough for one movie! Since they now believe Bond to be dead he is able to infiltrate their infrastructure and discover their plans for World War III. With the help of Tiger Tanaka (head of Japanese Special Forces), his army of modern ninjas, and the beautiful Aki, Bond is set to take down this sinister plot.Of course this time SPECTRE isn't holding any punches, for their faceless leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, is in Japan personally overseeing this operation (a great performance by Donald Pleasance). The criminal mastermind is determined to eliminate his pesky foe once and for all. Whether it be by submerging the smooth talking agent in a manmade lake filled with flesh-eating piranhas, poison taken in through the mouth, or a simple shot to the head.This entire film is built on a series of elaborate actions sequences, including two stand-out scenes in which Bond engages multiple SPECTRE helicopters with ""Little Nellie"" (the newest gift from Q) and a massive firefight between Tiger Tonaka's modern ninjas and the forces of SPECTRE in their hollowed out volcano lair.If you haven't noticed by this brief summary You Only Live Twice could very well could have been the one to set the foundation for the camp-filled Bond films of the 1970s. The exotic locations and over the top ideas are things that would be exaggerated and expanded upon in Diamonds Are Forever (Connery's last film) and all throughout the Roger Moore era of the character.So for these reasons You Only Live Twice is probably Sean Connery's most enjoyably fun entry in his run as the character.",You Only Live Twice
220,bock_g,"Over-the-top, but still passes as a classic.",8,4 June 2011,"""You Only Live Twice"" is Sean Connery's fifth outing as James Bond (and ironically his last due to a slight change in his acting career to avoid typecasting). A loose adaptation of Fleming's twelfth Bond novel, the film is the first film to have a completely original plot (while using some of the characters that appeared in the novel). The first half of the film was interesting, beginning with Bond's fake death in Hong Kong to Bond investigating the rocket hijacking in Japan. I loved how the filmmakers used many real locations in Japan (as Japan was at its height of economic prosperity) as well as using real Japanese actors to portray their roles. More like a detective thriller, Bond strolls around Japan sneaking into a office building, riding Tiger Tanaka's cool private train, and getting massaged by hot Japanese chicks. The second half of the film was over-the-top, with Bond flying a gyrocopter, Bond posing as a Japanese fishermen, Bond and his fake wife Kissy infiltrating Blofeld's volcanic lair, and Bond trying to ride one of the rockets posing as an astronaut. However, these moments managed to pay off with good acting and directing. The introduction of Blofeld (portrayed wonderfully by Donald Pleasance) was pretty chilling and still remains to be one of the best introductions of a character in film history. The Bond girls were attractive, yet still served as a legitimate purpose to the story (much like ""Thunderball""). ""You Only Live Twice"" is one of those sophisticated films that can only be pulled off by good acting and directing.",You Only Live Twice
221,jonny_mcclatch,The most iconic of the Bond films.,8,4 February 2020,"I can't not rate this film highly, don't get me wrong there is plenty of flaws worth bringing it down which is why it's not a 10. But the best parts are so good that it would be criminal to trash the film for it.What are the best parts? This film became the benchmark for many movie villains and film sets, after 4 other films we finally get to see Blofeld and the reveal is so good that you almost completely forget that in reality he just peers out from behind his henchmans backside. On top of that they are in this incredible set which is still impressive and often parodied in movies now. It is also one of the first noticeably exotic Bond films, the entire film is on location and showcases Japan. It's just a genuinely fun movie from start to finish thanks to parts like the Little Nellie action scene or the volcano lair.One giant flaw of this film is more infamous than everything else, that's right. The scene were they decide James Bond has to become Japanese in possibly the worst disguise ever seen. It's also quickly forgotten about, he fakes marriage for an afternoon before the movie carries on which was definitely for the best.Beyond that the only issue I personally had with the film is the death of Aki, while actually a very moving scene in the movie. A woman who Bond actually really connected with until this point is forgotten about, I felt while it was well acted that it just seemed to be a way of bringing Kissy Suzuki in for the remainder of the film and by comparison the relationship between her and Bond wasn't as good and took away from the death of Aki.",You Only Live Twice
222,tomasg-69814,The Japanese Experience Of 007.,8,17 January 2016,"By 1967 James Bond were ""bigger than Jesus"" on screen, to use a well known phrase from John Lennon, himself peaking his Beatle career with Sgt. Pepper the same year. Sean Connery had developed his 007 character to the fullest, and started to feel some boredom in the series, according to later interviews. But the Bond-machine itself was in top gears, now building multi-million dollar stages to simulate volcanoes and other things. This fifth movie in the James Bond series is better than the precursor, by thin margin, and was for sure an entertaining continuation for the already blessed 007-fans. This movie was the end of the era I use to call JB Mk.I. (62-67.) No strings attached, by the release of You Only Live Twice the production team delivered a well remembered movie. Many classic scenes and a good intrigue, with a bombastic final. But what would the future hold for a restless MI6-agent? By then I think none was prepared of what to come up on screen in a few years.....",You Only Live Twice
223,reoroy,If You Only Live Twice Watch This Movie During Both of Your Lifetimes,9,17 June 2020,"There are two specific reasons why I liked ""You Only Live Twice"" which has every right to be considered as a legendary Bond movie.(1) Bond becomes airborne when he flies an autogyro called Little Nellie and is chased by the villain's helicopters. That scene is a treat to the eyes and can be considered to be just as great as the grand underwater action sequence in ""Thunderball"". I feel the aerial sequence that features this autogyro perhaps became a standard for movies in the future that wanted to depict impressive aerial shots of flying objects.(2) The set design of the lair of the SPECTRE boss is possibly one of the most elaborate movie set designs I wil have seen on celluloid. The intricacy of that set never ceases to amaze me. If that set has still been preserved to this day, I would certainly love to seep in its apparently magical aura. I wish some amusement park created a ride inspired from the sets that depicted the lair.Besides the aforementioned reasons, I like how the SPECTRE boss' face gets revealed in this movie. Overall, everything seemed to pan out in a way that thoroughly entertained me. This movie will always be a substantial precedent for action movies that boast of incredible sets and innovative action sequences.",You Only Live Twice
224,gerard-21,YOLT- You (Sean) Only Looked The (Part),5,25 May 2000,"Connery's worst performance by far as James Bond or in any role for that matter. He doesn't even try to create a credible character, although the script and direction doesn't offer much help either. This is also by far the silliest of all his Bond movies, which is probably the reason that Mike Myers' Austin Powers seems to borrow from and mock this one the most. Sure, Diamonds are Forever was the first Bond film to emphasize wit and high camp over serious spying, but this one is unintentionally funny. Pleasance's uttering of the line, Kill Bond - NOW!!!, is a perfect example. Sounding more like a spoiled child than the leader of the world's biggest criminal organization, it is hilarious. Given his small physical stature, Pleasance seems to portray Blofeld as suffering from some sort of short-man stigma, further complicated by a hideous scar.  The fact that the incredibly silly plot was taken so seriously also has a bit of ironic humor to it as well, especially in light of the Bond movies to follow it in the early seventies which took good plots and characters too lightly. And again, Connery's performance is non-existent, and this alone is enough to rank it as the worst of his Bonds by far. I think the actor himself was embarrassed by his showing, and after thinking about it for a few years wanted to right a wrong. Remember that when he returned in Diamonds Are Forever, he said he would only do it that one time and never again and he donated his entire salary to charity. His motivation therefore seemed to clearly be to go out giving his finest performance, which he did. In fact his acting in DAF, saved the movie and elevated it to a higher level than it would have attained if any of the other Bond actors had been in the movie. Here, in YOLT, Connery helps to destroy the movie. He's incredibly slow moving and lethargic. It's almost as if the producers drugged him up so that he would take the role. And that fight with Blofeld's henchman Hans is the worst and least believably one of Connery's reign. Connery shouldn't take all the blame however, because the script doesn't give him anything to do, except press buttons and trigger gadgets. The intended humor appears forced and there's no real interaction between the characters. For those reasons this also ranks as the most superficial of all the Connery Bonds. None of the things Bond does in this movie contribute to establishing his character in an manner whatsoever. Where is the rugged toughness he displayed in Dr. No and Form Russia with Love? What about the cool confidence he possessed in Goldfinger and perfected in Thunderball?  Or The sophisticated wit and sense of irony we enjoyed so much in Diamonds Are Forever? Oh well, you can't get it right every time, and at least this movie contains another great John Barry score and a few very Bondian moments like the Kobe docks fight and Aki's death. Worth watching only after you've seen all the other Connery ones or if you're trying to introduce a child to the world of James Bond films.",You Only Live Twice
225,d-apergis,dazzlingly lavish,8,22 December 2009,"Expensive Bond extravaganza in which everything goes astray, including credibility. Its production design is dazzlingly lavish as is its visual gloss, Pleasence's Blofeld surpasses camp level and Connery is smoother than ever, but Bond's expressionless invincibility is tediously and irritatingly played for laughs here (the man appears able to produce anything he wants from his pocket, never blinks an eye when faced by death and only looks petrified when he is informed by Kissy that they 'll sleep in separate beds). However, the film's sensational aspects -such as the villain's volcano lair and the mayhem that ensues within- and the irresistible corniness of the whole enterprise are now legendary in the series and have reached a cult status on their own.",You Only Live Twice

The music is beautiful, as is the Japan setting, and the cinematography really captures the beauty of many of the locations. The movie has elements that remind us of a romantic film era.Unfortunately, it is also a terribly uneven and sloppy film, with some of the most cringe-worthy moments of the Sean Connery period. To start, Connery gives his laziest performance. He looks a bit overweight and physically appears to have really dropped off during the two-year period between Thunderball and this film. He doesn't even seem to be ""present"" in some of the scenes, especially in the first half, and moves through much of the film on autopilot. This was his last Bond movie before he would later come back to do one more official entry after George Lazenby flopped in the role, and it frequently looks like he is just tired of playing Bond.You Only Live Twice hasn't aged well either and is frequently silly. The two Japanese Bond girls are not very memorable and add little to the story. They are nice, but perfunctory. Midway through, Bond undergoes a physical transformation into a Japanese man in order to help him go undercover and to train as a ninja. This is completely unnecessary and proves to be useless in his mission. Additionally, it is just ridiculous and perhaps even highlights bigotry and ignorance on the part of the filmmakers. Whether intended or not, it makes me laugh more than anything else.Bond flying around in ""Little Nellie,"" a tiny one-person helicopter/plane gadget, while strapped with a helmet equipped with a camera, stands out to me as an example of the silly action in the movie. And it's just not a good look for Bond. Two of the villain henchmen are poor imitations of Red Grant and Fiona Volpe from previous installments. And while Donald Pleasence gives the series' mastermind villain Blofeld a great first on-screen full reveal, in most of the scenes Blofeld just looks like some schizoid little man running around, and no real match for Bond or his allies. And that poor cat, just trying to run away from his arms in so many of the shots. The story goes that this cat's owners, who would provide the cat as an extra in many other projects, could never get it to work on any set again after this.The highlights for me are the aerial shot of Bond's rooftop escape and battle with dozens of henchmen, and the fantastic villain lair set and the action that takes place there in the last part of the film. But again, as I stated earlier, so many moments just make me cringe and while some of it can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek, I feel that those moments, as well as the film, really miss the mark.",You Only Live Twice
227,jackhamel1987,Blofeld - the man behind the screen at last.,7,7 April 2013,"Imagine pitching this as a plot to a producer:A NASA space rocket orbits Earth, with the astronauts in the middle of a mission. Suddenly, from nowhere, another rocket appears that swallows the first rocket. The Americans believe it's the Russians, and when the same happens to the Russians, the Russians believe it's the Americans. As things heat up, and the prospect nuclear war becomes more and more likely, only the cool British are convinced that neither the Russians or the Americans are responsible, and send James Bond to Japan to investigate, where he soon discovers that SPECTRE is kidnapping astronauts in space and taking them back to his volcano in Japan.Sounds nuts, doesn't it? And it is! Thankfully, it's a James Bond film and all is forgiven. If you're looking for a nice afternoon of action, this is the film to watch. If you're looking for any kind of realistic plot, move on. You Only Live Twice marked a bit of a slip in the Bond franchise in some aspects, but in other aspects marked some interesting steps forward. As an overall production, it's pretty decent and I think it's a solid performance. The good parts? Well, there is the brilliant volcano set design which gave the world the original arch-villain 'secret lair'. It also boasts one of John Barry's most beautiful musical scores, and in terms of character, it offers the first real hint that Bond might be capable of loving a woman as Bond and Aki do get very, very close. We also finally meet arch villain and SPECTRE supremo Erst Stavro Blofeld, and whilst some aren't sure about Donald Pleasence, I do think him a worthy villain. The bad parts? The plot isn't a strong one, and that does show as the film moves forward. Also, some of the supporting cast isn't as good as it should have been, which also shows. And, though I am a fan of Roald Dahl, I don't think his screenplay was as sharp as it could have been (though there are some nice, dark moments). I suppose that it was inevitable that the Bond franchise would have a slip in plot values, given that it had some very strong plots to live up to. But I forgive this film, because it does make a very good go of it, and the first half is strong. There are some stunning locations, some stunning sets, some great action scenes and I am very much of the opinion that Donald Pleasence is great as Blofeld. It's just a shame that the plot wasn't a bit tighter. 7/10",You Only Live Twice

229,BrohmaBull007,Nicely Done Bond Film,7,26 March 2006,This was a good Bond film. I feel that negative comments for this movie are a bit much. Connery once again stepping into his comfort role as James Bond. It was also good to see Bond step out of his usual happy Bond self and we get a more serious Bond. James Bond is portrayed with less one-liners and he seems cold and relentless here. He reminds me of Dalton in this particular movie and I was pleased with the serious Bond here. Most people should like this if they want a close resemblance to Ian Fleming's character. People say Connery was bored but I didn't notice anything that showed him bored. I can see him a little tired because he complained about the media/news in Japan. Pleasence as a villain was one of my problems with this film similar to Dr. No he appears within minutes left of the film and all he does is sit in a chair petting his cat. Blofeld is supposed to be dangerous but he served as little threat to Bond. I enjoyed the Japanese landscape as I feel it was beautiful. The Bond women here are very well chosen to fit with the story and they are tough and know how to fight. The fight sequences between Bond and the henchmen were very well done and very electrifying. The helicopter fight sequence was highly original and really cool. The beginning of the movie had you gripped and confused with the suspense of it all. Connery was also fun to watch when he had on makeup to look like an Asian. The Ninjas in this film were a pleasant addition to the storyline and action sequences. Nice little way for Bond to sign off temporarily with 5 films and years under his belt. Overall this is a nice Bond film that deserves a little more praise than it is getting. 7/10,You Only Live Twice
230,trekfan2001,The only good thing about this one is Connery.,5,14 June 2003,"*** spoiler alert ***You Only Live Twice is my least favourite Bond film. IMHO the story is just too cheesy. I actually think Moonraker has a better story than this one. I know logic is hardly a feature of Bond films, but this one is just ridiculous. Come on, why would Blofeld bother launching manned space ships to capture another one in orbit! You not only have the massive problems and cost associated with manned space flight, but you then have to hold the prisoners when they get back.It would be far simpler, cheaper and far more logical for Blofeld to simply fire missiles into orbit. It would have the exact same effect as capturing them (because both powers thought their space ships had been destroyed) with far less cost, effort, people, etc... Basically, my problem with YOLT is that even if you assume a criminal organisation is capable of the things SPECTRE does in YOLT, there is no need for them to do it. A missile would do the job just as easily and with much less effort.At least in Moonraker there is a reason to take people into orbit. The villan plans to make the surface of the Earth uninhabitable to humans with a nerve agent. Although it is a very weak reason and virtually impossible, I still think it makes more sense than YOLT.Then there is the part where Bond ""transforms"" into a Japanese peasant. I mean, it's so obvious that he's not Japanese. This is yet another area where YOLT pushes it too far.Good Bond films stretch the limits of plausibility but not too far. YOLT not only stretches the limits, it completely shatters them into absolute stupidity.*** end spoilers ***Basically I think Roald Dahl should have stuck to writing kids fantasies. This is where this movie belongs. However, the film is still entertaining if you ignore the complete stupidity of the story and it does have the best Bond ever. Therefore I'll rate it 5/10",You Only Live Twice
231,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,An unfortunate departure from the novel (SPOILERS),6,27 December 2004,"With the unparallelled success of ""Thunderball"", the James Bond phenomenon had reached it's peak. The spy-craze was beginning to die down, and by the end of the decade, the television shows and movies based around secret agents would slowly dwindle. Worst still, Sean Connery had said that he was fed up with playing 007 and that the fifth film, ""You Only Live Twice"" would be his last. For most movie-goers, no Connery meant no Bond, so the producers, writer, and director decided to pull out all the stops and make YOLT as action-packed, as big, and, unfortunately, as formulaic as possible.When a random person in 1967 thought of James Bond, they saw an unbelievable, completely ""out-there"", fictional character that in no way mirrored reality. Today, the first four films (and the original novels, too) can actually be seen as realistic, plausible, and low-key. ""You Only Live Twice"" can't. This movie best describes the audience's unfounded suspension of belief of the early films, and I can only imagine their reaction to the scope of the plot all those years ago.Since Ian Fleming's 1964 book of the same name was probably looked at as too quaint, screenwriter Roald Dahl completely re-wrote the story and threw in everything except the kitchen sink. With only a few character names and basic setting, the film is completely different from the written page. After faking Bond's death, MI6 sends their very much alive best man to Japan to find a connection between the abduction of a Russian & an American space ship and the landing of an unidentified flying object in the land of the rising sun. Once there, Bond slowly uncovers a plot that would cause World War III between the superpowers, leaving Bond's old nemesis, SPECTRE, to gain power.This plan, compared to the previous films, is actually pretty inspired, and would be redone in countless imitators, not to mention in later outings in the series, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". The main problem is that it's way too ambitious, especially for the late '60's. A movie made today with space ships that ""eat"" other space ships would be laughed off the screens. This is why ""Dr. No"" to ""Thunderball"" hold up so well: they understand their limitations and become easier to relate to as time goes by, which isn't the case with ""You Only Live Twice"".Then there's the special effects, which along with ""Diamonds Are Forever"", aren't up to scrap with the best. Numerous shots of space craft make it clear that it's just a model on a string with a fake background behind it. This detracts from the non-stop action scenes (which seem to show up every twenty minutes, whether they add to the plot or not), especially the Little Nelly dog fight and finalé, which look too clunky and mechanical.The thing is, I understand that everybody was excited about there being a possible moon landing soon. There's just little insight onto how the film would age decades later and the entire situation appears contrived in the long run. Characters don't serve the film too well, with Hans, Mr. Osato, and Helga Brandt (a pale imitation of Fiona Volpe from ""Thunderball"") being there only to fill up plot purposes, while continuity/logical goofs plague the production. Finally, the fact that the film ""You Only Live Twice"" came before ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", where it was the opposite in the literary realm, makes the story arc between those books dramatically moot on screen.Not everything fails, though. The first thirty minutes or so are suitably entertaining and the events build nicely on each other. The lush score by John Barry is absolutely beautiful, with every cue being better than the last. It's exciting, fresh, and fits every scene perfectly, while the dreamy title song is sung perfectly by Nancy Sinatra. Then there are the fantastic sets by Ken Adam, that are so big and imaginative that it's a shock that Adam didn't win an Oscar for them (not that his genius is in question). Osato's office and the classic volcano crater come to mind when someone thinks of the movie, with the other smaller sets also staying in the viewers mind after the end credits roll.Next to ""Goldfinger"", ""You Only Live Twice"" has the most memorable scenes and the biggest effect on pop culture. Mostly everything mentioned in the rest of this review are instantly recognizable to anyone who's watched the Austin Powers' movies, including Donald Pleasance as Blofeld, complete with a bald head, fluffy cat, and scar across the eye (even though I think he's one of the weaker Blofelds).The stunning cinematography of Japan and a likable ally in Tiger Tanaka almost overshadow the fact that Kissy Suzuki doesn't even come close to Aki (who's unfortunately killed off) and that Connery isn't giving his all this time, seeming bored in some scenes. But the final product is still sporadically entertaining and the movie did turn out a success, keeping the franchise alive so it could make better outings later on. It's a shame that film ignored the book and substituted it with a weaker plot, but we're stuck with what we got, and we'll just have to live with that. 5.5/10",You Only Live Twice
232,asdodge,A Fine Cookie from the Bond Recipe,8,15 December 2008,"Bond... SPECTRE.... WOMEN... Chases... it is all here. This is the 5th movie in the series and the third that fully follows the Bond Formula to be used almost without exception through the last of the Brosnan films.This time, Bond is caught in some intrigue in Japan as American and Soviet spaceships are disappearing and blame each other. Obviously, when the West and the East are being set at odds, it can only mean... SPECTRE is behind it! Bond must determine what is really going on and where SPECTRE is hiding.The script is solid and the plot flows steadily, but the true detective-aspect of a secret agent starts to disappear in this movie. Being based in Japan, some of the just blossoming fascination of Japanese culture with all things electronic is highlighted in the movie.Tetsuo Tamba is very good as ""Tiger"" Tanaka- head of Japanese Security. The female leads Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) and Kissy (Mie Hama) are rather interchangeable, and fall into the borderline area of eye-candy female agents and Bond toys. Karin Dor as ""Helga Brandt"" is an intriguing female heavy, but pales in comparison to previous (and later) ones. Her character is a bit inconsistent- one scene involving a chance to kill Bond, which she decides not to do, in lieu of a more intricate and silly death, which backfires. A poor plot device, overall. These three female leads and many commentaries in the movie really show Fleming's misogyny at its most blunt and unnerving. Donald Pleasance becomes the first face of Blofeld and does well in the role. Outside the ahead-of-its-time space plot, the villainry is acceptable and, in Cold War terms, cohesive and believable.The movie resolves with one of the better good guys-bad guys battle scenes in one of the most elaborate stages built in this era.""You Only Live twice"" is a very good Bond film, especially in this era.

233,theonewithallthecontacts,The first really over the top Bond film!,8,3 December 2012,"After the mild disappointment that was Thunderball EON regains their foothold with You Only Live Twice! The movie was completely over the top, silly and unrealistic, but it doesn't matter! The movie is so enjoyable and entertaining, which is are perfect ingredients for a good Bond movie! While Thunderball was so bland, forgettable and boring at times, You Only Live Twice is bold, enjoyable, funny, over the top and a very memorable Bond film! Like Goldfinger the movie has been parodied so much over the times, and the movie has some of the most memorable set pieces in the entire Bond series! You Only Live Twice isn't an intelligent spy thriller, but it doesn't try to be! It's a very remarkably entertaining Bond entry, and certainly one of the most memorable!After Terence Young and Guy Hamilton passed on the job, Lewis Gilbert was brought to direct. I like Lewis Gilbert as a Bond director! He seems to be very good at making over the top Bond films and still make them entertaining and good! You Only Live Twice is one of them! Jupiter 16 (an American space rocket) has been ""hijacked"" by another mystical space rocket in the outer space. USA and Russia is quick to throw threats at one another, but Britain has received a mysterious signal coming from Japan at the time of the hijacking. James Bond is sent to investigate if there is anything behind the mysterious signal, and Bond is once again quickly lured into a larger than life and devastating plot that could change the world forever! The plot in You Only Live Twice is the first Bond film to have such an epic feel to it. The plot is much more comprehensive than in the others, and that's kinda' cool. It is over the top, but what would you have expected from a Bond movie?Sean Conney is James Bond for the first time, and he's great! While he he was sometimes lacking in Thunderball, Connery steps back into the shoes of James Bond for the better! Akiko Wakabayashi is our main Bond girl as Aki. She's beautiful and a great actress! Aki works for Japanese SIS, and therefore she is the first Bond girl, who is truly his equal! Finally, we get Blofeld as our main villain! And this time we see his face! It's Donald Pleasence! Pleacense owns the role of Blofeld, and he is my all time favorite villain of the Bond series, and also my favorite interpretation of Blofeld! He doesn't match the physical bill of the other actors, and his voice doesn't match neither, but it doesn't matter! He's awesome! His performance is over the top, but that's what makes him Blofeld! He has some creepy eyes and an enormous scar through his face! My pic for the best Bond villain ever, and I suspect many will agree! Mie Hama is our secondary Bond girl, Kissy Suzuki. She's not as good as Aki, But she's certainly more eye candy! Tetsurô Tanba plays Tiger Tanaka, Bond's Japanese contact and the leader of SIS! He's a very cool character, as he can fight like Bond and has like 1000 ninjas at his disposal! One of the best supporting characters in the entire series! Teru Shimada is our secondary villain. Not a really good one, but he works as a secondary. Karin Dor is the beautiful but villainous Helga Brandt, and she's OK. Ronald Rich plays our indestructible henchman Hans, Blofeld's bodyguard! He's very big and kinda' cool. Plus, he and Bond shares a good fight scene! Desmond Llewelyn, Lois Maxwell and Bernard Lee reprises their known roles, respectively. Overall, You Only Live Twice is a near perfect Bond movie, and a damn good one too! The movie do has some minor set backs, though. When Bond first arrives to Japan the movie just seems to drag, and become sort of a documentary of Japan's local life. The movie seems to portray the daily life in Japan a little to much, in my opinion. But these are only minor complaints, the movie's still awesome! It also marked the point where Bond movies would really begin to go over the top. But like Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice is the perfect amount of silly, and it just makes the movie so much more entertaining!

235,Finalreminder,More plot holes than a British road,8,9 October 2021,"I've only watched this film 97 times, 96 times as a kid, and once as an adult. Only watching it as an adult did the plot holes stand out. Despite that, it's a really fun film to watch, and has stood the test of time very well for an action film.Yes, it's sexist in places, but it's also not very sophisticated by today's standards. Let's be honest, the modern James Bonds take themselves far too seriously. A solid entertaining movie.",You Only Live Twice
236,bsamdahl,This organization does not tolerate failure.,9,8 February 2003,"You Only Live Twice is one of my favorite Bond films. I like the character of Blofeld in general and Donald Pleasance does an excellent job with the role. Some of his lines that I get a kick out of include, ""This organization does not tolerate failure."",Kill Bond now!"",""It won't be the nicotine that kills you Mr. Bond."",""Extortion is my business."",and,""This is the price for failure Mr. Bond.""  You may notice a pattern throughout the Bond films with Bolfeld. He has a certain amount of respect for James Bond and is quick to kill his own associates when they screw up.  Blofeld always enjoys sharing his schemes with Bond which is why he always ends up giving Bond enough time to foil his plots. That is part of the personality of Blofeld. He wants to have Bond see him triumph as sort of a self satisfying ego booster.
You Only Live Twice was a well done plot line for 1967. Sean Connery did a great job in a more reactive role for all the situations he fell into. He displayed quick reactions with some humour that was not too corny.  It's easy to tell he was not as comfortable in Japan as he is in other locations. One example of this is after Tanaka had him slide into his office.  Tanaka asked Bond if his mother advised him not to get into a car with a strange girl. Then Tanaka went on to tell Bond that he would get into anything with any girl. Osato and #11 were quite a pair that fit well for this type of movie.  When Osato and #11 started blaming each other in front of Blofeld for failing to kill James Bond, Blofeld sent #11 into a tank of giant man-eating piranahs.I do enjoy the creative ways of killing people by the villains in the Bond films. It seems that the newer Bond films have strayed just a little bit from that using more conventional means for killing people.",You Only Live Twice
237,mcfische,The biggest Bond to say the least,7,9 August 2003,"While not nearly the best 007 adventure, ""You Only Live Twice"" surpasses the first two films and Thunderball. It was the biggest Bond of it's time, but bigger doesn't always mean better.First of all, the film's plot; breaking out a war between Russia and the U.S. by ""swallowing"" their spaceships; was a tad bit outlandish for the time, but not nearly as unbelievable as ""Moonraker."" Connery's so-called last performance as James Bond, and all the actors, especially Donald Pleasance in the role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, were fantastic. The setting in Japan, Bond's close allies and evil enemies, and the first real nasty Bond girl who seduced Bond decently are all good in this film. What really gets my attention is Blofeld. He was faceless in ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Thunderball,"" with no accent and a soft, low voice that spoke calmly. The voice is still calm, but with a neat accent that gives him a more sinister sound. The face of Blofeld; a short bald man with a nasty scar on his face; is suitably sinister for the character, who is himself cold and sinister the entire movie. He still is obsessed with the cat. I love the title song; it's the best yet.However, several things about this movie bugged me. You'd think if those girls were Japanese agents that they'd be a lot tougher. Aki and Kissy look almost identical except for their  smile. And what kind of name is Kissy!? That doesn't sound Japanese to me. It doesn't sound English, Russian, German, or anything for that matter. Why is it no one in this film considers the danger of a nuclear holocaust. Blofeld seems like the guy who would have that in mind based on his previous plots. What happened to Tiger and his men after the rafts were dropped? And speaking of rafts, the planes that dropped them were too convenient. They had no time to radio for rafts. And even for him, Desmond Llewelyn's screentime as Q is short.I give this Bond film 5 1/2 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
238,benjscott,"""Siamese vodka?""",7,6 May 2019,"After 4 major successful films. This one became the icing on the cake. Great action sequences left, right and centre. Little Nellie was like the Aston Martin DB5 scenes in Goldfinger (1964) which led that scenes like these became iconic where vehicles with gadgets are stars of the films. The revealing of the face of Ernst Stavro Blofeld was the jackpot after waiting a few films for where Bond is at the centre core with SPECTRE.When the film crew arrived on location in Tokyo. All hell broke loose, filming on location was difficult whilst paparazzi were everywhere. Sean Connery was too pressurised with the paparazzi, even though he was caught in a toilet by a man with a camera. Everyone knew that Sean has had it. Sean Connery felt exploited by the producers for making more money than him. Connery was angry at Harry Saltzman at that time. He vowed that if he sees Saltzman whilst acting, he'd halt and stop working. After all of this tension, Sean Connery broke the news to the world that You Only Live Twice would be his final one.If Sean Connery was treated right during the time of production, he would have starred in the following film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",You Only Live Twice
239,thestarkfist,Flemings Dead So Who Needs Plots,1,3 March 2013,"It was probably inevitable that this movie would turn out to be such a dog. By the time they got around to producing this one the Bond film franchise had turned into a cultural phenomena that absolutely nobody could have seen coming. The merchandising alone must have made several large fortunes all by itself. Each successive film adaptation of Fleming's original stories had been a bigger success than its predecessor, and with each success a formula came more and more together. After Thunderball the producers wanted to film the next story in the Blofeld Trilogy; On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which Bond actually falls in love and attempts to marry. Supposedly Connery was very keen to film this one as it would give him a chance to expand the character and make him a little more human. Unfortunately mounting the production ran into unexpected difficulties and it was the decision of the producers; Broccolli and Saltzman, that they should just proceed with filming the third story; You Only Live Twice.On the face of it this decision presents its own production problem, since Fleming's original story was the finale of the trilogy where Bond finally avenges the murder of his bride by killing Blofeld. But, by this time, a very important thing had happened to the Bond franchise. Its creator, Ian Fleming, had died. Apparently when Fleming died any intention of the producers to stay true to his stories went with him. The solution to the continuity problem was to simply drop Fleming's original story altogether and film their own Bond story in its place. Certainly Ian could not object.And thus did the perfect storm of crap start to congeal. Big mistake number 1 was the hiring of Ronald Dahl to write the original screenplay. Although it was their intention to ignore the actual story they did intend to keep some of its elements intact. Ronald was told to set the story in Japan and there had to be a garden of death and a trap door, etc. What he came up with is so trite and silly that it wouldn't have made the cut as a story for The Man From Uncle. Ronald has no idea what espionage looks like or how wars might be fought in secret and so, when Mr. Osato tells Ms. Brandt to ""Kill him"" just as soon as Bond leaves his office he is met by a carload of gun-toting thugs in the parking lot of Osato's office building! Apparently they think they can just pop Bond off on Osato's doorstep and no-one will ask any questions, certainly not the police. Superagent Aki shows up out of nowhere to rescue Bond and they speed off in her sports car with the thugs in hot pursuit, machine guns blasting tons of lead into the streets of Tokyo. Now, if you're right in the middle of a secret plot to initiate World War 3 and using Osato Chemicals as a front for your dastardly plot, it seems to me that a carload trigger happy goons flying out of your parking lot might not be in your best interests. Such thoughts do not occur to Mr. Dahl. Ever. The story is full of such nonsensical falderol. If Dahl sucks as a writer of spy fiction he's certainly not a comedy writer either. Most of the humor in the movie falls to the floor with a leaden thud. The outstanding example of this is Henderson's offering Bond a martini that's stirred and not shaken. Most of the people who mention this in their reviews fail to understand that this is supposed to be a joke. This is Ronald trying to be witty. Were all supposed to laugh at how stupid Henderson is as Bond graciously accepts the offering with a slight frown.There really is no plot to speak of, merely story devices to get Bond from one overblown set piece to the next. Characterization is nonexistent. All of the participants in Mr. Dahl's pulp fiction have the depth of cardboard cutouts and it is this fact that completely ruins any chance this movie had at being a decent Bond offering. The best of Fleming's stories always have a tragic human element to them; the horrible consequences that Dr.No's murder of her father has on Honey Ryder, the awful deaths of the Masterson sisters at the hands of Goldfinger, the corruption of Domino and the brutal murder of her brother in Thunderball. By including these details in his stories Fleming is able to pull his fiction out of the realm of superhero fantasy and add the human dimension that is an absolute necessity if you're going to build any suspense. The awful script is culprit number one but our perfect storm would not be complete without the producer's smug assurance that it was the big budget effects and sets that made the movies huge successes. This movie is so very like so many of the modern CGI effects blockbusters where the cardboard heroes merely travel from one eye-popping effect to the next with little time or thought being given to either plot or character development. 2012 leaps readily to mind. This movie delivers spectacle but little else. More than one person has commented that it's really Ken Adam's volcano rocket pad that is the true star of the movie. They couldn't be more right.You Only Live Twice is actually the first of many reboots for this classic film series. From here on out most of Fleming's novels would be replaced by clichéd pseudo-spy drivel, big action sequences and ever more amazing stunts. Fortunately for the producers they would eventually find the perfect ham sandwich for their crap confections in the person of Roger Moore, an actor who had perfected merely walking thru a role to an art form.",You Only Live Twice
240,dmbjam29,The Last Original Bond,6,25 April 2007,"I don't blame Sean Connery with growing weary of the James Bond series, by the time ""You Only Live Twice"" was released they had done five movies in five years! That being said this is the last original Bond with Connery (not counting his return in ""Diamond are Forever"" and ""Never Say Never Again). These five movies will always be the iconic Bond movies, but by the end of this film one could predict the franchise was on its way down.This film takes James Bond to the Far East to investigate the kidnapping of US and Soviet spacecrafts which could eventual lead to war between the two powers. Roald Dahl, yes the same Roald Dahl who wrote ""James and the Giant Peach"" did the screenplay for this film, and he does a commendable but not extraordinary job. Some of James Bond's best one-liners are in this film, like ""Oh the things I do for England,"" and ""you sound like a commercial,"" most likely in credit to Dahl's creative touch.The strength of this movie is that the franchise moved away from Europe and sent Bond to Asia. The Japanese background is excellent as are the Japanese Bond Girls, Aki and Kissy and the Japanese agent Tanaka. The action sequences are just OK. There's one good fight scene at the Osaka Corporation, it's similar to the ""From Russia With Love"" train scene and the opening fight in 'Thunderball.'However compared to its predecessors, this movie fails to deliver. The editing and pace seems to slow down significantly once Bond has to get married and become Japanese. The enemy's lair seems over-the-top and fantastical, even more so than Dr. No's lair. Even with Connery's flair and grace one can see how anything less than an 100% effort isn't going to make a movie great, even a James Bond film.Despite its minor hiccups, I still think this is an enjoyable Bond. Not as great as the preceding four films, but still solid. Yet one can't ignore the ominous signs that the Bond franchise was on its way down. For the last 40 years, minus some good films thrown in that time, the Bond franchise has never duplicated the magic and bedazzlement that it had from 1962-1966. A Good James Bond film but not great. 6 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
241,Orpington,OTT but fun Bond adventure,7,28 July 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe release of You Only Live Twice was overshadowed by the news that it would be Sean Connery's last film as OO7. As things turned out it was not, but if Connery had resisted being lured back to the series YOLT would have provided him with a suitably grand exit, for this is one of the most epic and OTT Bond films ever made. Although it has its faults, it is also very enjoyable, and certainly the Austen Powers spoofs could not have been made without it.By the time YOLT came out the Bond series had settled into quite a rigid formula, with gadgets, one-liners and big explosions winning out over the greater realism of Dr No and From Russia with Love. YOLT makes no big attempts to deviate from the formula, and indeed Q provides OO7 with some of his most outlandish gadgets yet, but what saves the film is its style, scale and musical score. John Barry provided one of his best Bond scores for this film, and Nancy Sinatra's lavish title song is a great one.  The Japanese locales are well-used, and legendary designer Ken Adam surpassed himself with this film, doing a remarkable job with Blofeld's volcano HQ, which has become the stuff of Bond legend. On the directing front, newcomer Lewis Gilbert manages to hold the show together very well, not allowing the film to drag too much and helping to invest it with a truly epic look. Gilbert would go on to direct The Spy who Loved Me and Moonraker, which are also very ambitious Bond films, but unlike the latter YOLT does not descend into total silliness, though it does have some daft moments.The cast is quite good in this film. Connery himself turns in a respectable performance, not his best as Bond but certainly not his worst either, even though he was now fed up with the part. Donald Pleasance has taken quite a lot of stick for his turn as Blofeld, but personally I thought he was quite sinister and effective. The moment he swivels around in his chair to finally reveal what he looks like is a great one in the Bond canon, and the scar on his face is suitably evil, even if, post-Powers, you immediately think of Dr Evil. Tiger Tanaka is one of the better Bond allies, a lively Japanese equivalent of Kerim Bey, and Karin Dor gives good value for money as Blofeld's evil henchwoman Helga, even if she is not quite up to Rosa Klebb standards. The Bond girls are not the most memorable, but they are at least quite spunky and, needless to say, very good to watch.The real weakness of YOLT is the script, which is a shame because it was written by Roald Dahl, one of my favourite authors. SPECTRE's plot to steal rockets from the superpowers is a pretty lame one, although it does at least involve Bond in a race against time to stop nuclear war. However, the most stupid point in the film is when Bond goes ""undercover"" as a Japanese fisherman, allowing Sean Connery to attempt probably the worst impression of a Japanese man ever. It was silly elements like these which would come to plague the Bond films increasingly during the 1970s.Overall, however, YOLT is a perfectly respectable entry in the Bond series, making up for what it lacks in story and character depth with excitement and spectacle. It is a daft film, but fun all the same, and probably ranks as the best of Connery's post-Goldfinger Bond outings.",You Only Live Twice
242,Bel Ludovic,Top notch Bond is big on Japan,8,17 December 2002,"You Only Live Twice is often spoken of as the worst of the first five Bond films, but it's difficult to see why. After the bore that was Thunderball, You Only Live Twice is a fresh, exciting entry in the series, and one whose plot would a decade later be recycled for The Spy Who Loved Me. Future Bond films would flit from one exotic location to another, but 'Twice' picks one country and runs with it: Japan. And it's a highly successful move, imbuing 'Twice' with a unique and distinctive flavour. Tiger Tanaka is one of Bond's most affable allies, second only to Kerim Bey in From Russia With Love, and Aki is my favourite Bond girl, enjoying a good chemistry with Connery's Bond. Connery himself is fine, of course, and this would've been a good one to go out on. And finally we get to see Blofeld. Well - I do think Telly Savalas was better as Blofeld the following film, but Donald Pleasance's utterance of the words ""Goodbye-Meester-Bond!"" is enjoyably overplayed. Final rounds of applause go to Ken Adam for superb set design, as always (incidentally there's some good interior design throughout the film, all of it back in fashion!), and John Barry for an exquisite score, reminding the viewer that Barry was just as important part of the Bond tradition as Connery, Moore, Lee, Maxwell and Llwelyn.",You Only Live Twice
243,South62,The Best,10,4 January 2003,"YOLT is cornerstone in action movies and best Bond ever made. It is not necessary to underline perfect special effects and design - of course considering the fact it is made 1967! Each director who has an ambition to make action movie of that ambitious kind has to study YOLT with respect. Such mixture of SF, action, exotic, martial skills, beautiful women, threat to mankind was made for the first time. All similar movies made after it (including similar Bond movies like Moonraker and Spy Who Loved Me) suffer by the fact they are made after YOLT. The plot is completely stupid and unbelievable like each Bond plot is - but Bond fans do not look at Bond movies with artistic attitude but fun-attitude. Readers, please do not be offended - I am genuine Bond fan and I know what am i talking about. Bond movies have they own criteria that cannot be applied on any other kind of movies, ie any movie except 007 serial. Also, YOLT has interesting reference to space race of 60', Japanese economic and technological boom and to menace of aggressive policy of China of that time. Not to mention self-irony to British rule in world affairs. Low-rating of YOLT should be reconsidered.",You Only Live Twice

245,cortlahman,The Classic James Bond Movie!,9,13 February 2009,"I would highly recommend this film to anyone who has seen any of the Austin Powers movies and would like to see where Mike Myers got his ideas. It has all of the Bond clichés and then some:1. Crazy Gadgets (Cigarettes that shoot rockets) 2. An incredibly evil villain with a cat 3. An enormous evil lair with guys in the background who arbitrarily turn knobs to make it look like they're doing something. 4. Insane plot-ideas (Bond is transformed into a Japanese man to maintain cover on a secret mission*) 5. Girls that fall in love with Bond, but needlessly die in his stead and are later on replaced.This film is good in its own right and it's the reason that Casino Royale was such a good change of pace. You Only Live Twice is highly entertaining regardless of what level of Bond fanatic you are. *The scene in which Bond is being reconfigured to look Japanese is very similar to the scene in which Gary in Team America: World Police is altered to look Middle-Eastern.",You Only Live Twice

The opening sequence of the shuttle hijacking was so striking in my mind that i could forget it till now. After a decade i saw the movie again this time i understood pretty well. The movie has got strong plot along with great actions sequences. The movie runs to fast that you wont ever realize how time runs while u watch this movie.Sean Connery left the role of bond while he was shooting for this film. A bad decision of course, cause he thought their is no charactisation in his character since the release of DR NO. But if we look at the next bond movie 'On her majesty's secret service' which has got everything & it also features bond getting married. But still this movie has got the best elements & characters which any bond movie needs. Bond travels Japan to find out the man behind the hijacking the Russian & American space shuttles. The music is the best which is conducted by John Barry thought out the movie. Ian Fleming titled this venture as You only live twice, cause in 1962 he recovered from major heart attack. This was his second life, & he only lived twice, & twice is the only way to live.MY RATING - 10/10",You Only Live Twice

Bond is now all becoming about escapism.The pace is certainly a lot quicker than the boring and overlong Thunderball and the acting of most actors is quite good.The art direction on this Bond movie is fantastic and the great volcano of Blofeld is magnificent.The mystery surrounding the leader of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. has subdued somewhat, do to seeing his face for the first time ever.You Only Live Twice would become the blueprint for Bond in the seventies and early eighties.",You Only Live Twice

As for 'You Only Live Twice', I noticed it has received mixed reviews. After having read both positive and negative reviews for it and being able to agree with both, I still like this movie and recommend it. The plot of You Only Live Twice takes Bond to Japan where he will eventually come to meet the head of the Spectre organization and we the viewers will finally get to observe the face of No.1 if you will (except for the viewers who skipped over this for whatever reason and watched the next two Bond installments). I notice that some reviewers didn't care for the ending of this movie. As for me, I saw nothing wrong with it. After all, what Bond film has yet to show a detailed and lengthy finale anyway? The characters, story, gadgets, and action scenes of You Only Live Twice managed to entertain well enough to a satisfactory level in my opinion.",You Only Live Twice

Bond hikes the mountain in khakis but is in a ninja suit with knee cups magically. Then there is the stupidity of an entire village that never sees a rocket come out of the volcano but the girl can run down the mountain and swim 2 miles to the village in 10 min.

Yes it's the first time you see time you archenemy Blofeld in the form of (miscast) Donald Pleasance. Pleasance is a good actor who gives the most spirited performance. He's just not right for the role. The rest of the cast is okay. There are some concerns about race in this one, but as always I try to view the Bond films as products of their time. The highlights include the volcanic villain lair and the climatic battle involving ninjas and Spectre soldiers. On the other hand the film ups the ante on outlandishness, which will plague later films. While it's considered a classic by many, I think it's a middling affair.",You Only Live Twice
253,chaosHD,weakest of the Connery Bond films,5,15 July 2008,"The movies released in 1967 were either excellent or mediocre, there wasn't much middle ground. Unfortunately, You Only Live Twice leans toward the mediocre. That didn't stop it from being another massive box office success, of course. It has high production values, and cinematography by Freddie Young, who had won Oscars for Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago already. What sinks it is a very weak, by the numbers script, and forgettable Bond girls. Although the Asian actresses did do a pictorial in Playboy that year, which probably has given them a bigger fan base than they otherwise would have had they not.By this film the Bond formula was getting tired. Spy films were still in vogue, but were moving away from the camp and more toward the serious. The Deadly Affair from Sidney Lumet and Billion Dollar Brain from Ken Russell come to mind. But in You Only Live Twice, it was merely business as usual, albeit on an even bigger scale than ever. Ironically, the director Lewis Gilbert was not known for large scale productions, yet his Bond films are among the biggest. Pretty much all of his non Bond films are small budget affairs. An even stranger choice comes in the screen writing department with Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, taking the place of the usual writers such as Richard Maibaum.After watching this again, i thought to myself how it's not surprising that Connery wanted to jump off the Bond ship and move on (well, at least for a few years anyway). Many Bond fans dislike Diamonds Are Forever even more than this one for some reason, but i can't count myself among that group.",You Only Live Twice
254,isbabo,A good but older Bond,9,31 March 2005,"Okay, this Bond film is very dated (and not just because he's trying to save the world from war between the U.S and the Soviet Union). The portrayal of the Japanese in this one will show people just how far we in the west have come. ""In Japan men come first, women second"" (Tanaka really said this).The plot is over the top although,unlike ""Moonraker"" and ""Die Another Day"", it doesn't seem to insult your intelligence. It also has a great villain (think about Dr. Evil). It moves faster than some of the other Bond films of the day and the location (Japan) was a great idea and suites the film well. If you can overlook the racial stereotypes, and enjoy it for what it is, you'll really like it. Besides, Connery is still the best Bond ever and all of his films (except the unfortunate ""Diamonds Are Forever) are pretty good.",You Only Live Twice

What more could you ask for? What's that? You want to see Sean Connery fighting a sumo wrestler?? You're in luck!! (OK so Roger Moore fights two sumo wrestlers in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", but they were much smaller and the rest of the film was rubbish.)Austin Powers probably owes more to this film than any other, which is no bad thing. ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia with Love"" are also classics of course, and ""Goldeneye"" is perhaps a better film, but for sheer Bond-ness this is my favourite.",You Only Live Twice
257,kinky_friedman,Bond in Japan? Tries and succeeds,7,25 November 2006,"You Only Live Twice, I'll admit, is gimmicky. The novel was written and movie made for the sake of having a story of James Bond in Japan. They just didn't use as blatant a name as ""007 in New York."" That being said, there's a good movie made from this.For a movie from 1967, the production qualities are great. The direction is particularly good during action scenes. There are some great aerial shots, although the definition suffers because, well, it's Panavision. But the action scenes are of good quality.That being said, Roald Dahl made some bad decisions. We are all used to the formulaic Underground Lair finale. Bond always manages to save the world and himself singlehandedly. Not so in YOLT. In fact, he's aided by an army of ninjas and the Japanese secret service in the climax. Mr. Dahl also went out of his way to objectify the women of Japan. I know it's the way of the people, but...Another unnecessary qualm is using Japan too much. For some reason, Bond needs to disguise himself as an Asian, although he doesn't alter too much physically. If anything else, he ends up looking like Spock. One of the antagonist's assistants is Asian, although that is unnecessary. She is clearly white with crappy make-up.What Roald did do write is pacing. The action scenes and development scenes are intertwined perfectly, and the film's pacing is great. It is also very plausible for a Bond movie. This is also the first true (and satisfying) appearance of Mr. Evil, I mean Blofeld.Alright, let's talk about the most apparent twist on this Bond outing- the setting. The setting isn't just there- 007 interacts with the environment he's in. When Bond fights in Paris, he could be fighting in London or New York. But James Bond uniquely interacts with Japanese buildings and adapts somewhat to their traditions.The cast is hard to criticize. On one hand, they are monotone except for Sean Connery, on the other hand they might be really good Japanese actors who don't speak English. Either way, everyone except Bond disappoints because of a less than engaging plot.This movie is good. I recommend it to any James Bond fan, Japan enthusiast, or both. It really succeeds as a James Bond movie in Japan. It's not the best story (I mean, it is basically a cash-in), but the action scenes are a must for said fans.Overall, I give You Only Live Twice a B+.",You Only Live Twice
258,barrygermansky,Great Bond Film,10,29 December 2004,"You Only Live Twice is by far one of the greatest 007 movies ever made. Not only does it star Sean Connery, the best Bond, but it has an amazing plot involving Number 1 (aka Blofeld) hijacking American spaceships in order to create tension between the U.S.A. and Russia. This film also features the best Blofeld ever, superbly played by Donald Pleasence. The highlights of this film are its awe-inspiring sets, the scene where Blofeld kills one of his agents by sending her falling into a pool of piranhas, the entire end sequence and the beginning teaser. Director Lewis Gilbert would later go on to direct two other Bond films, The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker.This James Bond film is a classic of the silver screen and should be viewed by all 007 fans!",You Only Live Twice

Spectre is thought to be behind it and bond is sent to Japan to investigate. Apart from James Bond played by Sean Connery Aki a Japanese spy assisting Bond is played by Akiko Wakabayashi Kissy Suzuki a diver who replaces Aki played by Mie Hama Ernst Stavro Blofield head of SPECTRE played by Donald Pleasence This is one of the Bond films you can't take too seriously its a good action movie with lots of the top scenes and the usual mix of Bond gadgets and girls. Always worth watching.",You Only Live Twice
260,sinatra-11,Terrible. it definitely annihilated bond's images,1,5 June 2006,"In 1967, Sean Connery must have been slightly crazy. Because he appeared in You Only Live Twice. His other 007 series Diamonds are Forever(1971), Thunderball(1965) and Goldfinger(1964) were nice. No one blames him about those 3 James Bond movies. But You Live Only Twice definitely annihilated James Bond.First, I was totally disappointed with the movie's background and scenery. James Bond went to Japan to investigate why U.S' and Soviet's spaceships had disappeared. This movie showed Japanese scenery. That's a bad thing. No one wants to see Asia's scenery. Japan isn't America, France, British and Russia. Well, in the Diamonds are Forever, we can see U.S' great scenery. But in this movie, we can't. I'm Korean. Although Japan and my country are totally different, somethings are similar. So Japanese scenery doesn't give me a strange feeling as much as when I see western scenery.Second, It shows the impossible to happen. How did specter launch their rocket so easily? Even in NASA, they set up huge machines to fire the rocket. Launching the rocket isn't an easy job. Firing the rocket at 11.2km per second isn't easy. We can see specter's humble machines fire the rocket. Then, Japanese technologies are much higher than U.S in the 1960s? Very Interesting.Third, the movies plot isn't good. Toyota 2000 GT is an eye-catcher. But with only a TV attached? cigar-rocket was great? A More terrible thing was Ninja. Ninja appeared in 1967 with a sword, foes have machine-guns. It's ridiculous in itself. And when the Japanese agent shows Bond a Ninja, Why did the Ninja kill other Ninjas? Last, we still thought that James Bond was a playboy. What is a playboy? Enticing a beauty, staying in expensive hotels like the Trump plaza hotel, Going to casinos to earn extra money and driving a nice V8 car. But in this movie I didn't know if 1960's Japan was very poor or not, I never found out skyscrapers or tall buildings(except the Osato building) like U.S, even V8 or V6, and beauty blonde. Japanese girl? They looked like living next door to poor neighbors. James Bond wasn't the James Bond we know.How about this. James Bond rides a horse with a blonde cowgirl, armed 6 revolver, playing the guitar and singing Rocky Mountain High. Bond girl sang The Tide Is High. That's much better for Bond. Instead of going to Japan.",You Only Live Twice

262,chelb,A Bond movie in an interesting Asian locale...,6,16 December 2001,"This is the 6th James Bond movie of 22 (including two unofficial Bond movies and one currently in production).  This is the 5th Bond movie to star Sean Connery who was the first actor to play Bond. I would give this movie a 6 out of 10.  The teaser in the movie was part of the main plot, that of a satellite in space capturing an American spacecraft and severing the astronaut's lifeline, leaving him to float off and die in space. This movie was shot in Japan, among other places, and has two Japanese actress female leads.  They are played nicely by Tokyo born Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama.  They do a wonderful job and their personalities show well on the screen.  The music is great, especially the title song by Frank Sinatra's daughter, Nancy.  The villain is Blofeld and he is great too.  Bond must find out and stop whoever is sending out killer satellites that trap American and Russian space vehicles and stop World War III as each side is positive that the other is up to it.  Naturally, the British government is wiser than both.  The action is good but the plot bogs down and gets slow and boring in places.  The movie was a bit slow and dragged, sort of like Goldeneye dragged years later.  There is a great fight scene in a Japanese office with Bond and a very large Japanese man.  The villain has a hollowed out volcano hideout which is very cool too, but the movie was really lacking alot of good suspense and humor.  Bond is more sexist than usual in this movie but not too bad.  The plot could have been better but this is an above average Bond adventure.  The helicopter chase was exciting along with Ninja assassination techniques used in the film.  Mie Hama is one of the most beautiful Bond female leads.  Action is a 4, plot is a 4, music is an 8, locales are an 8, villain is a 7, strong man buddy Tiger of Bond is a 9, female leads are a 9.5.  Overall score is a 6 out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
263,JMitnik,Is it so hard to kill someone?,8,1 April 2010,"This is the last, good Connery movie in my opinion. I know I said that its good, but it has however flaws, which annoyed me in this movie.First of all the music. I liked the music at first, but it started bugging me after a while. As if it was the only song, with a little bit variation during the movie.Next comes the story. The story reminded me of Thunderball. Again, something with destroying the world, by attacking the US(secretly). However, the story writers did do something smart... they took advantage of the despise between America and Russia, and Spectre made each other hate each other. I thought that was quite clever, and topped DR.No and Thunderball with that.Now for the action. This is the part where I sort of get frustrated. The action with the ninja's was extremely cool, for their time. Nice infiltration scene, and nice battlefield. I just... didn't like the way Bond got around this time. Acting all recklessly, being lucky that he has villains who are dumb and lame as hell. I mean... how hard is it to just shoot someone, knowing you will fail if you wait a second(like Blofeld). Or, at the basin... how hard is it to just throw a stone(or whatever it was that bodyguard had) at a guy? Bond was lucky the whole time, because it was coincidence that he was the only one who could fight sort of, with the enemies having the reaction speed of 1. The special effects were quite good(for their time), so I have nothing to say.I liked the setting for the movie, and all that Japanese stuff. Even if Bond wasn't really convincing this time as a Japanese dude.Although the movie had its flaws, the story was smart, and the setting was brilliant. I liked that, and liked all the other stuff. I didn't liked the acting of Connery in this one... he acted as if he actually didn't care.I still give this movie a 7,5/10.",You Only Live Twice
264,ThomasHayden,May I say the best?,10,1 March 2005,"Great Bond flick. All the usual elements of the series are superbly crafted in Connery's , trendy, extremely entertaining fifth outing as 007, which includes exotic locations and non-stop pacing. When sent to Japan to investigate a mysterious spacecraft hijacking, Bond involves in an exciting adventure going after an ambitious Japanese industrialist, who's ultimately linked to SPECTRE.Many argue Roald Dahl's screenplay places too much emphasis on fantasy, turning Bond movies traditional tone into a series of endless action sequences and incredible gadgets (the following films have been very prone to such diversions). But I think that, despite the realistic and darker tone of Dr No, previous entries such as Goldfiger had already introduced these elements, which are quintessential for Bond, a character quite different to that deadly serious, broody assassin Ian Fleming once imagined in his books. However there are some scenes which remain quite faithful to the original (Bond's incursion into Osato Chemical headquarters, including a breath-taking fight with a Yakuza hit man).So let's not complain about the (terrific) volcano set, Little Nellie chase, the piranha pond or Donald Pleasance's outstanding performance as the deliciously evil, unforgettable Bond villain Ernst Stavro Bloefeld (I will always associate his image with the white Persian cat to Bond movies) Add to this a luscious Karin Dor(""why a nice girl like you works here?"") as N11 and Aki, and what do you get? Best plot, gadgets, villain, girls the pure essence of Bond movies No twists, no new takes on the character just CLASSIC Bond AT HIS BEST.",You Only Live Twice
265,mc_bez86,Very colossal,8,3 November 2004,"When my father brought home this movie it was in the VHS tape, and when I saw it it interested me a lot.First, the plot regarding the hijacking of space shuttles by an unknown group was good. It really underlined the tensions of the times and hooked me on the movie.Next comes the James Bond himself. I liked the way Sean Connery brought himself in this film, and my favorite line of Bond here is ""Bon Apetit"" (which Connery delivered with real cold-bloodedness).Finally the production designs and the set. I was truly impressed by what Ken Adam did here (especially in the volcano) and also the design of the shuttle was good.I rate it 8 stars out of 10.",You Only Live Twice
266,Rejisior,The things I do for England...,10,16 October 2007,"This movie is simply perfect. Pure entertainment. And fits so well in its genre.All the nonsense and things happening ""like in the movies"" don't spoil the show but rather enhance it. It is so well made.The Japanese scenery and cultural inserts are awesome and John Barry's score couldn't be more appropriate.The film's dialog is overfilled with great lines as the one I've put in the title of my comment.Some of you may say that I'm a crazed Bond fan, but I'm not.As a boy, I was a great fan of Bond movies and now I've started to watch them again, just for fun.I watched Dr. No and it is crap, apart from Ursula Anders there's nothing valuable in it.

267,OriginalSheady,Not the greatest Bond film going,8,6 September 2006,"Sean Connery planned to make this his last one- and it comes across. He continues the laid-back (or bored-looking) style that he began in Thunderball, taking some of the life out of the film. This film has a good look at the Japanese culture, whether it be viewed at the sumo wrestling ring, the ninja school or at the fishing villages. However, the plot is quite outlandish and is the first of what can be seen to be the OTT, cartoonish Bond films that appear later on in the Bond series. The Bond girl, Kissy, isn't an inspired choice, and there aren't any real menacing henchmen that can be associated with Bond; like Jaws later on in the series, or Oddjob earlier on.However, as with most Bond films, it is entertaining and enjoyable to watch, with Little Nellie the auto-gyro, the revealing of Blofeld's appearance and the ninja's penetrating the volcano base being the highlights.It's a good film but, with many great Bond films to compete with, it's not the greatest one going.",You Only Live Twice

269,portland295,Sean Connery's Worst Performance. Donald Pleasence not far behind.,7,4 November 2000,"Sean Connery really seemed bored in this movie compared to others. He really didn't seem comfortable in this one. Of course, he doesn't take all the blame. Donald Pleasence was just hilarious in this movie. Blofeld seemed more like a comedian in this movie. He is also childish at times. Perfect example: Kill Bond, NOW!!! He also has a calm voice until he lashes out (at the end of his appearence), ""Goodbye, MR. Bond!!"", and gets a razor sharp flying disc in his hand. Piranahs, where is the table? You know, with the SPECTRE Agents at it. Throwing people in a piranah pool using a pedal is the cheapest and the most retarted way to kill people. Blofeld will do anything, won't he. The main girl's name (Kissy, if you didn't look at the credits) wasn't even mentioned in the 117 minutes of boredom. And last complaint, what is with the eye? None of the other Blofelds had that scar on their eye. Donald Pleasence's eye wasn't as bad to give him a scar in the movie. My rating: ** out of *****",You Only Live Twice
270,agbwillow,Best of the bunch!,9,16 November 2006,"Undoubtedly, my all-time favourite Bond film! I've seen them all so many times but YOLT has always stood out from the rest. It has the best Bond (Connery), best villain (Donald Pleasance's Blofeld), best sets (volcano crater), best death scene (by piranha!) and best theme (sung by Nancy Sinatra).The film has some delicious dialogue (screenplay by Roald Dahl, no less) and some lovely quirky scenes - Bond's 'transformation' into the least Japanese-looking man ever, Q's 'Little Nellie' etc. But there are also some touching moments when Bond 'bonds' with his allies in the Japanese secret service. I loved all the locations, in particular the Tokyo scenes which make a nice change from the usual interchangeable Caribbean beaches.Basically, just a fab film - one that can still entertain me after a hundred or so viewings!",You Only Live Twice

273,TheSawIsFamily,Pretty good 007 adventure.,7,10 July 2003,"It's up to Bond once again to save the world from World War III is this good (not great) action/adventure. The pace is rather fast, with Bond jumping from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, narrowly escaping death too many times to count. The situations are pretty unbelievable (even for a 007 film) but it's all in good fun. The film really elevates itself in the finale, with hundreds of Ninjas attacking Blofeld's volcano base. Good entertainment, but not the best Bond film there is.***** out of *****",You Only Live Twice
274,Actorsactiondotorg,One too many for Connery,7,6 January 2006,"You Only Live Twice (1967)It's incorrect, actually, to title the fifth 007 film as ""Ian Fleming's You Only Live Twice"". It isn't. It's Roald Dahl's total rewrite of the Fleming novel. Other than keeping the chief setting (Japan) by avoiding the original storyline, it has good moments and bad moments as cinema fare.To capitalize on the fascinating, news-making, tech-advancing space race taking place in the 60s, this is ""The Right Stuff""/""Apollo 13"" type of Bond movie. Astronaut mania.Space capsules orbiting the Earth disappear! Swallowed up by a mysterious spacecraft with a hinged-jaw that closes around them like a shark around its prey.But where do the stolen space capsules (and the men inside) go then? And who is behind these orbital hijackings? That's the mystery Secret Agent 007 must solve - and soon.The US Govt, losing 2 astronauts & a capsule, blames the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, when losing 2 cosmonauts & a capsule, blames the USA.Both world superpowers are angry and suspicious of each other.At a secret emergency meeting of diplomats and CIA and KGB, snarling barbs are exchanged by an American and a Russian.Her Majesty's Govt is the only clear-thinking reasonable entity depicted. ""Our man in Hong Kong,"" a British Diplomat calmly says at the meeting, ""is on the case now.""Bond.This may be considered a * Spoiler * here, but I must point out that one clever thing the script does is KILL BOND. His untimely demise happens in the first ten minutes of the film. You'll see his bullet-riddled fate before the opening credits.Everyone now thinks he's dead (it was in the newspapers too) but secretly still alive, he goes undercover on a mission to Tokyo, and when the time comes that his enemies discover he's still alive, Bond says, ""Yes, this is my second life."" To which his arch nemesis Blofeld (Donald Pleasence) replies, ""You Only Live Twice, Mr. Bond.""A great line. A great use of the title within the story.""I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips!"" The ever-lovable Q (Desmond Llewellyn) has a funny scene in Tokyo when he brings 007 a special aero-gadget to fly around in.The music in YOLT is fantastic. Heavy dark foreboding notes when the capsules are being hijacked above the Earth. Lush oriental-style instrumental versions of the billowy Main Title Theme sung by Nancy Sinatra.The cinematography captures beautiful horizons, exotic landscapes and islands. Bond films really do travel the world to shoot scenes.The upper-atmosphere special effects are very realistic. Almost 3D looking as the capsule hovers there and the blurry blue curve of the Earth turns slowly. Well done fx for 1967.Released during the heady magical year of Sgt. Pepper, flower power, and the Summer of Love, this latest installment of the World's Coolest Cop Defending The Establishment must've had a strange chemical reaction with hippie moviegoers. They cheer for Bond - but he's ""a pig, man. One of the pigs."" A government agent. A military man. A uniformed UK Naval Commander. Yep, the one hip icon in contrast to the Counterculture's attitude towards Authority.YOLT did introduce to popular culture, a few interesting things never seen on-screen before: pirahna fish... ninjas...martial art throwing stars... scary/violent elements we see utilized in many films since.Look for the repelling Ninjas scene which bears striking resemblance to the repelling Clonetroopers in ""Revenge Of The Sith"".YOLT has the distinction of being the one 007 film with the most-recycled plot. This film's premise was copied for two other Bond films: ""The Spy Who Love Me"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" in which nuclear submarines were stolen, each govt blamed the other, Bond must discover who stole them & why.Here's the negatives I note about ""You Only Live Twice"":Sean Connery stayed too long at the Bond party. (To be fair, Moore did too.) Connery, here, is clearly wearing a toupe, has gained weight, and needed to trim his visible nose hair. A different actor should've got this 007 role (in this reviewer's opinion).The Asian actors have such a happy relaxed lackadaisical delivery of their lines, they sound corny and fail to convey a sense of emergency and drama and tension. (Helloooo, there is an anxiety-worthy crisis poising the world on the brink of WW3)In return, Connery's delivery is just as ho-hum and trite in scenes with the Asian actors/actresses. He practically, as some critics have put it, ""sleepwalks thru this film"".At times, the scientific dialogue sounds comic book silly when characters use quasi-technical terms. The word ""computer"", new to our vocabulary in that time period, seems to be the main word for characters to say. Computer this, computer that. I doubt NASA was a technical adviser on this film - maybe should've been. ""Exploder Button"" ? Err, isn't that better known as a Detonator?The worst sequence visually is when the evil redhead parachutes down as a sabotaged plane (with Bond trapped inside) is smoking and plummeting. One of the worst background projection attempts in film history. Elvis movies with him fake waterskiing look more real.MGM or whoever archives and distributes this film for home-viewing has released 2 different versions. One has subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. One doesn't.Hopefully, YOLT did well at the box-office to justify the risks taken to make such an expensive large-scale blockbuster. A stuntpilot/cameraman lost a leg in a mid-air collision while filming.Maybe someday, somehow, the 007 producers will remake Moonraker and YOLT and shoot the original stories Fleming wrote. They may not be commercially viable for theaters; maybe best suited for BBC TV. But I hope the original Fleming Bond will....live twice.",You Only Live Twice
275,MST3K-3,THE JAPANESE JAMES BOND,10,23 June 1999,I liked You Only Live Twice because of the way that James Bond can be anybody and do anything. I have always said that the day they make a James Bond Western I won't be the least surprised. You only Live Twice also marks the first of many Bonds where Bond's girl gets murdered in the process of apprehending the arch enemy Biofeld.I like You Only Live Twice for its great action and awesome armies of Japanese fighters.,You Only Live Twice
276,attitude2000,"Good fist fighting action, unlike the Roger Moore ones",8,24 December 2000,"After watching Goldeneye, I sort of went on a quest to see the older Bond movies that came along.  Well, I've seen my share and in my opinion, the one with Sean Connery were the best, before Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies and T.W.I.N.E.  This one, like the other Sean Connery films, had real fist fight Bond-has-to-get-away action.  Not that play punching they seemed to do in the Roger Moore ones.  They did real fighting in You Only Live Twice, busting tables and lamps over each other.  If I didn't know they were trying to kill each other, I'd think I was watching a pro wrestling match.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the Roger Moore ones, too, every Bond fan does.  I just wished they had a better one-on-one fist fight element to them.",You Only Live Twice
277,DarkMoon72,A lot better than the reviews suggest,8,3 March 2002,"You Only Live Twice is the 5th James Bond film to star Sean Connery. Unfortunately, it is Sean Connery himself who creates the main problems in this film. Let's face it, he is completely and thoroughly bored and walks through the film, as anyone can see.(This paragraph contains spoilers) Particularly awful is the ""Little Nellie"" scene, because just moments before, Q had mentioned all the capabilities of the helicopter (and thus telling the audience how all the SPECTRE agents were going to get killed), and Connery exhibits none of the fear or anxiety that he did in movies like Thunderball or Goldfinger. Instead, he pushes buttons and eliminates the opposition yet again. One can almost hear Connery sigh as he does this.On the other hand, that's about the film's only big problem. Yes, the plot and certain scenes stretch credibility, for instance Blofeld could've just fired missiles at the spaceships instead of launching this space-faring Pac-Man up to swallow them whole and bring them back to Earth. It would have made a lot more sense. However, the film compensates for this with its unusually suspenseful music, breathtaking volcano complex, fantastic last 45 minutes, and Donald Pleasence's eerie, quietly creepy portrayal of SPECTRE's #1, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.All in all, a fun film to watch, and certainly one that Roger Moore fans will like, since it set the stage for future adventures in absurdity.",You Only Live Twice

279,zillionairepoet,"South62, Of Course, It's Business",9,8 November 2006,"South62, I agree -- the Bond movies are supposed to be fun; at the same time they are supposed to be have at their core somewhere in the neighborhood of reality. This makes them more fun, to have Bond in some danger -- being in a tight situation with a mixture of tenseness and suavity. Connery pulled this off great; Bond is really sort of nuts, but a lovable one. Sort of a guy who escaped from the looney bin, but having fun acting out his fantasies. But the Bonds don't work when they are TOO over the top, like Moonraker's Jaws, who bites cables.YOLT, for example, has a fine fight atop Osato's office. Splendid stuff : exotic decor, fighting a deadly fighter for keeps. This is one of the best fights of the series. I feel that Bruce Lee must have watched this, and said ""That's the way a movie fight should be."" Too have blood and guts spilling out ruins it, and I don't wanna see that in Casino Royale (another topic, but I just may boycott it because they made Bond an army guy, and have him play poker,etcetcetc.).I never considered YOLT in your terms, and now I can. I enjoyed it before, because it is so much fun, with wonderful scenery, funny lines, and cornier dubbing ""Nmm mmmh mmmh, you move very well for a dead man, Mr.Bond..."" ""Why .... I ... love you ..."" And the music! The very tops! Captures the Bond world perfectly; the myth of Japan was made for Bond. And Barry is the perfect composer for both Bond and Japan with Bond. Too bad Brosnan wasn't able to do one. Maybe he can play a Bond-character in Japan, now that he isn't under contract. Cool thought.And the girls! Kissy is one of the most appealing heroines; the shot of the wedding and the Music --- classic -- as her face comes up. And also the shot with the ama girls running in the sunrise .... and Bond and Kissy hiking up past the waterfall with The Music. ""Think you can make it?"" ""Of course, it's business!"" (doubly funny, with a paunchy civil servant asking a hard as nails ama girl!) I've spent much time in Asia, and can tell you that when I have adventures there, it's just like YOLT, and the Music is not far from my silly brain. Example, the hydrofoil from Hong Kong to Macau -- pure Bond, looks like an airliner inside with beautiful cabin attendants. And the flight there --- all of the flight girls were pretty to beautiful. Bond heaven! Without YOLT, life would not be as much fun. Once, we had a massage in China, (legitimate, btw) and very funny ... something Bond and Dikko would have done. The girls were practicing ""I love you"" in English, while twisting us into pretzels, while we were laughing. Very Bonded!",You Only Live Twice

I am not bothering with COnnery now. The Helicopter sequence is too repetitive, the finale is a letdown,the villain is a Joke. Even the worst cartoon is preferable to this slur on the Bond franchise.

281,professor_blah_blahson,The Best of the Series,10,30 August 2005,"This film contains many features which make it my favourite of the series. One of these is the casting of Donald Pleasance as Blofeld. He makes for an intimidating villain, probably more so by the fact that he seems rather puny and calm, making us feel that he is powerful in some other we which we cannot know. His calm demeanour while disposing of Helga Brandt (by piranha - an ingenious addition) intimidates us as anyone who can kill with such ease must be truly evil. The plot was topical for the time, and the prospect of WW3 makes for a fast-paced, thrilling film.The thing about early Bond films is that the viewer cannot take them at face value any more - you have to see them for what they were when first shown. For example, the lava flow at the end may be very poor (and known to be impossible) now, but when the film was made it was quite a feat. This is the same with the inclusion of Little Nellie - microlights were nowhere near as well known then as they are now, making Bond seem once again on the cutting-edge of things.The volcano set at the end is spectacular, if a tad unbelievable (it has been asked before how Blofeld managed to hollow out the volcano with no-one knowing), and the climactic battle is stunning. The fact that Blofeld escapes at the end is remarkable in itself, for he is the only villain to have ever remained alive at the end of a Bond film.Despite the plot and film in general being unrealistic, the fact is that it is still entertaining, and surely, this is what counts. Surely this is what the film was made to do, and so it has served its purpose. However, despite the inaccuracies, I still award it the title of Best in Series.",You Only Live Twice

Not under a festive tree, but under the sea, in a submarine, where M and his assistant Moneypenny have temporarily relocated.Bond was back, 2 years after he thrilled audiences with Thunderball. This time, though, he was in need of no help (""You forget: I studied Oriental Languages at Cambridge!""). As soon as he had arrived into the sub (""Permission to come aboard, sir?!""), Bond was blasted off (literally: through a torpedo hatch).Instantly the audience is transported to Tokyo, where Bond faces potential trouble immediately. Merely a few minutes later, a conversation between Bond and Charles Gray's ""Mr. Henderson"" (the actor would play Blofeld in later Bond films) is ended abruptly, interrupted by the first of many thrilling fights.The film is most successful in that the business of danger and the presence of ""sexyful"" women are entwined perfectly. It is only in the last act of the film, when the true enemy is revealed, that the tone of Roald Dahl's screenplay changes. A classic moment: a man swivels in his chair, stroking his pet cat. A moment that retains its effect, despite being endlessly parodied (Dr Evil!!).Without a moment's rest, an epic fight scene begins. The underwater epic battle in Thunderball was hugely successful. This one is under a volcano. And even better. So-called ""Modern Ninjas"" fight with brightly-dressed workers, explosions all round. This is the James Bond equivalent to the Death Star and it excites to a much greater extent.The film concludes explosively. Altogether the film fulfils the promise of the opening credits that it would be volcanic. The perfect Bond film.",You Only Live Twice
284,plaincharlie,So bad I must have erased it from my memory,2,9 November 2020,"So after the passing of Sean Connery I thought it apt to rewatch a few Bond movies that he featured in. I could recall this particular movie and so decided to watch it. My memory was jogged somewhat however I was very disappointed with it and basically had to force myself to watch it to the conclusion.Sean Connery seemed bored even though the script was fine. The special effects were really very subpar, even for that time.My two stars go to Q and Moneypenny.",You Only Live Twice
285,karimnash,One of the worst Bond movies,4,14 December 2008,"I probably would have ranked this movie much higher if it wasn't for the 30 mins of the movie devoted to turning Bond ""japanese"" and training him to be a Ninja. They arrange a marriage for him as well to a local Japanese girl who is also actually an agent. It all is completely unnecessary and has no relation to the overall plot at all. I mean the guy is a highly trained British agent. Why does he need to be trained as a ninja to go investigate a suspicious volcano crater.Aside from that ridiculous plot sequence, the whole SPECTRE organization starts to look real stupid at this point and you really see where Austin Powers gets most of it's material. At one point while number one is holding his cat, it looks like its ready to freak out and is desperately trying to jump out of his arms. The whole thing is rather comical.I know Bond movies are supposed to be a little silly, but this one is mostly just dumb and annoying.",You Only Live Twice
286,eddiescandura,Changing Plots,1,22 January 2015,"This movie had to be one of the most inaccurate book-to-film adaption of the entire franchise. The so called ""Blofeld/SPECTRE trilogy"" went in this order: Thunderball, On Her Majesties Secret Service, and Then You Only Live Twice. Not only did those stupid idiots went out of order of the trilogy, they changed the plot. I've noticed that in a lot of the bond films after Flemming passed away in 1964. Yes, even I have to admit that the original plot of Blofeld creating a 'suicide garden' was a bit bizarre, but they should have respected and gone with what Flemming wrote originally. Another thing, the death of Mrs. Bond was a huge impact on Bond and the movie didn't even address that in Diamonds Are Forever, nor did Blofeld even die! The producers really messed up. Connery made the right decision to leave the franchise in 68' because he knew about the changes they had made to the trilogy. But what can I say, that is show business for you.",You Only Live Twice

288,huegtoad,the good forget the bad and go straight to the extremely ugly,3,8 September 2020,"Everybody is entitled to their perspective, and i will never say someone's opinion or perspective is wrong, but i don't understand how anyone could give this movie anything higher than a 4. I am as big of a bond fan as anyone, and goldfinger is my favorite MOVIE of all time, not just a bond but of all movies, so it hurts me to say this, but this movie disqualifies Shawn Connery from being considered the best bond.
ok let's go over some good things. I thought the cinematography was good. the premise was good. there was some good for 1966 level special effects. Donald Pleasance is the definitive Blofeld. final action piece was good to.
ok the extremely ugly. Shawn Connery. never before have I seen an actor with as little F'S to give as Shawn Connery displayed. he was either embarrassed to be there or was just going through the motions. he didn't physically prepare, as he was chubby. his performerance was so low energy. and the whole, turning him Japanese was EMBARRASSING.
the good kept this from being the worst bond ever, but this may have been the most disappointing",You Only Live Twice
289,alohaman,Excellent and lively Bond film - a must!,10,6 March 1999,"Connery's Bond enters a new world in Japan; this film is useful for seeing Japan, where it was titled ""Mr. Kiss-Kiss Bang-Bang"" (Japan nickname for 007).  Costarring lovely Mie Hama, the film has a fast-paced appeal that keeps the viewer engaged throughout.  Gadgetry such as Little Nellie and the drop-floor to Tanaka's lair are in line with the film's location, and provide a welcome change from the European locales that most Bond films feature. Blofeld is interesting, as are Bond's allies, in Tanaka and all the women who help Bond's efforts to hold off yet another World War.   An excellent effort.",You Only Live Twice
290,brotherartimidus,"You only live twice, Mr. Bond.",10,7 May 2001,"You Only Live Twice is by far one of the best movies in the James Bond series.  Sean Connery does a good (although I must say not wonderful) turn as Agent 007 in this 1967 film based off of one of Ian Fleming's last novels.  007 is given the task of stopping nuclear war when American and Russian space capsules start disappearing.  Naturally, since it was the middle of the Cold War, both sides blame each other.  Decent special effects and a solid plot make this the second best Sean Connery James Bond movie, lagging only behind From Russia, with Love.  A great flick all around.",You Only Live Twice
291,Theo_Athanas_2005,A very special one !,8,30 October 2021,"Always watched it as a kid, so it has an important place in my heart. First of all, love the atmosphere of the movie, every setting is exotic and captivating (absolutely love Asian landscapes like these !) Also, the villain is great and iconic it sets so many standards for the next coming movies. Furthermore, I'm always satisfied with the action, especially the plane scene and the huge fight at the end. Finally, its a comedy goldmine for me ! Connery is so effortlessly cool and smooth, but for some reasons I always get funny vibes from his acting and I laugh my ass off when I see Bond become Japaneese and dress like one. Great theme and the best atmosphere in my opinion with lot of action , funny ,witty , iconic , suspensful and of course a lil corny, but what you expect people it's damn simple good James Bond ! Overall beauty + impact it has had on me while growing up = Recipe for classic nostalgic great James Bond !",You Only Live Twice
292,mchnive,"Not bad ,but Connery Is tired",6,24 May 2020,"Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed this movie. But , having said that It Is painfully obvious that Sean Is tired of playing Bond. He came back strong In "" Diamonds Are Forever"" and I thoroughly enjoyed him In "" Never Say Never Again "" .
Gets a 6.5 from me.",You Only Live Twice
293,jkiefte,Best looking Bond film by far,10,12 September 2021,"The directing and cinematography are second to none. Every other bond film pales in comparison to the beauty and thought into every single shot here. No, really. Watch this, and then any other - especially Connery - Bond film. This one is all the swagger that the other ones almost peaked at. No janky edits or frame skips, just flow baby. Are there awkward cultural ""insensitivities""? Sure, but it's a product of it's time, and all in good fun. No one takes themselves too seriously, and most classic memorable Connery quips actually come from this movie, as well as the most Austin Powers material.",You Only Live Twice
294,joeallen30,One of the most gloriously rich and entertaining films of the decade,8,22 September 2016,"The last Connery Bond of the sixties must be one of the most gloriously rich and entertaining films of the decade. So be warned if your're looking for reality or substance, this is high calibre cinematic escapism only! With You Only Live Twice the film makers provide an adventure that outdoes all past Bond movies in terms of scale. While Roald Dahl's script follows the Bond template with great locations, characters and gadgets to enjoy, the concept of an arch villain in a hollowed out volcano trying to create World War 3 is the tour de force here. Bond has to find the hide out and stop the plan, and enlists the Japanese secret service for help along the way. The work of three Oscar winners is standout: Freddie Young's cinematography creates the requisite Bond atmosphere; Ken Adam's production design is nothing like anyone had seen at the time and composer John Barry's score is literally music to the ears. Enjoy Sean Connery in fine form as Bond. Strictly to be appreciated in widescreen only and via the biggest screen you can get your eyes on.",You Only Live Twice
