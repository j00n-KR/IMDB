0,Leofwine_draca,"Second-tier De Palma, but still worth a look",6,11 December 2015,"Director Brian de Palma's crime thriller is full of the expected Hitchcockian moments, from the murder viewed through a window (REAR WINDOW) to the hero's claustrophobia (a basic equivalent of VERTIGO). Obviously it's not as classic as its various predecessors, but there are enough twists and turns in the tale to keep one watching. However, you need to have your brain firmly in gear to do so or you may find yourself getting a headache.The acting is all average, sometimes good, sometimes quite bad, but on the whole okay, and the film benefits from a respectable cast, some of whom (notably Melanie Griffith and Dennis Franz) have gone on to greater stardom. Although the film is best when working on the mystery aspects (the erotic moments are not handled too well), there is one excellent, striking set piece.The moment occurs when the young woman is about to be murdered with a huge electric drill, and the hero desperately races to her house to try and save her, only to keep getting stalled, while the murderer also keeps being held up. The tension, as to whether the murderer or hero will strike first, is sustained remarkably well through the quarter of an hour long moment and it literally keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final outcome. This moment highlights an above average thriller, which veers too far on the silly side to be wholly enjoyable, but still contains plenty of nice photography and sinister shots to raise its value.",Body Double
1,SnoopyStyle,De Palma and Griffith,7,5 January 2018,"Actor Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) finds himself suffering from claustrophobia and he's later fired. He goes home and catches his girlfriend cheating on him. He is befriended by Sam Bouchard (Gregg Henry) who offers him a place to stay. Sam shows him a telescope trained on a scantily-clad neighbor. He becomes obsessed with the woman and starts following her. She is Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton) and he comes to her rescue with a purse snatcher. He continues to spy on her when the thief shows up and murders her. Then he notices a tattoo on porn actress Holly Body (Melanie Griffith) that is the same as the one spied on Gloria.It's director Brian De Palma and Melanie Griffith as the Body. It's salacious and devious. I'm not sure that the premise completely works. There's no need for a false alibi with the Body. The alibi shouldn't work in the actual murder. I don't think the premise works but I'm not sure. Craig Wasson is a solid everyman actor although the role may fit better a matinee idol. He is the lead actor in the movie within the movie after all. Despite that, this is deviously voyeuristic and deliciously sexy.",Body Double
2,Woodyanders,"One of Brian De Palma's most engrossing, enjoyable and ingenious thrillers",9,16 March 2009,"Amiable down on his luck actor Jake Scully (a solid and likable performance by Craig Wasson) gets a job taking care of a posh Hollywood high-rise home by fellow thespian Sam Bouchard (splendidly played to smarmy perfection by Gregg Henry). Jake watches gorgeous rich neighbor Gloria Revelle (a sympathetic turn by ravishing brunette beauty Deborah Shelton) do a nightly striptease and becomes obsessed with her. After he witness Gloria's brutal murder at the hands of a mysterious Native American prowler, Jake decides to investigate said killing and soon discovers that there's more going on than meets the eye.Director Brian De Palma and screenwriter Robert J. Avrech concoct a dandy 80's thriller variant on Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"" that not only delivers the expected suspense and excitement promised by the clever and riveting premise, but also works as a smart and highly cinematic meditation on illusion, reality, voyeurism, and perception. De Palma shows tremendous skill relating various plot points through music and visuals alone. Moreover, he stages individual set pieces with tremendous panache: the grisly butchering of Gloria with a giant drill, a delightfully bawdy large scale musical production of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's gnarly hit song ""Relax,"" and a tour-de-force climax involving an open grave and a roaring river. Better still, this picture pokes sly self-mocking fun at both schlocky low-budget fright flicks and raunchy adult hardcore fare alike. The acting is uniformly tops: Wasson makes for an appealingly flawed and vulnerable protagonist, Henry oozes scuzzy charm, Melanie Griffith impresses with a superbly brash and winning portrayal of jaded porno starlet Holly Body, Guy Boyd steals the few scenes he's in as sardonic homicide detective Jim McLean, and Dennis Franz is his usual excellent self as slimy director Rubin. Popping up in nifty bits are Barbara Crampton as Jake's unfaithful girlfriend Carol, Brinke Stevens as an extra in a porn film, and Slavitza Jovan (Gozer in ""Ghostbusters"") as a clothing store saleslady. Stephen H. Burum's slick, fluid, glittery cinematography pulls out the gloriously outrageous stylistic stops: tilted camera angles, gliding Steadicam tracking shots, and dazzling 360 degree circular tracking shots. Pino Donaggio's lush, rousing, pulsating score likewise hits the spot. Essential viewing for both De Palma fans and thriller buffs alike.",Body Double
3,ccthemovieman-1,"Stylish, But Not As Smart As It Tries To Be",5,26 February 2007,"This was a wild, confusing - and extremely stupid - movie for the first 50 minutes BUT once the action kicks in and all the twists and turns begin happening, it's definitely a fun ride from that point. That's director Brian De Palma, for you: intriguing visuals, with Alfred Hitchcock- type camera angles, a lot of twists and sometimes a great movie and sometimes a very bad one. More often, sad to say, a bad movie.I'd have to rank this closer to ""bad"" than ""good."" I'd like to rank it higher but Craig Wasson's character, ""Jake Scully,"" (he's the lead) was so stupid at times that I almost stopped the tape. That, and too mean an edge overall to this movie, made it unappealing. It's not far removed from a very soft porn film at times, either, since the female lead, played by Melanie Grifftith, plays a porn star. We see a fair share of nudity, although it's hard to complain looking at a naked Griffith. Overall, it has style - De Palma loves that - but it plays like a film that that thinks it's smart, but doesn't connect to its audience.....sort of like Hollywood in general.",Body Double
4,rmax304823,Deja View,3,7 June 2002,"I think I just had what they call an ""epiphany."" It never occurred to me before, just as I'm sure it never occurred to anyone else, that there is a certain family resemblance between Brian DePalma's films and those of Alfred Hitchcock. Yes, it's true. For me, the dawn broke during the first half of this movie, when Jake freezes with fright upon finding himself in an enclosed space, in this case a fake coffin. The thought came to me unbidden that this was something like Jimmy Stewart's acrophobia in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" He finds himself falling in love with a neighbor of his. She's a brunette, okay, but she is one longlimbed lankylooking looselipped lovely.Wow. Her lower lip is adroop in a perpetual pout. He follows this young woman around, just like Stewart follows Kim Novak around. And the woman, Gloria, wears this totally outstanding signature white dress, just like Novak wears the gray suit. She has her purse stolen on a beach by an ugly-looking galoot, and Jake pursues him into a tunnel. Sure enough -- his claustrophobia prevents him from catching the thief, just the way Stewart's disability stopped him from preventing a mishap. And just as in ""Vertigo,"" this whole deal with the pursuit across the sand and into the tunnel, followed by Jake's tonic immobility, is a SET-UP, except that in this movie the snare is so exquisitely executed and timed that its rehearsals must have begun at a time now shrouded in the mists of antiquity. Hitchcock had a naughty fantasy about icy-looking blondes who would assault a man in the back of a taxi. DePalma has the notion that when Jake returns what's left of Gloria's purse to this woman, whom he first met one minute ago and with whom he's exchanged fourteen words plus one sigh, she wordlessly falls in love with him, smooches him mercilessly, and lets him half undress her in public. It happens to me all the time. While this breathless display of lust is taking place, the entwined couple and their background whirl slowly in opposite directions, just like what happened in Novak's bedroom in the Empire Hotel before they made love for the first time, and elegiac strings swell tumescently in the score, just like Bernard Hermann's in ""Vertigo.""But there's even more. ""Vertigo"" aside, Jake finds himself house-sitting for a stranger and soon he is watching his sultry neighbor doing the dance of one veil through a monstrous telescope, which reminded me immediately of Miss Torso bouncing around in ""Rear Window"" while Steward peeks at her through a telescopic lens. There are other echoes, of Miss Lonelyhearts and The Salesman's wife. By this time, halfway through the movie, my heart was racing alarmingly at the nearly religious revelation I was experiencing. DePalma and Hitchcock. Hitchcock and DePalma! Of course! How simple it all seemed in retrospect. But DePalma isn't really Hitchcock. The story gets pretty looped and twisted and even less logical than the master's. There is a gruesome death, gorier than, but not as shocking as Janet Leigh's in ""Psycho."" There is a long, completely silly musical interlude about shooting a skin flick. (THIS scene reminded me of Gene Kelly's Broadway Ballet in ""Singin' in the Rain"" because of Jake's goofy, loud, hick outfit, his horn rimmed glasses, and the den of iniquity his character finds himself in.) The acting is okay, no more than that. Craig Wasson is easy to identify with. Where is he? Melanie Griffith is pleasant to watch but her voice is unappealing, at least to me, because it can't seem to make up its mind whether to emerge as a rasp or a whisper. Deborah Shelton looks gloriously glamorous but on the evidence of her few lines here doesn't seem like a powerful actress. The photography is superlative, though. What an easy movie to look at. The musical score is vintage Hermann. But I don't mean to be too hard on the film. It has one unusual thing going for it that lifts it out of the ordinary. Annette Haven is listed in the credits. I sat through the whole thing looking for her but missed her. Realizing this, as the end credits began to roll, I felt my mystic experience had been blunted.",Body Double
5,BA_Harrison,Me and Body Double go way back.,7,9 February 2014,"Many years ago, when I was in sixth form, I reviewed Body Double as part of the college video 'magazine', which was shown to bored students during lunch hours (usually one or two desperate souls who would do anything to get out of the cold). I included a lengthy clip—the film's gruesome power-drill murder—to accompany my review, but the scene was later excised at the insistence of the head of the audio-visual department after he showed it to his overly-sensitive wife and she threw up. I had liked the film to start with, but my first-hand experience of censorship during the Draconian '80s only made me like it even more!Director Brian DePalma's 'inspiration' for this trashy, nonsensical but irresistible murder mystery is, once again, the work of Alfred Hitchcock, most notably Vertigo, Rear Window and Psycho, the protagonist suffering from an irrational fear (claustrophobia) and partaking in voyeurism, with the seemingly central female character meeting a grisly fate well into the film. DePalma also seems to have been taking note of the Italian horror scene, his work frequently resembling that of the 'Italian Hitchcock' Dario Argento, whose movies often feature similar free-wheeling narratives devoid of logic and dizzying camera-work. But while originality is definitely not Body Double's strong point, the film is simply too crazy not to enjoy.Craig Wasson stars as struggling actor Jake Scully, who finds himself suddenly homeless after discovering his girlfriend carol (played by 80s scream queen Barbara Crampton) in bed with another man. When fellow thespian Sam Bouchard asks him to house-sit an exclusive Hollywood apartment belonging to a millionaire, Jake cannot believe his luck, especially when he is shown the luxury pad's incredible view—of the hot brunette in the neighbouring building performing a nightly strip routine.Jake's interest in the mysterious woman quickly becomes an obsession, even more-so when he realises that she is being stalked by a sinister Indian. With too much spare time on his hands, Jake takes to following his sexy new neighbour, eventually encountering her face-to-face (literally—the pair have a snog and a fondle after the Indian steals her handbag and Jake gives Chase). Imagine Jake's horror, then, when the very next night, he witnesses the Indian attacking the woman in her home, but is unable to prevent her grisly demise (via the aforementioned power tool—one of the most impressive bits of DIY kit you're likely to find in a movie!).The police are soon on the case, suspicious of Jake's voyeuristic obsession but quickly ruling him out as a suspect. However, Jake decides to do a little investigation of his own after he notices Hollywood porn star Holly Body (Melanie Griffith) performing a routine uncannily similar to that of the now dead woman and begins to believe that she is somehow involved in the mystery.What follows is preposterous in the extreme, with Jake following Holly into the world of porn to find answers, even becoming a performer himself (in a riotous scene that starts with a ridiculous musical number from Frankie Goes to Hollywood); as Jake gets nearer to uncovering the truth, the film gets more and more unbelievable, but DePalma's impressive style, the spirited performances, lush Pino Donaggio score, frequent nudity (Griffith getting near naked for her role), shocking violence, and audacious finalé all add up to a whole heap of fun.",Body Double
6,moonspinner55,Sexual thriller circa 1984: back when our fantasies were still allowed to be sordid and kinky,4,29 November 2010,"Struggling B-movie actor with no place to sleep accepts an offer to house-sit for an acquaintance with an abode in the Hollywood hills--one with a great view of the city and also of the sexy female neighbor across the way (who has a habit of dancing provocatively in her window). Producer-director Brian De Palma also co-wrote the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech (based on De Palma's original treatment); it's a quasi-Hitchcockian thriller with the proverbial new-fangled bloodshed and body-baring. De Palma doesn't appear to have a conscience when it comes to aping The Master--however, upon doing so, he proceeds to overload his derivative scenario with tacky modern elements (all of which cause ""Body Double"" to look far more dated than, say, ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window""). Still, Melanie Griffith is an undeniable presence as porn actress Holly Body; her poison-lipstick decadence and dryly unaffected demeanor are a tantalizing combination, and she's far more interesting than her male counterparts. *1/2 from ****",Body Double
7,dbdumonteil,"the son of ""Vertigo"" (1958)",5,31 May 2007,"An unemployed actor, Jake accepts the offer from a friend to put him up in a luxurious flat where with a telescope, he can admire and fantasize about a female neighbor who languorously takes her clothes off. It's the same ""show"" every night. But it's the start of a perverse game which will prove to be infinitely more dangerous for him and will catch him in the heart of a big conspiracy.""Body Double"" is a piece of work that bears the seal of its auteur Brian De Palma. Manipulation and voyeurism are once again the two unifying threads of this effort and called upon to play with the hero's nerves and even the audience's.Unless you've never heard about him, it's blatant that De Palma went for a new ride in Hitchcock universe. ""Rear Window"" (1954) for the observation of the female neighbor and as the Master said: ""don't start to spy your neighbors, it can get you into trouble"", ""Psycho"" (1960) for the sparse cinematographic writing and the somber story of doubles and especially, the shadow of ""Vertigo"" (1958) hangs over the whole film. The scheme of ""Body Double"" is practically identical to Hitchcock's masterpiece. In the 1958 film, James Stewart suffered from vertigo. Here, the hero is claustrophobic and the replacement is done.Then, De Palma's effort includes features that are common to his films: a main character suspected of a murder he didn't commit and who has to manage all alone to find the culprit and to exempt himself. An actress of X-rated films who isn't depreciated and ends up helping the hero even if at first, she thinks he's crazy. To shot his incredible adventure, De Palma has recourse to a sparse directing with taut camera work to fuel suspenseful sequences like the very long one when the hero follows Gloria. To increase the interest, the filmmaker interspersed his work with bombastic visual effects and there's the rub. These tricks besmirch the film and its story, notably the second part after Gloria's murder (a would-be creepy sequence that turns out to be farcical). And one can't skip on certain disputable steps of the plot: is it sensible from De Palma to make Gloria and the hero kiss each other after the latter didn't manage to arrest the killer? The two people don't really know each other. And in the second part, how can Jake precisely identify the woman who made her striptease in the neighboring flat? Many women must have an identical act.Because of his hateful penchant for visual excesses and a lack of rigor in the story, the student doesn't match at all the Master. I say it: De Palma's finest efforts are the ones exempted from extreme effects like ""Sisters"" (1973) or ""Obssession"" (1976). The latter being ""Vertigo""'s truly legitimate son.",Body Double
8,Quinoa1984,"De Palma's lurid and outrageous thriller hits all the right marks as more of a satire or parody than a full-on thriller, and magnificently so",10,4 July 2007,"With Body Double, Brian De Palma has another of his ""Hitchcock rip-offs"", but in quotes as it's the easy critical thing that's already been said by others. The film is really a lot more cunning than that, and has a level of cunning wit that one could more associate with De Palma's early comedies that felt very much about skewering the style being homaged as opposed to incurious methods. If one looks at it as much as a big wink and a nod to films like Rear Window and especially Vertigo, with a lot of direct jabs at Hollywood and the whole method of acting and pretending, there's a lot on the table. It's also tasteless in its outrageous depictions of sensuality and seduction, not just sex which gets a lot of wicked moments that veer almost totally into what's being made fun of, and has a huge ""gotcha"" ending that works specifically for its shock value. It's own self-consciousness is a huge asset, as when De Palma is at his best or at least most assertive, in this case pushing the taboo of mixing regular dramatic fiction with soft-core porno to a limit with glee.It's not even that one can't take it sort of seriously as a work of kind-of pop-art, as in taking in the outlandish brilliance of a much better-than-average paperback book, because De Palma is on his toes the whole time in crafting a melodramatic thriller. There's even an experiment in tension which starts as an long homage to the 'following' sequences in Vertigo, but then building to a high crescendo and then to another. In fact, Body Double is silent for a lot of the time, but as something that is worked into the main character. Craig Wasson is a perfect foil for the events that unfold around him as the ""witness"" to all that comes before his watchful eye in a befriended man's apartment. In what is, to be sure, fairly typical material for the director with the basics of the substance, the story calling back to Hi, Mom and Sisters especially (hence as well the connection to the knowing dips into comedy, of which both of those could be considered as), though this time the 'hero' is a of weakling with panic attacks at the moment to act, albeit already an actor. A murder is witnessed following a pivotal plot point and high-flying moment of romance (again, calling attention to its over-length), then the dive into porno comes around.It's trashy, sure, but why shouldn't that make it more enjoyable if one's to get the kidding and sharp sensibility after a while? Wasson, looking a bit like a double of Bill Maher sometimes, has the expression of terror in his eyes, and a kind of strange guts needed to pull off a hilariously flawed pawn. De Palma also intentionally casts to type with both women and the villains, one for each being more deceptive (i.e. Henry's Brouchard and Shelton's Gloria, who are very much like ""movie"" caricatures from the craftiest and most seductive of film-noir), and with one 'villain' called the Indian, donning a face that's a riot just to look at, who at one point engages in a murder including the most blatant phallic imagery in any murder scene from the filmmaker. But, again, it all works exceptionally for rhythm and a sort of momentum build into even the smaller moments. As cheesily 80's as it is, I loved the whole music video Relax, where occasionally as De Palma almost makes us forget that a movie is being shot within this scene, the camera shooting Wasson and Griffith comes into view in a mirror. But that's just a sly joke, as opposed to the scenes where suspense and humor get the back and forth treatment, where you aren't sure whether to laugh or cringe or look at the screen through closed fingers peeking out.I can actually understand some of the negative criticisms of Body Double. I probably wouldn't be so forgiving of it being so proudly 'B-movie' while appearing to be a big Hollywood crime-drama, if I wasn't at least intrigued on the outset from the sensibility behind it all. 'Guilty Pleasure' comes to mind as a defense, but I should digress into what it really comes down to- either you'll go along for a De Palma atmosphere that is wild and cynical and full of rough-edges, or you won't. In other instances with the director I've gone for the latter, but this isn't one of them. One of the best of 1984.",Body Double
9,Coventry,Dull and unappealing fan-boy stuff,3,13 August 2005,"Brian DePalma's ""Body Double"" isn't a very good thriller, in fact, the only REALLY disturbing thing about it is the director's own and always-increasing obsession for Alfred Hitchcock's persona. Fans of DePalma (and I know there are a lot) will never admit this, but you can't refer to his work anymore as being homages to Hitchcock. What his films really are  and ""Body Double"" is the most obvious example  are desperate supplications to be regarded as Hitchcock's number one acolyte! The story is an simple re-telling of both ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"" (set in the Hollywood porn scene) but DePalma's devotion to the Master of Suspense also shows in many other, smaller trademarks like camera angles and characterizations. The actual film is quite fatuous and takes off incredibly slow... You can easily skip the first 45 minutes without missing out on the 'essence' of the story; namely a loser-actor who's too easily framed for murder because of his many weaknesses like claustrophobia and voyeurism. ""Body Double"" never becomes compelling and doesn't evoke emotions of involvement, simply because the main character is such an antipathetic and miserable guy. You can't possibly cheer for him, on the contrary, I was secretly hoping that his fate would be merciless. The pivot murder-sequence is inappropriately and tastelessly gore (beatiful Deborah Shelton is butchered with a huge drilling machine) and totally doesn't fit in the wholesome of the film. Considering the story takes place in the porn-underground of Hollywood, ""Body Double"" throws in quite a bit of sleaze and nudity, yet the quality-level of this film never surpasses that of an ordinary soft-core-flick starring Shannon Tweed or, even worse, Shannon Whirry. Remotely positive aspect is the music by Pino Donaggio and the supportive role of Denis Franz as the porno-director.",Body Double
10,hitchcockthelegend,"De Palma Double Bubble, Toil and Trouble.",8,22 February 2014,"Body Double is directed by Brian De Palma, he also co-writes the screenplay with Robert J. Avrech. It stars Craig Wasson, Melanie Griffith, Gregg Henry, Deborah Shelton, Guy Boyd and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Stephen H. Burum.Brian De Palma continued his crusade to push buttons of the sensitive whilst homaging his hero Alfred Hitchcock, with this cheeky, garish, sleazy thriller. Even when moving away from Hitch like movies, he created a storm with Scarface (1983), so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top, apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry, with exploitation gore thrown in for good (bad) measure, Body Double was the devil's spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much, film was a sure fire hit at the box office.Of course today it seems all very tame, where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience, or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it's easy to view De Palma's movie as a visionary piece of work, a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA, and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work, he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them, Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.That it's Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given, but that doesn't make it a bad film, besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well, undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor with claustrophobia, thrust into a world of murder, obsession, deceit and paranoia, for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend, he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time, but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neo-noir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.It's pulpy and pappy, but in the best ways possible, and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory, it's never boring (hello Sliver). Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated, the twists fun if not hard to see coming, and with De Palma's visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio's musical score, Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 8/10",Body Double
11,Theo Robertson,Too Bizarre,5,8 May 2003,"I suppose BODY DOUBLE has some merit as a spoof on the porn industry and as a homage to Hitchcock but there`s two things I found annoying and one thing that ruined the whole film for me The first annoying thing was Holly Body . Melanie Griffith plays the part of a porn star bimbo very well , but her name Holly Body ! I was under the impression that porn stars got their names by combining the name of their first pet with their mother`s maiden name hence Holly Body is an unconvincing porn name Frankie Goes To Hollywood was the second annoying thing . What on earth were they doing in that sequence ? Was it a video shoot or did they get invited onto the sets of porn films in the 1980s all the time ?But the thing that spoiled BODY DOUBLE was the ending . I`m reluctant to write a spoiler but what the hell was all that about , it`s not too disimilar to these type of films where somebody wakes up and they discover it`s all been a dream . I didn`t understand it at all and I wouldn`t recommend this film if you`re looking for a logical ending
And I wouldn`t recommend it BODY DOUBLE unless you`re familiar with the techniques of the porn industry . This not a family film",Body Double
12,Scarecrow-88,Body Double,9,5 April 2007,"An out-of-work actor, Jake Scully(Craig Wasson, quite good in a rare starring role), struggling after a broken relationship and a career marred by his claustrophobia, is allowed to stay in the fine, palatial home of another actor, Sam Bouchard(Gregg Henry). Jake is a certified peeper and Sam introduces him to a gorgeous woman across the way who likes to flaunt her naked body in front of an open window. Jake frequently peeps at her during his stay, but never imagines that this woman's life would be in jeopardy. An ""Indian"" who works for the satellite company, repairing a dish on the woman's property, spies and follows her. The woman's name is Gloria(Deborah Shelton)and Jake takes a particular interest in her himself, but wishes ultimately to protect her from the Indian. In a long, marvelous sequence(which is, in my opinion, some of De Palma's best work as a director), Jake follows Gloria to the mall and beach apartments worried for her life when he spots the Indian, in his Ranger, right behind her. At the beach apartment, Gloria was awaiting a certain someone..when he doesn't show, she heads to the beach only to have her purse stole by the Indian as Jake pursues him. Once they make it to a tunnel, Jake freezes in fear because of his paralyzing vertigo. The Indian gets away with a pass key that can open Gloria's home. This sets off a harrowing, and ultimately haunting, sequence where the Indian enters Gloria's home, taking her jewelry as Jake looks on in a state of horror. Instead of calling the police, Jake tries to play hero with Gloria being killed by the Indian thanks in part to a nasty use of a drill. Jake couldn't help her because the house's dog attacks him. This haunting aspect looms over Jake for he could not heroically ride in like a knight in shining armour and save the woman he cares for.This set-piece is the catalyst for the rest of the film as Jake desperately desires to redeem himself after the loss of Gloria. This entails a porn star named Holly Body(Melanie Griffith, who is good in her short screen time)who may've played a part in the murder and didn't even know it. And, a possible revelation might prove that Jake was playing a part in a very dangerous plot not of his doing, but because of his faults.I fell in love with De Palma's camera-work in this film. Not just that, but the amazing editing work and the twisty story which kept me on edge. I was repulsed at how De Palma unapologetically and blatantly rips off Hitchcock, but what he does with the themes from VERTIGO & REAR WINDOW do make up some wonderful visual set-pieces. But, this film is the anti-thesis almost of REAR WINDOW as the hero isn't able to save the woman he loves because he was simply too far away, while also oh so close. Using the paralyzing shock of vertigo and claustrophobia plays the most important role in this film because Jake is damaged by this. It affects his life in such traumatic ways. De Palma has a field day with the pornography business, submerging and propelling the film often into sleaze. Dennis Franz has a small memorable role as Jake's film director. The ""Relax-Don't Do It"" porno video is a highlight.",Body Double
13,preppy-3,One of DePalma's worst,1,30 July 2006,"Out of work actor Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) agrees to house sit for a friend. The friend also has a telescope that points right to a house where a beautiful woman does a nude dance all by herself every night. Jake immediately becomes obsessed...until he finds an Indian is also watching the woman with murderous designs on his mind...DePalma didn't want to do this movie...and it shows. He was sick of fighting the censors to get his movies released uncut--he wanted to make this an X rated film--full of explicit sex and violence. The studio said no so he was forced to tone this down.His direction is off in this one--he always imitated Hitchcock in his earlier films and it's pretty obvious here. He's ripping off Hitchcock again (especially ""Rear Window"") and his own films too! There are some beautiful sequences but I always felt like I was watching someone imitating Hitchcock...DePalma never put his own style into films until later. There's also a needlessly long sequence where Wasson is stalking somebody. It's boring and brings the movie to a screeching halt.The picture is full of gratuitous female nudity--as much as an R rating will allow. Also there's a particularly sick sequence where someone is drilled to death and it's shown as a phallic instrument! Also the story in this is just ridiculous--the ultimate solution to what's going on is, to say the least, implausible. Even the ending is terrible--it doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with a closeup of breasts with blood pouring down them! Wasson is terrible in his role too.The only saving grace here is Melanie Griffith playing a porno actress named Holly Body. She's just great and energizes the movie. Especially good is a sequence where she tells Wasson what she will (and will not do) in a movie. Also they (somehow) fit the 80s group Frankie Goes to Hollywood into this performing the song ""Relax"" for a porno film!

Here, however, he seems somewhat unsure of himself as he even turns to his own earlier films for inspiration: while the main theme of Craig Wasson as a voyeur clearly owes a debt to REAR WINDOW (1954), his obsession over a woman comes from - what else? - OBSESSION (1976; and, by extension, VERTIGO [1958]), the film-making milieu (with the nostalgic title sequence being especially nicely done) from BLOW OUT (1981) and the ruse of committing a murder in disguise (in order to put the lead character - and the audience with him - off the track) from DRESSED TO KILL (1980; and, obviously, PSYCHO [1960])!Still, the mystery isn't particularly involving - though Wasson isn't bad in registering his character's curiosity and confusion, while being able to romance both the victim (Deborah Shelton) and her double (Melanie Griffith) - and, other than adding an extra element of sleaze, the porn subplot is more of a distraction than anything else! The villain, too, is totally uninteresting which rather makes the resolution less compelling - though the excessive violence (Shelton is pinned to the floor with a power drill!), camera gymnastics and, above all, Pino Donaggio's typically wistful score certainly keep one watching...even if De Palma has clearly made better films!",Body Double

I guess that is why his wife was cheating on him. Who meets someone for the first time and then takes a free apartment without wondering what the catch is? And, can you really trust someone that looks like Sam (Gregg Henry)? This Hitchcokian film noir has voyeurism, pornography, murder with a big drill, and a great performance by Melanie Griffith, who has more bad performances than Paris Hilton could ever dream of (The Bonfire of the Vanities , Shining Through, Born Yesterday, Too Much, Mulholland Falls, Crazy in Alabama, and Cecil B.

It is a well known fact that De Palma admires Hitchcock. In this movie De Palma mixes several elements from various Hitchcock movies with as a result his homage to the master of suspense; ""Body Double"".Like I said before, the movie has several story elements from Hitchcock movies in it, mostly from ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"". The movie doesn't create a Hitchcock like feeling but it does know to create some Hitchcock tension. There are some really nerve wrecking scene's.The main reason that this movie doesn't have an Hitchcock like feeling is because of the fact that De Palma's style is too notably present for that. As a De Palma fan I don't mind this at all. There are some purely genius scene's that are typically De Palma like, such as the warehouse sequence.But the movie is not perfect. Even though I'm a fan of De Palma and his style, the movie still has some odd moments and scene's and the ending doesn't quite pay off. Still the tense moments make up a lot for this.

18,view_and_review,Half Witted Hitchcock,3,14 February 2020,"This movie was billed as a variation of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" albeit a smuttier version. I thought it resembled both ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" but almost in a spoof-like fashion. Just about everything that happened in this movie screamed parody or worse. It was a complete joke. Instead of the main character, Jake (Craig Wasson), having a fear of heights, he has claustrophobia. He seizes up whenever he's in tight spaces like elevators or HALLWAYS. Whereas in ""Vertigo"" James Stewart's character was contracted to follow the antagonist's wife, there is no motivation for Jake following his crush Gloria. Unless being a peeping tom stalker is enough of a motivation. And that is a motivation, but they never painted him as this creepy character. Like peeping tom stalkers are just normal guys with a healthy obsession.No amount of boob shots and stripteases could save this movie from the cesspool it was plopped in. I damn near turned the movie off when Jake caught up with the girl he was stalking and they locked into a passionate game of tongue wrestling. Only in Hollywood do women make out with their stalkers. I only watched the movie because it is a Brian De Palma directed film and he's done some really good work. This movie is a far cry from Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables, and others. ""Body Double"" slightly redeemed itself towards the last quarter of the movie, but not nearly enough. This is something De Palma won't be remembered for.",Body Double

But if you surrender yourself at the hands of Brian De Palma, his direction is so fantastic, and so assured, that the film becomes an entertaining, at times even exhilarating, experience. It's erotic, (briefly) violent, surprisingly funny, and occasionally positively surreal. Perhaps one of the key thrillers of the 1980s. *** out of 4.",Body Double

So in an attempt to protect her he begins to follow her as well--and things take a turn for the worse immediately afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film which greatly benefited from the presence of two attractive actresses in Melanie Griffith (as the porn star ""Holly Body"") and the aforementioned Deborah Shelton.

The police are dubious about what he claims to have seen, but the case takes a bizarre turn when, while watching TV, he sees a porn star do the exact same dance he had watched for all those nights. He soon realises he has been an unwitting accomplice in a complex plot.De Palma has always referenced Hitchcock in his movies, and here, it's his rear window, and the concept is as bonkers and as brilliant as the decade it was made in.There are many interpretations of the films narrative, and this is why it demands repeat viewings. Is it all in Jakes head while he is suffering his bout of claustrophobia? So the only parts of the film that are real are the initial scene with him in the coffin, and then him being helped out of the coffin. After all, the majority of the film is almost dreamlike, thanks to the wonderful eye De Palma has, most noticeably the scene in the shopping mall where Jake sees the Indian following his victim from afar.The film can be seen as a wonderful epitaph to the decade that fashion, music and taste forgot, and no matter how garish the make up, clothes and sets are, it just adds so much t the narrative.It's a definite conversation piece, there are plot holes aplenty, but this just adds to the argument of where reality ends and the subconscious starts in the films narrative.And it also adds much evidence to my theory that 1984 was the best year for movies ever.It's a bonkers piece for sure, but it's thrilling, and never let's up the craziness.Essential viewing.",Body Double

It's a bit the same storyline. The acting is okay and the score used do works because with some sounds you immediately knows we are going to watch the girl strip in the other house. Made in 1984 it do looks like an exploitation flick because there's a lot of gratuitous nudity. The girl that's giving a show every night before her window, she appears a lot before that window were you just see her giving a show with her body. I know that a lot of people do tear this flick down due the stupid story and the nudity and goofs in it. I for example saw the whole crew reflecting in a closing door. But the flick is famous for a few reasons. Melanie Griffith goes naked here and show her juggs a lot. And be honest, once she is asked to go for a porno flick she says she doesn't do a few things, the most notorious was, I don't shave my pussy. Those were the days, full bush as I saw in other eighties flicks. Maybe you can indeed see it all coming from the start who the killer is going to be but even clocking in well over ninety minutes you still keep watching.

But for the most part, this movie is trash. And trash isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just depends on your reaction to it. This does not do it for me. De Palma's clearly going for Hitchcock here - hell, he's smashing together ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" . . . while standing inside a porn shop. Sleaze isn't the problem here so much as the melodrama is off the charts. Guy Boyd easily steals this movie, but his screen time is minimal. After that, it's lots of time with Melanie Griffith.

The main problem is that the first half is grand, De Palma is freely utilising both, Vertigo and Rear Window, to great effect but around the time the poorly judged Frankie Goes to Hollywood sequence is up, the film is changing gear. It is more lighthearted from then on and then another problem arises. Such was the success of the first half action that we fail to notice the inadequacy of Craig Wasson as lead, but as soon as Melanie Griffith appears, her star quality shines and she takes over. She is perfect for the role and has some great lines, bringing much humour to the film. But was humour what the film needed? Was there not enough of the Hitchcock inspired material? I suppose the obsession with the Hitchcock movies in the first half took our attention off what was really happening in this one, which is OK, but unfortunately we are loosing real interest as the twists appear and Griffith steals our attention.

31,lasttimeisaw,a cracking-a-nut-with-a-sledgehammer case of Hitchcock plundering,6,11 March 2018,"While Brian De Palma's BODY DOUBLE taps adeptly into its hetero-normative erotic thrust, in post-mortem, its central plot fits right into a cracking-a-nut-with-a-sledgehammer case that if the nefarious perpetrator simply needs an eye-witness for his purported burglary-turned-murder skulduggery, he really wouldn't have concocted such an involute set-up to pull the wool over the eyes of our protagonist, Jack Scully (Wasson), a struggling actor in Hollywood afflicted by claustrophobia. So what De Palma blatantly exploits down pat is the libidinous bent and voyeuristic tantalization mostly derived from the straight male demography, plundering Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO no end, BODY DOUBLE's misbegotten plot is at first a thoroughgoing manifestation of female objectification through man's wish-fulfillment, as if in real world, a luscious woman really enjoys putting on such a show for no one's gratification but herself, also the camp choice from a telephone cord to an electric drill in terms of the murder weapon in the archly designed gore climax does writ large a wicked sign of its times and De Palma's thinly-veiled mean-spiritness. Jack Scully is hare-brained enough to not suspect something bizarre is afoot right from the start, but the same can be referred to the culprit, so inimitable is the seductive routine that he must hire the porn star who invents it to do the same performance, and thanks to the slipshod prosthetics wearing by the ghastly-looking ""Indian"", any sharp-eyed spectator can more or less guess who is underneath that halfway through the journey, ergo, thrill is drained by half. Having said that, Melanie Griffith does hold court in her breakthrough performance as the titular double, who only makes her appearance in the second half but charmingly weds immaculate allure with an air of nonchalance in her trademark cooing articulation, the paradigm of a woman in the eyes of her opposite sex beholder. Ultimately, the takeaway of the film is exclusively ocular apart from Griffith's grand entrance, the strikingly futuristic dwelling Chemosphere and a vampy music video of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's RELAX are here to stay, but as for De Palma's facility, that Dutch-angle tunnel-vision might be any viewer's best shot.",Body Double
32,Red-Barracuda,Brian De Palma at his most excessive = a good time,9,8 March 2018,"Brian De Palma has often been labelled a director who rips off Alfred Hitchcock. I really don't mind his lifts myself as it seems to me that he takes this stuff and reconfigures it into something new, something uniquely his own. It has to be said that with Body Double he goes full pelt with the Hitchcock lifts like never before; to the point it really feels like he did it to antagonise his detractors. In this one there are very blatant nods to Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958) in particular. Not only this, but he also seems to be parodying his own films here as well, with the final shower sequence surely a reference to the notorious shower scene in Dressed to Kill (1980) which was edited in such a way to make Angie Dickinson look like she had the body of a Playboy Playmate! Not only this but with Body Double De Palma included a notorious sequence of extreme violence which was a further nose thumb at critics who decried the heavy violence in both Dressed to Kill and Scarface (1983). As a consequence of all this, I find Body Double to be a very playful and knowing film from De Palma. Consequently, it is highly entertaining stuff.The story is wilfully artificial, with a thriller story-line which I unfortunately found quite easy to predict. It involves an unsuccessful actor with claustrophobia who is offered a luxurious futuristic apartment to live in temporarily after splitting from his girlfriend; from here he is the witness to strange ominous goings on involving his beautiful neighbour who has a habit of dancing semi-nude in open view. It's a story which taps into the voyeur in us all.The things I really like about De Palma is his taste for excessive content with an unapologetic style-over-substance approach. To this end, we have a story with severe fluctuations in tone, from the melodramatic, nastily violent, highly eroticised and moments of extreme weirdness. It is all, needless to say, highly stylish in presentation, with trademark fluid camera-work and long stretches of dialogue-free sequences where image alone tells the story and an effectively lush soundtrack adding additional flavour. In some respects this is a De Palma film turned up to volume 11, with lots of nudity, an excessively violent murder scene, overly dramatic acting from the main character, dream-like border-line surreal moments and an extended scene involving a porn star played by Melanie Griffiths played out as a music video to Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 'Relax' including an appearance by singer Holly Johnson! Not only this but it's a film which both begins and ends on comic film-within-a-film sequences which only serve to accentuate the artificial bizarreness even further. De Palma was one of the very few A-List Hollywood directors who made films whose directorial style and no-holds barred content have earned them the label 'cult film'. Well, with Body Double I am going to go out on a limb and declare this his most culty film of all! It is not a film for those who equate movies to social responsibility and good taste but for those of us who like them for unashamed entertainment value, this ticks many boxes.",Body Double

The opening was interesting, as we're introduced to the character of Jake, a claustrophobic actor playing a vampire in a low-budget horror film who can't stand being in the coffin. It seemed to be setting us up for some type of comedy or spoof-type movie. Then, almost immediately, we're drawn into this bizarre, kind of erotic murder-mystery story as Jake first becomes a voyeur watching an apparently exhibitionist neighbour (and creepily develops into something of a stalker type) only to eventually witness her being killed. There are twists and turns galore and it's hard to know whether this is supposed to be taken seriously or not. The performances from a less that A-list cast (Melanie Griffith would be the best known name involved with this) weren't bad, but they also weren't great. It's not a movie I would recommend very highly.",Body Double
34,lost-in-limbo,De Palma's slick peepshow.,7,16 May 2006,"Jake is a washed up actor who walks in on his girlfriend with another man and so it means his got to find another place to live. Plus he is fired from the vampire movie he was involved in because that of his phobia of confined places. So, when Jake is checking about for some acting gigs he meets another struggling actor who offers him place to house sit and it does have its perks. Through a telescope he can spy on his neighbours, which through one window a lady goes through the same strip routine every night. Jake becomes extremely obsessed with the woman and he gets caught up in a seedy web of intrigue when he witness the woman being killed.De Palma goes all out on this occasion with his obsession with Hitchcock and the master's films that are under the spotlight in this voyeuristic thriller are ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"". While, there might be elements borrowed from those films, De Palma still brings to the party his own distinguishable style and perspective. I've enjoyed most of his works and this one joins the ranks. Well, maybe one of the lesser ones since I was a bit iffy on it at times. I'll admit - it's pure trash, but technically it's done so well with many fashionable touches worked into this artistic piece of steamy erotica that I just found it hard to take my eyes off it. Some of those facets that make a mark is the camera-work that's handle rather silkily with it's many gliding shots and innovative angels. The taunting score rallies up the tension remarkably well and actually generates an alarming awe. There are some odd, kinky and down and out heart stopping images like that of the infamously lurid drill scene and a couple of downright claustrophobic build ups. The female cast involving Melanie Griffith and most definitely Deborah Shelton are desirably seductive. Craig Wasson as the down on his luck actor Jake was solid, but it's the freaky villain of the piece ""The Indian"" that will catch your eye and make you real nervous. Also there's a neat cameo role by Dennis Franz as a director, which is a neat treat. The over-the-top story tightly constructs itself around a complicated web of twists and turns involving sleaze and murder, but when it came to its climax it felt convoluted and rushed. The confusing revelation doesn't seem as effective and clever as it may think. Hollywood even comes under fire with it being mock with De Palma using the porn industry to do so. Anyhow, remember to shut your blinds, as who knows maybe someone is peering into your window right now. ;) ""Body Double"" is a flawed, but an interesting concept that I could not help but go with the flow.",Body Double
35,Lejink,Slash / flash bang wallop!,6,11 September 2014,"Brian DePalma's ""Body Double"" has fault lines the size of San Andreas running through it but through sheer directorial chutzpah, he delivers another visually stunning movie, big on set pieces, if shallow on anything approaching realism.In this X-rated feature, he combines vintage B-movie chic (right down to the opening titles) with the unsavoury world of film pornography and of course lashings of his staple slasher- gore action and Hitchcockian motifs to produce a film that is often uncomfortable to watch and yet difficult to take your eyes off. This of course is one of the points of the film, drawing the viewer in as voyeurs as patsy Craig Wasson is unwittingly involved in a contrived murder plot centring on a beautiful young woman given to exhibitionist late night dancing and a sinister Freddy Kruger-esque Indian with terrible teeth and a driller-killer of a weapon.I'd say the first half of the film overdoes the voyeurism as Wasson gets his kicks on watching the girl do her ritual dance of the seven veils so that even when he follows her into a daytime shopping-mall ostensibly to protect her, still he can't help himself sneaking a peak at her in the ladies changing room. The convoluted plot typically ends up with a grandstand ""buried alive"" finish requiring to overcome his embedded claustrophobia to save the day. Once the twist is revealed dePalma handily reprises all the clues to lead us to the murderer's identity, not exactly an original device but a useful crutch nonetheless.As for the Hitchcock homage, I counted references to ""Spellbound"", ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Vertigo"" (naturally), ""Psycho (double naturally) ""Rear Window"" (triple naturally) , ""Topaz"" and ""Frenzy"". DePalma would like us to think this is the kind of film Hitchcock would have produced if he was starting out now, but I doubt the Master would have touched such a fantastic plot. There are no big stars in the cast, with only a young Melanie Griffith baring all as the body double of the title and while a little star-action may have helped credibility, the story moves unconcerned through its ever stranger phases.Boring it isn't however and while not the best of Brian it's fine for fans which I guess includes me.",Body Double

It's amazing how, even in this day and age, (see ""The Neon Deomn""), critics still tend to judge films on content rather than on style or technique and ""Body Double"" is style personified. He was still paying homage to Hitchcock, (in this case both ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"") and he still tended to use actors who were somewhat limited in their abilities, (the exception being the extraordinary Melanie Griffith who won the National Society of Film Critics Best Supporting Actress prize), but the set pieces are sublime and the suspense sequences are beautifully handled.

37,ironhorse_iv,"I need a Body Double to watch this movie again, it's not worth watching again.",5,26 May 2013,"The film was marketed with the tag line: ""You can't believe everything you see."" That's truly right, I can't believe everything I see in this movie. I thought it was going to be good, but it's not. There is little to no originality in this film. It's full of rip-off of Hitchcock references. The only different between Hitchcock and this film by Director Brian De Palma, is the fact that Alfred Hitchcock was a master of suspense and subtlety while Brian De Palma puts gratuitous nudity and violence due to the lack of suspenseful material. Alfred Hitchcock would use visuals to portray sex, like the bag that looks like a female sex organ in 1964's Marnie or the scene near the end in 1959's North by Northwest of a train going into a tunnel. He would be crafty to show enough visuals so the audience could guest what was going on. In here, Brian De Palma just exposed things as what they are shown. I wouldn't say the movie is paying tribute to Hitchcock, but very predictable obvious duplicate Hitchcock's classics 1958's Vertigo and 1954'w Rear Window ideas to the grotesque extreme. Jake Sully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who keeps losing jobs because of his claustrophobia. To make matters worse, the Bill Mahr lookalike discovers he been kick out of the house by his girlfriend, so he has no place to sleep. His pal offers him the use of his apartment for the evening. The apartment happens to be equipped with a huge picture window and telescope, enabling him to spy on his beautiful neighbor Gloria (Deborah Shelton) while she undresses. He soon realizes that the woman is in grave danger, and begins to track her every move, with the hope of coming to her aid, but find Holly Body (Melanie Griffith), instead. Who is Holly Body and what does she has to do with Gloria? No doubt what happens in the ""twist ending"" if you're a fan of Alfred Hitchcock's work. It's so obvious, it's sad. The acting is absolutely atrocious. Craig Wasson is so unremittingly wooden, that it hurts to hear him speak. No wonder why he can't find work in the movie. There is a crucial scene there where Jake is told ""You must act!"", so not only is he a horrible actor in the movie. The actor playing Jake is an awful actor in real life, too. It doesn't help that the dialogue sounds like a really bad porno dialogue. The movie hasn't aged well in my opinion. It's the worst of 1980's right here. Very bad haircuts, terrible clothing, ugly girls doing pornos and awful new wave music. At one point in the film, we see a ""film within a film,"" with Frankie Goes to Hollywood performing the song ""Relax"" on the set of a porn film, in which porn stars arrived. It has nothing to do with the movie, and it's eats too much of the already long film screen time. I don't find Melanie Griffith hot in this movie. She look like a naked Billy Idol mixed with a Dutch boy. The film doesn't even take off until about an hour in. No suspense at all, but Peeping Tom voyeurism. It's hard to take this movie as a thriller, as the first shot in the movie is Jake Sully dress up as a horrible Twisted Sister Dracula in some kind of B-film horror mess. This film suffers from its sleazy tone. All the characters are unlikeable. Jake Sully is truly a stalker, he steals discarded underwear, and doesn't call the police immediately when he unmistakably sees somebody being murdered. I kinda wish we had 2009's Avatar Jake Sully in this, instead. Some people think the movie is a dreamlike state of Jake Sully due to abrupt ending and tricky shifting in realities. In my opinion, it's just reality. It was just flashbacks. The Editing is very poor as continuities is pretty much non-existent. I know the movie has a lot of faults, but here are some things I do like. I do like the make-up disguise even if it doesn't make sense. I really couldn't tell the different between the two characters that end up being the same killer. Still, a makeup job like that, wouldn't just take a few minutes to put on. The ""drill sequence"" remind me of 1983's Scarface. It's disturbing and not necessary need in the film. Plus that scene got mentioned in the book American Psycho, where the main character rents the movie 17 time just for that scene. I'm serious. If you feel the need to watch this scene repeatedly you should talk to a psychiatrist. I do like the cameos, they had in the film such as Slavitza Jovan, who appeared as Gozer the Gozerian in Ghostbusters the same year, briefly appears as a saleslady. Prolific voice actor Rob Paulsen, known for voicing Raphael of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pinky of Pinky and the Brain, also makes a rare live action performance. The phony backgrounds might be a throwback to the 1950's film noir, but the way they shot at real L.A famous locations was pretty amazing. Overall: Brian De Palma took Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear window"" and turn them into a dumb porno flick. Associating violence with eroticism is not only disturbing, but downright unpleasant to watch for any normal viewer. I don't find it too disturbing, but rather stupid. Any normal person would think the same as I do, and rarely watch the film.",Body Double

Here, he takes on two of the master's best, ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo."" Hitchcock must be turning over in his grave. Unfortunately, other than incorporating elements of the two films (Wasson suffers from claustrophobia instead of vertigo), De Palma has no idea where he's going with this. The script is laughably bad and the characters are all cartoon-like idiots. Since most viewers are not idiots, they will be able to guess the outcome about ten minutes into the movie.

40,TheMovieDiorama,Body Double infiltrates the vehemence of adult entertainment through inspired Hitchcockian thrills.,7,9 November 2019,"De Palma was at the height of his success during the eighties. Implementing his technical flourishes within sub-genres that we're not necessarily accessible for the average audience member. Erotic thrillers, whilst some may describe as distasteful and misogynistic, accentuated sexualisation to further enhance the lust of man. Body Double is no different. Much like the pornographic industry that is portrayed, it certainly has a sub-par screenplay that persuades you to fast-forward to the ""act"" in question, yet manages to lure you into the sleazy allurement of De Palma's technically adept direction.After waltzing in on his partner cheating on him, a novice actor is recruited by a friend to house-sit a luxury abode, conveniently positioned adjacently to another property hosting a sumptuous succubus of temptation. Naturally, downbeat and fuelled by anger, he resorts to peeping and spying as she provocatively dances in front of the window before proceeding to creepily follow her the next day.As the main man himself stated, this is inspired by Hitchcock's two greatest thrillers: 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo'. The added eroticism granting De Palma's feature a differing (if unpleasantly salty...) flavour that uniquely defines its narrative qualities. Initially, the first act kicked off with a mundane imitation of Hitchcock's aforementioned 'Rear Window', opening itself up to comparative criticisms. The introductory setup, outlining Wasson's Jake Scully as a claustrophobic unconfident mess, sent the plot down a one-way route that, upon first thought, had minimal opportunities for a U-turn. The convenience of the telescope as Scully unashamedly invades the privacy of his new temporary neighbour and his dreadful tailing techniques complementing his mediocre onscreen acting portrayals, sent my own thoughts down the predictable avenue. Was Scully a perverted mess, or was he being set up? I thought I knew. But then De Palma trapped me.Through ornate neo-noir aesthetics and a vapid insight into the world of adult entertainment, he precariously planted a sufficient amount of false breadcrumbs to force me to second guess myself. And that I did. The mystery slowly unraveling, accompanied by a smooth monosyllabic score and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's legendary gay anthem ""Relax"", unlocking the intentions of all characters involved. Heightening the glossy lifestyle of adult performers, De Palma's directorial flair, mostly consisting of extended takes and distant shots, invited audiences into a tainted environment plagued by primitive regression. Tantalising voyeurism and dangerous obsession. Even hints of Argento's influence of the giallo sub-genre.Various techniques, especially the continuous panoramic 360 revolving as Wasson and Shelton questionably embraced each other, resembled dated homages that failed to match the noir aesthetics that De Palma meticulously crafted. The conclusive ten minutes unfortunately unwrapped certain revelations in an underwhelming manner, by having the story abruptly cut with no substantial resolution. This left myself viewing the proceeding credits montage with an overbearing feeling of unsatisfactory bewilderment.Undoubtedly, Body Double is rough around the edges. Occasionally bypassing substantial development for evocative voyeuristic tendencies. But that does not deter from De Palma's intrinsic cinematic approach, where the night life of Hollywood truly becomes illuminated.",Body Double
41,videorama-759-859391,Two hot bodies moving as one in sleazy 85 outing,6,26 February 2014,"What I love about this movie, besides not being able to overcome it's sleaze factor, which was unavoidable, is how it's story follows through in an unhurried style. It has Wasson who does well as a budding, awkward actor, trying to find whoever's responsible for brutally murdering a beautiful woman, who ply a Makita drill into her, while Wasson was watching with gaping, hungry eyes. Wasson is leant this other actor's (slick slimy Gregg Henry, again great) pad, actually a tower that looks like something out of The Jetsons. You've got to see the plush inside too. Large revolving bed, pop out t.v, plants, and a telescope that affords a beautiful expansive view, and a plus, that hot woman (Dallas's' Deborah Shelton) doing a little strip, not for Wasson's benefit, who Wasson becomes obsessed with. The lengthy, suspense part scenes that have him following her are indeed tense in bits, one scene in that tunnel, after her bag is snatched has claustrophobic Wasson kissing her, which is done in a 360 shot I loved. I just didn't buy that bit, as 1- She really she didn't really know him and 2- How could someone as beautiful as her go for someone like him. The actor scenes I could relate with, as at the auditions, actors have been there and done that, some so up themselves, whatever, that tutor giving Wasson that humiliating exercising, with Wasson failing dismally. Guy Boyd as the hardened detective is great, giving the film just what it needs, and the one scene with great actress Barbara Crampton (used as eye candy back in the eighties) who Wasson finds screwing another guy, was another erotic bit. Even though it's a psychological thriller, Body Double still runs high on sleaze, but it augments the appeal of this guilty pleasure of a movie. The lead up is great, if breathtakingly tense. Of course, remember, we're dealing with De Palma here. Even over the end credits, the film doesn't let us forget the sleaze if it's left in it's wake. The movie has a number of camera tricks or surprises, like a misleading backdrop at the start. Melanie Griffith as the porn actress who's used as a decoy in the brutal murder is very good. But in the end, it's the quota of sleaze that brings it down, passing it off as another, ""get your rocks off"" adult flick. But still for every movie buff, it's one you must see.",Body Double
42,subxerogravity,One of my favorite De Plama movies before I even knew it was a De Plama movie.,7,3 September 2016,"And now watching it fully realizing it's a De Plama movie, I can see what a huge fan of Hitchcock De Plama is, which makes it so much cooler.This movie feels like Vertigo, Strangers in a Train, Rear Window, all combine.Craig Wesson was a perfect leading man in this, playing a young actor trying to get out of his shell, but it's funny, every time I see Wesson I keep thinking Bill Maher (He was the guy in Amazon Women on the Moon). He plays Jake Scully doing a B-Vampire movie, Vampire's Kiss, who's Claustrophobia effects shooting. He comes home and finds his lady in bed with another man (Following a long beautiful tracking scene down the hallway, which everyone could see coming, except Jake, in turn making it sadder). His life is on a downward spiral, until he meets a fellow struggling actor who cuts him a break allowing him to house sit, it's here where he begins spying on his next store neighbor that gets him tied up in a mystery, when someone else has taking interest in her It has some great visuals that you would expect from a De Plama picture, but more than anything it's a great homage to Alfred Hitchcock, just combining some of his best films into one. Makes me wonder what the fat man would have thought of the movie if he was alive to see it. If De Plama were not already so skilled at his craft, with great acknowledgment of that skill, this movie could have been shunned for ripping off Hitchcock (Although when done right Hitchcock is definitely the guy to rip off). De Plama's style seems to shine more in the violence in the film, which he shows far more than Hitchcock.Plus I love movies about Hollywood. Taking place at the end of the Golden Age of Porn, it was cool looking at how the industry worked when porn was more of a movie industry.Body Double has always been a movie worth watching, whenever I caught it, but now its even better knowing it's a Brian De Plama (channeling Hitchcock) film.http://cinemagardens.com",Body Double

I rather wish I hadn't. The film is a bit of a mess. It surprises me that the film seems to have quite a good reputation. I don't know what people saw in it.The film centres around a struggling actor 'Jake'. I kept thinking to myself, who would ever put this guy in a movie? Ironically I was asking that as he was starring in a legitimate movie. But he just wasn't a very enjoyable leading man at all. It probably didn't help that the entire first half of the film was basically just him awkwardly and creepily following a woman around and then eventually kissing her when she discovered him (possibly the most unearned kiss in cinematic history).About an hour in something finally happens that makes the film a little more interesting. It finally had me wanting to know what was going to happen next. But then that was only leading up to one of the sloppiest film finales I've ever seen. I won't go into spoilers but the last ten minutes of this film have to be seen to be believed in terms of how bad they were.The only positives I can really highlight are that small window of about 30 minutes an hour into the film that I mildly enjoyed, and also the look of the villain and the way the one kill scene was done. Otherwise though this was a complete misfire. Not one I'd recommend. Also, what on earth was that end credit sequence? A baffling way to end a film.",Body Double
44,ebiros2,A Classic by Director Brian De Palma,7,7 January 2013,"I can't believe that critics panned this movie when it came out. I have to give director Brian De Palma for his eyes for beauty, and crisp cinematography. Jake (Craig Wilson) is s struggling actor with claustrophobia. One day he gets invited to house sit a house that belongs to a guy named Sam (Gregg Henry) who he met while looking for a place to live. Across the street on his Hollywood hills home, is a woman who dances away each night in a skimpy attire. Not knowing that he's being set up to be a witness, he watches her with a telescope each night.Holly (Malany Griffith) supposedly is Gloria (Deborah Shelton)'s body double in this movie, but what's not clear is where was Gloria when Holly was dancing away in her room each night. Ex miss USA Deborah Shelton looks gorgeous in this movie.Body double's idea might have originated from the movie ""Flash Dance"" where the word became famous due to Jennifer Beals using a body double to do the dancing scenes. Beautifully shot around some of the most luscious places in Southern California, the movie is a eye candy to watch. If the plot was better fleshed out it would have been even better.One of the Hollywood classic that deserves a watch by all cult classic fans.",Body Double
45,MBunge,It's half wannabe Hitchcock and half brain injury,3,31 August 2010,"There was a time when it looked like Brian De Palma was going to be a very big deal as a filmmaker. Body Double largely put an end to that notion and deservedly so. Not only does this movie demonstrate that De Palma has nothing to offer as a storyteller other than a modern imitation of the classic style of Alfred Hitchcock, but some of the scenes are likely the worst things ever filmed by a director whose name people would recognize.Roughly the first half of Body Double is De Palma's effort to weld Vertigo and Rear Window together. Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a semi-struggling actor with claustrophobia who discovers his girlfriend is cheating on him. Since they live together at her apartment, Jake needs a new place to stay and after bunking one night with a friendly bartender, Jake seemingly lucks into a great accommodation. He meets another actor named Sam (Gregg Henry) who is going out of town for a few days. Sam asks Jake to take over a house sitting job, so Jake finds himself living in a multi-million dollar, UFO-looking house in the Hollywood hills with all the luxury you could want. Sam also points out the house across the way, where a beautiful woman strips and pleasures herself every night with the windows wide open. Jake can barely tear himself away from the view. But then Jake sees an ugly workman also peeping at the woman, and then he sees the ugly guy follow her the next day. So Jake also follows her and the movie turns into a stalker's wet dream, where Jake spies on the woman (Deborah Shelton), saves her from the ugly workman and then gets to kiss her and feel her up on the beach.Up to that point, Body Double is pretty creepy because it treats a peeping tom like a hero, but it's not that bad a film. The second half of the movie, however, is almost entirely without merit and features moments so staggeringly stupid and ill conceived, your jaw will drop open with such force it may dislocate from your skull. Jake sees the ugly workman in the house across the way start to kill the beautiful woman. As the woman and her assailant engage in a struggle where almost every horror movie cliché ever invented comes into play, Jake runs over to try and save the object of his voyeurism. He doesn't make it in time, she dies and when the cops show up, the movie realizes for 5 minutes that Jake is a pervert and not a hero. Then, while Jake is watching what I guess is the porno version of 60 Minutes, he sees a commercial for an X-rated movie. The star of the production, Holly Body (Melanie Griffith), does a seductive dance and masturbation scene that is exactly what Jake saw in the window in the house across the way. This makes Jake think there may be something more going on. But does he call the cops? No. Does he go down to the porno company and just ask if he can talk to Holly? No. He concocts an elaborate scheme where he gets a job as a porn actor, has sex with Holly Body on film and pretends to be an oily, wannabe porn producer who wants to make a movie with Holly. Then the ugly workman shows back up, kidnaps Holly and Jake has to save her. That leads to a ""shocking twist"" in the story, but it you don't see this twist coming at least 50 minutes before it happensyou are a half wit.If I didn't know better, I'd say that De Palma had a stroke in the middle of making Body Double. The first half is a cheap imitation of Hitchcock, but it's at least competently pulled off. The second half isn't just bad, it's sub-amateurish. It's not just about porn, it's like it was made by a porno filmmaker.I know many folks complained about the content of this movie when it first came out, and its disturbing embrace of the stalker mindset is even more disgusting by modern standards. But what's truly objectionable about Body Double is how bad the storytelling is. I've made videos with my friends from high school that were more professionally plotted than this thing, the mystery couldn't fool a 6 year old and even the nudity isn't particularly appealing. Melanie Griffith gets naked but instead of being aroused, you'll be concerned she's not eating enough.I will say this - Body Double is exactly the sort of film you can have a lot of fun MST3King with your friends. Outside of doing that, it's the sort of movie you walk out on in the theater and not just stop the DVD at home, but break it in half and shove it down your garbage disposal.",Body Double

Thinking she's in danger, he follows her around, to try to warn her. This film lost me with a first-half plot that was numbingly flat and pedestrian. With telescope aimed at the young woman, Jake mimics James Stewart's odious behavior as a peeping tom in ""Rear Window"". Though there may have been some tension and suspense in Hitchcock's plot, there isn't here, as Director De Palma's rip-off lacks thematic substance.The boring first half is aggravated by the casting of Craig Wasson, an actor who comes across as Hollywood's ""every man"": dull, weak, homely, and nondescript. In some scenes he so overacts that it's almost humorous to watch him stretch his facial expressions.The second-half plot devolves into silliness, with a tawdry 1970s version of disco-porno that is out of sync with plot points that went before it. Later segments become increasingly outrageous. And the ending is almost comical in an unintended way. The villain is blatantly obvious from the get-go, owing to poor casting, first-half plot points, and to the film's opening credits.Adequate cinematography and production design can't save this turkey. Even the background score is awful, because it is so dreadfully manipulative. It telegraphs how the viewer is supposed to feel, a function of cinematic music that mostly died out in the 1950s.""Body Double"" is intended to be an erotic thriller. But a stupid story premise, a script that is full of plot holes, an incoherent second half, an unlikable protagonist, together with bad casting combine to reposition this film into the vexation genre, but rescued from filmdom's dregs by fine cinematography. I can't imagine that this script would ever be approved for production, unless the writer was a powerful Hollywood insider with a famous name, an insider who could pull the studio's strings ...

It's not rare or hard-to-find, but seems to slip under many film-fans radar. DePalma is a gifted director who's done several very good films, this one being near the very top of my list. Anyway...BODY DOUBLE is a psycho-sexual murder mystery/thriller dealing with subjects such as murder, voyeurism, claustrophobia - plus it has a cool Indian-killer guy! Plenty of twists and turns in the plot, without becoming too disjointed or self-indulgent. A fun, strange film that I try to re-visit every couple of months.

49,slokes,Hitchcock Meets MTV,8,28 February 2014,"""Body Double"" shouldn't work. Its plot is ropey, its filmic influences obvious, its lead actor a total blank in terms of industry profile. Yet not despite but because of these things, as well as director Brian De Palma working at his visual apex, ""Body Double"" sneaks up on you to become an inventive, highly rewatchable comedy suspense film.Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is having a bad day. In one afternoon, the struggling actor loses his job, his residence, and his girlfriend. But fortunes change in Hollywood. A new friend sets him up in a mushroom-shaped manor with a panoramic view of Los Angeles and a telescope aimed at the bedroom window of a beautiful woman who struts about in the near- nude. Jake, inherently weak, can't help but look, an unhealthy obsession that may cost him his life.""Body Double"" is remembered today mainly for the breakout performance of Melanie Griffith, who plays porn actress Holly Body with a lot of skin and brio. It's also one of De Palma's most obvious nods at the films of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window,"" whose plots get almost conflated here.All this might seem a bad idea; imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery yet on its own it can't help but feel like a weak artistic premise. But De Palma's interest in Hitchcock extends beyond specific cues and references. ""Body Double,"" like ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo,"" works as an exercise in pure cinema, playing the viewer the same way Hitchcock did, as a kind of partner in voyeurism with the down-on-his-heel protagonist.Wasson doesn't leave a big impression in this movie, and he didn't have a big career after, but he proves the right man for this part. He's a nice guy too used to being stepped on, easy meat for the less angelic denizens of the City of Angels. Asked if he is working, he can only mutter: ""I was in an episode of 'Hart To Hart' that was pretty good."" (Wasson actually was on that series before taking this part.) His pain is our pain too for the duration of the movie, something Wasson milks rather well in his low-key way. When he is caught with the panties of the woman he pursues, it's like we the viewer are caught as well. It wasn't our idea, but in a way we did go along with it, watching in guilty silence as it were.The plot, particularly as it relates to the web Jake finds himself in, relies too much on coincidences and sudden character changes. I would say this is a bad thing, except it works so well in drawing you into the movie, actually playing like a layer of meta-comedy on top of the overdose of filmic fantasy. Can things get even weirder than Jake getting a starring role in a porno film? Well, now imagine that film transforming itself into a Frankie Goes To Hollywood video.This is a very '80s film, with its pastels and glitz backgrounds, Griffith's bleached punk hairdo, and a cordless phone with long antenna that Jake pushes down whenever he hangs up. It carries much the same vibe of that cultural touchstone, ""Miami Vice,"" though ""Body Double"" actually reached screens a month after that show hit TV, so unlike Hitchcock, no imitation was intended.Funny bits abound, too, sending up La-La Land in a genial but sharp way. Jake has the news of his firing broken to him by his agent, who knows the score because he also manages Jake's replacement. An acting class is an exercise in psychological masochism where an oval neon sign proclaims ""Actors Advance,"" though that sentiment is reduced by the other neon words ""Pay In"" stuck in the sign's center. Dennis Franz has much fun here as a caustic director of Grade-D horror cheapos, which is De Palma's way of sending himself up along with everything else. Griffith gets off many of the best lines, though most aren't repeatable here.De Palma at his worst can be pretty bad, but he's a director of finesse and polish who thrives on projects that allow him to toy with viewer perspectives. Here we get one of the more enjoyably goofy examples of that, a genre-twisting time capsule that still feels very fresh.",Body Double
50,fertilecelluloid,"Audacious, sleazy, insanely inventive thriller",9,17 February 2006,"It's amazing what Brian De Palma managed to get away with in the 80's. This audacious thriller, which launches itself off ""Vertigo"", is insanely inventive, incredibly well shot (by Stephen Burum, who also photographed ""Rumble Fish""), beautifully scored (by Pino Donaggio) and very well acted by Craig Wasson, Greg Henry, Melanie Griffith, Dennis Franz and Al Israel. The sleazy plot, which is a superb excuse to showcase eye-popping eroticism, lurid violence and surreal hallucinations, is predictable but such fun to watch unravel. Borrowing bits from ""Rear Window"", ""Vertigo"" and his own ""Dressed To Kill"", the film becomes a heady amalgam of virtuoso cinematic tricks and ridiculously complex plotting. Despite there being a shining roster of great, twisted characters such as Greg Henry's ""Sam"", the stand-out character for me is The Indian, a frightening, rubber-faced, snarling symbol of fear and intimidation who is also a filthy pervert who gets his jollies watching women undress. The shot of him working on the satellite dish towards the third act of the movie is one of cinema's finest. De Palma has such an interesting way of conveying information and he clearly relishes the possibilities of the medium. The film did not do good business at the box office and was subjected to the wrath of ugly, fat feminists during its theatrical release, but while those old heifers have aged and fattened, De Palma's ""Body Double"" has achieved cult status and retained its brilliance. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to single out the gorgeous Deborah Shelton for her terrific contribution to this film's aesthetic success. The impossibly delicious object of many a pervert's misguided affections delivered one of exploitation cinema's hottest performances by simply being Deborah and taking a phallic drill bit between her legs like few have before her. God bless Ms. Shelton and receive her into paradise.",Body Double
51,Samiam3,A good film to sample de Palma from,7,3 September 2010,"Body Double owes more than its share to Hitchcock's two greatest (Rear Window and Vertigo) but Brian de Palma offers the viewer something which is suspenseful and intriguing enough that frankly, I don't care that the story is derivative. Despite a certain lack of credibility, Body Double works fine as a thriller. It is a step up from the previous two; Dressed to Kill and Blow out, and it is a good film to sample de Palma from.In this tale of voyeurism, Jake Sculley; a b-movie actor, has just left his wife (having caught her with another man). He goes looking for a place to stay, and by pure coincidence, a friend asks him to house sit his place while he goes out of town. It is a very nice place, with a jacuzzi, a bar, a rotating bed, but best of all, it overlooks the neighbours house, and the neighbour likes to do a little striptease in the window every night. Jake watches her through a telescope, growing ever more interested, until one day he decides to follow her, only to discover that he may not be her only stalker. She could be in trouble, and little does he know that he himself could be in trouble. Brian de Palma has a great eye for this stuff. His camera work is impressive and he uses the right kinds of shots in all the right places. This one has a lot of wide shot imagery. De Palma likes to play with sense of space. He knows how to keep the viewer hooked, assuming that the viewer keeps an open mind, and he also ensures that we stay for the credits by choosing to run them over the last scene. As is one of De Palma's trade marks, he gives you two items to watch on screen.I enjoyed Body Double for what it is. It's not very original, but then again from a 21st century perspective, it is in a way kind of distinctive. Hitchcockian thrillers, are few and far between these days. Most Hollywood thrillers are now generic, twist-a-minute, over adrenaline types. If you want something a bit more old fashioned, Body Double might work.",Body Double
52,Galina_movie_fan,"Brian DePalma: ""People hate me or love me.""",8,11 July 2007,"I am a Brian DePalma's fan. I love his style, his visual uniqueness, his ability to grab me from the very opening of his films and not let me take my eyes off the screen until the very last moment and even after that keep me a captive of his dangerous yet seductive worlds. I liked a lot every De Palma's film I've seen: The Black Dahlia (2006), Femme Fatale (2002), Snake Eyes (1998), Mission: Impossible (1996), Carlito's Way (1993), The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Casualties of War (1989), The Untouchables (1987), Scarface (1983), Dressed to Kill (1980), and Carrie (1976).As with all his films, you either love ""Body Double"" and let its typical De Palma's over-the-top charm, his mesmerizing beautiful camera movements, his 20 minutes long, dialog-free pursuit sequence, his intense interest in exploration of sexual ""dysfunction,"" his constantly present obsession with voyeurism, his satire on making cheap horror and adult movies, and his loving yet humorous homage to several Alfred Hitchcock's films overwhelm you or you just dismiss it scornfully for its most impossible and unbelievable story, for the plentiful coincidences and the holes in the plot, for the excessive violence, and for its sensationalism and exploitation. I found ""Body Double"" shocking, poignant, satirical, often hilarious, and always highly entertaining. Once again, De Palma did not disappoint me. I figured from the beginning where the story of a struggling B-movie actor (Craig Wasson) with many problems (claustrophobia that cost him a part in a horror movie, break-up with a cheating girlfriend, witnessing a gruesome murder and becoming a possible suspect) would lead. It did not stop me from enjoying the film and admiring De Palma's ability to trick me not just once but many times by making me see what he only wanted me to see, yet never hiding the whole picture and using to perfection his magic camera that ""lies all the time; lies 24 times/second"". I believe that De Palma himself has provided the keys to better understanding and enjoying his films when he said, ""My films deal with a stylized, expressionistic world that has a kind of grotesque beauty about it."" All we have to do - to recognize the beauty behind the grotesque.P.S. Melanie Griffith gave her best performance and stole all her scenes as a hot blond smart porn star with ""a head for business and a bod for sin"" who might help Jack to solve the mystery of the brutal murder he had witnessed.P.P.S. After I finished watching ""Body Double"", I added to my rental list ""Blow Out"" (1981) and ""Sisters"" (1973). Exploration of De Palma's worlds continues.",Body Double
53,raulfaust,What?,4,26 December 2012,"An unemployed actor finds a house to stay in after his divorce. Nothing too exceptional until this point-- except on how easy he got that. As the movie goes, we surely expect that it will occasionally deliver a strong twist, giving a sense to all the weirdo things that have been happening all along. However, after scenes and scenes with lack of sense, when we think it's finally revealing it's big twist, we have a surprise-- there is NO twist at all! In the end, we don't know if it's all a (bad) dream or if those things really happened-- which I hardly doubt, given that who wants to kill somebody, goes there and kills, no point in finding an useless witness as such. Also, there are plenty of unnecessary scenes that seem to be made only to show director's skill-- and hide the lack of a plausible plot.

54,PredragReviews,Double Trouble!,8,7 May 2016,"Body Double shows the ugly, moral tawdriness of the bottom rungs of the Los Angeles acting scene. When we first meet Jake he's in danger of being fired from Z-grade horror film. De Palma has crafted a beautifully structured thriller with a mystery that we piece together along with Jake. The story is suspenseful, mysterious, touches on Vampire and porn film-making, and conveniently provides sex as the substitute for drama. Controversial movies like this always result in a lot of contradictory feedbacks.The plot revolves around a failing actor (who could use some serious couch time, if you know what I mean), who becomes obsessed with ""the girl next door"" - a sexy neighbor whose 'jones' for late-night dancing in the ""all-together"" and abhorrence for window blinds makes house-sitting worth the lousy pay. And as we've seen in dozens of erotic thrillers, someone dies, someone is accused, and our hero must save the girl and get the bad guy. Nice twists along the way keep this one very intriguing. A spectacularly hot, 28 year old Melanie Griffith, who about steals the movie and registers a ""'10' on the peter meter"" whenever she's on-screen. Sure, there are elements of real, American ""cheese"" here; leaps in logic (the plot tenuously hinges on a couple ""convenient"" things happening at just the right time) and an overall ""over-the-top"" feel will turn some viewers off and have them scrambling for the remote. But Body Double is truly one of those late night cable classics that many have duplicated, but few have surpassed. It has just enough art, just enough schlock and just enough brains to keep your attention - and did I mention Melanie Griffith? Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Body Double
55,philip_vanderveken,A waste of De Palma's talent,5,11 January 2005,"Brian De Palma is a very good director (think of movies like Carlito's Way, Scarface, Carrie, The Untouchables ...), but sometimes the man really makes me doubt about his talents. Body Double is one of those movie that really make me wonder what De Palma was thinking when making it.Even though I've seen movies that are a lot worse, there is really nothing special about this one. It's about an unemployed actor who's in desperate need of a place to stay since he has caught his girlfriend with another man in his bed. Pure by coincidence he meets a fellow actor who needs a house sitter. The man offers him a free stay in a marvelous house, all he has to do for it is to give some water to the plants at regular times. As a bonus to the house he also gets a free peepshow/strip act from one of his neighbors. Every night she does some kind of strip act in her bedroom, only for herself, but with her window open, not knowing that someone else is watching her. A few nights in a row he enjoys the show and gets completely obsessed by her. He follows her and finally meets her. But than a few days later he witnesses how she is being robbed and murdered in her own house. The police doesn't believe him just like that and he goes after the murderer and the truth all by himself.The story isn't the worst part of the movie, it's the way how everything is portrayed that makes this movie mediocre. I'm convinced that De Palma has a lot of talent, but I'm afraid he made the wrong choice by filming this movie. There isn't much that will help me remembering this movie in a few days time and that is too bad. Watch this movie only when you haven't much better to do or when you are an absolute fan of De Palma's work. I give it a 5.5/10.",Body Double

57,punishmentpark,Off the deep end...,8,12 February 2016,"Brian De Palma really goes off the deep end here; the scene with Frankie Goes To Hollywood is the one that illustrates this best. It's like a music video within a film, like the film seems to be a statement within a dirty confession, or possibly a comment on De Palma's working with Hitchcock, or maybe... I'm really not sure. Then there's porn, exhibitionism, agoraphobia, voyeurism... the list seems endless. God bless De Palma, if only for trying.Craig Wasson's acting is terrible, though. I've tried thinking up why or how (t)his sort of amateurism would fit in some way, but I end up pretty much blank (he's been working before and since a lot, so maybe I should check out some more work he did). And yet, somehow, it's also as if there's no one else that could have done a better job... if you understand what I'm talking about, please explain it to me.By the way, (Melanie) Griffith, (Dennis) Franz and (Gregg) Henry do terrific jobs in this B-film piece of art.

58,capkronos,Entertainingly trashy Hitchcock ripoff.,6,20 May 2003,"Brian De Palma hit the mark with DRESSED TO KILL (1980), a contemporary take on PSYCHO, but is less successful with this Hitchcock copy, which steals most of it's ideas from REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO.Craig Wasson stars as a claustrophobic actor who's fired from a vampire film, catches his wife (Barbara Crampton) cheating on him and ends up housesitting for a guy he doesn't even know (Gregg Henry). There he witnesses his beautiful neighbor (former Miss USA Deborah Shelton)getting power-drilled by a creepy, facially-scarred Indian, and ends up in the middle of a complex murder plot, which also leads him into the adult film underworld!The plotting stretches credibility to the limit, Wasson's idiotic and gullible character elicits no sympathy and the ending is terrible, but some of the porn scenes are well done (and funny!) and Melanie Griffith is great as porn star Holly Body, who is unknowingly tied into the murder. One whole scene is a music video for ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Real-life porn stars Annette Haven, Linda Shaw and Susanna Britton (as Barbara Peckinpaugh) are supposed to be in here, too, and Brinke Stevens can be spotted in footage from ""Holly Does Hollywood.""",Body Double
59,seymourblack-1,"If Something's Worth Doing, It's Worth Overdoing",8,29 January 2011,"Brian De Palma's ""Body Double"" is an extremely entertaining thriller which reflects the decade in which it was released by being full of excess and completely over the top. The 1980s was a time when it was often said that ""if something's worth doing, it's worth overdoing"" and on the evidence of this movie, De Palma was clearly on message. The plot contains numerous enjoyable twists and involves murder, voyeurism and duplicity. It also, however, tests the boundaries of good taste in the passages where it becomes particularly lurid and prurient.Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a claustrophobic actor who loses his job on a vampire movie because of his affliction and then returns home to find his unfaithful girlfriend in flagrante delicto. This leaves him without a roof over his head, but not for long, because soon another actor offers him a house-sitting job. His friend also helpfully points out an apartment close by where a beautiful woman performs a striptease routine in front of her window every night at the same time. Jake watches the nightly performances by Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton) and after he witnesses her murder, becomes a suspect.Jake soon realises that he's been set up and his attempts to find the real perpetrator bring him into contact with a porn star called Holly Body (Melanie Griffith) who has the information he needs to confirm the killer's identity.Brian De Palma is an exceptional talent who creates great visual moments and skilfully constructs long sequences without dialogue which brilliantly generate atmosphere whilst also moving the story forward. His frequent use of Hitchcockian influences is well recognised and ""Body Double"" is no exception. The plot has elements which are reminiscent of ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"" and also to a lesser extent ""Psycho"". The presence of doubles, disguises, women in danger, confused identities, black humour and a significant amount of audience manipulation are also additional influences from the same source. Hitchcock's fear of being buried alive inspires a couple of scenes and the inclusion of Melanie Griffith in the cast is an additional link to the great director as she is the daughter of one of Hitchcock's leading ladies (Tippi Hedren).Criag Wasson is good as the confused and creepy Scully and Deborah Shelton has a remoteness which fits in well with the dreaminess of some of her scenes. Melanie Griffith is also bubbly and amusing in the movie's strongest performance as she successfully brings to life the full range of Holly's qualities.",Body Double

61,hnt_dnl,"Flawed, yet entertaining,""Hitchcock"" copycat",7,29 March 2011,"BODY DOUBLE (1984) was Brian DePalma's last venture into ""Hitchcock"" territory before moving back into more mainstream films. Definitely an interesting flick with some good things going for it, somehow it misses it's mark, yet I still find it very enjoyable! Telling the story of struggling actor Jake Scully (very well performed by Craig Wasson, in essentially his only major film role). Wasson is quite good in the role of the can't-catch-a-break, eternal loser who lets EVERYONE walk over him! Wasson's smallish stature gives the film an authentic air and his character is a real everyman, as he isn't some good-looking Hollywood pretty boy putting on an act 'playing' the geek; he actually is one! And he quite credibly makes Jake a more confident, assertive character as the film progresses. I like how Jake essentially ""plays a role"" in order to solve the crime, taking on untapped characteristics in himself, thus making him become more confident in himself by film's end.The film has all the elements of several of Hitchcock's most famous films, most noticeably ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"": voyeurism, obsession, repressed sexual feelings, mystery, murder. While Hitchcock used blondes, interestingly, the 'femme fatale' in this film is the brunette character Gloria Revelle (played by former Miss America, hot 80s model, and future ""Dallas"" babe Deborah Shelton). Shelton is absolutely gorgeous in this, the way I wish more women nowadays looked! It was smart of DePalma to keep Shelton's character mysterious and mostly non-verbal, which made her even more alluring and sensual; but Shelton is badly dubbed by another actress in her ""speaking"" parts! Not even knowing how Shelton sounds in real life, you can totally tell that is not her speaking those words! I think it was to give Shelton a more 'mature' sounding voice, but it doesn't work for me.The other major female role is played in wonderful, scene-stealing fashion by Melanie Griffith (as the aptly named adult film star Holly Body!). Griffith is so naturally good and convincing in the role, not some caricature of what Hollywood THINKS an adult film star acts like! She could have easily fallen into the trap of playing the ditzy, clueless blonde bimbo, but Griffith rises above that delivering one of her best film performances. The other character that left a big impression with me is the cop investigating the big crime in the flick, played very convincingly by the underused Guy Boyd. The scene where Boyd interrogates Wasson's character after the murder is probably my favorite of the film. Rounding out the main cast are Gregg Henry (as Jake's acting friend Sam) and oft-used DePalma actor Dennis Franz (in an appropriately sleazy role as a director of cheap horror flicks!). I much prefer Franz's work in this film over any of his other DePalma roles in the early 80s. Franz seems more natural here.The main problem with BODY DOUBLE is that the plot itself is totally predictable and it's not hard for the viewer to see it coming from a mile away! It's just too obvious who the REAL killer is! Also, the film feels a little short and is missing some more character detail. I think it's the 80s syndrome where potentially great films fell into the trap of the 80s trend of catering to pop culture and nice, tidy movie endings.That said, it's still a very interesting exercise from DePalma with some good characterizations and interesting scenes, including a hot makeout scene at the beach between 2 sexually repressed characters and a funny music video while Jake is 'undercover' investigating the murder. Not the best thriller ever made, but surely an entertaining one!",Body Double
62,Andy-296,Trash masterpiece by De Palma,8,3 February 2008,"A trash gem from Brian De Palma. Here, Rear Window meets Vertigo in the porn subculture of the 1980s Southern California. Jake, a bit actor in B films (played engagingly by Craig Wasson) finds his girlfriend sleeping with another guy and has to move from his home. A fellow actor needs someone (or so he says) to take care of his house while he is away on a trip, and Jakes agree to do the job. Before leaving, he shows him his favorite neighbor, a beautiful and sculptural woman who strips with her window open each night. Jake spies her with the house's telescope every night, becoming obsessed. He meets her once in the beach, and is able to help recover her purse from a thief, but is incapacitated by claustrophobia when the burglar runs through a tunnel. Eventually, Jake witnesses her brutal murder through the telescope by someone dressed as an Indian. But, if you've seen Vertigo (and know De Palma has been paying homage to Hitchcock in virtually all of his movies) you can imagine not everything (or everyone) is what is seems. Melanie Griffith is also great playing what could be described as the updated role Kim Novak played in Vertigo. Among the movie's odd touches: a musical interlude in a video form with 80s band Frankie Goes to Hollywood playing their hit single ""Relax"".",Body Double
63,gftbiloxi,Stylish But Silly,4,25 May 2005,"One part VERTIGO, one part REAR WINDOW, a splash of DIAL M FOR MURDER, a garnish of NORTH BY NORTHWEST. The resulting mixture is the 1984 film BODY DOUBLE, which is often described as an homage to legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. But in truth, the word 'homage' is scarcely applicable; writer-director Brian De Palma doesn't so much reference Hitchcock as he simply steals everything that isn't nailed down. The end result is a stylish but silly film that is much more interesting for the films it mimics than it is in and of itself.A down on his luck actor and neurotically claustrophobic actor, Jake Scully (Craig Wasson), who lucks into the cushy job of housesitter for a lavish Los Angeles bachelor pad complete with a round and rotating bed. It also comes with a view: just peek into the handy telescope and there she is, a beautiful woman who has the compulsive need to dance naked in front of open windows in a house not far away. Needless to say, Scully is fascinated by her--but he soon finds that he is not her only audience. She is being stalked by a gruesome-looking native American. Can he find a way to save her life, not to mention win her love? The cast ranges from adequate (Wasson) to intriguing (Deborah Shelton) to extremely good (Melanie Griffith in a star-making role), and De Palma demonstrates considerable wit and not a little style. But there is a basic problem here. Brian De Palma isn't Alfred Hitchcock, and his wholesale imitation of Hitchcock devices and themes is simply that: an imitation.There a fair amount of sex and more than a few dollops of sly comedy, and it is really here where De Palma endows the film with his own special brand of style. The rest, including one of the most ridiculously improbable murders ever to hit the screen, drowns in its own detail. Throughout his career De Palma made several notable suspense films that were inspired by Hitchcock, most particularly DRESSED TO KILL and BLOW OUT, but he was trying way too hard on this one.Gary F.

Watch me track the protagonist as he follows the girl around town ! Hear how my soundtrack composer uses only strings in key scenes ! ( just like Bernie Herrmann did in Psycho, only that was a black and white flick, where such an approach made sense). See how my lead guy watches other people ! (only through a telescope, not binoculars). The whole flick should have been released under the name, Hitchcock's Greatest Tricks. The only thing missing is Hitchcock's genius.

The difference is that Hitchcock's movie is a classic , while ""Body double"" is  Well, I don't know what . The movie is so idiotic and absurd that it makes you feel like the whole story is one big joke put on the audience.I knew from the beginning that the whole thing was a set up. It was just too obvious. Gregg Henry had written on his face that he's the bad guy . Not to mention that the idea of woman dancing erotic dance EVERY NIGHT AT THE SAME HOUR was too ridiculous to be real. Same goes for the whole husband in trench coat and big bad Indian.There are some incredibly cheap twists – our hero takes panties from the trash (for what ?) and later when the woman is murdered the cop finds them in his pocket , so naturally he thinks he got something to do with the crime. Or that main hero accidentally finds about Melanie Griffith.Don't forget the ridiculous kiss scene at the beach and the fact that our hero instead of just calling Griffith goes undercover as an porn actor. Some laughable moments – the cable is too short , cop doesn't notice woman being attacked in a car , dog kills his evil master instead of main hero. The ending with the ""Was it all dream ?"" seems to be put to create some ambiguity.The more I think about it the more I'm sure that this whole movie is some kind of black joke on the genre. Still not every joke is funny . I rather watch comedy when I want to laugh . From thriller I'm expecting logic and thrills . I give it 2/10 thanks to sexy Melanie Griffith and Deborah Shelton and for ""Relax"" from Frankie goes to Hollywood.",Body Double

So clearly a play on Alfred Hitchcock's greatest moments that he seems to be doing a Mel Brooks - winking and nodding to the camera as if this, somehow, makes it all OK.Having a fly weight lead (Craig Wasson) makes the whole thing look like a cheap Canadian TV movie and the inclusion of sleaze (they even have a Frankie Goes to Hollywood video in the middle!) makes the whole thing appear doubly desperate. The camera seems more interested in Melanie Griffiths' snow white backside than her face (maybe the cameraman thinks that is what she is talking out of?), but she is believable as a shrieking porn star because her acting is about that level anyway.Brian De Palma is mediocre film maker, but usually works hard enough to disguise it.

69,oOoBarracuda,Body Double,3,15 May 2017,"I have never had such a hot and cold cinematic relationship that I have with Brian De Palma. Carrie was great, The Untouchables was great, Carlito's Way was phenomenal. Then there's Raising Cain, Scarface, and now Body Double that I don't simply dislike, but I loathe them. Body Double was the director's 1984 feature film starring Craig Wasson and Melanie Griffith that was maybe supposed to be an homage to Alfred Hitchcock but which actually made his film Vertigo into complete trash. The film chronicles a young actor's obsession with his neighbor that gets him entangled in a series of life-threatening events. Satirizing two of Hitchcock's most well- known features was the result of whatever Body Double was supposed to be, and I doubt that has anything to do with the director's intent or a testament to his skill. I really don't know what happened between the concept and the execution; heck, I still don't even really know what Body Double was supposed to be, but it struck all the wrong chords with me. I guess De Palma is going to continue to be a director whose output I either love or loathe, which will probably force me to see everything he does just to see where I fall.Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is an actor struggling through his current project when he comes home to find his girlfriend in bed with another man. (He makes this discovery in the most Mulholland Drive kind of way, which is one of the film's few good standout moments, for me). As Jake contemplates his next move and his next acting job, he meets an actor who needs a house sitter which is perfect for the newly homeless Jake. As Jake is being toured through the home learning the place he will be taken care of, the owner of the home is quick to show Jake his favorite neighbor. Across the street, there is a Ms. Torso-like woman who regularly parades in front of her window naked. The homeowner has positioned a telescope aimed directly at the neighbor's home that Jake is more than welcome to use through his stay there. Throughout his nightly viewing, Jake becomes completely obsessed with the neighbor and vows to meet her. The opportunity finally presents itself when Jake decides to act heroically and chase down a man who stole the neighbor's purse. Soon after Jake witnesses a murder, then learns that the police love pinning crimes on peeping toms. Without intervention from the police, Jake decides to hunt down the perpetrators all on his own. I thought Body Double was going to be in the category of De Palma films that I enjoyed. The set up was wonderful, I especially appreciated the attention to detail De Palma paid to the world surrounding Jake. There was such intricate detail filling the small places Jake went or passed that was not lost on the audience. It was so fun to see the realism of the coffee shop Jake sits in and the people he passes. The film really loses it's footing for me when it tries to emulate a Hitchcock film. When Body Double switched from Rear Window to Vertigo I could not have wanted to check out more. I don't even like Vertigo that much yet, but I would have much rather watched that than Body Double. The lead actor, Craig Wasson, was an incredibly bland choice, which I understand was part of the intention but he doesn't pull off vanilla as well as the Jimmy Stewart archetype he was supposed to be. The music was poor, the plot was a mess, and the women in the film were terribly depicted. I have an odd enduring interest in De Palma despite my many failings with his output.",Body Double
70,bregund,No one stretches out scenes like De Palma,8,10 July 2021,"In this age of budget-conscious streaming and slap-dash entertainment it's refreshing to look back and see an auteur at work. De Palma's framing, lingering, focus, and camera angles all work together to bring you into the film in a way that modern-day entertainment simply can't do. It's a joy to watch this film just to see real filmmaking craftsmanship. Yes he borrowed heavily from Hitchcock, but he put his own spin on it, so that counts for something. I think the film's flaws are in the casting, I never heard of Craig Wasson, Gregg Henry, or Deborah Shelton, in the hands of talented actors this could have been a much better film. Choosing unknowns was clearly deliberate, or perhaps the leading actors of the day were turned off by the subject matter. The killer's elaborate scheme is rather weak, and one wonders why he has to wear the mask when he clearly doesn't need to any more...in the end, he's out in the middle of nowhere, who's going to see him or even care?

Now, I am saying that the film is brilliantly done not that everything in it is brilliant. I personally didn't dislike the scenes Brian De Palma wasn't happy about. I view the film with an artistic eye but I also view it with an acknowledgment that it captures a certain loneliness that I've seen here in LA. I've met women similar to Gloria Revelle. It captures that isolation people can find themselves in here and that is punctuated perfectly with the slightly dreamy, yearning music. The lighting is beautiful, the acting is excellent by everyone in the film and the way the film is shot.....it is beautiful to look at.

Everything about it is completely over the top - while this is probably why a lot of people love this movie, for me it mostly had the opposite effect.First, let me talk about what mostly weighs it down. The lead character is pretty much unbearable. He has very little personality aside from an overblown and unrealistic claustrophobia problem, though he does end up unsheathing some major things it's still painful to watch the journey because he is an awkward, despicable creep the whole way getting there. I disliked him more and more with each shot. While the story seems to be written to be purely entertaining and not realistic (AT ALL), it just doesn't work for me in this case. There are too many cases in nearly EVERY scene where I found myself getting frustrated, saying aloud ""That would not happen!"", ""That is not how that works!"", ""Why would anyone ever do that?!"" constantly, over and over, more than I have done with the majority of movies in my life. The entire thing feels like a ""complex"" plot that someone planned out a week or two before shooting, and didn't give it any time to marinate and tweak anything to make it feel more organic. But, hey, if you just want an over-the-top B-movie sort of experience, this might tickle you the right way.One thing that is starting to win points with me after letting this film sit in my mind overnight is that due to it's extremely unrealistic unfolding of events, it does give the film a sort of dream-like or nightmarish sort of quality in your memory, which is always something that I value. Other strong elements are the fantastically eerie and intense music score by the legendary Pino Donaggio, Melanie Griffith at her sexiest and most scant possible, and a few sequences that you won't forget due to some really effective and very Hitchcock-ian cinematography.Overall, this film really does stand out, but I could never call it a GOOD film. If you just want to see something that is absolutely over the top, functions under it's own set of rules, and is a bit of an anomaly in movie history, especially as something that was created by someone who is considered ""a legendary film director"", then you'll want to see this at least once. Generally I'm sucker for rule-breaking, absurdist films but this one just hit wrong in too many different ways, which I could not ignore.",Body Double
74,coldwaterpdh,Entertaining as hell.,8,10 October 2009,"I really enjoyed ""Body Double."" As a big fan of Italian giallo and horror, I can see where DePalma gathered a lot of his influence for this one. Not to mention a slice or two of Hitchcock thrown in for good measure.There is a down on his luck actor who needs a place to stay after being cheated on by his girlfriend. He accepts a generous offer from an acquaintance to stay in a wealthy man's pad for a week or so if he waters the plants. He witnesses a murder across the way from him via telescope and then the movie rolls through twists and turns that are pretty impressive. I have to admit I did not guess the ending, but I wasn't really trying to.In terms of slasher flicks, this one is definitely worth a viewing. As far as mysteries go, this one is not the toughest to guess. As far as scary movies, this one has it's moments for sure. I have to say, I thought Melanie Griffith was awful.8 out of 10, kids.",Body Double
75,CelluloidRehab,80's Post-Scarface Brian De Palma's take on film noir and the Hitchcockian thriller,8,26 January 2007,"I continue to celebrate the year 1984, by watching yet another wonderful movie from that year. A year that brought us Orwellian homages via Apple commercials and even a situation close to my heart involving a plane, a rabbit hat and a Chevy Monte Carlo (gray). As Conan's chronicler would say - ""But that is another story....""After the exploitation films popular during the 70's, there was what I like to call a film noir retrospective revival during the 80's through most of the industry. It brought back the gritty, sordid, sexual and action based narrative back from the mindless thrills. It started in the 70's with Sam Peckinpah's violent epics and movies like Taxi Driver. The 80's with movies like Scarface, added the 80's ""crisp and bright"" stereotypical look, feel and sound.Of course this movie is yet another in the VHS ""I remember that cover"" story revolving around my childhood and recently gone defunct mom and pop video store, I once patronized. It also did a heavy stint on the Skin-a-Max Cable tour I believe. This movie is probably as close to a grind house movie as you can get to from a studio film. Jake Scully is a somewhat struggling, B-movie actor with a severe case of ""stage fright"" and mild claustrophobia. After one of his episodes, he finds himself at home watching his girlfriend having sex with another man. He gets about as good a look as someone could get without being called a habitual voyeur. He then loses his acting job as the lead; as a vampire in Vampire's Kiss. He is down on his luck and ends up meeting a ""fellow thespian"", Sam Bouchard. Through Sam, Jake is given the job of house-sitting a very expensive house in the hills of Hollywood. I think its the same house ""Mad Mel"" took out in Lethal Weapon 2. He is told that the neighbor has a particular habit she does every night at the same time: (cough) Masturbate (cough). More than an audience now, we are made participants in the voyeurism through the telescopic lens. Jake believes the neighbor, Gloria Revelle, an attractive, yet abused hot 80's trophy wife is being followed by an ""Indian"". He proceeds to do the ""heroic"" act of following her himself. It is hard to reveal the rest without revealing the intrinsic goodness of the mystery. This movie occurred after Scarface, yet is full of similarities. De Palma enhances the close up shot with all the background action. It is the background and at the same time it isn't, because the story is happening out there even though the eye if focusing on the clarity of the foreground. Your eyes are in a constant frenzy to keep up with everything that is happening in the shot. He uses that to describe the fear of claustrophobia as well as the ecstasy of voyeurism. The infusion of a melodramatic and over the top symphonic score further enhances those emotions. There are long sequences in which there little to no dialog. There are other scenes in which the dialog is in the background conversations and noise. Even if there is no dialog or sound, we are constantly accompanied by the eerily familiar score. The music is reminiscent of Hitchcock's music man  Bernard Hermann (composer on North by Northwest, Psycho, the Birds, Cape Fear and even the Twilight Zone). It is a bit more crisp (like the hair and clothes of the time).This is very much a stylized, modernization of a Hitchcock mystery and film noir in a 1980's perspective (the clothes, colors, hair, porn's transition to VHS and the television airwaves, the yuppies and the coke). This movie has multiple layers and a very sharp edge. Voyerism is a big component. There is also a underlying parodistic component regarding the movie business. Did I mention there is the very, very, very nude Melanie Griffith giving it her all as Holly Body in Holly Does Hollywood ??I especially enjoyed the director's porn music video (Frankie apparently did come to Hollywood) as well as the director's definition of the title of the movie during the ending credits. Both are a nice wink, wink to the audience. Why not watch it? Its a good match. Looks real, looks good and best of all there's no tan lines.",Body Double
76,nomoons11,"Good Director, average script & below average casting = a transparent film",5,28 April 2012,"You know those films that you watch that early on you can pretty much guess every turn/plot point? This was one of those films.From very early on you realize the villain is the Gregg Henry character. Throughout the entire film you can easily tell it's him in the shots where his stooge is watching them. They try, very unconvincingly, to hide the fact that it's him with pretty obvious camera shots where they only show him in side view but it's so obvious it's him. Even the Melanie Griffith characters face can be seen through the way too obvious low light camera work. When I first noticed this I immediately knew what was going on. So that was about...oh 10 or 15 minutes in. To me, that's not a good sign of a good film.Another bad guy pops in in the form of an odd looking Indian. For a while his face close up is kept away but when you finally get to see him you immediately know it's the Gregg Henry character again. His stooge is obviously being set up to be a witness.The casting in this was just not up to snuff. I'm not sure De Palma was intending on these lower tier actors to be in this to keep in form for the backdrop of these characters jobs...i.e...porn star and low b grade film actor etc. He should have tightened this script up and got a few higher paid actors to run through this...It would have helped.The fun part about this film is guessing every twist and turn and being right every time. Seeing Melanie Griffith you would think would have helped but she couldn't save this from being a badly casted, badly shot and boring scripted to the end.",Body Double
77,Thrashman88,Flawed Cult Favorite,6,20 January 2014,"I vividly remember that BODY DOUBLE was some kind of box office hit back when I was in high school, yet I somehow missed the boat and never saw it in the movie theater nor on tape. Fast forward 30 years later and I finally get the chance to view it, in Bluray quality. Most Brian DePalma movies look a bit outdated nowadays and BODY DOUBLE is no exception. The movie deals with a struggling actor, Jake Scully, who suffers from claustrophobia, an adulterous girlfriend and plain bad luck. While auditioning for a movie part he befriends another struggling actor, who lands him a place to stay after breaking with his girlfriend. The place to stay turns out to be a deluxe flat, with an awesome view of Los Angeles and a telescope so he can peep on an specially good looking neighbor. One night while peeping this hot neighbor Jake notices that a man breaks into her house. Jake desperately tries to run to her neighbor's house in order to save her but it's too late. Jake becomes obsessed with knowing why his hot looking neighbor was killed and by whom. BODY DOUBLE reads like a faster paced DRESSED TO KILL, the beginning of the film very similar to the latter but done with a more updated touch. There are questions that are never answered in BODY DOUBLE, like the real reason why the hot looking neighbor was killed, who was she talking to on the phone, why was Jake chosen to stay on the deluxe flat, etc. Sure, you get to see Melanie Griffith's bare bottom in its full glory as a celebrated porn star and a cool montage with Frankie Goes To Hollywood singing their trademark hit from the 80's. Now I come to think that it was because of this (the T&A and the music) that the movie was a smash amongst my friends at the time, but aside that BODY DOUBLE holds very little water. There's a fine mystery/murder thriller buried beneath BODY DOUBLE and I'm sure a remake would certainly give this movie some justice.It's movies like this that Hollywood should remake, not ROBOCOP or SPIDERMAN; they should remake movies that had the potential to be really huge but somehow never got to that point.",Body Double
78,jgcorrea,A man spying on a beautiful woman leads to drastic consequences,7,27 November 2019,"Body Double's Hitchcockian hero (Craih Wasson) is a flawed, weak man in great danger. We, the Hitch buffs, can't help empathizing with him. But this movie tries to make an ultimately pointless point. It's typical Brian DePalma fare. More style than content. Cinematography performing impressive camera movements. Exuberance merging dream and reality. Not dePalma's best moment, but kinda his signature tune, thanks to the defaulting emphasis on visuals rather than on dialogue. The filmmaker even had the nerve to mix the plots from Vertigo and Rear Window in this flamboyant voyeurs' feast, which he pulled off with certain panache. Obsessions abound, to the delight of every voyeur and haunting of every feminist. But BD isn't misogynistic. It's, say, meta-Kitsch: purposefully Kitsch in its implicit sex explicitness.",Body Double
79,quaseprovisorio,this is hitchcock for naughty people. and it works very very well.,8,11 May 2020,"Body double starts with a protagonist that might not be very emphatic to everyone due to his stalking mode. yes, he had problems with his personal life, yes he was alone, but at the same time that's probably the most complicate part: to like jake when he does things we know are pretty wrong. at the same time the movie has an incredible pace and it's always interesting to watch everywhere he goes: in movies the characters can do pretty much whatever they want, and in here that works. period.the plot doesn't reveal itself immediatly: he puts us under a courtain of deceipt with hot women dancing, panoramics with kissing, claustrophobia, loneliness, desire...it's a movie that plays with human instintcs but at the same time with doubt and fear in our heads. then you have depalma working beautifully behind the camera: some shots are great, the tunnel scene is completely unrealistic but it gives a noir sense to the movie that is very welcoming. i also loved the music effects in this, and some of the scenarios mainly in the ""metalanguage"" scenes are great. this looks like if this movie could have been made in the 50's but with way more sexual freedom.then yeah: rear window and vertigo show up here. not only but mostly. depalma loves this type of classics and that's very noticeable. he just does them his own way: and loves to put them way over the top until the point they even become funny, while maintaining them suspenseful. because the mystery itself it's interesting. maybe i didn't love the ""explaining"" part but the truth of the matter is the mystery here is still the most important part of all of this: with so much lights and sex and video we even forget what the movie is all about: a criminal case. that's part of his charm!the movie kinda has a ""twist"" that divides it into two parts; and yeah in a way they're two different films, even the ""metafilms"" are different (i' trying hard not to spoil anything) and that's very interesting and well crafted. the lights and color palette are managed differently either. depalma really worked with the visual language here and that shows.For what i know this isn't exactly know as a big depalma classic: i honestly think that's unfair. this is a noir film for naughty people simple as that. it is provoking it is dense it is visually beautiful and it seems to have been a labour of love. i really enjoyed and see this as a very solid piece of filmmaking.",Body Double

Craig Wasson does a fine job in the lead role and Melanie Griffith is a far better actress than Nancy Allen (""Dressed to Kill,"" ""Blow Out"") as the requisite hooker.

81,PCC0921,De Palma shows early signs of genius.,9,5 October 2020,"Still a beautifully shot and edited piece of work. De Palma manages to capture the essence of Hitchcock and Scorsese and I swear I saw a little bit of Spielberg in there too, but this amazing piece of 80s film noir is top notch still. It also comes with some 80s cheesiness, but that just helps to emphasize the almost dream-like craziness that our anti-hero and peeper, Jake (Craig Wasson), experiences. This would be the film that made Melanie Griffith a star, and it garnered her a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress. It also featured a then unknown band named Frankie Goes to Hollywood doing their classic song about sex, ""Relax"".Many twists and turns in a plot full of deception and voyeurism. Wasson does an amazing job of conveying to the audience a character that imbues sympathy and support even though he tends to do things a little bit on the creepy side. I was worried that the sands of time may have made this film dated, but I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case. This is still a blast and a must see for movie buffs.

82,blakiepeterson,A De Palma Classic,7,2 May 2015,"""Look,"" a movie director (Dennis Franz) frankly says to his leading actor, Jake Scully (Craig Wasson). ""I got a picture to make here. I got 25 days to make it. I have no time to wait around for a claustrophobic vampire who freezes every time he lays down in a coffin.""Scully is a young, struggling actor, good-looking, nice enough, but just passable when it comes to star power. He has landed a leading role as a vampire, true, but it's only a B-picture. One can hope for the best as he dons gaudy, glittery eye makeup and a pair of fangs that makes Bela Lugosi seem like a Dardenne Brothers figure. His staggering claustrophobia only makes things worse.As his professional life limps along, things only get worse when Scully discovers his girlfriend in bed with another man, which, in response, leave him homeless and alone. A fellow actor (Gregg Henry) offers him the chance to stay at his house for a few days, a house of fiendish tackiness that sits on top of a hill and looks like the Seattle Space Needle had a baby with a spaceship. Across the way is a mansion inhabited by a stunningly beautiful woman (Deborah Shelton) — Scully is able to watch her undress as his friend has equipped a telescope overlooking the balcony.If you've had a filling serving of Alfred Hitchcock movies, I'm sure you can only guess where the film is going. Body Double is Rear Window junior and Vertigo the second, except with a lot more blood, sex, nudity, and enough tawdriness to top off a jumbo sized popcorn bin. One night, as Scully peeps on his new neighbor performing her nightly striptease, he notices a deformed looking man perched on the satellite dish in front of her home, watching her with a sadistic thirst in his eyes. Skip to a few days later, the woman is brutally murdered in her bedroom, with Scully as the sole witness. The police (of course) laugh at him, passing him off as a paranoid pervert. But his neighbor's death leads him to a number of startling discoveries, the most shocking turning toward the world of pornography, where he enlists the help of actress Holly Body (Melanie Griffith) to find out the truth in the bizarre slaughter.Hitchcock had a fascination with hot blondes, armed-and-dangerous camera angles, and ever-present danger. Brian De Palma, billed as the Master of the Macabre in his heyday, likes all that, but he doesn't want to turn himself into a carbon copy of cinema's most predominant suspense filmmaker. De Palma's own Dressed to Kill, Sisters, and Blow Out (let's stop talking about Carrie and Scarface for a minute) were jaw-dropping in their stylistic dexterity, their stories borderline ridiculous yet efficient when connected with such unique visuals.Body Double is no different, even if it is sillier than some of De Palma's other efforts (which is saying something, considering Dressed to Kill gave the then 49-year old Angie Dickinson a blatantly obvious 20- something year-old body double, put Michael Caine in drag, and ended with a was that all just a dream? startler). The plot twists are sometimes inane, and sometimes too coincidental to truly be stunning, but De Palma is so self-assured that it isn't hard to make us want to just go with it. I have been purposefully vague when retelling plot points because so much of the film's success lies in its slimy thrills, but the style is something worth noting — Body Double shows the director at his optical peak. Early in the film, Scully, sensing his neighbor is in trouble, follows her to a Los Angeles mall, her actual soon-to-be attacker lurking in every nook and cranny. In the past, De Palma has payed great attention to split-screens and close-ups, but the entire sequence is notable for its remarkable combination of voyeurism and open space. There are three buzz characters moving around the complex all at once, with the camera sometimes peering onto them from above, most impressively when they walk on different floors. Without much dialogue to back it up, the scene rattles with tension. Will danger catch up in this game of cat-and-mouse?There are even more visual kicks (particularly the simultaneously laughable yet hugely ingenious moment where Scully and his neighbor run into each other, after he's been following her around for hours, embrace in fiery passion, the camera spinning around them with merry-go-round delirium), but the theme of voyeurism in Body Double is what makes the film such a wild experience. It's almost always uncomfortable — in every scene, you feel as if you shouldn't be there, as if you're intruding on something deeply private. The storyline may not always be strong (or even truly believable), but Body Double is about style, tone and mood. In that sense, it's more than convincing.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Body Double
83,Tiger_Mark,DePalma at his brilliant best!,10,6 November 2003,"This has to be one of my favorite films of all-time. I first saw it some ten years ago and I still cannot get it out of my mind. It was in fact, the muse for the future great film ""Boogie Nights."" It centers a masterful story around the porn industry of Southern California during the early 1980's. It mixes in excellent cinematogrophy with vivid sets and mind altering music. It is as fun to watch as it is to listen to. The story grabs you early and it does not release you till the very end. Mix in comedy, violence, sex and drama, and of course, if Mr. DePalma is involved, you will have more than a few twists (there are plenty). Melanie Griffith is hotter than hot! This movie has it all, I really do love it.The story involves an out of work actor who is down on his luck. He soon becomes infatuated with a beautiful woman that he sees brutally killed by a rather disfigured Indian character. Ahh, but things are not what they appear to be.

84,MF210,Good Entertainment,8,19 August 2003,"I am not a huge fan of Brian De Palma, I think he is actually an overrated director. I thought Carrie was a mediocre movie, and Snake Eyes and Mission to Mars were just terrible movies. Mission Impossible and Femme Fatale are decent entertainment, but nothing that would really impress me a great deal. Body Double is definitely De Palmas best movie so far but its nothing great.Body Double's story is kind of Vertigo-ish. Only it involves an actor not a detective. The story isnt the most impressive thing about Body Double.
The acting is mostly fine in Body Double. Craig Wasson is fine as a claustrophobic, washed up actor. Melanie Griffith is actually the standout in Body Double. She plays a porn star quite well and can be very funny. The actor who plays the detective is a scene stealer too. I guess probably one of the best things of Body Double is its script. Not storywise, but the dialogue is quite good and funny at times. The least impressive is probably De Palma's direction. Its mostly just a bunch of rip off shots from Rear Window and Vertigo. Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10. Body Double will keep you interested even with its flaws.",Body Double

Don't waste your time unless you're a desperate bloke (or woman I guess) who likes to be a voyeur & watch women who, for no apparent reason, dance pornographically in front of their windows at night (I mean come on people, no-one does that) but wants to pretend they're watching a movie for other reasons.",Body Double
86,jay4stein79-1,Brilliant,10,21 October 2004,"I was introduced to Brian De Palma at the rather tender age of 7, when I watched The Untouchables with my parents. My friend Nicky and I enjoyed it immensely and found the rousing tale of Elliot Ness et al. an absolutely brilliant cop v. robber/adventure movie. Until Tim Burton released Batman in 1989, Untouchables was our game of choice and we would re-enact the entire movie in my back yard after school.But I'm supposed to be talking about Body Double... To make a long story short, since I was 7, I didn't know who Brian De Palma was, nor did I really care, so I went about my cinephillic youth without completely immersing myself in his oeuvre. I caught bits and pieces of it, encountering Scarface as a fourteen-year-old and finding it laughable, watching Sisters with (how apropos) my sister before I went off to college and finding it intriguing, and finally seeing Femme Fatale when it was released a couple years ago and thinking it amazing.So, as you can see, I grew into De Palma and, since watching Femme Fatale, I've gone back and watched many of his films (even Phantom of the Paradise, which was an epiphany - go see it immediately). I re-watched Scarface, Carrie, Blow-out, Wise Guys, the Untouchables, etc. and then this week I saw Body Double at the video store. The cover art, which is horrible, drew me in. I said, Jason, that cover art is so tacky and the movie is called Body Double, it must be awful. Flipping the case over, what should I find? De Palma.Oh my. I scooped it up then and there, went home, and popped it in the player. How had I not heard of this film? Probably because 2/3 of the natural world finds it a trashy piece of filth. I find it brilliant.It is your typical De Palma suspense thriller. Riffs on Hitchcock, beautifully fluid camera movements, sexual 'dysfunction,' an exploration of voyeurism, Hollywood satire, a convoluted and endearingly unbelievable story...So why watch it? Because unlike most movies Body Double cannot seem to take itself too seriously. Body Double moves forward with a straight face but, as evidenced by the Frankie Goes to Hollywood video somehow slipped into this film and an awful rubber mask, De Palma's tongue is so firmly in his cheek it's liable to break through the skin. Could a film that's credits hearken back to the EC Comics font really intend to be taken seriously? No. Oh, and for you scenesters out there, QT may have found inspiration for his first film's title in Body Double's final scene which, you guessed it, contains both a reservoir and dogs.And yet, although the movie on some level parodies the preposterous suspense thrillers of yore, it also never condescends to them. De Palma directs this movie with such glee and exuberance, that you know he loves those types of movies (well, I mean if Phantom of the Paradise, Sisters, and Dressed to Kill hadn't let the cat out of the bag already).Anyway, if you enjoy maverick directors unafraid of genre-pictures, fun, and enormous drills, this is a movie for you. However, if you like Lars Von Trier or other such beings who take themselves and their art far too seriously at times, go elsewhere.",Body Double

I got some of the cheesiest, campiest filming, acting, and music in cinema history. Some I enjoyed, some I didn't. So, is the movie good? Umm...You'll find the plot similar to films like Vertigo and Rear Window, told in its own strange and campy way. It's not exact, but it might as well be. Craig Wasson is bad, bad bad bad. The script isn't good, but he didn't even try I feel. Most of the acting is dumb, except for Melanie Griffith as a porn star, who was pretty solid. The music is unbelievably bad, so out of place and gets intense at the wrong places. The editing isn't the best either. There's a 20 minute scene where a guy follows a girl around, and it goes on forever. He takes panties that she threw away in the trash, he follows her everywhere etc.I feel like this was a fetish film for De Palma honestly, it's just so out of place and stupid. I don't think it was intentionally cheesy, but I don't know. Some parts are so bad, I laugh my ass off, but other parts just make me cringe. I like that it tried to work, but it kind of failed hard.

I was aware of the negative reviews from uptight critics who dismissed it as sleaze, and to be honest, that's what I was in the mood for. Besides, my curiosity was aroused. (No cheap jokes, please!)To my surprise, this is actually a compelling, well-crafted thriller. Let me take it a step further. It's an improvement over DePalma's effective but overpraised ""Dressed to Kill."" ""Body Double"" is actually better-constructed and better-paced. Perhaps the extremes of the film's content turned off some members of the critical community. And keep in mind that many of these people loved Dressed.However, if you can stomach some of the content (it would certainly warrant an NC-17 in today's climate), there's much to like here. DePalma's approach might be manipulative, but when he does so this effectively, it's hard to complain. Technically, it's a marvel of film technique. Wasson's claustrophobic attacks are effectively conveyed to the viewer. When they hit him, they hit us just as hard. The very ending, which I wouldn't dream of giving away, is a work of pure genius. The infamous drill murder is a terrific setpiece.One aspect that interested me was its attitude towards porno. So-called ""dirty movies"" are not condemned, but treated as simply being another side of the film industry. It's not considered right or wrong; it's just there. Such a nonjudgmental outlook is refreshing after hearing the tiresome rants of self-appointed ""moral watchdogs."" Likewise, there is a loving tribute to B-movies during the opening and closing credits.""Body Double"" isn't good art by any means, but it's good trash. Watch it, and you will behold DePalma at his sleazy best. He makes no apologies for what he does, nor would we want him to do so.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Columbia Pictures",Body Double

Henry tells Wasson that every night in a house across the street a women does a striptease and they can see it from a telescope.

It's not up to the level of perfection that Brian De Palma's Phantom Of The Paridise, Carrie, Scarface, Untouchables, Casualties of War, or Mission Impossible but it does a good job. It is a fine companion to the De Palma's series of films that pay tribute to Hitchcock. Most will say that De Palma is riping of Alfred but I find it to be an homage. He does the same things Quentin Tarentino does, which is mine past resources for stuff that can be used today. I find it sad that showing a love and appreciation for the past as these two directors do is seen as wrong, but is perfectly OK for other people to destroy the past with remakes and un-connecting sequels that make it as the past never happened. I find that to be the sin of film and not the fact that someone like De Palma is showing how much he loves cinema. Body Double it's self is a film that shows Craig Wasson from A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors try to solve a voyeuristic murder from across the street of a women he was watching undress every night. Wasson is an out of work actor who's wife or girlfriend I can't remember just cheated on him and pretty much kicked him out. He goes to live in a friends house while said friend is away and then all the plot happens. Wasson's character who is afraid of tight places constantly finds himself in them and is stalled to do the right thing, but he tries his best. Watch this for a good story.",Body Double
92,KatMiss,AN EXHILARATING AND VERY INVOLVING THRILLER,7,26 April 2001,"I really can't understand why Brian DePalma's ""Body Double"" has received such terrible reviews. I think Roger Ebert is right on the money when he states in his review that ""Body Double is an exhilarating exercise in pure filmmaking"". First of all, DePalma is always accused of stealing from Hitchcock. He is not. If he had stolen it from Hitchcock, it would play exactly like the original did. It's true that DePalma borrowed from films like ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"". But DePalma takes it one or more steps further and he has his own delightfully nasty surprises up his sleeve. He has his own ideas and that is what sets his films apart from the ripoffs.Second, DePalma is always criticized for his imperfect plots. Recall that Hitchcock's plots were not perfect as well. He wanted it that way. There is no such thing as a perfect plot. Anyway, DePalma's films are built on emotions and style, not logic. Actually, Body Double makes the most sense of all his films.Third, DePalma's choice of Craig Wasson in the leading role was heavily criticized. I thought it was perfect casting. He is like the Hitchcockian Everyman. Wasson understands that and doesn't add any touches a more famous actor would have.The film is terrifying and suspenseful. It has humor, scares, suspense and genuine thrills all wrapped up together neatly. It's a real treat.**** out of 4 stars",Body Double
93,howie73,A disaster,5,28 December 2005,"Body Double is essentially De Palma's failed postmodern reworking of Vertigo and Rear Window, but rather than simply employ pastiche and parody as his cinematic styles, he opts for a twisted, self-conscious reworking of those aforementioned films. Set in and around the porn industry of LA in the early 80s, De Palma's awkward anti-hero, Jake, plays the voyeur and the detective; roles that result in some awkward and surprising corny moments.The film is an uneasy, contemptuous mix of Hitchcockian homage and farce. There are many funny lines about the porn business and some scenes that are simply too preposterous to be believable but was this De Palma's intention or just bad execution? The first half is superior, where Deborah Shelton's woman in trouble is pursued by two men, including the anti-hero. As soon as that story seemingly ends, De Palma diverts his blasé gaze towards the excesses of trash porn and S&M in a silly last segment that sees the preposterous plot implode. There are more holes in the plot than Holly Does Hollywood and De Palma is too lazy to solve anything. I think something went seriously wrong with the editing of this film and it shows in the final 10 minutes where there is no effort to save the film from disaster.Although I guessed who the murderer was early on the twist was a little too preposterous to take seriously, but perhaps that was De Palma's intention yet it still felt like a cop-out. After all, Body Double is just a self-consciously postmodernist reworking of Hitchock, right? We don't have to think about the many plot holes?",Body Double
94,kyle_c,*** out of ****,7,4 December 2002,"Immensely entertaining albeit somewhat trashy De Palma reworking of a few Hitchcock classics (Vertigo and Rear Window).  Some of the Hitchcock references are quite obvious  However,  it's clear that this isn't a direct rip-off, but rather De Palma melding some of Hitchcock's themes and techniques into his own style.  Either way, you have to admit that De Palma takes these themes to a disturbing level that is well beyond anything Hitchcock ever did  whether this works for or against the movie is for the viewer to decide.  The sleaziness and B-Movie feel is also something that may put off some viewers but others may enjoy.  Some truly excellent scenes, and good performances by Griffith and Wasson, who fits the B-Movie actor role well.  One point  I'm not really sure how the movie got from the climax to the final scene.",Body Double
95,The-Last-Prydonian,Entertaining yet vacuous attempt to blend Hitchock's Vertigo with Rear Window,7,25 August 2016,"Arguably the one movie among Director Brian DePalma's back catalogue which owes a great debt to his hero, the late great Alfred Hitchcock. Body Double marks something of an oddity which far from perfect didn't deserve the critical dismissal it received, leading to it being a commercial failure at the box office. It also marked the closest thing that actor Craig Wasson had to a mainstream leading role. The movie revolves around Jake Scully, (Wasson) a struggling actor starring in cheap, tawdry Vampire flick which proves more trouble than it's worth. He suffers from claustrophobia which Isn't exactly helpful when he has to appear in scenes of him sleeping in a coffin. Upon arriving home he finds his girlfriend in bed with another man, forcing him to find a new home. A chance meeting with fellow out of work actor Sam Bouchard at an acting workshop proves fortuitous as he needs a house-sitter while he's away on an acting job. Jake jumps at the chance of taking care of the plush apartment, and to top things off, each night a sexy alluring neighbour who lives in the building across performs a sexy striptease which Jake views via a telescope. This leads to an unhealthy obsession with wanting to meet her which eventually leads to him witnessing her murder. Inevitably finding himself the chief suspect he finds that he must work to clear his name which gradually draws himself in to the seedy world of the porn industry and where he learns that everything he saw that night wasn't quite as it seemed. Glossy, beautifully filmed and with a slightly surreal edge Body Double while largely effective and never boring is marred predominantly by a vacuous plot which tries to hide the silliness behind flashy window dressing. De Palma delights in excess which was very much a hallmark of the eighties, especially in the shamelessly O.T.T. murder scene and when Jake reluctantly appears in a pornographic Horror Movie, marching through a brothel to the strains of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's, Relax, and marks an inspired foray in to opulence and indulgence which De Palma captures beautifully. Ultimately a movie of two halves with the first being one long set-up for the main plot as Jake's obsession with the mystery woman grows unabated. Wasson, a limited actor in some people's view is actually effectively cast here as he makes for a likable screen presence. He has an amiable, good natured quality which makes for it being all the more troubling and cringe-making as he descends in to essentially becoming a stalker. It's these moments which ironically prove more tense and unnerving than the inevitable killing. Unfortunately the combining of plot aspects from of two of Hitchcock's more renowned thrillers don't exactly make for a cohesive plot, which under close scrutiny is rather flimsy. The eventual plot twists are either predictable or when they do arrive although unexpected don't have the jarring effect of shock they were clearly designed to invoke. On the plus side, Melanie Griffith who doesn't make her long awaited appearance until over an hour in to the picture is on top sleazy yet naive and ultimately bemused form as porn star, Holly Body(moniker which was actually taken by a genuine porn star after the movies release. Below the surface there is however some rewarding self referential observations on the pitfalls of the Hollywood film industry, De Palma sublimely delights in bewildering his audience with a neat psychological deception which will have you double guessing yourself. Topped off by a beautiful, haunting score by Pino Dinaggio it's an entertaining foray in to style over substance, deserving of the critical reappraisal it has garnered. Not necessarily to be missed if you can get past it's shortcomings.",Body Double
96,nixskits,Porn nailed itself shut by 1984,9,30 November 2009,"Out of all the many discs I've bought, De Palma (after Scorsese) ranks as the director who made the most of those titles. A few years ago, when I owned a dozen films and they all fit in one small box, ""Body Double"" was really the key to converting me to DVD from the dreadful VHS tape format we had to put up with until the digital takeover was official.Now I've got hundreds of movies all over my home and when thinking about which De Palma project to write about, realize ""Body Double"" has a special place in my library. This explores the darkest parts of male desire, with Melanie Griffith as the porn actress who turns out to be the most moral figure of the story and Craig Wasson crumbling and rebuilding himself wonderfully as a weak man who can't help but cower until he has to get beyond his all consuming fears and live, not merely exist.An actor is something less than a man, according to an old show biz maxim. So the parallels between straight films and the X-rated world are really blinking like a neon sign the size of the very sky. Graying thespians and tired studs are all feeling the chilly hand of old age patting them on their shoulders and wonder where all the time went. This actor likes watching human behaviour, up to the point where it causes so much trouble, his whole world shakes to it's core. He makes an unusual transition to porn from his familiar turf of the stage and bit parts to continue his investigation into a most bizarre mystery. The real porn star Annette Haven was thought of for the role of Holly Body, but I seriously doubt any major studio would have given a high profile gig to a notorious figure, no matter how good an actress she might have been. The dream many had of combining authentic eroticism with mainstream film was not to be in 1984 and the X-rated crowd were busy with the decline in everything their business stood for. Too much cocaine, the newer explicitness for it's own sake, AIDS waiting in the wings and the threatening presence of the LAPD vice squad meant adult film would forever be a stigma. And never integrated into a new category of adult entertainment, with a rating implying some place between plot free sex pictures and the R rated stuff geared toward less sophisticated, mass audience fodder. ""Body Double"" is troubling, as the gore and dark nature of evil gets to a feverish pitch. But the acting of Griffith and Wasson makes you care about these two, realizing they are no where near as evil as many in society who would look down on them for being a part of ""smut"" (one of Richard Nixon's timely 70's words). This film is my favourite De Palma work and I doubt he'll make anything else that impresses me more.",Body Double
97,bob-790-196018,Stylish entertainment in spite of (because of?) the sleaze,7,25 October 2012,"This movie has three terrific sequences, any one of which is worth the price of admission. The extended double pursuit sequence, in which Jake follows Gloria to and through a fashionable shopping mall while intently aware of the 'Indian' who is following her, all of it taking place without dialog, is spellbinding. So is the follow-up sequence, as Jake follows Gloria to an upscale seaside ""cliff dwelling."" The music video-style porno movie scene is simultaneously satirical and irresistible, with the camera gliding through a busy, crowded set where everyone is moving to the rhythm of a pop song that goes on and on.If you are uncomfortable with sleaze, you won't like this movie, which has plenty of it in its depiction of cheap horror flicks and cheap porn movies, not to mention the scenes with Gloria being watched through a telescope as she strips. The final scene, with its close up of a vampire fondling the breasts of a body double and of the blood from his kiss flowing over them, is purposely over the top and literally ""in your face."" Also very much ""on purpose"" is De Palma's use of iconic situations from Vertigo and Rear Window. Those who like this may call it homage to Hitchcock; those who don't may call it a rip-off. To me it's all too blatant to be either.It's a good movie. Brian De Palma is almost always stylish and entertaining. If you can stand sleaze, it's well worth a look.",Body Double
98,james362001,Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud.,10,26 August 2002,"Pardon my ignorance, when I saw this film in 1984 (I was young then) I thought Melanie Griffith was actually  in adult films.  Wrong!  But alot of young ladies I guess tried to take the name ""Holly"" as there adult business name after this film was released.  Melanie Griffith is a fine actress and has proved her talent in many films.  This is her breakthrough film.  We knew of Craig Wesson from his previous work in Ghost Story (1981).  Deborah Shelton (Miss USA 1970)  is perfect and unforgettable in this standout role. The song ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood was highly controversial when released.  This song fits the film perfectly.  (The song ""Relax"" went through many versions before finally becoming a hit that we are familar with.  A longer version is available from Frankie Goes To Hollywood.  And that is ""Frankie"" singing the song in the film.  That is Barbara Crampton (as the nude woman on top, in the house) whom you may recognize from the NBC serial ""Days Of Our Lives"" in (1983), CBS serials ""The Young and the Restless"" (1988-91,1998-2002) and ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" (1995-1998). Rebecca Stanley as ""Kimberly Hess"" was a standout for me in this film too. I always wanted to know who that woman was and if she had been in any other films.  Thanks to imdb.com I now can get the information.  This film is NOT for children to see.  It contains nudity, sexual content, pornographic images and murder.  If you enjoyed Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), you will enjoy Body Double (1984).  Although Body Double is adult in nature it does have its moments of comedy.

Craig Wasson is a very likable leading man but never achieved the star status he seemed headed for and Melanie Griffith is very amusing as a hardcore sex film actress.

Melanie Griffith does quite a good job, but the rest of the cast are all at sea, especially Wasson, whom I just wanted to punch. Even the music is irritating. Occasionally de Palma does produce moments of flair, but they're very few and far between, and I saw the 'trick' ending coming a mile off.

103,Oggz,Spurious drivel,4,11 December 2018,"In 1981 Blow Out was released, a very fine viewing even today, and arguably the best of what was seemingly an endless procession of De Palma's Hitchcock homages. Only three years later the most vulgar, unsubtle and spurious of them all comes up in a spectacular, almost unrecognisable downturn for the director.Purporting to be fun, kinky or even deliberately sleazy, it comes across as none of that but instead painfully uninspired, dull and predictable - and of course yet again massively derivative, to the point where abject boredom sets in. Even some clear mistakes are on obvious display - De Palma utilises a woman who can't act and has to be overdubbed (but looks incredible), Deborah Shelton, for the most part hiding her best feature - her eyes - behind a pair of huge sunglasses, thereby highlighting her less-than-perfect chin. Also he is clean-stealing not just the odd Hitchcock idea here and there, but the entire building blocks, symbols, processes and developments from his idol, all in that same muddled, hasty, ill-advised way, which has a price - the film is littered with quotations and the only thing that's missing from the scene in the tunnel is the actual ""Vertigo shot"". That's no longer idolatry, it's a rather wretched lack of fresh, more authentic ideas, long after all reasonable tributes have been paid, some of them many times over.The once celebrated Frankie Goes To Hollywood segment today looks really old, out of place, hopelessly staged and just downright fake, as leather clubs looked nothing like that back in the day, most of all because they were overwhelmingly men-only places where men cruised other men. That inconvenience does not stand in the path of our auteur though, so the scene is there such as it is, rather embarrassingly sticking out like a fancy feather on an old hat.Not even De Palma's usually reliable regulars come out well, even though Dennis Franz tries valiantly but we've seen that exact same schtick many times from him. The brutal drill murder, the one reason why this film exists in the first place, is executed with panache that might be judged as somewhat authentic, but between that set-piece and the final shot of blood pouring down some nice looking breasts, nothing of much interest happens, let alone any real suspense. Still, Raising Cain would prove to be an even worse waste of time. Watch this for the scandalously cheap 80s soft-porn music by Donaggio while Melanie Griffith wiggles her ass, if that's your thing - that just about sums up the whole scope of the film.",Body Double

106,Undead_Master,"a great movie, misunderstood by most",10,7 December 2003,"possible spoilersI'm pretty sure that Body Double is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. Many people call it a tribute to Hitchcock, other people call it a rip-off of Hitchcock, some people think it's a parody.... I think it's more than any of those things, I think it's an analysis. A humorous, insightful essay on Hitchcock... Kind of like something Godard might do, which isn't surprising when you realize that Godard is also a big influence on De Palma. The distancing techniques employed in the film, the way he hams it up, the scenes where the internal logic breaks down in obvious ways, like the kissing scene near the tunnel, where the movie suddenly reenacts the famous hotel kiss from the second half of vertigo, at a very unexpected time with almost no set up to make the scene believable... All these things are intentional, designed to let the audience in on the fact that this is not just a straight forward movie (although it can be enjoyed that way). De Palma wants the audience to have some separation from the story so that they can look at the movie in a more critical way, and think about Hitchcock's movies from a different perspective. These distancing techniques also allow de Palma to get away with some pretty harsh/sleazy scenes, and that was necessary because the analysis wouldn't have worked any other way.
This is basically De Palma saying, ""what if Vertigo and Rear Window had a baby, but the baby was born in the 80's and raised by a prostitute and a murderous pimp."" The result is a fascinating movie that stands up very well, as long as you understand the intentions. If you take it the right way, it's one of De Palma's very best movies.As a big fan of vertigo and rear window (vertigo is my favorite movie of all time), it was fascinating to me, to see De Palma, rework those story's, twine them together, and put them in a different context.

A little disjointed and a few odd filmic choices throw you out of the action here and there, this is why I would use the term 'comedic'... I can't be certain but some of the decisions seem to have either been intentionally tongue in cheek, or at least they were overtly dismissed as such.

109,grahamcarter-1,Driller Killer,9,8 May 2017,"Dismissed on release Body Double is referenced often in Bret Easton Ellis' novel 'American Psycho'(1991), the stories serial killer Patrick Bateman has seen the film 37 times. He also occasionally repeats his preferred moments from the film to the reader or to other characters, especially 'the power drill scene' (he masturbates to this scene). On a lighter note, the futuristic octagon residence Jake house-sits is a real place, 'Chemosphere,' at 7776 Torreyson Drive in Los Angeles. It was designed by the architect John Lautner in 1960, but is still looked cutting edge in the 1984 film. In The Simpsons television series the shallow ex B actor now infomercial host 'Troy McClure' lives in a near-identical house. DePalma began his career as an American Jean-Luc Godard with his films 'Greetings' and 'Hi, Mom!' and to a lesser extent with 'Blow Out'. He is unusual for a mainstream American director, in that he frequently produces love letters to Godard's 'Weekend'; colourful, loud, violent sometimes popular, sometimes not. Body Double is a chapter in his ongoing war with his critics. The film was so shocking (for a major studio film from an established director), that I remember my jaw hit the floor when I first viewed it. It references early eighties porn films, Hitchcock via Melanie Griffith as well as 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo'. Dario Argento is there via 'Tenebre' like killers, and as always DePalma thinks highly enough of himself to reference his own work (most obviously the Victoria Lyn link in 'Dressed To Kill'). DePalma had talked about making a porno and with Body Double his critics thought he had. Those who still hate this film would probably be surprised to hear Bertolt Brecht mentioned in the same breath. ""the play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the character or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage."" DePalma performs more distancing tropes than he had ever tried to pull before under the guise of a thriller. We are asked to examine what is being said and how we observe and process it. DePalma does this via movies within movies; Jake is filming a movie, or was until he is fired for being claustrophobic. Melanie Griffith's porn starlet Holly Body stars in 'Holly Does Hollywood', a movie described as the 'Gone with the Wind' of porn. The two meet on the set of the porno sequel, one that recreates the making of the earlier film (a mirror shot that actor Craig Wasson claims he created reveals the camera crew; though DePalma probably had 'Blow-Up' in mind). Body Double begins and ends with deliberate deconstructions, breaking the fourth wall by showing the film set and crew. It sounds academic but it is a sickly sweet early eighties 'Tangerine Dreamy' sound tracked concoction full of nudity and violence, and this is precisely what makes it possible for DePalma to demonstrate his concerns, techniques and cognitive dissonance. DePalma is thumbing his nose at his critics for 'Dressed To Kill' (and 'Blow Out', and for that matter his previous film 'Scarface'), who decided the sexed up thriller 'Dressed' was the number one cause of all rapes committed since its release. DePalma like Godard, gets a kick out of fatalistic humour. My reference to 'Tangerine Dream' is deliberate; whenever Jake catches a glimpse of his own 'Madeline'/'Judy' double (i.e. a doppelganger of a doppelganger) dancing in nothing but headphones and panties, DePalma has Pino Donaggio's music sounding not like a Hitchcock thriller, but more like 'Risky Business' from the previous year that starred a young Tom Cruise. DePalma is pointing out the hypocrisy that, in 'Dressed To Kill' for instance, it is verboten to have a middle-aged woman having remotely risqué sexual fantasies unless you get to throw labels of misogyny at the director DePalma who is regarded as arrogant by many. However in films like 'Porky's' (1982), 'My Tutor' (1983), and 'Class' (1983) and most obviously the aforementioned Risky Business (which the critics loved), it's okay to romanticise the corruption of virile, high school boys at the hands of non-Gonorrhea-carrying prostitutes. Body Double, whilst not a 'great' film (it's too flawed by the directors indulgences even though they are what make the film; it's complicated), is however the front runner as his signature film. It has all the DePalma DNA; long set pieces, little dialogue, story told visually, voyeurism, the culprit aware he is a voyeur and yet being worried about other characters voyeurism, and what it means. He is self-referential (a kiss lifted from the climax of his own 'Obsession'), and to work our way back to Dario Argento, rather than being a 'noir' thriller, DePalma utilises the bright California sunshine, much as Argento did in 'Tenebre'.",Body Double

At best, it's a parody of itself, and perhaps unconsciously so. The horribly dated disco and porno scenes only make it worse. The 'thrills' are jokes, and the 'mystery' is solved by any thinking viewer in the first few minutes. Are we supposed to accept ""The Indian' as a character that any real witness would describe in any way other than: ""He had a rubber mask on"" ? The set-up of the witness right at the beginning is so painfully obvious that I watched the film only in hope that I was wrong; the murder itself would be a joke if only it were actually funny, and the witness's reaction to the murder is absurdly inappropriate. If you want to paint someone into corner to have them not call the police, it has to be better than merely that they don't want to admit peeping with a telescope. This is murder , after all, let's respect that with some adequate explanations. That also applies to motive: You don't kill your beautiful young rich wife for the ""insurance"" ; rich people don't need life insurance.

De Palma makes good on his logline and brings the sleaze, shocks, laughs, and suspense as only he can.The story centers around a struggling actor who's just been dumped by his girlfriend (well, it's implied he was dumped since he walked in on her riding another guy) and he decides to take a new friend up on a housesitting offer. There's a wonderful bonus - the hot chick who lives across the street is known for dancing around naked every night and, since this house comes with a telescope, our hero begins to enjoy these nightly peep shows. He takes things up a notch when he decides to follow her around in the daytime and...well, I'll leave it at that, because Body Double is a film that's best to go in cold to.De Palma has a couple of terrific suspense set pieces here including a protracted drill murder and a stalk around a Los Angeles mall. Performances are good with Melanie Griffith stealing the entire movie as rough, hilariously blunt porn star Holly Body. Craig Wasson is a bit dry as our lead, Jake, but he does a fine job as the film progresses.Body Double isn't De Palma's best, but it's certainly worth a watch.",Body Double
114,JWBly,"Melanie Griffith nude, but that's about it.",2,5 May 2006,"Brian de Palma has certainly directed some brilliant films. CARRIE was bone-chilling and SCARFACE was memorable. THE UNTOUCHABLES gave us one of Sean Connery's best ""middle-aged"" performances.Unfortunately, like most talented directors, de Palma also has made some spectacular failures. BODY DOUBLE falls into this category. The plot is silly and predictable and the acting is atrocious. If you like Melanie Griffith, she does appear nude, but even this early in her career she proves that she simply cannot act at all. Add her lack of talent to her mediocre looks and one wonders why her career did not end with this film. I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this idiotic film. Despite Griffith's appearance, it's not even a good ""chick flick,"" so there is no reason to even rent it. Watch CARRIE again. That is de Palma at his best.",Body Double

Our lead man suffers a similar phobia and is enveloped by the same paranoia of a murder conspiracy involving the victim switch. Point of view shots are used in a similar vein and our leading man constantly speaks in his best James Stewart drawl. Other than lacking the customary Deplama split screen (which would have made the most sense in this of all Depalma films) ""Body Double"" is spectacular. Low budget elements are a deliberate mesh with the story of making a low budget horror, dated music is well represented. The plot, on the other hand, is filmed with the brilliant conventions we come to expect from depalma. dennis franz is not as raw as he was in ""Dressed to Kill"". Any NYPD Blue fan has got to check out ""Dressed To Kill"" to see the real detective at work. Here, you actually never know what is real and what is set-up making ""Body Double"" a quintessential thriller for all lovers of the genre.",Body Double
116,pfogertyca,DePalma Mixes His Two Favorite Things - Hitchcock and Porn,5,11 July 2021,"Brian DePalma picks the bones of his favorite director and and throws everything at us - Rear Window, Vertigo, Dial M for Murder. We even get a bit of Psycho, where the plot takes a complete 180-degree turn after a grisly event.The problem is that none of it really works, mainly because viewers have to do more than suspend their disbelief when it comes to the plot; they have to catapult it into outer space.Then there's the casting. Aside from Craig Wasson, who I thought embodied the ""average Joe"" character well, everyone else was a miss. Deborah Shelton, while beautiful to look at, clearly had her dialogue looped in (by actress Helen Shaver, it turns out) and expressed terror with all the gusto of a woman who had just opened up the top of her washing machine and discovered her colors had been mixed in with her whites.Melanie Griffith starts out playing Holly Body as a tough-as-nails porn star, but then suddenly evolves into a Lucille Ball parody. The behind-the-scenes story is that DePalma had wanted to cast real-life porn actress Annette Haven in the Holly Body role, but the studio nixed the idea. Haven probably would have brought more of a sense of realism to the character. DePalma did give Haven a consolation prize though, casting her as the faceless woman dancing in the window.Finally, there's the abrupt shift in the tone of the film, which may or may not have been intentional on DePalma's part (see Psycho reference above), but what makes the movie ultimately lose momentum. After the extremely violent scene halfway through the film, we turn to the seedy underworld of porn. Well, DePalma's fantasy of what porn is, anyway.The X-rated movie-within-a-movie that features Frankie Goes to Hollywood performing ""Relax"" is a big-budget Busby Berkeley-style musical extravaganza with a cast of hundreds and elaborate sets and costumes. A porn film has never been made that would resemble anything like what we see here. But we indulge DePalma nonetheless.After this, it's a rush to a ridiculous finale that highlights Griffith's attempt to do screwball comedy and that leaves the audience thinking, ""Really? That's the best ending you could come up?""The one scene that's really worth watching occurs during the rolling of the closing credits, where we get a behind-the-scenes look at how actual body doubles are used in movies and all the complexities involved.I'd skip this one if you're looking for a good DePalma film. Check out his underrated gem Blow Out instead.",Body Double
117,aldo-49527,Movie Double - De Palma Sits In For Hitchcock,9,7 July 2021,"Watching Body Double makes me think that we should often not be concerned with whether we like a movie (or for that matter any piece of art) and instead focus on trying to understand the intent of the artist(s) behind the work.Why does it have to be about us all the time?In the case of this mid-1980s film, I think De Palma was thinking ... what would the master do?Body Double isn't a Brian De Palma movie. It's a Brian De Palma and Alfred Hitchcock movie.In the mid-1950s, maybe no major Hollywood filmmaker dared to cinematically probe his id like Hitchcock did. In the 1980s De Palma used Hitchcockian film techniques to explore his own id. In fact, Hitchcock himself may have influenced De Palma's interest in voyeurism.Body Double is a fascinating look into the minds of De Palma/Hitchcock.",Body Double

119,moviestar26,Voyeurism At It's Best.,7,24 November 2009,"Brian De Palma is one of the few directors that has made a movie on possibly every genre that is in existence. Whether it has been a horror with 'carrie' or even action with 'mission impossible', he has proved that he can make a good movie regardless of the theme. He has never specialised on any particular genre, but has experimented with many different themes. This movie however is one of those that has never been a box office hit but has been criticised as a Hitchcock inspired feature. The movie is filled with many moments that are reminiscent of Hitchcock's style of suspense and camera work. Upon viewing it will seem like you are watching a combination of 'rear window' and 'psycho'. The male lead suffers from claustrophobia anxieties. This will indeed make a reference to the movie 'vertigo'. As James Stewart was afraid of heights. De Palma has been inspired and this is his attempt to pay homage to the classics of the 40s and 50s cinema era. The movie is truly a piece of work that is high in quality. The movie tackles the subject of voyeurism. But it is perceived in a enjoyable manner.**************************SPOILERs AHEAD****************************** Craig wasson is a struggling b grade horror movie director who after discovering another man with his wife has to find another residence. He meets Gregg henry who to wants to break in acting as well He gives Craig a special place to stay in. As a surprise Gregg informs him of a woman who gives a special private dance routine across the street. Craig is tempted to follow the woman (Deborah Shelton) where ever she goes. To his surprise he notices that an Indian is interested in her too. Caig warns her that she is being followed. But Deborah is aware. Later that night she is murdered by the Indian despite Craig's attempts to stop it from happening. A police detective has suspicions that Craig is behind it. However he is let off with a warning. While watching television that same night a porn actress (Melanie Griffith) dances in the exact similar manner. This urges Craig to want to meet Melanie to uncover the mystery behind the murder as he has doubts that it was most probably her that was dancing at night to his attention.*******************END OF SPOILERS*********************** Many movies on women murders have been made over the years; From 'laura' to 'twin peaks' to 'the gift'. Each has been a novel experience. However Body Double is of a different nature. The movie does not present to us a line up of suspects but we have to discover what the killer's motive is behind the murder. This element in fact reduces the suspense element. The movie is also devoid of many twists and turns plot wise, this reduces the level of intensity in goings on. However when the murder happens, the movie is in to the mid point. After that stage it is pretty self explanatory. It is difficult to understand why the killer would want to set Craig up as a witness, instead of framing him. The whole point was to frame him for the murder however this is not clear revealed in the movie, which I view as a potential flaw. Brian De Palma's direction is of top standard and the photography supports the movie well. There are many close up frames within the nail biting sequences. These actually enhance the standard of enjoyment. The murder and telescope sequences are well handled. To my surprise there was not a single scene without Craig wasson. The entire movie progresses with his involvement. Pino Donnagio's background score is sensually fabulous. The tracks are incorporated well in to the important scenes. They really enhance the viewing pleasure. Craig Wasson gives a good performance however he responds slow to certain situations. Deborah Shelton evokes eroticism in her character. She carries herself well. Everything from her clothes to looks are given top priority. It was disappointing that she did not have much scope to perform and if she had running time in acquaintance with Craig, it would have made one to more emotionally connect with the characters. Melanie Griffith did a good job. She has about 4 scenes in the movie, but her funny dialogues keeps her character in your mind after watching the movie. However I for certain would rather appreciate her acting abilities than her exposure.",Body Double

It's like a sloppy 70's leftover that you really just want to avoid.  However, it's hard to see how this movie could not have boosted Melanie Griffiths' career as she demonstrates her finesse as a porn star.  The story is choppy and strange but features a great nugget by Holly Johnson & Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The movie is a puzzler and it makes you wonder what sort of drugs the director (dePalma) and the crew were up to.  Give me some of that...

123,funeralfortheliving,Here's to starting a carrier six feet under!!!,10,18 November 2010,"WARNING!!!!! Don't read unless you have watched!!!!!!!!! Body double takes you into the mind of an eccentric struggling actor on a B movie set. Exploring his every fear we go into his mind and experience the pressure an actor feels trapped momentarily in purgatory between shots waiting for the director to yell action. About 95% of the story takes place in these minutes that turn to hours and every fear an actor can imagine in a few long minutes is entertained and played out in paranoid delusions. Body double presents its dream sequence story line in the form of a mystery thriller handing out clues but only giving the audience enough info to keep them interested till the end.The ending scene is a great pay off executed passively and metaphorically explaining the plot intelligently with a shower scene that might be over looked by most viewers. This scene perfectly plays out those hellish moments as Craig is forced to remain in position while the actresses body double is slipped in by showing the difficulty in making the shots work.But what does it all mean? What it says basically is in Hollywood to survive as an actor sometimes you have to do compromising things with your carrier and always worry that you'll be type cast. And in Craig Wasson's case he feels his part is perverted and could be viewed by others as pornographic. So for all you who haven't watched it as many times as I have give it another watch remembering only the very start and end are real.The rest of the film is an exaggerated story of scenarios the actor is creating in his mind between shots. This is something we all do as humans, create bias imaginary situations out of our fears and prejudices. We create a story and then we act.Update: I have read other comments and reviews in opposition to mine and others who get it. Before you try and redact us go listen to the old time radio show called The Lift. It is about a claustrophobic man who gets locked into a elevator and imagines an entire series of horrific events that turn out to be only in the mind. Depalma takes this further with the character being an actor.",Body Double

The lady who gets murdered (I forget her name) doesn't even give a performance, she just shows up.  The very worst aspects of DePalma's misogyny are thrown in your face.  And a porn movie with a 100 extras and giant sets-what's up with that?Still, just as pure cinematic storytelling, this soars above all that, I think.

126,bornskeptic,"So much to hate, and so much to love about this movie.",7,8 March 2020,"I first saw this in the mid 80's on VCR tape. First thought - like every other young man who saw it naturally freeze framed Barbara Crampton's 10 second scene, among others. That was also my overriding impression of the movie - that it was borderline adult movie. It was also vile and perverted, scary and gross, and held an almost mythical place in my memory of 80's cinema. I wasn't entirely fooled by the plot (spoiler-I thought Gloria's husband in the early scene was Sam but didn't know the Indian was the same guy) but I also loved how it manipulated both Jake and the audience to get where it needed. The story and it's contrivances was a weak point to the movie but also one of it's charms. It was so silly and far fetched but it made me chuckle too. Some other nits to pick was the casting of the lead. I know he was supposed to be Joe Average and a likeable schlub but he was so frustratingly weak and stupid it drove me a little batty. At the same time, the movie wouldn't have felt the same without Wasson and how he played Jake so maybe my criticism of him is exactly what DePalma wanted. I just found him distractingly limp. However I loved Gregg Henry as Sam. He was perfect...charming, sleazy, unnerving. Much has been said of Griffith and whereas I also found her to be perfect for the role, her voice in this (and her entire career really) drove me crazy. So the question has to be when it comes to a 30+ yr old film...how does it hold up today? In a way, it doesn't for a modern audience member that can see plot twists coming a block away. But the twists of the story are not the only thing to like in this as I already mentioned. There is also a history of years worth of DePalma bashing since this came out. Many saw this movie as the apogee of DePalma's excesses. But for a fan, it was 2 hours of nirvana. It was fun, funny, stupid, exciting, sexy, self-indulgent, grotesque...everything that people who love DePalma, love him for.",Body Double

Borrowing from `Rear Window' with a little `Vertigo' thrown in, add Tippi Hedren's daughter and you get De Palma either paying homage to the original cinematic master of suspense or a dissection of his oeuvre.  Jake is a struggling actor who tangles himself up in a tale of mystery and obsession.  After a series of mishaps, he finds himself ogling a neighboring woman from the window of his swanky temporary digs (think Star Trek Enterprise) up in the Hollywood hills. The deeper he digs into the story unfolding before his eyes, the more he is forced to confront his fears and deal with his own sexuality.  The film has a similar structure to De Palma's `Dressed to Kill,' and his tongue is pressed even further into his cheek.  The usual De Palma jolts and yuks are there, but, perhaps not with as great of a frequency.  The running time is a flabby 114 minutes, the length of which is most felt during the first half.  He has some innocuous fun with a `music video' rendition of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's hit song `Relax,' as well as the closing credits.

Carrie is nothing short of brilliant.Dressed to Kill out Hitchcock's Hitchcock.Body Bouble, however, is an ill advised attempt at some sort of self satire or a bizarre message to his critics.Watch DePalma have fun with the now patented EVERYTHING from his femme fatale, cool blond, voyeurism, standard chase scene, any clique in the book of erotic thrillers is here and used. The problem is the audience isn't having any fun..just memories of better made thrillers by the same director.DePalma once said that he doesn't copy Hitchcock. He's just using the film language or ""palate"" Hitchcock presented to filmmakers. Sure DePalma is all style but here it is ALL stylistic re-treads-not very interesting.Nothing, nothing, nothing is fresh and the satire doesn't ring true.We get Craig Wasson looking glum for two hours.It just looks like someone doing a bad DePalma imitation-only its DePalma. The fact that this was made in 1984 (MID CAREER for the man) is sad too when the director should have been experimenting with new techniques and a new variation on the thriller formula.I'll take it a step further and say the real feeling you have is what it's like watching a third rate Hitchcock film. Or listening to Stone Temple Pilots instead of Pearl Jam instead of Led Zepplelin..but I digress.The performances: here DePalma's staging handcuffs all the actors with the one exception of a very charming Melanie Griffith in her breakthrough role of Holly Body. Usually DePalma can get GREAT performances out of everyone. Here, it looks like a bad SNL sketch about his movies. Everyone looks so bored or afraid to hit their mark or wondering what's at the Kraft's food table today.So is it a little fun? No. Watching Brian DePalma doing DePalma doing Hitchcock is just sad.

De Palma manages to capture the essence of Hitchcock and Scorsese and I swear I saw a little bit of Spielberg in there too, but this amazing piece of 80s film noir is top notch still. Sure, it comes with some 80s cheesiness, but that just helps to emphasize the almost dream-like craziness that our anti-hero and peeper, Jake (Craig Wasson), experiences. This would be the film that made Melanie Griffith a star (of course she would ruin that fame by turning into a bitch and a pain in the ass to work with by the time 15 years went by), and it garnered her a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actress. It also featured a then unknown band named Frankie Goes to Hollywood doing their classic song about sex, ""Relax"". Many twists and turns in a plot full of deception and voyeurism. Wasson does an amazing job of conveying to the audience a character that imbues sympathy and support even though he tends to do things a little bit on the creepy side. I was worried that the sands of time may have made this film dated, but I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case. This is still a blast and a must see for Movie-Buffs.

Body Double has so many unlikely coincidences, so many unrealistic and ridiculous scenes, it actually works pretty well as a comedy. De Palma enthusiasts often find themselves defending this film, but anyone with half a brain can easily see it for what it is. Bad acting, dreadful writing, and a show-off director who thinks he can guild a turd with weird camera angles and slow motion. Don't get me wrong, the man has talent. Scarface, Untouchables, Carrie, Casualties of War and so fourth. But sadly, for every good film Brian De Palma has turned out, there are more than a few Femme Fatals and Dressed to Kills and Blow Outs to remind intelligent viewers he's drastically overrated. If the Japanese had been half as inept, Pearl Harbor would have been funnier than the Bay of Pigs.

Of course there is a resemblance between Brian DePalma's direction of Body Double and of Hitchcock's works like Rear Window for example. That's the whole point. It's no secret that DePalma believed that Hitch was a genius at film making  and that many of his films are an homage to the great director.Body Double is more than just a remake of a Hitchcock film. DePalma is also showing us his fascination with the Porn Industry and how he sees that mainstream Hollywood and Porn is one and the same. To emphasize this point, DePalma uses relatively unknown actors in the main roles. Melanie Griffith had not yet hit it big in the industry and was more than willing to display her body in some very graphic scenes. Everything is a double in this movie. Hollywood doubles for Porn where it can show graphic violence instead of graphic sex and be released under the credentials of a major studio. Actors will prostitute themselves for a role which will supposedly gain them credibility; when in the end, they can be just as used and exploited by legitimate Hollywood directors and producers as they would be in any porn film.Body Double is DePalma's masterpiece and one of the great films of the 80's.",Body Double

Obsession, Carrie, Dressed To Kill and Blowout were visually stunning and emotional thrillers. After the swamp of female-in-jeopardy movies started by Halloween, Friday The 13th and paler imitations, there was a backlash against them.  As a superior director of these suspense pictures DePalma was criticized savagely and you can see some of his reaction in Body Double after which he proved his versatility with crime (Scarface, The Untouchables) and drama pictures (Casualties Of War).Using elements of Rear Window (Craig Wasson sees a murder being committed but is powerless to stop it) and Vertigo (he fears confined spaces), DePalma weaves a suspenseful plot.  The acting is headed by Melanie Griffith's breakthrough performance in which she manages to combine a weary knowledge of the world with a sweet innocence.Placing his main character as an actor in horror films, he is able to take some potshots at the voyeuristic audience (what all movie lovers are) in that we crave sex & violence (the film's final scene symbolizes this) but in effect this is what life and death is all about.",Body Double

If i ever get amnesia, this is going to be one of the first movies that i watch.  I know that alot of other people dont feel as strongly as i do about this movie, but hey, that is their problem, atleast i can enjoy a movie for what it's worth.  An instant classic.  ****",Body Double
140,jabaw1,De Palma + Sex + Murder = Above Par Thriller,7,24 November 2006,"Although many critics and viewers rubbished this film, it deserves a much larger amount of praise. Many people criticized this movie for its nudity and gore, but if they think this is bad, they definitely wouldn't like movies such as Basic Instinct. Both Body Double and Basic Instinct are in my opinion terrific films, and likewise both of them received a high amount of bad publicity and controversy for its subject matter. Although both films do have a fair amount of violence etc., neither of them have been appreciated for their true beauty.This film is similar to De Palma's previous work Obsession, which was very similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. In this film, Craig Wasson stars as a struggling actor Jake Scully, who witnesses a grisly murder, yet everything isn't as it seems....This film contains many memorable sequences, most notable the murder scene. Many people were a bit confused about the ending of the film, including me, but it doesn't ruin the story very much at all.Overall, this is an excellent piece of film-making, which deserves a much wider audience than your average crime flick.",Body Double
141,nils_asther,Masterpiece,10,10 January 2017,"Please, stop describing it as ""hitchcockian"" at all! De Palma is a genius by his own merits. This movie proves again his authorial identity, as well as his prominent attitude to analyze psycho- social issues.Here Hollywood, ""The Industry"", is totally depicted during the hedonistic-Reagan's era. It was 1984. De Palma's camera takes are undoubtedly referred to the Hitchcock's school but there is MORE, I would personally assert.The criticism De Palma always displayed in every work he made is pretty faraway from the sugarcoated studios' standards agreements. Last BUT VERY NOT LEAST: this flick endures being a total landscape's eye about L.A. Visually from Lautner's Chemosphere House atop Mulholland Dr. to few Westwood and Beverly Hills spots, up till the S.ta Monica surroundings. This is a historical film in my opinion. This Los Angeles too. Ciao belli!",Body Double
142,poly-nikes,Terrible film,3,19 July 2012,"Great God, what a terrible film. Many films ""date"" badly, but this one is possibly the worst I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. It comes across as a hopelessly amateurish movie, rather than a mainstream Hollywood production. You can figure out who the killer is before too long -- even a blind man could tell the guy is wearing a hokey rubber mask. I've seen better makeup on children calling at my house on Halloween. And the murder, with the cord of the electric drill popping out of the wall at the last minute -- a break, render unto me one. Even the over-rated Hitchcock wasn't that lame, although he came pretty close at times.Finally, does anybody out there think that Craig Wasson looks like the love child of Jeff Bridges and Bill Maher? That was so distracting to me, that, even if the film had been any good, I couldn't have sat back and enjoyed it.",Body Double

Rented Live and Die in L.A. several times.  Lethal Weapon--what happened? In the case of Body Double, the characters (especially Jack), that wonderfully captured Hollywood feel and scenery, the nothing-is-as-it-seems symbolism right from the opening credits and that desert shot that turns into a backdrop, the ""Relax"" orchestration, and music generally, all stay with you vividly after -- for this reason alone it rates as a very good, successful film.

I find it funny that the negative reviews all seem to have figured out the mystery early. Thou protested too much; I don't buy into their ""it's too dated"" smack. The time and place of this Hollywood is imaginative and really cool. If one needs historical verisimilitude, watch documentaries. This is a fun ride with all the obsessions of DePalma's work (and Hitch, and Powell's Peeping Tom); voyeurism, etc. The fun is in the details and the affect of scenes, not their logic. Since when does an effective thriller need hard cold logic? I've just watched it again on cable and all the haters are just people looking to hate.

149,drkdglr13,"Stylish, but inferior De Palma...",6,8 October 2020,"As a fan of Brian De Palma and for those not schooled in all things Hitchcock, Body Double is a highly visual, erotic murder mystery. It's a film that wears its influences on its sleeve with borrowed plot points from Dressed To Kill, Dial M For Murder, Rear Window and Vertigo. We have the actor angle, the jilted lover, the harlots, the ""mystery"" man, the obsession, witness to murder, claustrophobic & voyeuristic angles, but it is set in the modern day world of Hollywood & the Adult Entertainment Industry.The problem is De Palma makes the audience feel pretty dumb since any thinking viewer can figure out the plot twists in 5 minutes. And Craig Wasson's performance is so laughable that we have a hard time remembering his character is a method actor who is actually taking acting classes. The one bright spot is Melanie Griffith, who unfortunately shows up an hour into the film. People tend to forget she was nominated for a Golden Globe as Holly Body and it's really hard to complain when we get to look at her in her prime.Flaws aside, Body Double has since reached cult status. It is beautifully shot and has some great locations (the Chemosphere house) as well as some interesting parallels that we as the audience are only intended to see (i.e., the long kiss in the tunnel). But in comparison to De Palma's other works, this will always come across as vastly inferior.",Body Double
150,magnoliafanboy,A great film and several levels.,10,26 January 2004,"One of the best films of the 1980's, and of Brian De Palma's career. This is taken the wrong way by many who view it on face value.  It says on the video box and poster, ""You can't believe what you see"".  That is proven when the title of the film pops on the screen over a desert back drop, then the back drop slides to the side and we see it was just a background for a movie set.  We are decieved right away and I think that is what your average film goer hates about this movie and De Palma in general.  He loves to play games with the viewer. Yes, you are watching a mystery thriller with eroticism and murder thrown in.  To view the film in this perspective is fine. But to also view it as an metaphor for the Hollywood Film Business works great too. Everyone in the film, who is innocent, is wronged and used.  Craig Wasson and Griffith's characters are actors themselves and get put through the rat race of Los Angeles all while trying to hold onto their identity. But each one of them find themselves taking on different personas and roles.This was De Palma's commentary on how much he despised the Hollywood System. Concerning the accusations of ripping of Hitcock, well yes he does so-but they are very exagerated. The exageration is done for the purpose to anger many.  He has been accused of ripping Hitch off since he did Sisters and up until Dressed to Kill. He simply takes great tools invented by the Master and makes use of them. So this film is in a way his way of saying, ""You're calling me a theif, alright then I will be a theif"". Watch this movie. Enjoy it. It is entertainment, but if you'd like you can take another look on secondary viewing for great subtext and metaphor.",Body Double
151,mcilhany,Suspense! Originality! Uninhibited yet Tasteful Sexuality! Marvelous Movie!,10,25 December 2005,"Body Double is my favorite De Palma film, and he sure is one hec of a director! Even now, he continues to impress me with his breadth and wide variety of ideas and interpretations. I absolutely love this film, the acting is marvelous- the suspense and the Hitchcock element along with the sassy,cool sense of humor that's so unique to Melanie Griffith all put together into this one-of-a-kind film. It is so unfortunate that anyone would claim this movie is just a ""copy"", or ""stealing"" or attempt of a copy of Hitchcock. I adore Hitchcock and this movie if anything, pays real tribute to him in the sense that it had it's own feel...Hitchcock style.. but definitely it's own thing. And I mean jeez, what so wrong about emulating a style anyway? Hitchcock is dead, so unless people want to be stuck watching old, old movies the rest of their life they'd better begin to open their minds. If anything Hitchcock's memory could only be strengthened by a movie like this...modern, but reminiscent of the older styles. It's a combination of styles. It sure makes me think about Hitchcock when I see it, and yet opens new doorways laced with De Palma flavor.Craig Wasson is awesome. Totally believable in his role, and Gregg Henry (who is also to be seen briefly, but distinctly, in Scarface) is fabulous and convincing as well. I love how relatively unknowns were cast in this movie. Deborah Shelton is so beautiful, almost too beautiful for words. I remember seeing her in Dallas the TV show and was always surprised she wasn't absolutely everywhere. But ultimately that's part of what makes this movie so special... it's full of treats and surprises. I'd tell more, but I really don't want to spoil it... you have to see it.One thing though, if you are uncomfortable with movies with sex and sexuality in them, this movie may not be for you. However, this movie is very tasteful in my opinion; the main characters who engage in sexual activity come across as sensitive, human, and caring. The sexual aspect of this particular movie is in my opinion exhilarating (how it should be :)) and actually quite charming.I saw this movie many, many years ago for the first time and it has stuck with me throughout the years as one of the most unique, eye catching, and successfully formulated movies ever.10/10.",Body Double

This movie has everything, suspense, comedy, sex, gore! its one i'm proud to have in my collection. Brian in my eyes along with David Fincher is one of hollywoods finest directors- and this is in my opinion one of his greatest works. People keep slating the plot! what planet are you on! just go along with the ride and stop reading between the lines.

This movie deserves to be among the best in thriller category. And the plot is nothing about what I thought of.Reminds me of Rear Window (1954), that Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. One does not know where this movie is going until 3/4th of the movie. It is highly underrated with ratings of 6.4 . Until the 3/4 of the film, this movie seems empty(storyless) but its fun and unexpected when the plot unfolds.There is lot to watch in this movie - sex act/butt act of Melanie Griffith, acting of Craig Wasson, story, suspense, murder, comedy.

It is stirs up those element of the human psychic without been preachy or should i say in Hollywood style .

156,davidchisholm,Sleazy But Compelling Thriller,8,30 August 2012,"Body Double is one of Brian DePalma's best thrillers to come out of the early '80s. It is a good companion piece to Dressed To Kill and Blowout. The film is both a sex thriller and a semi-satire of Hollywood as seen though the struggling actor's point of view. DePalma tends to wallow the film in voyeurism and sleaze especially scenes that the viewer into the world of pornography but it's hard to take your eyes off it because it is a compelling thriller. DePalma was also smart to cast a relatively unknown actor in the lead role instead of a big name actor. Craig Wasson gives a good performance as Jake Scully, a struggling actor who suffers from a severe case of claustrophobia which costs him a lead role in a ""B"" horror movie. To make matters worst he walks in on his girlfriend having sex with another guy. Now out on his ass - jobless and homeless - we see Jake at various bad auditions and sleeping in hotel lobbies. At these auditions he runs into another actor named Sam Bruchard (Gregg Henry), a slick but friendly guy who is all to eager to help Jake out by giving a place to stay in a sphere shaped house up the hills while he's out of town on a gig. Sam also entices Jake to peep across the road at a beautiful woman (Deborah Shelton) who likes to do an erotic dance every night in lingerie. Jake becomes obsessed with this woman and when he watching her at home he sees her get abused by her brute of a husband and one night sees a disfigured looking Indian watching and then stalking her. This leads to Jake following her around trying to protect her from immanent danger but his fruitless attempts lead him to witnessing a brutal murder which leads him to try and solve this puzzle himself by going undercover in the porn business where he meets porn star Holly Body played by a young and then unknown Melanie Griffith (who is great) who may just be a major key to this mystery. I love the performances by the three leads. Craig Wasson was effective as a nerdy and naive character. You always feel like your a step ahead of him but he pulled the part off. Gregg Henry has made a career at playing slimy villains and here he doesn't disappoint and Melanie Griffith is convincing as a tough talking and sexy porn star. I recommend this film to anyone who likes Brian DePalma's films. He's been a gutsy filmmaker when it comes to explicit subject matter that no other director of his generation have dare to explore.",Body Double

I especially like the performance by leading man Craig Wasson; I'm surprised I haven't seen him in more feature films.  De Palma like to emulate Hitchcock, and I kind of relate this movie to a modern version of one of my all time favorites, Rear Window.  What I like about the movie is that it doesn't take it's self to seriously, although it is a thriller.

Brian DePalma is very hit and miss. He has made more misses than hits and I can only hope that he doesn't butcher Black Dahlia the way he has most of his other projects. This movie sucked. The fact that anyone tries to defend this junk is comical. We all have out directors that we admire, but when they make a piece of junk there is no need to defend it against what it really is.

After the successes of 'Carrie' and 'Dressed to Kill', this is a sadly disappointing piece of crap. The script/screenplay by Brian De Palma and Robert J. Avrech is simply awful. The plot is ludicrous by any standard, and has more inconsistencies than O.J.s testimony. The leading man is the biggest idiot in screen history. This is supposed to be suspense, but Wasson's character makes Mr. Bean look like James Bond. Craig Wasson (the lead actor) is the worst leading man I've seen in many years. Melanie Griffith is the only bright light. She is cute and fairly believable in her small role. This film has been described as an 'homage' to Hitchcock. In fact, this is a blatant rip-off of Hitchcock, with a plot ripped screaming from the still-warm corpses of  both 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo'.",Body Double

De Palma set up those two basic ideas into a story that's really enjoyable and intense same time. Especially when you are in the knowledge of the movies of the 40s and 50s and the art of making a thriller you are just going to be pleased.My guess is that De Palma made this movie out of pure pleasure, doing all those great stuff with claustrophobia, sexual need, voyeurism, grotesque murder, and most of all terrifying suspense.The murder sequence was in my opinion of a well crafted exercise in suspense. You fear, then you hope, then you try to guess, it goes all right, then all wrong, the hero comes, it seems at right time, but still too late, it all goes on and on and you can't believe it happened. Loved and hated the sequence, for film-making and emotional purposes.Not the greatest, but definitely one of De Palmas best.",Body Double

Others think it's absolute crap. To be honest, I think it is spectacular AND crappy, not at the same time, but from one half to the other.The first half of the movie, aka the cool circular house, the voyeurism, the Indian, the mall sequence, the beach sequence, the drill sequence, is quite frankly one of my favorite 50 minutes of any movie, anytime, anywhere. It succeeds on being scary, romantic, sensual, elegant, creepy, exciting, beautiful, nasty, flowing, and any thing else one could want from a film. SO spectacular. I mean take out the opening credits and start the movie right when ""Body Double"" appears on the screen (take out the acting class scene) and you have a masterpiece hour long mini-film. If someone asks me why I love movies; 2001, Lawrence Of Arabia, Halloween, Kubrick, etc. appear as reasons, but so does the first hour of Body Double. Just immaculately gorgeous and genius. Then to the 2nd half. Trashy, pointless garbage. So far below the standard of the first half. Don't even watch it anymore. Not even going to waste my time describing why it sucks. It just does. But that first half alone, makes it one of my top handful of hours in all of movies. Truly beyond wonderful.

I was expecting yet another edge of your seat thriller similar to Dressed to Kill and Carrie, and I indeed was treated to one. However, it just wasn't as good as his previous or even as good as his latest, Femme Fatale. Don't get me wrong, the film is great. Especially, DePalma's superb directing style. However, I felt he could have integrated some more of his signature techniques, like more slow motion scenes and perhaps some split screen sequences to enhance some of the action and tension. However, all in all the film wasn't bad. The ""Vertigo""-like mall sequence was great and the driller killer sequence was pure DePalma with it's extreme visual style.

After ""Blow Out"" flopped financially and subsequently ""Scarface"" ignited a large amount of controversy, I think De Palma was in a combative, negative place. His script for ""Body Double"" is self-parodic - he seems to be deliberately crafting a sleazy thriller to spite his critics at that time. ""Body Double"" is entertaining and often quite funny - the scenes with Melanie Griffith are fun. But it's a bad movie, plain and simple.

It was as if De Palma and his writers couldn't figure out how to end this nonsensical piece, so they added a nonsensical ending that tracked not at all with the plot. Poor Craig Wasson spends most of the tedious picture looking bewildered, bothered and more bewildered -- surely he was directed this way,because he's a better actor than this. One spoiler example of the improbability of this story: Wasson chases the killer, who has kidnapped Griffin, to a darkened dam property.

Hitchcock or not, this is still a horrible movie. I like De Palma's work, but I just can't stand this movie. I couldn't believe that it was made after Scarface. It was aesthetically pleasing, but the story was predictable and at times far fetched. Scully is lucky that the woman he just happened to be stalking was complete oblivious and the part where they meet on the beach was just so unbelievable. This movie was painful to watch. If I saw this late at night on Showtime I probably would have liked it more, but to believe that this movie was a theatrical release boggles my mind.

177,hanif30,Great Movie!,8,11 March 2006,"This film was fairly hard to track down initially in England, but now that I have it I watch it regularly and really enjoy it. It is essentially a bad B movie but there is something quite hypnotic in it,s music and pace that compels this avid viewer!. It's such an 80's film at times and so cheesy but hey the 80's were my favourite time period.......! I actually think that Craig Wasson can really act and he does the whole bewildered look to a tee and this was a time when Melanie Griffiths was quite attractive as well. Not to mention Deborah Shelton who was and still maybe one of the best looking American actresses of that time. I thought the music was amazing and have tried in vain to track down a soundtrack album to the movie. What can i say? I really like this film!",Body Double
178,alakin0012,Body Double extra,8,4 November 2013,"The movie is one of my all time favorites, the acting is pretty good, the director really tapped into the actual feeling of suffering from claustrophobia, the build up to the crime scene is classic and the actress playing the real victim is wonderful. It was very nice to see Melanie Griffith playing something sensual instead of a complete bubble head. The sets are realistic and there just enough special lighting to make the whole film feel real. We had fun trying to figure out who was who and who wasn't. This one is a cult classic. Craig Wasson is the only person who could play Jake. He made Jake come alive, in more ways than one. The biggest kick was seeing JEFF DANIELS as an extra in the film. He is shown twice, waiting in the casting room. He is very young, probably about 20 years old and his hair is short. He is sitting next to Jake... check it out.",Body Double
179,MooTownJANEboardLord,True Aussies Love Body Double,9,13 July 2014,"""Body Double"" represents a crowning cinematic moment for ""sometimes"" cult film director Brian De Palma. The film itself would last in the memories of generations to come creating its own brand of cult following. Masterfully executed with just the right blend of tension, music, and character creativity, ""Body Double"" would carry over form its 1984 debut as a stand alone film to remember.That equally memorable track by composer Pino Donaggio would attach itself to the film as not just a score piece but an identity signaling the famous scenes executed by Melanie Griffith. Melanie would capture the attraction of drooling fan boys as the highly sexually alluring Holly Body. It probably didn't hurt that she played the role of a p0rn actress in the film. Often I found myself coming back to the movie to see how ""often"" I could recognize Melanie's face in that opener solo dance. Melanie had just come from the production of ""Fear City"", though it is her role in ""Body Double"" that would remain a staple role for her career. Soon after she went on to do the additionally great role in the film ""Something Wild"".Body Double"" is one of film great early offerings full of surprise, mystery and reveal . Fans of the director's work will most certainly have to place this among his best. Highly recommended with years of return.",Body Double
180,YouWillNeverStopWASP,Classic... G'Day Mate!,9,13 July 2014,"Brian De Palma's thriller Body Double is a lurid, violent, perplexing, mesmerizing and sometimes infuriating train wreck of a film. As New York Times critic Vincent Canby observed, ""Brian De Palma goes too far, which may be not only the most consistent quality through all his films but also the most important and, possibly, the most endearing. Each of his films is guaranteed to offend some of the people all of the time, including his staunchest admirers. He never leaves well enough alone."" De Palma clearly was influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, and Body Double is an homage to both Rear Window and Vertigo. It is stylishly directed, beautifully photographed, and well-acted. Whether those positive attributes outweigh the film's outlandish implausibilities may be a matter of taste. Like a train wreck, it is often difficult to look at it but it is nearly impossible to turn away from.",Body Double
181,pitcher-1,"Similar in some ways to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""",8,1 June 2006,"I had heard about ""Body Double"" for many years before I watched it. When it arrived on the scene, I was not familiar with the term ""body double"" and had no idea about the plot. In some ways, this movie might be considered a kinky remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"", but the ending is definitely something new. ""Body Double"" is fun to watch, but is sometimes difficult to follow. In addition, suspension of disbelief can be a valuable aid to enjoyment. I would recommend this movie as light entertainment for a mature group. Even though it is described as a suspense thriller, I think there is a lot of tongue-in-cheek here. The mature group that has watched ""Body Double"" will probably want to spend a little time trying to figure out what they saw.",Body Double

183,sspelling1,A great movie! Tremendously underrated and overlooked,10,17 December 2005,"This is a terrific murder mystery / comedy / erotic thriller, and Brian De Palma's next flick after Scarface. Let yourself go along with it for a really fun ride. The style is tongue in cheek, masterful film-making including the usual ballet camera work and wonderfully interesting imaginative staging. It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making this overlooked gem! The star, a young Craig Wasson gives an Oscar caliber performance overlooked by all the critics. What gives with this? Scorsese never won an Oscar for best director either, so the fix must be in. He carries the entire movie and is in practically every scene. An unbelievably great performance! This actor never made it big to the big time, but if you want to see a terrific real actor providing a stunning display of his chops, you must check this flick. Truly one of the great murder mysteries of all time. A real find.",Body Double
184,madaglasscar,DePalma blends wanabee Hicthcock with porn obsession,1,19 February 2006,"During my entire viewing of this piece of crap I desperately wanted to believe that it was all a joke, some sort of well intentioned but poorly executed black satire. I could've appreciated that, given that I did have several laughs of total disbelief at several, well actually most, moments of the film. Unfortunately, I was convinced by the end that any laughs inspired from me were unintended by the filmmaker, the overrated DePalma, who, as usual, is indulgent, lazy, boring and at times just plain stupid in his vain efforts to put an audience at the edge of their seats with suspenseful anticipation. Instead, we figure out in the first ten minutes exactly what is going to happen (my wife called it just as I thought it) leaving DePalma no choice but to distract us from his ""Rear Window"" meets ""Vertigo"" meets the toilet ripoff foray by spiraling the main character into the early 80's porn underworld, where he has really passionate sex with a porn diva that reminds him of a woman whose panties he stole and watched get brutally murdered. Oh yeah, and her dog bit him too. Good god, this movie's a train wreck, watch it if you don't believe me. I'm telling you, it might be genius if it was a joke, but it's not, so it's just bad. Really bad. And Scarface sucks too. So does Snakeyes. And Mission Impossible.",Body Double
