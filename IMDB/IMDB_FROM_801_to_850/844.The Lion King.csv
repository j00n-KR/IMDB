0,TheLittleSongbird,Doesn't roar enough,6,3 December 2019,"1994's 'The Lion King' is not just one of my favourite Disney films, it is also one of my favourite animated films and one of my favourites overall. Beautiful animation, some of Disney's most iconic songs and amazing score, an entertaining and powerful story with unforgettable moments, terrific voices (especially James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons) and joint best beginning to a Disney film alongside 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.Disney's live action films are often frowned upon, they often have been described as pointless and many feel that Disney are running out of ideas. Can totally understand this, as the small handful that have been made so far have not really been necessary but the quality of them have varied. 'Cinderella' and 'The Jungle Book' were great and by far the best of the remakes, but the rest have left me mixed. Will admit to not really seeing the point of this version and was not massively impressed by the trailer, but saw it anyway being such a fan of Disney and because my sister desperately wanted to see it. Watching it way back when it first came out but with being behind with my reviewing it took me to now to review it, it was a little better than expected and not as bad as others have said. My sister did like it a lot better than me, with my feelings being quite lukewarm. Am really trying not to compare and try and judge it on its own terms, but sometimes it is hard when the quality of a remake, follow up or another adaptation is very far removed from something so good and that is the case with comparing both 'The Lion King' films.'The Lion King' (2019) does have good things. The best thing about it by a mile is the visuals, which are absolutely fantastic. Something of a technical achievement, with the scenery being breathtaking in every sense (""Circle of Life"" being a notable example) and the characters (excepting their eyes needing more expression) blend very realistically in a way where one gets the sense that this was a nature documentary. The score is still powerful, especially in the stampede and one of Disnney's most iconic tear-jerkers. Have always loved the songs, and with two exceptions they still make an impact. ""Circle of Life"" is truly awe-inspiring and the closest the film came to making me cry.Most of the dialogue has some moments of humour (Timon and Pumbaa) and tension (the hyenas). The story has its moments. Can not praise ""Circle of Life"" enough, Timon and Pumbaa are amusing and the stampede is intense, not goosebump-inducing though, even though everybody who has seen the original will know the outcome. Making the hyenas scarier and fleshing out the lionesses (a little) more were good moves. Actually thought that a lot of the voice work was not bad at all, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan being so much fun and by far the best faring of the voices, they were clearly having fun too with the improvising and their comic timing is full of exuberance not obvious elsewhere. Florence Kasumba's Shenzai is very different, the opposite in fact, to Whoopi Goldberg's, and the more sinister edge worked very well. James Earl Jones, the only voice actor to reprise his role, still has Mufasa's booming dignity and Donald Glover does quite well.Didn't care for some however. Was mixed on John Oliver, who is fun but overdoes it at times. Beyonce comes over as very out of place, her voice not fitting how Nala looks, and she even sounded bored. Chiwetel Eijofor, a good actor who was brilliant in '12 Years a Slave', was the biggest disappointment, found him too subdued for Scar and he is nowhere near as menacing or enjoys himself as much as Irons (whose voice work is some of the best for any Disney, and animated, film). While ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" come off well (especially ""Circle of Life""), ""Be Prepared"" was bizarre and quite over the top, what a way to waste one of the greatest Disney villain songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was reminiscent of decent at best karaoke. ""Spirit"" is even worse, that did not fit within the film and was more an excuse for Beyonce to show off her vocal chops and have actually heard much better singing from her.Excepting the hyenas being scarier, some additional dialogue and the lionesses being more fleshed out, 'The Lion King' suffers from being too faithful and not having enough of its own identity. Too many of the scenes are near-carbon copies with only fleeting moments of heart and soul, mostly the film emotionally is very bland. The big death scene, heart-wrenching before, is treated in too throwaway a fashion. The additional dialogue and any interpolations are not for the better either and actually rather jar, while the cuts and changes were not necessary. The eyes and facial expressions for the characters, especially Scar, lack nuance and are at times borderline creepy.Summing up, found a lot to like but was disappointed overall. 6/10",The Lion King
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than the original,5,19 March 2020,"Unusually, here's one live action remake that I preferred to the original, although I should say that I have no love or affinity for the Disney movies of old; even as a kid I remember avoiding them where I could, finding them twee and unfunny even then. If the original animation left me bored rigid, this one's a step up in the right direction. The excellent CGI effects surpass the old-fashioned cartoon look of the original movie and I couldn't fault them for the most part. The voice cast are nothing special (aside from James Earl Jones) and the songs aren't handled in as iconic a way as the original film, but otherwise this is fairly watchable viewing.",The Lion King
2,SnoopyStyle,respect and making dough,6,11 September 2019,"It's the realistic CGI rendering of the 1994 Disney animated classic. I don't love the original but I do respect the Shakespearian jungle book. It hasn't changed for this new version. I still don't like Simba but a little less this time. Instead of a brat, he's more of a clueless kid. Scar's villainy seems less cartoonish and more threatening. It's the heart of the change for the new movie. The CGI rendering is very realistic. The cartoon animation is a memory in the back of the mind. I'm reminded of all the nature films and that's where the trouble begins. While the rendering is correct, these are not real animals. It's jerry-rigging a human story into the animal kingdom. For some reason, it's fine for a cartoon since that's fake. This feels real and yet it's fake. That dichotomy annoys me. So different things annoy me in the two versions of this movie. I still respect the heck out of it although Disney is not adding to the culture by continuously redoing the same movies.",The Lion King
3,Horst_In_Translation,"I think it was a triumph, a thing of beauty",8,28 July 2019,"Okay what do I have to say this is of course a remake of the famous animation film classic ""The Lion King"" from the 1990s. I could end here. But I won't. First things first: It runs for slightly under two hours and was directed by Jon Favreau. I will spare you the names of the writers. Also it has been a long time since I watched the original film I just mentioned, so I won't really talk about similarities and differences, just talk a bit about this new 2019 movie here taking the newest animation techniques and visual progress to elaborate once again on this classic. I must say I was a bit skeptical knowing the story really and all the characters if the film could win me over because sometimes when I in detail know about the plot I am struggling a bit with that, but it was not a problem here by any means. I had a really great time. I was either glued to the screen in the more serious moments or just smiling permanently during the lighter sequences. You will laugh a lot seeing this one too. Just a few examples the whole Hakuna Matata sequence, the brief ""Lion sleeps tonight"", Pumbaa going rogue after the bodyshaming that happens towards the end of the film etc. With how funny he is we forgot that he is also a pretty strong wild animal I guess. So yes Timon and Pumbaa really brought in some great comedic delight that was badly needed with how serious everything else was most of the time. I am of course mostly referring to the scenes with Scar. The Mufasa death sequence got me, but what I found even more emotional were the scenes with the night sky (and the foreshadowing coming with it), first the father-son scene with the stars and old kings looking down on them which was really touching (I'm just a sucker for scenes involving star-studded skies) and second occasion same location with Timon and Pumbaa next to Simba. Also how he and Nala met each other again with their playful fighting was really cute. And the deeper moments like that the king of animals does not own everything but is responsible for keeping up the circle of life in a way as Mufasa tells his son also never felt fake or try-hard, so they really did a convincing job all in all with this challenging task.Another thing I liked here is that they got some of the old actors back like James Earl Jones from the original Lion King film. And new famous faces, mostly black actors for whatever reason like Glover, Beyoncé, Key, Kasumba, but also Rogen. I cannot really comment on their voice acting because I watched the German dub which was nice too. I struggled a bit early on with young Simba's voice, but I got used to it I guess. Also they did a good job here with the German song versions of Elton John's classics I suppose. This could have gone a lot worse. The music in general was a highlight here. So were really all the visuals, it was a beautiful sight from beginning to end and surely added to the film's charme. I have seen people criticize that it looked too modern for the story, but I don't think this is a valid argument at all. I did see though that many critics did not like this film too much and I am not sure if that surprised me. I mean this would be the second year in a row where my favorite film was really adored by the fans (not as much as Bohemian Rhapsody admittedly), but slightly panned by critics. Screw them I say. You should not let them destroy the viewing experience here. It is a wonderful movie that had me on the edge of the seat constantly and definitely definitely watch it on the big screen as long as it is still there. Chances are high it probably won't be shown a lot anymore in theaters later on with the reception once it is gone after everybody has basically seen it. It is probably the best film I have seen so far from the new wave of remakes of famous classics. Watched Aladdin earlier this year and it was good too, but not great, just okay. This one here is really mesmerizing and it gets better and better the longer it goes. Just such a charming movie. All the money they invested here and it surely was a lot definitely paid off. No idea if it will keep the top spot and for how long, but at this point this is my new favorite 2019 release. I highly recommend checking it out. Also great that young movie-goers can get their own Lion King experience in theaters now despite being born a long time after the original from back then. And if they really don't like this new take on things, which would surprise me (they are not old enough to be pretentious), then maybe it will direct their attention to the 90s' Lion King and it is also worth it. Everything about this one here is worth it too. It never felt like two hours and the film really flew by and could have gone on for another half hour without me losing my concentration. At least. A modern classic. Don't miss out under any circumstances. Don't get fooled or distracted by the reviews. Watch and experience it yourself! Highly highly recommended.",The Lion King
4,Prismark10,The Lion King,4,31 March 2020,Disney has decided to have live action remake of its classic cartoons with mixed critical results so far. The box office though has been very good.The Lion King is not even live action though. It is a CGI version of the 1994 animated movie.The Lion King cartoon was a kid friendly version of Hamlet. Young cub Simba's father is killed by evil brother Scar but Simba blames himself as he does not know the truth of what actually happened.I would have thought director Jon Favreau would had shaken up the story but it is almost a straight remake of the 1994 cartoon.However this remake has a longer running time and it showed. I felt listless as the movie went on. I realised the film lacked energy because it knew it was a bland copy.,The Lion King
5,claudio_carvalho,Unnecessary Remake,6,23 November 2019,"In Africa, the lion cub Simba is the pride and joy of his parents King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Mufasa prepares Simba to be the next king of the jungle. However, the naive Simba believes in his envious uncle Scar that wants to kill Mufasa and Simba to become the next king. He lures Simba and his friend Nala to go to a forbidden place and they are attacked by hyenas but they are rescued by Mufasa. Then Scar plots another scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba but the cub escapes alive and leaves the kingdom believing he was responsible for the death of his father. Now Scar becomes the king supported by the evil hyenas while Simba grows in a distant land. Sometime later, Nala meets Simba and tells that the kingdom has become a creepy wasteland. What will Simba do?""The Lion King"" is an unnecessary remake of the 1994 animated film. The songs are boring and the nice images tell a story without soul. In the end, this version is beautiful but does not give any emotion to the viewer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Rei Leão"" (""The Lion King"")",The Lion King
6,mark.waltz,"I didn't think they could do this as ""live action"", but they did, somewhat.",6,14 October 2019,"A perfect remake? No way, by no stretch. But enjoyable and filled with heart? Yes. Despite the absence of three beautiful songs from the Broadway musical (""They Live in You"", ""Shadowland"", ""Endless Night""), this was a satisfactory update of the Disney film, a variation of several historical stories, including Jacob and Joseph from the bible and Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". The legendary James Earl Jones is recognizable through his eloquent voice the moment he speaks as the Lion King Mufasa, only showing slight age in his rendition of the character 25 years after voicing the part in the original. JD McCrary (young Simba) and Donald Glover (older Simba) are great as the bereaved prince who believes wrongly that he was responsible for his father's sudden death, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is very subtle in his villainy as Scar, the usurper king.How can you recapture the magic of the Broadway show, especially that moving, tear jerking opening of ""The Circle of Life"". The one difference is between the animated movie, this remake and the Broadway show is the ability to show all of the various animals throughout as opposed to the limited view of the elephants, zebras, giraffes and other exotic creatures in the Broadway show. ""Circle of Life"" shows every creature in nature coming to pay respect to Musafa's presentation of his new son, picked up and carried to the edge of the rock by the noble baboon Rafiki who has the magic ability to know royal blood when he feels the warmth of it on his fur and skin. Simba's friendship with Nala is explored, but their mistakes come back to haunt them, leading Simba on his own to make an even bigger mistake that gives the opportunistic Scar to take advantage of the situation. Beyonce, as Nala, seems underused, only really getting to sing briefly.I never got the point of the songs ""The Morning Report"" or ""Hakuna Matata"" (which I have always referred to as ""Potato/Potatoe""), and the inclusion of wart hog Pumbaa and meer cat Timba in ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" is a juvenile, intrusive way to start one of the most beautiful love songs ever written for a Disney musical. In the Broadway musical, they make me cringe a bit, and in this remake, with the live action (or computer animation), I felt that feeling once again. Still, the movie is beautiful to look at, and there are some definite tension filmed scenes that will keep you gripped. The large number of bad reviews is very surprising as compared to the passionate positive reviews, and while I think this could have been made with more care (another 10-15 minutes to include the cut songs would have been nice), it is a satisfactory, if not unflawed, movie musical.",The Lion King
7,nogodnomasters,A Hyena's belly is never full,8,22 July 2019,"The film opens as a Shakespearean tragedy with brothers fighting for the throne and a young prince ready to rob the brother of his inheritance. Eventually, the evil Scar wins out and rules with his hyena robber barons who are ruining the land with their unfriendly environmental polices. Simba believed dead, returns like Flash Gorden to defeat Ming and restore Obama's policies.The film was about as exciting as a brick until they meet the comedic Nihilists. At this point, the adults can start enjoying the feature. Personally, I like the Netflix Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle better.",The Lion King
8,kosmasp,Not Original,7,15 January 2020,"I really have to rewatch the Original movie from the 90s. I remember I really liked it a lot. Having said that, for those who haven't seen that, they might be quite smitten by this effort. For those who hold it in high regard this might feel like an insult. As with many cases, the truth is somewhere in the middle.The animation or rather the visuals or whatever you want to call the real life depictions of almost everything, is quite astonishing. So if nothing else this really looks good. The story is proven to engage, so they couldn't go wrong with that either. But they did add stuff and moved pieces around. Having a song that should play at night time sung during the day may be quite off putting. Other might feel that is nit-picking. Try to enjoy this for what it is, not what the original was ... otherwise it is more than likely you'll be dissapointed",The Lion King
9,jboothmillard,The Lion King,5,28 July 2019,"The original Disney animated movie is a crowd-pleasing favourite and was a big box office hit, spawning a successful stage musical, so following on from Cinderella, Pete's Dragon, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo and others, the 1994 cartoon got the ""live action"" treatment 25 years later, well that's what the makers call it anyway, directed by John Favreau (Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, Iron Man, The Jungle Book). Basically, in the Pride Lands of Africa, at Pride Rock, the lions rule over the animal kingdom. There King Mufasa (James Earl Jones, voiced Mufasa in the original) and Queen Sarabi (Star Trek: First Contact's Alfre Woodard), with Rafiki the mandrill (John Kani), the kingdom's shaman and advisor, are presenting Simba, their new-born son, to the large gathering of animals. Mufasa shows young Simba (JD McCrary) the Pride Lands, explaining his responsibilities as king, and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba to become king himself. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (Shahadi Wright Joseph), who are betrothed, into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard. The lion cubs are attacked by spotted hyenas, led by Shenzi (Florence Kasumba), Kamari (Keegan-Michael Key), and Azizi (Eric André), who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu (John Oliver), and rescues the cubs. Mufasa is upset with Simba, but forgives him, he tells him the great kings of the past are in the night sky, they will always be there to guide him, as he will be one day. Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and manages to convince them to help him overthrow Mufusa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge, telling him it is the place where lions practise their roar. While stampede of wildebeest is driven by the hyenas to trample him, Scar informs Mufasa his son is in danger. Mufasa saves Simba but hangs perilously trying to climb out of the gorge. Scar refuses to save him and causes him to fall onto the stampeding herd. Simba finds Mufasa dead, Simba is convinced by Scar that his roar caused this tragedy and tells him to run away and never return. Scar orders the hyenas to kill the cub, they are convinced that Simba falls to death from the edge of a cliff, but he survives the fall and escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing the entire hyena pack to live in the Pride Lands. Simba has collapsed in the desert, he is rescued by friends and outcasts Timon the meerkat (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa the warthog (Seth Rogen). Simba (Donald Glover) grows up in a jungle paradise with his two new friends and other animals, living a carefree life under the motto ""Hakuna Matata"", meaning ""no worries"". Back in Pride Rock, the kingdom been reduced to a wasteland under Scar's rule, adult Nala (Beyoncé Knowles-Carter) manages to sneak past the hyenas and goes to find help. Timon and Pumbaa and other animals are walking through the jungle singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", when Nala tries to attack them. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, explaining what has happened to the land. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who discovered he was still alive, he tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, following this he decides to return home. Aided by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba sneaks past the hyenas and confronts Scar. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba reveals the truth to the rest of the pride. Scar attempts to defend himself, but his knowledge of Mufasa's last moment, having previously claimed that he arrived too late at the gorge, exposes his role in Mufasa's death. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Simba confronts Scar trying to escape. He spares his uncle's life but orders him to leave and never return. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, during a rainfall, Simba takes over the kingship and makes Nala his queen. Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the gathered animals, continuing the circle of life. Also starring Penny Johnson Jerald as Sarafina, Amy Sedaris as Guinea Fowl, Chance the Rapper as Bush Baby, and Phil LaMarr as Impala. The voice cast are all fine, especially Ejiofor as the villain, the return of Jones is welcome as the father, but he speaks pretty much exactly the same dialogue, and the ""photorealistic"" CGI animation is absolutely astonishing, you cannot believe the animals are not real, until of course they open their mouths and speak. The story remains unchanged, with biblical and Shakespearian themes, and the memorable songs composed by Sir Elton John and written by Sir Tim Rice you can still enjoy. Unfortunately, it is let down by the fact that almost all the dialogue is the same, as is the story, it doesn't have much emotional impact, and only subtle changes are made, including the song ""Spirit"" by Beyoncé (nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song) from the stage musical, but that's it, you may as well be watching the original 1994 movie, it is definitely opting for style over substance, nevertheless a reasonable animated musical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Worth watching!",The Lion King
10,paul_haakonsen,"Visually astonishing, but that is essentially it...",5,14 October 2019,"This 2019 ""live action"" rendering of the classic Disney animated story ""The Lion King"" is wholly unnecessary and it is simply just a fan pleaser and a cash in on the golden age of animation.While the CGI in this 2019 Disney movie by all means is phenomenal, that is essentially the entire movie summarized; a grand CGI experience. Why? Well, because we are already familiar with the story from the 1994 animated movie, and it wasn't a movie that was in anyway needing a remake, not even by turning into a CGI adventure.I wanted to like the movie, I really did, but it was so hard to delve into it, especially when you have seen the 1994 animated movie and loved it for what it was. So this was sort of a slap in the face from Disney, with their recent obsession of turning old classic animated movies into ""live action"" movies. It is just beyond my comprehension, but hey, money does put food on the table and make the Disney world go round.They did have a good ensemble of voice actors to perform the various roles and characters in the movie, no doubt about it. But again, why meddle with something that was already good back in 1994?Sure, this movie appeals to newcomers whom aren't already familiar with the 1994 animated movie, and I can see why it would be popular, of course, because this was a spectacular beautiful movie. But CGI only does so much for a movie, in my opinion.Since this 2019 remake is fully unnecessary, then I am rating ""The Lion King"" a mere five out of ten stars.",The Lion King
11,studioAT,An alterative to the original,7,16 August 2019,"Disney's recent trend of remaking their animated classics continues here, with 'The Lion King' being given the same treatment.There's a lot to like here. Visually it's stunning, and unlike 'The Jungle Book', here the original plot is adhered too (in some cases shot for shot), but longer.I liked some of the new voice cast better than the originals, and vice versa, but this made for an engaging and interesting reimagining of the beloved film.",The Lion King

13,CinemaSerf,A great looking but soulless void of a film.,6,3 December 2019,"The first ten minutes of this are spellbinding. The animation is visionary and the accompanying music can't help but raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Then... well it drops off a cliff. The characterisations are empty; as two-dimensional as the cartoons themselves and no amount of sound effects and shouty-singing can bring them to life. I'm not asking for Paul Haggis or Aaron Sorkin - but surely a production of this magnitude, with this kind of budget, could find a writing team that didn't have to reduce this to ""Janet and John in the Jungle""? Even if it is a kids film (I think not!) it deserves so much more substance to support the beautiful imagery than it gets. For reasons that aren't immediately clear to me; the lyric has been ""updated"" too - why? Truly a let down.",The Lion King

The ""live action"" is a bit of a hoax, in that it's still animated. But it's still breathtaking and beautiful, I found myself smiling throughout. The visuals are just stunning. While most of the dialogue is the same as the original, there are some changes. Timon and pumbaa have their own riffs and jokes, and even play up a couple of references to the original. I thought the voice acting on both the kids and Glover and Beyoncé were great ( I couldn't help but say BEYONCÉ!). It was truly beautiful.",The Lion King

At least the genuine, original LION KING flick admitted to being a cartoon fantasy. However, this alleged ""live action"" remake is sillier than any symphony starring ""Lucky Louse."" To see herds of CGI African animals keeping ""straight faces"" as their mouths spout out fluent American is very off-putting to True Nature Lovers, as well as to the students of the Afrocentric Academies now permeating all of the USA's major cities.

Currently the usurpers in power in both America and Brazil are waging a cut-throat duel to determine which of them will go down as the biggest villain in the on-going World Extinction Event.

16,view_and_review,A Marvelous Feat,9,20 July 2019,"If you were a fan of the original Lion King you will be a fan of this one. Because I saw the original so long ago and my memory is not the greatest, I like this one even more.The visual effects and animation was IN-CRE-DI-BLE. I really can't even put into words just how blown away I was by the visual effects. These effects nowadays will have you questioning what's real. If I were judging the movie on CGI alone I'd give it a 10/10.What the visual effects really did was make everything more intense. With cartoon like animations there is a slight disconnect. They're drawings after all. With the lifelike animations of this movie the dramatic scenes were more intense and you were just drawn in more to everything. It was so realistic that you felt that animal connection to the creatures.This movie was a marvelous feat.",The Lion King
17,AlsExGal,"Had this just been a nature film, it would be great!",5,25 July 2019,"The animals are well photographed and you have some great shots of them, but then if I wanted that I would watch a David Attenborough documentary and learn something in the process.So you basically have dialogue over well shot animals who do not convey the emotions called for in the script, so the entire production is pretty boring.This is what you lose when you take The Lion King OUT of animation and into live action. The original 1994 version of Lion King was illustrated by artists who actually watched real animals - yes and lions - move, and they tried to capture that motion in their drawings along with the emotions that the animals were feeling. I saw the original in theatres and I think that they succeeded brilliantly.Disney has obviously got the technical end of movie making down. What they can't seem to do in the last ten years is capture an audience with narrative and acting. First they buy a bunch of franchises - Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and have been failing with them. Now they are trashing their own legacy. Even Michael Eisner, an untrustworthy suit and bean counter, knew how to deliver when it came to entertainment when he was in charge of Disney.",The Lion King
18,ferguson-6,next gen King,7,15 July 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you have come here to read yet another take on how this next-gen remake of a beloved film doesn't bring anything new to the story, you've come to the wrong place. I love cinema as an art form, and when analyzing a movie, I typically look for the good and enjoyable, rather than focusing on every element I might be able to criticize ... never forgetting that the on screen presentation is the culmination of work performed by many dedicated people so that I might sit back in a comfy seat within the confines of an air-conditioned theatre and be entertained for a couple of hours. And entertained I was.It only takes a few moments for the awe to set in. The look is at times so realistic that kids may actually believe animals can talk. More than once the fur of an animal or the splash of the river reminded of a National Geographic program with ultra-High Definition photography. So let's clear up something right now. This has been labeled as a ""live action"" remake of the animated classic from 1994. You should know, even if your eyes tell you otherwise, that there is nothing ""live"" in the film. Instead, everything you see on screen is computer-animated/generated. No, the lions and elephants aren't real and neither are the trees or distant mountains. The look of the film is as revolutionary as when the first TOY STORY stunned us in 1995. We had never seen animation like that then, and we've never before seen computer effects like this. What is familiar are two early songs, ""The Circle of Life"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"".Of course, neo-realism can be admired only as a technical achievement when we are discussing a movie in which lions talk and warthogs sing. So while we marvel at the technical achievement, let's not lose sight of the story ... what made the original so popular and beloved 25 years ago. Although it's approximately a half-hour longer than the original, this one is exceedingly close to a scene-for-scene remake. Only minor tweaks will be noticed, mostly in the demeanor of Scar and the banter between Pumbaa and Timon - each actually improving on the first film. What remains is the coming-of-age story that will now touch many new hearts and minds.Kids will be immediately entranced with the cubs, Simba and Nala, voiced by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph (the daughter in Jordan Peele's US), and with Zazu (voiced by John Oliver), the goofy and comical bird tasked with keeping an eye on the two adventurous youngsters as they get themselves into trouble. James Earl Jones (now 88 years old) reprises his iconic voice role as the wise Mufasa, and Alfre Woodward voices Sarabi, the pride's leading female. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as the bitter Shakespearian villain Scar, but I couldn't help but wish Jeremy Irons had returned for this interpretation of the jealous and power-hungry brother of Mufasa.The energy level jumps once Simba meets Pumbaa the warthog and Timba the meerkat. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner take the comedy routine to a new place, and we can only assume much of their banter is off-script. Kids may not get every joke, but they are sure to respond to this odd couple. Donald Glover and Beyonce voice the grown Simba and Nala, and both are outstanding - especially with their singing (no surprise there). Nala's role is expanded a bit ... as expected when you cast Queen Bey. Her original song ""Spirit"" is included but it's her duet with Glover on ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" that is a real musical standout.Director Jon Favreau has been in the chair for such hits as IRON MAN 2 (2010), IRON MAN (2008), and ELF (2003), and he was also behind Disney's live-action remake of THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). The writing credits belong to Jeff Nathansan (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, 2002) for the screenplay, Oscar winner Brenda Chapman (BRAVE, 2012) for the story, and Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton for the characters. The latter three were among the 28 writers credited for the 1994 version. Also back is composer Hans Zimmer, who won an Oscar for his 1994 score, and songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, also Oscar winners for their 1994 song, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"".The beloved 1994 version didn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature film because the award didn't exist until 2002; however, it did spawn the 1997 Broadway smash musical. This more realistic version is rightly rated PG rather than G, as some of the scenes are likely to be a bit intense for younger viewers. And it's important to remember that this version is meant to bring Simba's story to a whole new generation - it's not meant to replace the 1994 version for those who were kids when it came out so many years ago. The story and characters, while familiar to those age 30 and up, will be a whole new viewing experience for today's kids. So while we may prefer the 1994 animated version, kids today will likely be enthralled by this updated look. And we all better get used to it, because Disney has 18 more ""live action"" remakes in the works (some of which will actually be ""live"" action).",The Lion King
19,FlashCallahan,The recycle of life....,6,20 August 2019,"You can't blame Disney for recycling their classic movies in order to have them become more profitable by being 'live action'. But i really don't understand why the backlash is happening now. In 1996, they made a live action version of 101 Dalmatians.....Yes, their output has increased in the last couple of years, but as they are making so much money (Dumbo aside, but that was terrible), can you really blame them for reaping the benefits?Simba idolises his father Mufasa, and takes to heart his own royal destiny on the plains of Africa.But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new cub's arrival. Scar, Mufasa's brother -- and former heir to the throne -- has plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is soon ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba's exile.Now, with help from a curious pair of newfound friends, Simba must figure out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully his......The film isn't a patch on the original, that was an amazing exercise in genius, and probably one of Disney's finest hours. Even the 3D upgrade in 2011 didn't fade any of it's beauty.Now if you are of a certain age, like myself, you will see this as a pointless exercise, but imagine it in through the eyes of someone who has not seen the original? It must be as wonderful as when we first saw the animated original for them, and from that point of view, i have to respect the makers somewhat.Yes, it's amazing to look at, attention to detail is painstaking, and at times, the film is extremely sinister, not as much as the original, but sinister nevertheless.So all in all, it's a pretty pointless affair from my point of view, but there is going to be a new generation who are going to find a new love for this film, and kudos to them.",The Lion King
20,Aaron1375,Pretty much everything you've seen before...,5,21 August 2019,"Once again, I somehow avoided these films when they were animated back in the day, but forced to go to the live action remakes today thanks to the wife. I saw the original one on VHS and it was pretty good, certainly seen a lot worse; however, I never said to myself, ""This would be so much better if it were like a nature documentary"". That is pretty much all they did to change this as the story is pretty much exactly the same. I cannot really fault Disney for this lazy approach to making films as the masses are eating it up like leftover spaghetti. Why make anything new, original or that isn't a comic movie as so many things have flopped badly when they try a different formula or try and adapt a novel. The best approach these days is just keep doing the same stuff and that is what this film pretty much does and though I thought it lacked a certain cuteness and expression turned into real looking animals, I cannot argue the profits it is turning.The story, well, the king of the Pride Land and his wife have a child named Simba and the king's brother Scar who wishes to be king is not overjoyed by this arrival. He tries to hatch a plan to kill his nephew and then hatches a plan to kill the king. Simba leaves the Pride Land and meets a warthog and meerkat who teach Simba to just forget everything and don't care, but a childhood friend sends Simba back to the land of his birth to take his place as the rightful king.The film has issues for me and the main one is the facial expression is just not there. They may as well be doing the whole using peanut butter to make it look like they are talking here. I would think with all the advancements made in computer generated graphics that they could make Simba and company look happy, sad and show other emotions and still make the animals look real. Sadly, no, they either could not or wanted this to look as real as possible; however, if you wanted that, why make the animals talk at all? May as well have taken the Milo and Otis approach and get one actor to do a voice over. Speaking of voice overs, whoever thought that not bringing back Jeremy Irons as Scar is a complete and utter moron!So there you have it, my review of a movie that I feel was pointless to be made, but I am apparently alone in this thinking as the movie has done quite well. It is pretty much watching the Lion King again only with real animals and a strange change to daytime while, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was being performed. Seriously? What is up with that one? Too expensive to have CGI night or something? It is cute to see the lions as cubs, but the film just lacks the power of the original. I will not call it a wasted trip to the movies though as my wife enjoyed it and she is the one who wished to see it.",The Lion King
21,mm-39,Not bad!,7,10 August 2019,"Not bad! The Lion King had a good story and pace. The Lion King had family deception, character development mixed in with a story about life. There was some P C headlines (attention grabbing stuff) about racism etc but the movie was tame. I guess the vegan, nature crowd would disagree the nature story about natures order and the food chain. My grand dad who was a game warded would find the story a good education about nature for the kids. Especially the over use part. The story about a boy Lion growing up and finding out the he will become the lion king is a good retelling of home away from home finding home again story. I miss the old school cartoons, but the C G I was okay. The beautiful C G I created great Disney magic. The father son segment was magic. The action ending of good vs evil would be exciting for any kid. 7 stars.",The Lion King
22,JamesHitchcock,Will delight the children and give their parents something to think about,8,27 March 2020,"Like most children growing up in the sixties and seventies I was very familiar with Disney cartoons, and some of them, especially ""The Jungle Book"" and ""101 Dalmatians"" were among my childhood favourites. Not having any children of my own, however, I never took the same interest in the company's later offerings, including those made during the so-called ""Disney Renaissance"" of the nineties. I must therefore admit that I have never seen the original cartoon version of ""The Lion King"" from 1994.In recent years Disney have had a policy of making live-action remakes of some of their classic cartoons, including ""101 Dalmatians"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"". I understand that a remake of ""Mulan"" is in the offing. The 2019 version of ""The Lion King"" is not really a live action remake, something that would not have been possible in a film where all the characters are wild animals. Like the remade ""Jungle Book"" it is a photorealistic computer-animated version of the story.The plot is similar to that of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". A king is murdered by his evil younger brother who usurps the throne which by right should have gone to his young nephew. (Shakespeare borrowed this story from an old Danish legend, but he may have been influenced by English history; he had earlier dramatised the stories of two English kings, John and Richard III, who both usurped the throne from their young nephews). The difference is that the royal family involved here are not human but a family of lions who rule over a kingdom known as the ""Pride Lands"" on the African savannahs; all the animals who live there, not only the lions, are regarded as their subjects. The film follows the efforts of the young prince Simba (Swahili for ""lion"") to recover his kingdom and to avenge the death of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar. There is also a love story involving Simba and the young lioness Nala. Two other important characters are the carefree meerkat Timon and his warthog friend Pumbaa, responsible for introducing the Swahili phrase ""hakuna matata"" (no worries) into English. Apart from Scar, the main villains are a gang of hyaenas.Although the film will doubtless be popular with younger audiences, it is more than just a ""children's film"". Parts of it, in fact, are surprisingly deep, with political, psychological and even religious overtones. Although the story is ostensibly about animals, it falls within the literary tradition of the beast-fable in which the animal characters represent human characteristics. Simba may be a lion, but he is also the hero of a coming-of-age story about a boy's growth to manhood in difficult circumstances.Mufasa is portrayed as an enlightened philosopher king, whose philosophy is that a true king always seeks to know what he can give to his people, not what he can take from them. Scar's political ideology, by contrast, is essentially a fascist one, based upon exalting the desire for power above all moral considerations. He presents himself as a strong leader, but paradoxically his worship of strength is rooted in a sense of his own weakness and in envy of his brother, who is stronger than him, both physically and morally. The most domineering leaders are often those who secretly believe themselves to be inferior. Simba also needs to overcome a sense of his own inferiority and unworthiness if he is to live up to his father's example. The religious element comes from the concept of the ""circle of life"" or interconnectedness of all living things, a concept which here is treated both as an environmental one and as a spiritual one.I also liked the musical score; most of the songs were taken from the original film with a few new ones mixed in. I was able to add another to my list of ""songs you never knew were actually from a film""; I was familiar enough with Elton John's ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"", having often heard it on the radio, but did not know it was first written for the 1994 film where it is used (as it is here) as the soundtrack to the scene where Simba and Nala realise their love for one another.The main criticism I have heard of the 2019 ""Lion King"" is that it is ""unoriginal"". Apparently it follows the plot of the 1994 version fairly closely, but never having seen that version I was not too worried about this. It is one of those family films which will not only delight the children but also give their parents something to think about. 8/10",The Lion King
23,FeastMode,well done,6,21 November 2019,"I liked it. it was very good throughout with a few small issues here and there. a few really awesome moments. the CGI was amazing, i couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. enjoyable overall.oh and the musical score, not the songs but the music playing in the background, was AMAZING in so many scenes. not sure if that was an enhanced version of the original or a new composition, either way i loved it, and was not surprised at all when the GOAT hans' name popped up on the screen.comparing to aladdin, i think this was a much better remake, but the story of aladdin and the songs in it are way better than in the lion king (1 viewing 11/20/19)",The Lion King
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"An interesting take, but just a bland copy of the original",4,16 October 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs the son of Mustafa (voiced by James Earl Jones), the 'Lion King', the young Simba (voiced by JD McCreary) is destined to take over from him and rule the animal kingdom upon his death, much to the chagrin of his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), who engineers a plot to murder Mustafa, convince Simba he is responsible and banish him away as he falsely ascends the throne. During his time in the wilderness, Simba grows into an adult lion and must return to Pride Rock to confront Scar, who's allowed his villainous cohorts the Hyenas to take over.Although the original Lion King is a Disney classic I hold fond memories of from my childhood, I've taken my time getting round to watching this 'live action reboot' (of which Disney seem to be making their stock in trade at the moment) on the grounds that I wasn't awfully keen on sharing my viewing experience with loads of rowdy kids, and so waited until it had been out a while. Although it felt odd as a grown adult watching a load of talking animals, I tried to put aside my cynicism, and was rewarded with a scene for scene remake, minus the magic.With the exception of James Earl Jones returning as Mustafa, the characters are all voiced by different actors from the original cast, none of whom have the same inflection in their voice that made all of them so memorable before. This isn't helped by the live action animals not having the ability to use their expressions like they did in the animated film. The success of David Attenborough's Planet Earth series shows how fascinating people find real life nature, and so transferring the film into a live action setting was certainly an idea with potential, but none of it is explored here.This is Disney's special way of marking the 25th anniversary of the release of the original film, but while it's visually impressive, it still just amounts to the original film, scene for scene, with a third of the heart and Seth Rogen doing a characteristically crass turn as a farting Pumbaa. Stay at home and watch that instead. **",The Lion King
25,Edvis-1997,7,7,19 July 2019,"To see something what was masterpiece before and trying to compete or even be better than it it's impossible. I agree that new Lion King movie had amazing visuals (except from the sky which looked so bad and fake and the black tree which was moving like a hand lol) but emotionally it's so poor. It didn't give any emotion when dad died, when Simba run away. Nothing. I watch it like ordinary cartoon nothing more for true. Was it worth to watch? Well it wasn't so bad but it doesn't give half of original film chills.",The Lion King
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Cinematic circle of life.,6,21 July 2019,"'The Lion King (2019)' certainly looks phenomenal: its 'photo-realistic animation' actually looks photo-real (or pretty much as close to it as we've come so far) on more than one occasion. The environments often seem so real you could touch them, the water simulation is perhaps the best I've ever seen and the animals all move, essentially, as realistically as CG creatures have ever moved. However, this does mean that the movie lacks most of the flair usually associated with animated works, even going so far as to omit emotion in favour of realism. The characters, whom are all inevitably anthropomorphised to some degree, don't really emote. Aside from providing ample range in their vocal performances, they remain as stony-faced as animals of their kind usually do. It's lucky that, for the most part, the cast do a terrific job at conveying everything that needs to be conveyed. However, when the singing starts, the believability of the vocal work starts to stretch beyond its limits; it just doesn't look like these lions, with their limited jaw-range and general lack of visual articulation, are belting out the big notes that they're supposed to be. Again, it's a good job that the songs are as genuinely entertaining as they are. Sadly, the picture can't claim to own any of them - except for a couple of originals that seem strangely out of place. On top of that, the musical sequences themselves aren't all that inspired, especially when compared to the original 'The Lion King (1994)'. I mean, the big, colourful, montage-esque numbers from that flick are here replaced by often stiff and generally just sort of bland ones. The same is true, I suppose, of the whole affair. It doesn't change anything in terms of narrative but somehow makes things longer and less energetic. Of course, this is all in favour of its realist aesthetic, but it does make you wonder whether that's a wise choice. After all, why does this Shakespearean musical about talking lions need to be realistic? The end result is far less memorable than the 1994 classic; it's not as vibrant, lively or dynamic. It still tells an engaging, effective and occasionally emotionally-affecting story, though. I can't deny that it's a fair bit of fun. It's not so much new as nostalgic, almost like an experiment on a large scale. It ultimately doesn't really feel worth the effort, however, because I'd rather watch the original and I think pretty much everyone else would, too. In five years time, will this be remembered as a classic? No, it'll be remembered as a remake. It's a shame, as the technical work involved with it really is astounding. The true artistry required to make this work would probably have been better spent elsewhere. I suppose it's just a product of the cinematic circle of life, though. In twenty-five years time, I guess we can expect an animated remake of this (so-called) 'live-action' effort. 6/10",The Lion King
27,ThomasDrufke,Life's Not Fair,8,1 August 2019,"The one thing I keep saying to people about this reimagining of the 1994 classic is that it's essentially a shot for shot remake and if you're argument is ""what's the point of it then?"", I won't necessarily argue with you. But I will tell you that this film is meant to be seen on the big screen, and is a visual masterpiece. With that said, they added about 30 minutes worth of footage but the story is almost exactly the same. In other words, it's still Hamlet with Lions, and if you're okay with that, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy the remake. Coming off The Jungle Book, I don't think anyone will deny the appeal of Jon Favreau attempting to put a CGI/live action spin on the classic tale. 95% of the cast is picture perfect, even if they don't necessarily compare to the original (i.e. Jeremy Irons), and I can get behind most of the new takes on the songs as well. Maybe the Beyonce song is out of place and perhaps you can't fully feel the emotion behind the animals eyes, when you don't have animators manipulating the characters' faces in the 1994 version, but I was still able to feel the 'Disney Magic' in what may be the most real looking 'animated' film I have ever seen. Aside from a few frustrating minor changes (that only a die-heard Lion King fan who has seen the original over 100 times would care about), I enjoyed the live action film more than I probably should have.

It's true that the original is much better, but I really did feel the good outweighed the bad here. Unlike ""Aladdin"", it doesn't add any new characters. It's mostly a faithful adaptation. The pacing was really good here, especially when you consider the movie's two hours long. I think the main problem with ""Alice In Wonderland"" was that it changed too many things while this one should have had more changes, but I'd rather have it like that.The special effects are really impressive. There are still a lot of faults here and there. I did not care for the singing at all in this, especially how ""Be Prepared"" was really disappointing. This had so little energy in it, especially considered that in the original voice actor Jeremy Irons actually strained his voice and had to be replaced with Jim Cummings!

32,ironhorse_iv,This movie is not quite a roaring success with me. I found the mighty lion mediocre at best.,6,24 January 2020,"It's sad because this I was really looking forward to seeing what filmmakers Jon Favreau & Jeff Nathanson could do to make to make this photorealistic computer animation not live action remake stand out from Disney's classic animated 1994 film of the same name. Yet this film heavily influenced by Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' & Japanese anime ""Kimba the White Lion' felt like a rethread. Don't get me wrong, the story of Simba (Voiced by Donald Glover) having to retake his kingship does have some new things going for it. However the added backstory of how the villain got his name & how the famine start didn't really enhance the viewing experience. Honestly it lean more to becoming a bigger illogical plot hole on why the lionesses would continue to follow his lead knowing full well that he once challenge Mufasa (Voiced by James Earl Jones), force their queen for sex & continue to mistreated them. After all in this adaptation, Chiwetel Ejofor's version doesn't have the Machiavellian charm that Jeremy Irons brought in the original movie to make them trust him. To add onto that, Scar is not ruthless powerful enough to overtake their physical strength both in size and numbers if they rebelled. In the original he was. After all, he killed most of the Lion Guards including Nala (Voiced by Beyonce Knowles)'s father. In this movie, he's just an untrustworthy scrawny recluse whom cover story doesn't make much sense. He didn't even knock out the witness. Instead he exiled Zazu (Voiced by John Oliver) yet the bird still considering warn the lionesses of his lying. So you would think that the cover story would be expose long ago. On a similar beat, even if Scar didn't get cocky in deus ex machina way and expose the truth about Mufasa's death like an idiot. The lionesses didn't ask the wildebeests what happen in the first place seem odd. Even if the herd are sentient. Lionesses should be more willing to hear Simba out when he come back. He could expose who led him into the gorge to practice roaring. The only thing I can think of the pride thinking otherwise is if a Scar follower like Zira was introduce into the film. That or Simba having shown severe psychological issues or seem more physical mangy than Scar. After all, no lion will became a strong mane just by eating bugs. All this could had made the ending more logically. Still this remake needs more humor. I hate that the comic relief aspects are toned down to make everything gritty including the hyenas with no Ed. They now lack less personality, nowhere near expressive and are taken too serious. Yet the biggest letdown is how the film interpreted Hakuna Matata. According to Timon (Voiced by Billy Eichner) & Pumbaa (Voiced by Seth Rogen), there is no circle of life only a meaningless line of indifference. The way they said it, made responsibility free philosophy seem highly negative & nihilism than fun. No wonder they seem more coldblooded and open to help the carnivores killed their fellow animals. Don't get me wrong, they may have protection due to their closeness with Simba, but there still a famine going on. The chance of them getting eaten is high. Anyhow, the filmmakers still ruin the enjoyable humor with them. For example, jokes about being a pig is turn into a somber forced message about standing against bullies. It's unfunny PC comedy at its worst. Padding also made the movie suffer. 88 minutes runtime is now 2 hrs. The flick really wanted to prove that there is more of a Circle of Life than Hakuta Matata by painfully showing long sequences of fur travelling in the wind or a mouse wandering around. Talking about Circle of Life. I do find it odd that the lions has achieved harmony with the animals they eat by exodus hyenas under the pretense that they weren't part of it like an evil diaspora. The idea that they overhunt is outrageous. In real life, hyenas are vital components the ecosystem. They gotten a bad wrapped in these folktales. Simba should figure out a way to coexist with them. Another unique thing the movie could had done is use more of the Broadway Musical beside the trailer. At least, most of the original songwriters return to add new touches to their memorable hits even if the visuals to follow it are a bit lackluster. For example 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' & ""Be Prepared"" sequences just doesn't compared to the fun original trippy animation with the cubs doing circus tricks or gusto delivery of strong fascism imageries of the hyenas. Then there is the opening of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" whom visuals also don't match the tone as it is still board daylight when sung. It also sucks that the triumphant score played over Simba racing back was replaced with ""Spirit"". It doesn't quite have the same heroic tone need for the audience to understand his journey. As for voice acting. Besides Ejofor being way off, most of the other performers were alright even if Beyoncé has her limits, Rogen can't sing and Jones sounds old. However it was very jarring to see the filmmakers remove nearly all range of human-like anthropomorphizing expressions. It made true to life creatures look so emotionless & stilted. Sadly making the animals move realistic also hurt the action as the film kinda screw up Simba's childhood pinning move. Even memorable spiritualism moments like Mufasa's physically spirit appearing in the clouds is tone down. Very little emotional punch. Regardless the CGI looks vivid accurate. Still overall I'll probably not see this remake again. The highest grossing animated movie of all time as of this writing is not really worth stepping foot on the lion den again and getting bit. That's for sure. I'll stick to the original.",The Lion King
33,slightlymad22,Falls Short,6,26 July 2019,"I just got out of the Lion KingAnd I have to say it falls short of delivering for me. Elements of this new version are spectacular because of the quality of animation... But so much else was just mediocre... Starting with the poor voice talent. My favorite animated movies are brought to life by memorable distinctive voices... I loved what Burt Reynolds brought to All Dogs Go To Heaven, then Robin Williams set the bar with Aladdin, then we have Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Mike Myers, then Eddie Murphy... The list is long but those films wouldn't have been the same without those voices. This new Lion King film has none of that... it's all just so flat.About 80% of this, is shot for shot/word for word the same as the 1994 classic. Although there is a subplot involving Scar and Sarabi from the Broadway show inserted.My next issue was the soundtrack... Again, there is nothing special here. The 1994 soundtrack was one of the all-time best. I hated Beyoncé singing Can You Feel The Love Tonight. I am not a fan of hers anyway, and her appeal is totally lost on me, but I can acknowledge when she is good as in Goldmember.Finally, and my biggest issue... The realistic non-expressions of the animals. Because you can't see happy or sad in their faces, you fully depend on the mediocre delivery of dialog. This was very distracting. The lion's faces do not show sad... happy... scared. This was like watching a two hour voice over.I found it less entertaining and engrossing than Aladdin and Dumbo, although at times I did enjoy this movie.

I had so many preconceived thoughts about this movie. After much deliberation, though, I finally decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.Wow, I'm glad I did! 'The Lion King 2019' exceeded all my expectations in abundance. Firstly, the element everyone is raving about: the animation. I mean honestly, can it possibly get any better?? This film proves just how far animation has come and what they can accomplish nowadays (with the right budget, off course). Its hard to believe not a single real animal was used for the film. They all look so incredibly realistic. Scar is a really creepy character in this 'live action' adaptation.Regarding the voicing, the only actor reprising his voice work, is James Earl Jones as Mufasa. I missed the sarcasm Jeremy Irons so perfectly added to Scar's character. It made him sound even more devious. The other voice work is fine, I don't really have complaints there. (Only that I also really missed Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi).Since these are now real - or should I say 'realistic' - animals, I actually found it funnier and much scarier than the original. The suspense was a lot more intense. It was also more emotional with realistic animals. Then there were some scenes that were honestly too cute for words! I highly anticipated the musical segments, which were so colorful in the animated film, and I must say they didn't disappoint here. Obviously a lot more realistic, these segments were stunning.I've heard a lot of complaints from viewers saying the animals have no emotion - or lack the emotion of the original film. Well obviously. We certainly can't have animals doing the things they did in the animated film. It would look kind of awkward and not credible. On the contrary, the animals actually have a lot of emotion and was so realistic within the context of the film. They had all the emotion I expect real animals to have: joy, fear, sadness, remorse...'The Lion King' is still one of the most incredible stories ever written. This 2019 'live action' film did not disappoint. It is an absolutely beautiful movie. It is spectacular and stunning in its production and looks incredible on screen. This is a gem of a movie!!Regarding all the negative reviews I've seen, I wonder how they would have rated the movie if this was an original with nothing to compare it with? I've heard complaints about them not using the same voices or music, but what would the point of a remake be if you use exactly the same actors? Rather rate the movie as a stand alone, and not a comparison.",The Lion King
37,briancham1994,Not as good as the original,8,2 June 2020,"You can't go wrong with The Lion King, so this film is not bad, but it does not live up to the original. The animation was realistic but too stiff. The songs were not as expressive. It did not need to be so long. Otherwise, a good film, but it is so similar to the original that you might as well just watch the original.",The Lion King
38,cruise01,"Beautiful, emotional, and a great live action adaptation.",10,20 July 2019,"The Lion King (5 out of 5 stars).The Lion King is impressive. Probably the next ground breaking with the filmmaker's technology in bringing the animated film to life. With life like settings, the visual effects on the animals and the background. It was amazing and believable. The Disney original film was one of my favorites as a child. Watching this live action brings back the nostalgia feeling. From the opening moment of the circle of life song with the sunrise showing in the landscapes of Africa. Seeing every animal showing up to the Pride rock with Simba being carried over. The film delivers all around. The visual effects are impressive. The story is beautiful, emotional, and adventurous. It is a perfect adaptation of the original. Maybe more new scenery's added the extra screen time. The voice talent was good. Seth Rogen was more noticeable as Pumba which was great. The film does have some exciting action sequences that makes you feel like you are with the characters in action.The plot follows Simba who is a prince and flees away when his uncle Scar takes over the kingdom. From there, he meets Pumba and Timon. Until, he is a lion and Nala tries to get him back to face against Scar and his Hyenas. Every one knows the story if they seen the original Disney film. It is very much the same. It is great seeing it brought to live action. There are a few emotional powerful moments in the film that does get to you. Mufasa and Simba's bonding moments as father and son will bring some tears again. I did feel like Jon Favreau direction did added some extra new scenes to help with the transition with the story. The film does keep true to the musical sequences. Which were all great and had a fun impressive musical scene with the characters. There is a new sequence with a Beyonce song Spirit thrown in the movie with the characters travelling back to their homeland.Jon Favreau direction is fantastic. He did great handling The Jungle Book. He did this film just as well. He delivered the emotional connections with the story and characters. The film had some exciting action scenes. Simba and Nala were great. Mufasa was great. The rest of the characters were all fun as well. The music score by Hans Zimmer is beautiful and inspirational. It does deliver nostalgia and emotional connection.Overall, The Lion King is one of the best Disney's live action film. I loved the original. This live action remake may be a little dark and has less humor than the original. The story is great. The direction, music score, voice talent, the action sequences, visual effects and musical scenes are all impressive. That will deliver with excitement and maybe some tears.",The Lion King
39,eddie_baggins,A visual delight lacking the heart and soul of the original,6,19 July 2019,"To put it simply, weighed up against one another in a battle for ultimate supremacy, the original animated classic from 1994 would win the battle for The Lion King pride land in knockout fashion.Full of heart, soul, imagination and of course singalong worthy songs and emotionally powerful music, the Disney classic of old still stands up today as a worthy cultural touchstone and while this new virtually carbon copied version of the tale of Simba and his quest to act out his kingly duties is still entertaining enough, Jon Favreau's visually sumptuous yet instantly forgettable redo is a relatively cold and unnecessary cash grab from the global behemoth that is the mouse house.From the moment the film starts with the ""I see Kenya"" made famous in the original, as animals of all shapes and sizes gather to witness the unveiling of lion king Mufasa's newly born cub Simba, Favreau's film sets itself in motion to be a risk free affair that while stunning with its downright eye-popping mastery of visuals, fails to capture the audience's heart like the 1994 original did with ease, for those of all ages.It's a shame for such a visual feast that Favreau and his Disney bosses failed to think of new ways to add a different flavour to proceedings here, as while there's some neat visual gags, added jokes (mainly courtesy of the films MVP's Timon and Pumbaa, voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen) and some of the songs remain a joy to listen to without bettering the original, this version of The Lion King plays it way to safe without doing anything else of note that would make you choose to watch this take over the briefer and more energetic original.Another curious element to the film is with Disney's insistence on going ""photo real"" they have managed like other live action re-doings to lose sight of some of the beloved characters that came to life in the original animations.Here of course we have our cute and adorable and eventually fearsome Simba, the feisty Nala, comic relief Zazu and many more of the characters many know and love (or despise) but with the realism attached to these once animated figures much of the simplistic wonder and stretching of the imagination disappears and so too does much of the whimsy and loveable aspects.Most notable in how the film deals with its musical numbers, as many will notice the outlandish nature of many of the original set pieces (such as Scar's Be Prepared Nazi like sequence or Can You Feel the Love Tonight taking place in the day time!) are now transformed into more plain set-ups that while looking great, lack the spark and memorability of what we've come to know and therefore expect.It all brings in to question the very being of these Disney reimagining's, that while perfectly watchable and seriously profitable (other than poor old Dumbo), makes one wonder what the whole point of the whole escapade is other than Disney taking a seriously easy route to making quick and easy money.If other future installments fail to add anything else of note like The Lion King, you can't help but feel much like the never spoken about Beauty and the Beast remake or the over praised Jungle Book, many of these experiences will go down as cold hearted money earners that very few would recall in future years as anything but entertaining distractions.Final Say -No doubt set to be one of the great box-office behemoths of all-time, this modern day Lion King provides much wonder for the eyes but offers very little else of note to lay hold on. Perfectly watchable but instantly disposable, Jon Favreau's film is a prime example that realism doesn't equal better when your film is stuck in auto-pilot.3 juicy grubs out of 5",The Lion King

41,leonblackwood,Brilliant Animation! 7/10,7,14 January 2020,"Review:
I must be one of the only people in the world that wasn't a big fan of the original, which is why I wasn't that excited about this film. I must admit, the CGI is pretty amazing, and the way that the director, Jon Favreau, adapted the 1994 movie for a modern age, was quite impressive. It did lack the wit that Timon & Pumba brought to the original film, and the storyline was exactly the same, so there weren't any surprises. With that aside, it's still a well-made film, which includes some of the same songs that we all grew to love the first time around, and I still found the emotional storyline, touching. In terms of entertainment, it's perfect for the whole family, and the cast was a great choice for all of there roles, but it seemed a bit too safe, in terms of the director thinking out of the box. If you're not aware of the original plot, the film is set in the Pride Lands of Africa, where the lions rule over the animal kingdom. King Mufasa & Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend, Nala (to whom it is expected Simba to marry) into exploring a forbidden elephants graveyard, where they are attacked by spotted hyenas, led by the ruthless Shenzi. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and manages to convince them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. So Sad! He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing Shenzi's clan to live in the Pride Lands. Simba collapses in a desert by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the oasis with his two new friends and other animals in their oasis, living a carefree life under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit living on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realising that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands. Will Simba save the animals from the evil Scar, and revenge the death of his father? I don't want to spoil the ending if you've been living under a rock most of your life and don't know what happens, so I will stop the explanation right there. For those people who are not into there Disney type animation movies, it's still worth a watch because the CGI is outstanding. The music didn't seem as magical as it did in the original film, and I was a bit disappointed with the Elton John song at the end, but the attention to detail was brilliant, even though they could have done more with the hair on the animals. Personally, I would watch the movie again, and in terms of the animation, it is the best that I have seen in a long time, but I was unable to give it a perfect score because the comedy element needed more work. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jon Favreau, who brought you Made in 2001, Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, Iron Man 1 & 2, Cowboys & Aliens, Chef and The Jungle Book. He is due to direct another Jungle Book movie but that is just rumours at the moment. He is definitely a versatile director, who has given his projects his all, even Cowboys & Aliens, and with a successful acting career, and an infectious passion for film, I commend him for his achievements in cinema so far. He has been responsible for some of the biggest movies of all time, including Iron Man and Elf which is always guaranteed an airing over Christmas time. His use of VR in this film was a unique method to show different angles of the characters and scenery on screen. The actors also acted out every scene, except for just talking into a microphone, so the chemistry between the various character's was actually real. It certainly deserved the massive profit that it made at the box office, and it's currently the 7th biggest movie of all time, beating the original movie which is in 49th place.Budget: $260million

42,SAMTHEBESTEST,THANK YOU DISNEY FOR RETAINING THE NOSTALGIA,7,19 July 2019,"THE LION KING REVIEW :
Animated Classics by Disney went on to cross the age barriers and box office calculations 2 decades ago and are stills remembered after so many years. The Lion King carrying immense popularity and high standard was never an easy task to be remade, yet the big names attested with product left us with some hopes. Thankfully Disney and Jon Favreau succeeds in retaining the Nostalgia of Original Animated Classic after 25 years. The quality of original classic can never be matched, it is always about going somewhere close to that level and The Lion King doesn't fail to walk on the right path.The Lion King is story about, as we all know King Mufasa murdered by his own brother Scar and then his Son Simba returns to aquire his Father's Kingdom. It is just not about the revenge, it is about Pride, honour, responsibility, being a True King and a Saviour. There is too much in this one narrative along with emotional Bonding and hilarious characters like Timon and Pumbaa. Firstly, the execution of such a big film is done excellently by makers. Disney does not compromise or reduce that Big Scale adventure. One could have never imagined animational biggie coming in live action on this much big canvas. Of course the credit will go to VFX makers as they not only create the fictional world but also made us believe in it. Screenplay having no loo breaks and dull portion is like tremendously turbo speed engine which picks up at the start and runs throughout till the end. Musically it was even a bigger challenge in this remake and fortunately that quality has been kept intact. Hans Zimmer returns to compose those lovable song and you're gonna love 'Hakuna Matata' anyways.From the director's point of view The Lion King lioks uncompromised, untouched and healthy remake. Jon Favreau missed something with The Jungle Book but this time he tried to bring everything possible from the original Saga. As a whole Jon Favreau's The Lion King retains the nostalgia of Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff's timeless tale in Mainstream Commercial entertainment attire. It might just fail to stand upto some people's expectations who have experienced the original one and kept it in heart forever otherwise, new generation gonna experience old wine in new Glass. Exclude those some people and you will definitely like it equally compared to the 1994's Memorial, oh sorry slightly less would be Great.RATING- 7/10*",The Lion King
43,matthewssilverhammer,STOP PAYING DISNEY TO LAZILY REMAKE YOUR CHILDHOOD,3,26 July 2019,"My question going into the latest ""pay-us-for-your-nostalgia"" Disney-remake was, ""Why do we need this? What new can it bring?"". Technically, the CGI animation is impressively state-of-the-art and new. Otherwise, my worst fears were warranted. It's not just similar to its source material but is 100% the same in almost every aspect. From moment one, when the iconic ""NAAAH SA-VIN-YAAAH!"" bursts forth, I realized they were so beholden to the '94 classic they didn't even bother rerecording that vocal. It sets the stage for both the larger things (story beats / scenes), as well as the smaller things (specific line deliveries), to be a lazy karaoke tune. So frustratingly unimaginative, it makes 2019's Aladdin look like a feat of original storytelling.
Thankfully, the greatness of the story is left untouched, though it was already plenty great without being redone. The few things that are changed don't expand the story, but just extend scenes past the point of reasonable story economics. We're forced to sit through self-congratulatory animation montages that are useless beyond ""look what we did!""
Crowds seem to be going for the cast, and many of those performances are the highlights. Listening to Glover & Beyonce sing together is special, Scar is decently rendered, and Rogen & Eichner offer the most unique and successful moments. Still, with dialogue so slavish, you can sense the actors desperately trying not to copy what they grew up hearing.
Honestly, even the technical brilliance is often a hindrance. By making the animals photoreal, we take away individual personalities, physical nuances, and even facial expressions, all of which help us relate to their plight. So, again I ask, why do we need this?",The Lion King
44,Vartiainen,Garbage,1,9 August 2019,"I did not want to see this movie. I did not want the Mouse to think that I in any way support this new trend of simply remaking old Disney classics with wooden actors and sparkling CGI. But alas, I was dragged into the movie theatre anyway, and here I am, telling you that I'm deeply ashamed that the Great Black Mouse of Disney has my money. Yet again.Because I was right in not wanting to see this film. Because this is the bottom of the barrel. The other movies have kind of been shot for shot remakes, but every single one of them has had at least something new. Some other angle, some twist, to make it interesting. This, one the other hand? Holy cow in heaven, is this bad. The beginning, for example. You know, The Circle of Life, one of the most recognizable and striking movie openings in history. The exact same. Shot for shot, camera angle for camera angle, the exact same. Except, you know, not as colourful, iconic or fetching. Because it's supposed to look real. Which in this case apparently means that everything looks either more wrinkled, dusty and/or dirty in general. Because that's Serengeti for you. According to the film makers.Luckily they stopped with the exact shot for shot soon after that, thank heavens, but that was only a minor relief. Because you know what else happens, when you try to make everything look as real as possible? Aside from everything looking like it's going to give you fleas. It makes everything look emotionless! Lions are not exceptionally renowned for their wide range of facial expressions, you know. The reason you can make animated movies with animals as the main characters is because animation doesn't care that lions can't have facial expressions. You can go outside the realms of biology and what's strictly speaking possible. You can exaggerate, emote and play loose with the rules. You can use colours, shapes and perspectives to compensate, to make it look interesting. This film has none of that! It's a dull, emotionless, flat table reading of dialogues we all know and love, but which are given nothing to support them.Not helping the matter is the fact that they hired celebrity voice actors. These people are talented entertainers, yes, and they look fetching on a poster, but none of them is exactly renowned for their voice acting capabilities. And boy does that show! Even James Earl Jones sounds like he's about to keel over and pass beyond the veil at any moment. There's very little of the majesty and gravitas of the original Mufasa left in his performance.And I actually misspoke earlier. This thing has one new thing in it. A song. A song by Beyonce, named Spirit. Because apparently that was the price of getting her on board. Or perhaps Disney wants an Original Song Oscar nomination. I don't know, but the song is awful and feels exactly like what it is. A forced, jammed in last-minute addition.Saints in heaven, was this a bad movie. It's a bit over a week after I saw it, but writing this review actively ruined my morning. I feel awful even thinking about this. About the fact that Disney has made incredible amounts of money with this. That they're going to keep making these.And I contributed to it. I think I might be sick. Excuse me.",The Lion King
45,lisafordeay,Stunning visuals yet its the same story disappointing,5,26 July 2019,"The Lion King is the remake of the 1994 film of the same name which was dubbed the greatest animated film of all time along with winning an Oscar for Best Song by Elton John.
I'm going to break down the pros and cons and my final verdict of the film as I don't want to break down the synopsis as its the same as the 1994 version.Pros
Excellent visuals and the voice cast is fairly good.
Seth Rogen and Bill Eishner as Timon & Pumbaa stole the entire film.
Love Beyonce's new song Spirit which can be heard in the film.
Donald Glover was great as Simba.
Cons
Same story
Pointless
Same score as the 1994 version
Mufassa's death didn't have me emotionally invested at all as like I said in my first con its the exact same as the animated one.Verdict: If you love The Lion King (as I much as I do since its my runner up film of all time)then you probably might like it,but for me I was just robbed as I wanted changes in this film e.g. change Mufassa's death scene. At least with the remakes of both Aladdin and Beauty & The Beast we did know what was going to happen but at least it wasn't using the same script and the same exact score like what this Lion King gave us. Its like they took the 1994 script and just read it out loud in a booth but without giving it emotions.

I thought to myself if you like the animated film, you'll like the live action one. No one can replace the great Robin Williams, but Will Smith's take on the genie was well worth seeing, as well as the political updates they made to certain characters for 2019.
Now A lot of people loved the original Lion King, but I don't feel that if you love the original you'll love this one.
It's funny, I'll give it that. Seth Rogen and Billy Eincher as Tamon and Pumba are great. Keegan Micheal key and Eric Andre as the hyenas are fantastic!
Everything else...is noticeably not better that the original.
What I really feel weaken it for this adaption was the music. Same songs from the first movie where not poppin at all. I just can't wait to be king did not have the same flavor. The song that Scar( who was horrible in this film)sings lost something in its attempts to be more menacing.
I'm not trashing the movie. It was good. Just letting you know what worked and what didn't (In order to brace a certain generation who is in love with the original, cause you won't love the remake, you may only like it)",The Lion King

Scenes with the animals are great, so was the voice acting, namely James Earl and Seth Rogen to name a few. And also very well directed by Jon Favreau, who also directed The Jungle Book. If you loved the original 1994 film, then give this film a look, you might like it.",The Lion King
48,kevin_robbins,"This is a slightly above average film, which you'd never expect from a Lion King storyline.",6,12 July 2021,"The Lion King (2019) is a movie we saw in theatres immediately upon its release. The storyline focuses on a son growing up with his dad who due to a series of unfortunate events has to replace his dad as King of their basin in the jungle. Overwhelmed by the change of guard and responsibility he goes into hiding and his ruthless uncle takes over his father's kingdom. All hope seems to be lost for the jungle until one of his childhood friends finds the son and tries to convince him to return and restore order. This movie is directed by Jon Favreau (Elf) and includes the voice of Beyonce (Austin Powers: Gold Member), Seth Rogen (Pineapple Express), James Earl Jones (Star Wars), Danny Glover (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Keegan-Michael Key (Tomorrowland). The storyline for this was a huge step down from the original with a few modifications to the end, the hyena scene, and the song selection with some classics missing and some new songs inserted that were not as good. This entire soundtrack is kind of blah to be honest. The depiction of some characters like the hyenas were just poor - they were funny, entertaining and one of my favorite parts of the original, they were kind of an afterthought in this. The build-up and expectations for this, especially with the greatness of the original and other live-action Disney pictures, was high and this fell way short. This is a slightly above average film, which you'd never expect from a Lion King storyline. I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once but not adding it to your movie collection.",The Lion King
49,stevendbeard,Very Good CGI,7,20 July 2019,"I saw ""The Lion King"", starring the voices of Donald Glover-Atlanta_TV, Spider_Man:Homecoming; James Earl Jones-the Star Wars movies, The Meteor Man; Bey once Knowles_Carter-Obsessed, Austin Powers in Gold member and Chiclets Heretofore-Doctor Strange, Salt.
First of all, this movie has been referred to as a live action remake. That is not true. It is CGI. But, it is very good CGI. It looks great. It's directed by Jon Favreau, who recently directed the live action remake of the Jungle Book. The original Lion King was made in 1994-with a couple of sequels-and only one of the original actors from those movies shows up here. James Earl Jones. They do use the original songs, plus some new ones, too. As far as the story goes, it's basically the same. James/Mufasa is the king of the jungle and when he has Donald/Simba, he wants to train him as the future king. Chiwetel/Scar is James' brother, who has dreams of being king, but is frustrated with the birth of Donald, the new heir to the throne. Beyonce/Nala is the girlfriend and future queen of Donald. Chiwetel in his bid for the throne, plans bad things for his brother-James-and his nephew Donald. Like I said earlier, the CGI looks incredibly life like. If you are a fan of the original, you should enjoy this one. I myself, am not a big Disney fan-they are ok but not my favorite-whereas my wife loves them so I'm sure she will really like this one more than I did. I will be taking her to see it at a later date.
It's rated ""PG"" for violence & peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
It looked good and the story was good but it's not one that I would buy-except for the grandkids. It would be a good rental.",The Lion King
50,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Lion King,5,23 July 2019,5/10 - the only thing this one improves upon or even truly changes is the visual CGI and thus proves itself unnecessary of remaking a still recent story (as if releasing a colorized version of a black-and-white film that came out just years earlier),The Lion King
51,GiraffeDoor,Something is rotten in the state of ...somewhere in Africa...,8,30 November 2020,"I tried to be open minded about these remakes from the start and I have few objections to this.A hot point was that they looked too much like the animals they were supposed to be and therefor lacked expressiveness. Well, I feel they were able to put a lot of character into them by way of excellent voice acting and body language and any limitations in facial expressions were more of a featural thing. I thought they were kind of expressive, personally...I thought it was strange to have no new songs but I still enjoyed the ride with a lot of familiar stuff but all interpreted in a way that felt spontaneous and fresh.I don't care for the flatulence but the animals are all adorable and look fabulous so it kind of balances out.Scar and whoever plays him is amazing and they kept James Earl Jones so let's be grateful.",The Lion King
52,alindsay-al,A Fantastic recreation of an amazing original film,9,24 July 2019,"We are in the age of remakes of animated classics and it is the turn of The Lion King and I thought this was a fantastic representation of a classic film, it is not a replacement for the original film but a brilliant film to go alongside it. The premise of the film sees new heir to the throne of the Animal Kingdom Simba have to grow up and overcome the troubles of his nefarious uncle Scar. We see two versions of Simba and both are great, the child version of Simba really does a great job at being innocent and delivering a heartfelt performance. Donald Glover playing the adult version also really worked and he nailed the character and really provided a great voice acting performance. In my opinion a real highlight of this film is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, he has such a presence about the role in this film. Scar is a great character and Ejiofor really bought all the complexity of the character out and made him a very memorable villain. Another big highlight of the film is the fantastic chemistry between Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumbaa, they are so funny in the film and provide a great counter in this film from some of the draker moments in the film. Alfre Woodard, Beyonce, John Oliver & James Earl Jones all do great jobs and emphasise why this is one of the best casts assembled for any movie. The story is goof, delivering the mix of drama and humour that would be expected in this film, however, like the majority of these Disney rermakes the film is quite formulaic and it is noticeable in this film that it is very similar to the original film. The script is great, this film for me does a really good job, it does a great job of blending a fun film with great dramatic moments in it. The style is amazing in this film, visually it looks stunning with some of the best CGI that you are gonna see in any film around, plus the use of colour is really important in this film and the story of the film. All the songs are back from the original and they are sung excellently by the cast.

Timon present Pumbaa as food to the hyena! The song in the film also very related to the scene! Such as, Simba singing he will be the future king at the beginning! That famous ""Hakuna Matata"" song sing along with Pumbaa and Timon! ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" song playing, when adult Nala accidentally met adult Simba! And the ""Spirit"" song sing by Beyonce playing at the end! At the end, Simba went back to Pride Land after persuade by Nala! He confront with Scar and knowing Scar actually kill his father!

However, it doesn't do enough to separate itself from its predecessor, as it's largely the same thing just with an - admittedly beautiful - animation facelift.I like Donald Glover, Seth Rogan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Beyoncé in this, though they don't stop it from being one of Disney's weakest and most needless remakes; which is only worthy to those who haven't seen the 1994 release.",The Lion King
56,kirbylee70-599-526179,A ROARING SUCCESS,10,5 November 2019,"The magic of movies is their ability to transports us from our everyday existence into wondrous worlds we will never have the opportunity to explore. These worlds are not limited to worlds outside of our solar system but worlds within our own planet as well. They might take us somewhere in history. They might take us 20,000 leagues under the sea. Or they might transport us to the plains of Africa. Such is the case with THE LION KING.Based on the animated feature from 1994, now 25 years in our past, Disney has added this tale to their series of remakes that are ""live action"" versions of older films. I use the quotes around this because while this film looks live every single thing in it with the exception of a sunrise sequence at the film's opening was created inside of a computer. From the hair in the lion's manes to the twigs on the ground, everything was done this way.If you're not familiar with the story it's a Shakespearean tragedy in the works. Loyalty, betrayal, family murder and diabolical manipulations in the royal court make up this story. The film opens with the birth of Simba, the young cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Held aloft by baboon shaman Rafiki for all to hail only one member of the royal court is missing. Scar, the brother of the king named so for the disfigurement on his face, is lamenting the birth. He feels the throne is rightfully his and does little to disguise his unhappiness.Simba is a playful and inquisitive cub. He makes friends with a lioness named Nala, another cub destined to be his queen though the two think this could never happen. Scar plays on Simba's inquisitive nature and plots with the hyenas to lure him away from the pride and have them kill him. They fail and he sets another plan in motion.Creating a stampede of wildebeests Simba is nearly killed until his father rescues him. Wounded while doing so he clings for life on a ledge. Scar sees this as his chance and pushes his hands free killing him in the fall. But Simba blames himself for the death of his father and Scar encourages this belief, telling him to run away which he does.On his journey Simba meets a warthog named Pumba and a meerkat named Timon. They become fast friends and take him to their home where Simba grows into a full sized lion. Time having passed Nala comes across Simba and tells him he needs to come home. Scar has laid Simba's homeland to waste and is killing more than he should. The land is barren and the animals are leaving. Only a true king can lead the land back to what it once was. But can Simba find that strength and courage to do so or will Scar rule out?There is a depth of story here that most animated features don't espouse to. And many that do fail to achieve the goal of being both a story with some meat on it and entertaining at the same time. THE LION KING achieves both of these goals and does so with so much emotion that you'll find yourself having a difficult time not cheering out loud for Simba or crying at moments like Musafa's death. Director Jon Favreau has taken the original film and copied it nearly verbatim, adding tweaks here and there and giving it an entire new look with the CGI animation.That animation is amazing to look at. It's difficult to describe the intensity of the look of this film. As I said every image on screen here from the backgrounds to the creatures are all done inside a computer. And while CGI films of the past have offered some amazing visuals this movie takes it to a whole other level. I can remember the first time I saw MONSTERS INC. and was stunned at the hair on Sully moving in the wind. But this is far beyond that. The animals move like real animals, the breeze moves branches, the drops of rain that hit the ponds leave ringlets that expand out. Every detail is meticulously planned and works here. As the movie progresses you suddenly are in that world and believe you are watching reality as opposed to animation. That is a stupendous achievement.I'll be honest, I wasn't looking for this movie to impress me that much. I still haven't decided if the desire to alter Disney's classic films into CGI fests is a good or a bad move. Some have done well and others have not been that impressive. This one though is one that needs to be seen. I will say this. The animation here is so good that some of the scenes may be disturbing for small children. So be prepared to talk to them about what takes place. If you can do that then this film will hold their attention from start to finish with no problems. My guess is that like me, you'll add this one to your shelf to watch not once or twice but repeatedly, enjoying every minute as you do so.",The Lion King

Though the film lacks on any truly new material worthwhile, and is choppy and uneven with some of its delivery of new material, not everything is lost when it comes to this remake. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen provide fairly good performances as Timon and Pumbaa, and the graphics (CGI) are needless to say breathtaking. Besides the first third or so of the film, which is mostly a formulaic and tonely unstable retelling of the original, the film does prove to be at least mildly entertaining, and there is plenty of interest to be seen by the beautiful and undeniably realistic views it provides. In the end, The Lion King (2019) was somewhat pointless, and even though there is much missed potential when it comes to this Disney retelling, all we can truly say to make things better is that it could have been worse.

For years now they've been regurgitating old stories and giving them the ""live-action"" make over and for years I've been against it.On the upside, the technology developed here in order to create these near photo-realistic CGI animals is spectacular. This movie looks gorgeous. The voice talent is impressive as well.Exceptional visuals, strong voice talent and a classic story beloved by all, must be a home run, right?NOPE!The visuals turn out to be a tremendous hinderance. What was fun on cartoons turns out to be creepy and off putting on nearly lifelike animals. To their credit, they did try to tone down some of the crazier scenes but again, when the source material is so beloved, losing parts of it sting a little and seeing the exact same thing only not as good just... falls flat.Seriously, this is a weird experience. The stunning visuals really kill this, something I never thought I'd say. It's impossible to enjoy or get into a movie when every single scene is weird looking and takes the viewer out of the realism, severely magnifying all flaws along the way.If it weren't included with Disney+ and essentially free, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this.

However, the fact that this is real life animation, similar to the brilliant Jungle Book (2016), makes this Lion King highly watchable. The problem I think is not that this version 'lacks heart' as some reviews have said, but that, for parents, it is a nightmare as to know what age can safely enjoy this.

68,davidmvining,A bad adaptation of an overrated original,4,25 November 2019,"I've never quite understood the appeal of Disney's mid-90s animated movie The Lion King. But, here comes Disney again with its latest money-making scheme to feast on nostalgia, their ""live action"" remake.So, when we ended up going to the theater, I took this as an opportunity to re-evaluate the film that everyone else around me loves but I always find myself standing just off from.In a nutshell, The Lion King is the story of an entitled brat who nearly gets himself and his best friend killed, succeeds in getting his father killed, runs away for a few years where he loafs with some buds, suddenly decides to come back and murder his uncle because he wants his uncle's stuff.I hate Simba. It's not just that he's an entitled and lazy brat for the first three-quarters of the film, it's that he's a terribly written character without an arc in a movie where he's supposed to have an arc. He's the same from the beginning to the three-quarters mark where he suddenly becomes hero just because he decides to be. There's supposed to be parallels to Hamlet, but Hamlet actually worked his way up to killing Claudius over the course of the entire play while Simba decides with about fifteen minutes of the movie left that Scar needs to go.On top of Simba's lack of growth and arc is the movie's cheapness. I don't mean in terms of production (this new ""live action"" one looks very expensive from beginning to end), but in terms of storytelling techniques to get the audience cheering for one side over the other. The Pride Lands, the lion kingdom, is a veritable paradise where, it seems, that no animal ever eats another. There's talk of it, but, oddly enough, in a movie about lions we never seen lions feed on anything save bugs when Simba is with his bros (Timon and Pumpa). Then, when Scar takes over, the place becomes a post-apocalyptic vision because the hyenas ate...all of the herbivores? Then, when Simba throws Scar into the fire, the Pride Lands become verdant and beautiful again (and all of the animals that Scar's army supposed ate all just came back again). It's cheap and designed to get the audience to hate Scar just that extra bit.The irony is that Scar, out of all of the characters, is the best. I wouldn't go so far as to call him well-written, but he's the best of a bad bunch. Scar has more to do with Richard III than Claudius, and the writers did what they could to imbue him with the same sneaky, scheming qualities. In the first act, as Scar works to get his brother, Mufasa, murdered, he's actually kind of fun. He's a pretty good bad guy.Now, you may notice that everything up to this point could be said about the animated version. That's because the two movies are virtually identical in terms of story. There are some small changes here and there (Scar has an extra line of dialogue early that makes him slightly more ideological, Timon and Pumpa are much more meta than before), but they're small changes. The biggest change is, of course, the use of realistic lions, and it does a disservice to the story. Simba's expressive eyes are gone. Instead of looking like he's crying, he looks like a cat. It deadens the limited emotional impact. I do wonder if Jon Favreau, the director, got to a certain point in production and realized that the lack of emoting was a problem. It obviously didn't matter because the movie has made, and will continue to make, oodles of money for the Mouse House.So, yeah, it's the same movie, but worse. Even the voice actors are, across the board, worse, even James Earl Jones who reprises his role of Mufasa. None of the new voices do as good a job this time as last time.But hey, Can You Feel the Love Tonight sure sounds good, doesn't it?",The Lion King
69,TheOneThatYouWanted,Meh,6,14 September 2020,Sort of meh. Below average to be frank. I am getting to the point where watching Disney films might have to be more optional than mandatory. This film is so freaking forgettable.,The Lion King
70,jadepietro,Dethroned,8,21 July 2019,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A visually well-made remake that entertains, even if this version doesn't compare to its wonderful original source.JIM'S REVIEW: A remake is a remake is a remake. Call it what you will, give it any fancy name...a re-envisioning...a re-imagining...a re-boot, it's still second class goods all wrapped up in a new shiny package, desperate for your love and admiration. This pre-owned substitute wants to earn your respect, status, and money, but it rarely achieves its glory when compared to the original product. That adage holds true with The Lion King (2019).But first, let us pay homage to The Lion King (1994), one of the best animated films ever made. This second version is already against the odds from the start. It's a monumental challenge to outdo perfection. Roger Allers' and Rob Minkoff's film was, and still is, a perfect blending of hand-drawn animation and strong narrative structure with a little experimentation into the early realm of CGI thrown in. That innovative animated film filled the screen with artistry, awe-inspiring visuals, and characters that created a deep emotional bond. The original was just that...original. It earned its seal of approval due to its imaginative and groundbreaking vision.Twenty five years later, we now have The Lion King (2019). Lovingly remastered, this updated model is a class act, but it's not a classic as its predecessor. The computer generated imagery is masterfully done and the photo realism is incredible in its artistry. It replicates the original source with many of its iconic moments, minus some of the charm.In case you are new to the plot: This is a coming-of-age tale of Simba, a lion cub on his circle of life journey. Along the way, he befriends Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, falls in love with Nala, a feisty lioness, and battles the evil Scar who wants to rule his kingdom.This 2019 film is a highly entertaining venture with wonderful state-of-the-art computer animation. It is solidly directed by Jon Favreau who delivered a wonderful and improved remake of The Jungle Book some years back. The Lion King (2019) has a photo realistic look that one can commend for its craftsmanship and applaud all of the dedicated talent involved. The film certainly merited my admiration but this reviewer just could not feel the love tonight, or any day for that matter. This virtual reality approach to the film tended to distance this viewer rather than beguile him.(An aside: I hesitate to call this a live action version since nearly every frame is computer generated. Nothing is real except the realness. The background scenes, handsomely photographed by Caleb Deschanel, are gorgeous in their saturated colors and lushness. The animated animals are walking and talking specimens of detailed textures, astonishing true-to-life figures designed to match their living peers in every way. Dear Moviegoers, you may have a decidedly different aesthetic view on this animation style than myself. I mostly favor the direct ""old-fashioned"" hand-drawn intimacy of pen to paper.)Still, one cannot see this version without the nostalgic reminders of yesteryear. There is a commonality by tradition in the inherent animated art form itself. Characters emoted in their cartoon style and the result was a triumph of line and color. In the first film, their expressions are more accepting and genuine as they pranced around and sang the pop songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. This later CGI remake seems incongruous. The natural appears unnatural as they perform the same song-and dance duties. The artistic equivalent is vastly different on screen due to the change from hand-drawn medium to computer generated technology. At times, the overall effect is oddly disconcerting and, at other times, very gratifying.The voice-over work ranges the gamut from okay to excellent. The more multi-cultural and politically correct cast includes Donald Glover (a nice addition), JD McCrary (fine as the young Simba), Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner (blending their comedic interactions seamlessly), Alfre Woodard, John Kani, John Oliver, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, and Chiwetel Ejofor (not as truly menacing in the vocal department, but a very close second to Jeremy Iron's original masterful emoting of the villainous Scar). James Earl Jones is wisely recruited to reprise his role as Simba's father, Mufasa. Oh, that glorious and unmistakable voice! (Also, welcome back to Hans Zimmer's notable instrumental music score.)All in all, the film remains highly enjoyable family fare. The final revised product is a well-made diversion that should delight today's audiences. Perhaps a younger generation might embrace this remake and its modern advances in CGI with more fervor than this reviewer, especially if they have never seen the superior 1994 version. Most of Mr. Favreau's movie is a faithful retelling of the previously successful formula, almost shot-by-shot, and rarely does the film stray from its source. It is as if the powers that be did not want to tamper with the well-loved property or disappoint the film's built-in devoted fan base, and in doing so, tamp down the genuine ingenuity of its artisans to adapt or achieve a new fresh vision. With all the technical acuity on display, the needed creative spark that abounds in the original version is somehow lacking here.Still, Mr. Favreau has given The Lion King (2019) the royal Disney treatment, although literally, its lineage is regrettably missing, which becomes its ultimate undoing. Yes, there is so very much to like in The Lion King (2019), but just not much to truly love.",The Lion King

73,lewiskendell,There's little here to recommend.,5,22 July 2019,"When you remake a classic, it has to be better or it will seem very unnecessary to the original audience. ""Different"" just is not quite good enough.The 2016 remake of The Jungle Book is a great example. It took the original movie and breathed new life into the story with charm. I liked it more than I ever did the traditionally animated version.In comparison, this version of The Lion King is the same, but updated. And those updates felt worse, almost each and every time.The computer animation is certainly impressive in its photorealisim, but the characters were uniformly less charming and interesting as a result. The elephant graveyard is no longer terrifying. Pride Rock is much less majestic. The savannah seems sparse and empty.The songs were anemic and underwhelming compared to the original soundtrack, which is one of the best Disney ever produced. The new version of ""Be Prepared"" would have fared better being left out of the movie entirely.The new voice actors ranged from passable to forgettable. It was jarring seeing the incredibly realistic animals' mouths moving in speech.Positives? Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner were amusing as Timon and Pumbaa. Realistic hyenas are certainly scarier and more menancing than cartoons.If I had never seen the original Lion King. I would have though this was an okay, if unremarkable movie that looks more like a showcase for how far computer animation has come in rendering realistic-looking animals. If you see it, see it for that reason. I don't think I'll fell compelled to ever watch this version of the movie ever again.",The Lion King

I had heard that THE LION KING might be scary for anyone under 10, but I wasn't that scared (although I was a little scared, especially when things jumped out on the screen). I liked the way they made the animals talk (it would have been boring if they hadn't). I thought the last part (the fight on the cliff in the fire) was very exciting. There is a lot of singing. Most parts are happy and some parts are a little sad and scary. If you love animals, this will be a good movie for you. I give this movie a rating of 10 (the best) out of 10.(*Age Appropriate Critic)Thank you, Sophie. I'll add my two cents, now. I went into the movie with a little caution. This had been my mother's favourite Disney animated movie so it was going to be tricky emotionally, missing Mom and hoping they didn't mess it up. In some ways this was a different movie. They had to switch up some of the story telling to facilitate the difference between animation and live action. They added a couple of songs and of course the voice talent was all new. The highlights of the movie, for me, was the beautiful photography and the ambient soundtrack, which were so artfully intertwined. They also had the added problem that the real violence of nature had to be retrofitted for a young audience. I'm not sure the ""circle of life"" speech Mufasa gave Simba would have registered with the young audience and the violence that is inherent to life (and death) of wild creatures is hard to assimilate with cute cubs, personified chums and beloved characters, so it was confined to our heroes killing and eating non-character bugs and grubs. The exciting ending, of which Sophie spoke, I found to be a little long and drawn out. But, all in all, I thought it was a good movie. I will always prefer the original but give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Young Adventure}",The Lion King

I thought they did a great job with this. Granted you aren't going to see Timon dress in drag and sing a little song while offering up Pumba, on a serving tray and an apple in his mouth, to the hyenas but it was still a fun film to watch.I don't care what others think of my opinion when writing my reviews because I am simply going to give credit when I believe credit is due.

77,Abdulxoxo,Just for show,6,13 January 2021,"The photorealism of this film is second to none. The rendering of the animation is quite brilliant. it's probably the most realistic looking animation of all time. Of course the trade off with having the characters look like real animals does mean that they do not have the facial expressions to convey emotion in the way we humans recognise. For the vast majority of the movie the characters appear to have blank expressions, which is one of the aspects about this film that makes it feel soulless. Another aspect is the lack of effort that comes across in most of the voice acting. They all felt bland. There is no majesty or theatricality in their voices. Even James Earl Jones, returning as Mufasa, didn't feel right. I have to say the majority of the songs, most of which are iconic, just felt mediocre, and Beyonce's new song for this film, 'Spirit', is misplaced and almost completely forgettable. This best song is probably ""I can't wait to be king"" sung by Simba and Nala when they're just cubs. As far as story is concerned, it's just a carbon copy of the original. On the whole, this film just pales in comparison to the original in almost every department.",The Lion King

The film's primary focus seems to be the delivery of photorealistic CGI animals - which it does, gloriously - although this quickly becomes a double-edged sword. Whilst it assists in the more dramatic moments - stampede, climactic pride rock showdown, anytime Mufasa's mane blows in the wind - it severely hampers the comedic elements due to the reality-grounding limits of the visual presentation. Whereas Favreau's 2016 The Jungle Book (and the modern Planet of the Apes trilogy) had a darker tone to suit the scarily lifelike animals, this mouse-house adventure relies on its toe-tapping joviality to offset, and actually strengthen, its serious scenes. Unfortunately then, gone are the amusing cutaways (Timon dancing in a Hawaiian skirt, Simba emerging from the lake with a puffy mane to name a couple) whilst the song-and-dance sequences lose their more overt fantastical strands (no hyenas playing bone xylophones = sad face). There's a relatively strict adherence to the original's plot and visual motifs with only a few minor tweaks and additions, however these fail to add anything meaningful beside the occasional smile-worthy meta-joke. The voice cast are hit-and-miss too, with comparisons to original counterparts hard to look past for some (not needed for the only returning cast member, James Earl Jones, who is of course always amazing as the regal Mufasa). So whilst Donald Glover (adult Simba) brings his child-like panache, Billy Eichner (Timon) amps up the snark and Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) nails the dopey optimism, Chiwetel Ejiofor (Scar) fails to reach Jeremy Irons level of terror and John Oliver (Zazu) lacks Rowen Atkinson's hilarious pomp. Although a jaw-dropping visual feat without doubt, this Lion King lacks wonder, excitement and memorable humour.",The Lion King
82,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"A Technical Marvel Lacking Depth, Discovery and Awe of the Original.",5,26 July 2019,"Here it is: The Lion King (2019) and it's the EXACT same movie we got 25 years ago, only this time... less energy and not-so vivid imagery from Iron Man's Jon Favreau himself? Yeah; for all the box office records this film seems to be breaking it shows that Disney's critic-proof with the 'right' films, but it's not a good sign for creatively bankrupt films like these: shallow remakes that forget what made the original so memorable and think that repeating EVERY story beta will make the film any more or less different to how it was before.This take on The Lion King suffers many of the same problems as the Ghostbusters reboot: its a cliff-notes abbreviation of the stuff that worked before with little to no variety in the narrative changes; and for the changes that ARE there, they aren't terribly strong on their own as narrative devices. There are nice touches here and there: the extra animals surrounding Timon and Pumbaa were nice and varied but the main characters are supposed to be THE main attraction. This film shows Simba struggling to make his whole redemption arc convincing and not phoned-in from the original's screenplay, and the voice acting: it was one of the most middling voices for me. You know the dialogue but the delivery of such key plot points in this movie are under-developed that it's not even bad under-playing of the lines.What did I like about this movie? The music's still AWESOME, the animation is top-notch stuff even if it doesn't fit the vivid, larger than life 'Broadway Style musical animated feature' aesthetic, and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa was a nice change from the original.The Lion King: it's a spectacle that's too beholden to the original movie to say anything different at all. The story's the literal same as the original, but the animation and music help spice things up for the viewers uninitiated in this kind of drama.This remake gets 2.5/5 stars.

86,proud_luddite,Good though less than the original,7,11 November 2019,"A photo-realistic animated remake of the original 1994 (traditionally) animated film: Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones), the reigning king of the Pride Lands, initiates his cub Simba (voiced by JD McCrary and Donald Glover) to the rules of royalty and prepare him to eventually be king. The lives of both Mufasa and Simba are in danger as Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), Mufasa's envious brother, is scheming to take over as the reigning monarch.The original version is rightly esteemed as one of the best animated films of all time. A remake is almost always in an awkward position when compared with an original. I am among the few who believe that the live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" was an improvement on the original. The updated ""Lion King"" is not in this position but it does have its good points.The updated animation, thanks to modern technology, is magnificent. It has an effect that makes the film thrilling for the most part. While the showdown/finale was good, it didn't seem to live up to the quality of what preceded it. For one thing, Scar - at least in this version - is not one of the sharpest of Disney villains.

Unfortunately, The Lion King has become another addition to Disney's current addiction to taking their animated classics and remaking them in live action, and it had not been kind to it. The characters show no emotion, the remake does not add anything new to keep the story fresh (like most other remakes did), and while James Earl Jones did come back, he has no new lines and was mainly brought in for the sake of nostalgia.

With everyone complaining about the ""expressionless animals"" I wasn't expecting sooooooo much expression. They do smile (a bit), and express compassion, love and fear (but of course, not like the 94' cartoons, that would be unrealistic and dumb).Did someone notice these guys made animals talk? I repeat. Animals talking! Real animals talking. It's incredible!So:
Visually: Best animation ever
Story: Really good, but it feels a bit for kids, a bit simplistic.And then the problems:
Acting: Some great (Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar and the comedic trio of Rogen as Pumba, Oliver's Zazu and Billy Eichner's amazing Timon), some lackluster (Glover's Simba) and some lame (Beyoncé as Nala)Music: Really bad. I didn't remember the original songs, and now in home I'm listening and they improved ""Be Prepared"" (Scar song); and maintained the good Hakuna and Circle of Life.
Other than that, the music is the same with some new ones added. And all of them were AWFUL. Disgusting music. So freaking BORING! I HATED IT. The ""Coco"" soundtrack may as well be the entire Johann Sebastian Bach life work compared to this.

91,rockman182,The Lion King (2019),7,20 July 2019,"I think we all have seen The Lion King as a child. Whether you want to admit it or not, its a Disney classic. The songs and lines from the film are memorable and its up there with Disney animated ventures from their best decade. I question the need for every Disney live action film coming out but I've been surprised. Lion King was a strange case. Its got a great voice cast for sure but it looks like a feature length National Geographic documentary. I heard bad things about this going in. I'd say its decent. It follows the original work very, very, closely and I think it takes a lot of the if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy.The film takes place in the animal kingdom, where the king lion Mufasa has recently had a son named Simba. This young cub is destined to be the new leader at the behest of his scheming and jealous uncle Scar. Simba quickly learns the dangers of being next in line for the throne and then has to learn how to grow up and be a leader to his kingdom. The film interestingly brought back James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa. The film has a lot of voice talent like Donald Glover, Beyonce, and Seth Rogen.The visual and realistic nature of the animals is fairly amazing. The animals look so real and the recreation of the original animated features scenes is pretty remarkable. I thought visually its as good as can be. The film could have used some originality for sure but I wasn't so bothered with a remake that closely follows the source material. I haven't seen the animated version in a long time so recalling moments through a new film wasn't so bad. I felt some parts were very rushed though and not done as well as the original.The score and recreation of the classic songs was nice regardless. I know there will be a lot of complaining and it won't please everyone but I felt like it was a solid film and a good enough watch. Not very many complaints. I don't think it possesses all of the magic of the original but its still a faithful effort and I really mean you can see the effort there visually but maybe not so much so creatively. Pretty sure this will be a cash cow regardless for Disney as it was pretty hyped.7/10",The Lion King

93,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Technically proficient, but lacking the magic of the original.",4,29 November 2020,"Many years ago, I learned that The Lion King (1994) was basically the plot of Hamlet reenacted with animals. And while many people consider the original 2D animated version of this story to be one of the greatest Disney movies ever created, I never really cared that much for it. Fast forward to 2019, and the new ""live-action"" version of The Lion King is released. Again, I wasn't really wowed by anything in it because I was ambivalent to the whole story anyway. I did find it odd that they marketed it as ""live-action"" when it was completely CGI. It was an animated remake of an animated movie.Perhaps my biggest issue with this new version of The Lion King was that they didn't really change anything. It felt like the 1998 version of Psycho (1960) that recreated the whole movie shot-for-shot in color. While it was technically as close to the original movie as possible, it proved that a copy does not have the same amount of magic that makes the original a special piece of art. For the CGI version of The Lion King, there were no embellishments that other live-action remakes like Beauty and the Beast (2017) and Aladdin (2019) called upon to enhance the story.Another issue with this CGI version is what elements were prioritized in its visuals. While many animals do have fairly expressive behaviors, they are not nearly as expressive as the exaggerated emotions present in the 2D version. As such, this version felt flat and more like the voice actors were just talking over footage from a wildlife documentary. If anything, this is a testament to the power of today's computers, as they are able to create animals that look as lifelike as possible-not that it helps tell an emotional story that well.Technically proficient, but lacking the magic of the original, I give The Lion King 2.0 stars out of 5.",The Lion King
94,RforFilm,"The new The Lion King is ""Hakuna MaNADA"". It's practically a shot-for-shot remake that's pointless other then for the visual effects",4,19 July 2019,"If you were to ask me what I listened to as a child, I would have been quick to say the soundtrack to The Lion King. It was one of the first CDs I owned and I used to annoy my parents when I asked constantly to play it again and again on car rides. By the fifth rendition of ""Hakuna Matata"" or ""Be Prepared"", my dad would be ready to throw it out. A lot like how kids today wouldn't stop singing, ""Let it go"" from Frozen, I was on a Disney high from The Lion King, being the right age at eight back in 1995.If there's a lesson to learn from current Disney, it's that if there's nostalgia, there's money to be made. I've made it clear (with the exception of The Jungle Book) that I'm not a fan of the live action remakes, but because they're box office monsters, Disney will continue making them. It's a good plan to make a billion right away, but I'm sure it'll be bad strategy in the long run. Rather then creating new nostalgia, these movies are relying on borrowed nostalgia. But who knows, perhaps the remake of The Lion King can provide something new.After the birth of a new lion cub Simba, the Pride Lands are overjoyed with the arrival of the future king. Current king Mufasa (played by James Earl Jones) scolds his brother Scar (played by Chiwetal Ejiofer) for not attending, but he could care less. Simba grows into a curious cub whose excited about the notion of being king, even if it means stiring up some trouble and almost getting killed by the hyenas like Shenzi (played by Florence Kasumba) and Kamari (played by Keegan-Michael Key). Though watched by Zazu (played by John Oliver), Simba can't be protected forever.When a wildebeest stampede causes the death of Mufasa (of course with help by Scar), Simba thinks he's responsible and is encouraged to run away and never return. Simba eventually comes across meerkat Timon (played by Billy Eichner) and warthog Pumba (played by Seth Rogan) and learn about ""Hakuna Matata"", which means no worries. When he grows up, Simba (played by Donald Glover) lives a carefree life while Scar had taken the Pride Lands throne and desicrated the environment. Former friend of Simba, Nala (played by Beyoncé), sets out to find help and maybe find Simba to help dethrone Scar.Director Jon Favreau does a good job recreating the original animated classic...too closely in fact. The Lion King is so close that I might say this is a shot-for-shot remake. This makes me wonder the purpose of this. The answer is simple; money. Disney already knows their fans will return because of nostalgia, and it seems that The Lion King takes the steps necessary to ensure their basically getting the same movie. It's the same songs, same locations, same character, and in some cases, most of the same lines. I couldn't believe how lazy the film came out.Some might already throw out, ""what about the updated animation?"". I'll admit the photorealistic-like animation was impressive in The Jungle Book and it's the same here. It's amazing how the animals look real and how they move and behave. It can even look like a documentary. This also creates another problem in which it explains why the original animation was better. With the hand drawn style, the characters can express emotion more and the colors really leapt off the page and into my mind. The animals now react like real animals, which means little facial expression. Even the color here seems drab (which it has to be since it's supposed to be set in Africa).The impressiveness of the visual effect wears off after an hour and you just waiting to relive the moments from the original; the ""Circle of Life"" song, the stampede, the ""Hakuna Matata"" song, and Simba seeing his father in spirit. I know that remakes need to follow the story, but you'd think The Lion King could have taken a chance to explore other sides, like Scar's reign as king or new animals point of view. The original isn't flawless, but it now looks like a masterpiece thanks to the soulless remake he now have to live with.I'll give this four stars out of ten. I have a feeling that despite my complaints, this is going to earn another billion dollars t the company that's showing no end. If I had kids, I probably would have shown them the original instead. My only theory is that most kids have seen the hand drawn original and probably remember that over this one. For me, The Lion King is a ""Hakuta Manada"".",The Lion King

96,bankofmarquis,Middle of the Road,7,21 July 2019,"I have to give the Walt Disney Company credit, with their Live Action remakes of their classic animated movies, they have developed a very lucrative profit stream with properties that they already own - and are well known to audiences. Some are successful (THE JUNGLE BOOK, ALADDIN), some are not quite so successful (DUMBO, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).And...somewhere in the middle...is the LION KING.Directed by Jon Favreau (THE JUNGLE BOOK, IRON MAN), this Lion King is a fairly faithful reproduction of the animated movie - and that is a blessing and a curse - and it, ultimately, keeps this remake squarely in the middle in terms of quality, interest and achievement.What works: the CGI animation of the animals and scenery. Favreau shot CGI-fest films like THE JUNGLE BOOK and IRON MAN, so he knows how to do these things and they work here in a very workmanlike way. The are all professionally done - there's not a bad shot in the film. But the ""wow"" moments are few and far between in this film as wellThe story is a timeless classic (kind of an ""animal adventure Hamlet"") and that works as do OME of the voice cast (more on that later)...and...of course...the songs - especially the faithful recreation of the CIRCLE OF LIFE opening - one of the best opening musical numbers in movie history.What doesn't work: The first 1/2 of the film's pacing. It drags pretty badly early on and the songs in that part of the film (like I CAN'T WAIT TO BE KING) just don't have the energy and pizzazz that is needed. And SOME of the voice work is just plain bland and boring and (in one case) I found irritating.So...let's talk about the voice cast. James Earl Jones (reprising Mufasa) is terrific (of course) as is John Oliver's Zazu (a much bigger presence in this film than the animated film), Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar is appropriately menacing, if a bit bland, but ""good enough"" as is Beyonce's grown up Nala. I would have liked to see/feel a bit more of her ""presence"" in this character's voice, but that might be a Director choice and not an actress choice. John Kani's Rafiki is quite good as is the always steady/credible Alfre Woodward as Sarabi.What doesn't work is the two voice actors cast to play Simba. Donald Glover (TV's ATLANTA) is just too bland and boring as the adult Simba. He doesn't really bring anything interesting to his voice work of this character (but does hold his own in the musical duet ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" opposite the great Beyonce).I usually don't comment on child performances that I don't like (they are kids after all), so I won't really comment much on JD McCrary's voice performance as the young Simba except to say I didn't really how much MORE the young Simba is in this film as opposed to the older Simba - or at least it felt to me that the weakest voice performance in this film was on screen for far longer than I remembered from the animated film.As for the best voice performances in this film - that is easy - Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan's performance as Simba's pals Timon and Pumbaa. They had big shoes to fill in comparison to the voice work in the animated film from Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, so they did the smart thing - they didn't even try. Much like Will Smith not trying to imitate Robin Williams in the live action ALADDIN earlier this year (another voice performance that worked well) Eichner and Rogan make these characters their own and succeeded well - these two characters/performances are the high point in the film and bring much needed life and energy to a movie that was sagging under it's own weight by the time they show up.This Lion King will be THE Lion King for this generation - and that is ""fine"" - if the youngsters in my life want to watch this, I won't complain. But... I will try to steer them towards the much better animated version of this film from the 1990's.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Lion King
97,Anurag-Shetty,A visual treat.,8,20 July 2019,"The Lion King is a live-action adaptation, of Disney's 1994 animated movie of the same name. After a family tragedy shakes up his life, lion cub Simba(JD McCrary) runs away from home, only to learn the true meaning of nobility, courage, loyalty & responsibility.The Lion King is a great film. Director Jon Favreau tries his best to recreate the animated classic but, falls short. The CGI is gorgeous & the visuals are breathtaking. All the animals look super realistic. However, this prevents the movie from matching up to the 1994 original. Animals can't showcase their expressions as vividly or as subtly as human beings can. So, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Nala, Zazu, Sarabi, Timon, Pumbaa and Rafiki just can't portray various subtle, direct or complex emotions, that their traditionally animated counterparts in The Lion King(1994) could with ease. Certain unnecessary subplots are added to increase the run-time of the film. The updated versions of the songs, have been sung beautifully. The voice acting tries its best to make up for the lack of expressions on the animals' faces. Donald Glover is brilliant as Simba. Seth Rogen is spectacular as Pumbaa. Chiwetel Ejiofor is good but, just can't match up to Jeremy Irons' iconic performance, as Scar. Alfre Woodard is impressive as Sarabi. Billy Eichner is hilarious as Timon. Seth Rogen & Billy Eichner as Pumba & Timon respectively, share fantastic comedic chemistry & are the highlights of the movie. John Kani is effective as Rafiki. John Oliver is superb as Zazu. Beyonce Knowles-Carter is amazing as Nala. James Earl Jones is legendary yet again, as Mufasa. Keegan-Michael Key, Eric Andre & Florence Kasumba are excellent as Kamari, Azizi & Shenzi, respectively. JD McCrary & Shahadi Wright Joseph are adorable as Young Simba & Young Nala, respectively. The Lion King is worth a watch, for a massive dose of nostalgia & for families who can introduce their kids to this classic. You will love reliving all the iconic moments, that made up our childhood.

98,fernandoschiavi,"A beautiful film, but without soul and quite boring to watch. He may even catch the viewer for his charisma, but he must not beat his heart deeply",7,12 May 2021,"Oiled to meet the nostalgia of its audience without breaking the molds, the Disney remake machine has in The Lion King its greatest challenge. Escalating another cast, updating the text and re-recording Elton John's songs are peripheral issues compared to the main one: how to maintain the expressiveness of the characters - both in the Shakespearean tragedy and in the musical numbers - within a project whose main novelty is the photorealism of Jon Favreau's lions. It is not just a matter of transforming a classic of traditional animation into a feature film in live-action with computer graphics. When he made his Mogli, Favreau had an expressive human protagonist and some specific choices of caricature and physiognomy, such as King Louie and Baloo, to support the delivery of dramaturgy and grace. In the case of The Lion King, this transition is more problematic (first of all because it requires your CGI animals to make a convincing Hamlet) and does not happen as smoothly as in Mogli.The proposal of this new The Lion King was to take the original work, almost scene by scene, and transform it into a photorealistic animation, in which animals behave like animals, in their movements and movements. In this context, The Lion King of 2019 is far, far from being considered a masterpiece as was the animation of 1994. But firstly, it is necessary to emphasize how impressive it is to see the movement and small nuances of the animated creatures on canvas. , which creates moments in which it seems that you are watching an episode of any program on Animal Planet. The animators really managed to create a perfect aesthetic.The big problem with the feature starts with the uncanny valley. This is a theory of aesthetics and computation relating to when a character created in 3D animation behaves much like a human being in real life. Even though this representation is very true to reality, there is the uncanny valley, that is, the feeling of strangeness that does not create a connection with the character. Although this theory is very much related to human behavior, it can be extrapolated to the animation of the creatures of The Lion King. Here, there are lions, hyenas, birds, giraffes ... All very real. When they are doing their animal stuff, like nesting or hunting, it feels good. However, we are talking about an animation: they talk, walk and interact in ways that are not always natural.This is the first error of this animation: it is neither fully realistic, aside from the human part of the characters, nor does it allow itself to step outside the line of reality enough to make it look good. In this, the film turns into a pedantic video analogous to what channels like Animal Planet do, without it being really interesting as in the original animation. Disney wanted the characters to also have realistic looks and that ends their charisma, especially when our dear Simba transposes to adolescence. He turns into a generic lion, with little expression. The same happens with the partners Timon and Pumbaa, who are totally obliterated to the detriment of the realism of their own actions.As in his previous film, Favreau bets on the dazzle first. Details of nature appear on the screen with a richness of textures that was impossible in the 1994 film, and if these travelings (of the mouse, the lion's fur, the insects) often happen in sequential shots in The Lion King, it's because Favreau intends to preserve to the limit of the cut this interest of the viewer's gaze. It's like Simba enchanted by the flapping of a beetle's wings: a mesmerizing effect that delights while it lasts. To make the feature film more realistic, director Jon Favreau needed to make changes to some scenes and add others to the plot. For example, in this version Nala has more screen space than in the original, showing the lioness in more important moments. Other scenes also had to be cut, like half of Scar's speech in the song in which he presents his arrival on the throne.The most drastic change, however, happens in musical moments. Also focusing more on realism, the film leaves aside all the magic, surrealism or even the aesthetic character typical of musical scenes in cinema. So, in the face of music What I want most is to be king, do not expect the vibrant colors of the original, not even the pyramids of animals in the best cheerleader style. Even in Hakuna Matata the playful character of Timon and Pumbaa with Simba is left out, presenting only a tour of the characters through the new environment that the lion did not know. All of this gradually undermines the magic of The Lion King in its original and transforms this feature into a monotonous animal walk with some action scenes.The combination of all these factors to make the feature film more realistic also creates a production that is very, but very charismatic. The characters completely lose the personality traits they contained in the original version. Starting with the villain Scar, who is no longer ironic and sarcastic, typical of Disney villains, making room for a lion who is only sad and resentful for being played sideways in the reign of the jungle. Hyenas are also not well deserved. Here, the trio is relegated to Shenzi's leadership, with the other two not even gaining a name in the feature. Ed, the hyena with certain features of madness and its characteristic laugh, does not appear with the same characteristics here either. The most critical point, however, is Mufasa's ultimate scene. What should be one of the most exciting points of the feature, is far from convincing in this version, being a short scene incapable of shedding tears from the spectators as The Lion King of 1994 did. Even after the character's death, the plot continues so that grief is not felt. The lack of color, expression and even the soundtrack for that moment makes it as simple as the rest of the film. Lack weight.In this respect, it is curious to note how this new film dialogues, all the time, with classic animation. If the comparison is harmful for the aspect of emotion and also for the charm intrinsic to 2D animation, in several scenes the memory of the original helps with nostalgia. It is as if the game was already won, thanks to the moments so well known that come to mind immediately - a tactic that has been skillfully explored by the live-actions of classic Disney animations, by the way. How can you not smile when you hear ""Hakuna Matata"", for example? Or foresee the weight of what is about to happen when Simba finds himself frightened amidst an explosion of animals? Impossible. Also for this reason, the changes made in this film in relation to the original are minimal, even if there are 29 minutes more. The most relevant are the existence of a hyena leader and the appearance of Rafiki's staff, plus the extra time is spent on more elongated visual sequences. It is not by chance that Favreau seeks frameworks that at all times refer to classic animation, in search of the nostalgia of the fans. The only surprise in fact comes through the great joke with ""Be Our Guest"", the iconic song by Beauty and the Beast.I n spite of everything, it is still visually impressive what Favreau managed to do in this new The Lion King in aesthetic terms. The mimicry of the jungle, along with the representation of animals, impresses with its beauty and realism. However, it looks like a very well done painting that carries little, if anything, of the artist. The dazzle obviously does not support the film. Of the Disney remakes, perhaps this is the one where the dramaturgy service depends most on nostalgia to function. Favreau knows this and makes minimal and respectful changes, without deconstructing the original. The text doesn't change too much; it is updated on more sensitive issues (when Simba asks if the kingdom will be his, Mufasa replies that the reign is a responsibility, not a possession) and in lighter moments (as in the forest segment, now supported by self-referent jokes). The selection of songs is redone on the basis of the prestige of Beyoncé and Donald Glover - there is no nostalgia to resist the temptation of selling married to the phonographic market, after all - and the interpretations also do not escape much from the original in the arrangements.Favreau's direction is safe and effective, but Jeff Nathanson's script (""Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge"") needed to be sculpted more carefully. The characters gain more prominence, especially Zazu (John Oliver, ""The Park of Dreams""), another type who has his personality combined with the hyper-realism of his digital construction. On the other hand, the screenwriter lets the growing urgent tone subside by not satisfying certain actions by Simba and Nala for example - which worked in the original, but here he needed more depth. If, on the one hand, the main plot has no major changes, which can be annoying because it is a digitally updated version of the original animation, on the other hand it is precisely the power of a good story told.Here, Jon Favreau managed, once again, to show himself versatile by embracing a children's classic and bringing it to the new generations, maintaining the same adventure, romance and drama as the original. It is necessary, however, to know how to situate each film: however much it does not come close to classic animation, there is a beauty in it around the exits found when searching for expressions in animals, associated with their own movements, which makes this a beautiful film, but without salt and quite boring to watch. He may even catch the viewer for his charisma, but he must not beat his heart deeply.",The Lion King

102,PsychoBeard666,Visually stunning... and that's pretty much it.,6,13 March 2020,"The animation FX here are astounding and Jon Favreau has made another excellent adaptation to look at, just like The Jungle Book.It lacks the heart and soul of the original in almost every way. The only part of this I genuinely enjoyed was Seth Rogen and Billy ""On The Street"" Eichner playing Timon and Pumbaa. Whilst Billy is no Nathan Lane, he brings something new to the role as does Seth Rogen. My only criticism is the way they handle Pumbaa's rage against the hyenas. Instead of ""They call me MR. PIG!"" a line about bullying is shoehorned in.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is a great actor but his voice lacks the gravitas and sinister elements that Jeremy Irons pulled off. He never feels threatening.
James Earl Jones is a tired old man and it's so obvious here as he reprises his role of the murdered king. The character has lost his majesty through Jones' weak delivery.
Beyonce's Nala getting pointless lines just to give her more to do is so obvious. ""Lions, attack!"" was so unnecessary and this isn't an isolated incident.
I know they couldn't carbon copy the original but any time it strays from the main plot in any way it's incredibly jarring and distracting.",The Lion King

105,bob-the-movie-man,Gorgeously pointless.,7,2 August 2019,"After Dumbo earlier this year, now here is The Lion King: the live-action version of the prize coronation mug sitting on Disney's shelf of trinkets.I mentioned in my review of ""Toy Story 4"" that in comparing it with TS1, it ably demonstrated that Moore's Law of computing power must still be at least holding reasonably true. Here is another case in point. Technically, this is nothing short of astonishing. It's almost impossible to believe that what you are seeing is computer animated. Every mouse, lion and cheetah so vibrantly and perfectly visualised. That first sight of Simba draws an audible ""Awwww"" from the audience.The pièce de résistance of the film is the first 4 minutes, reproducing with ""live"" animals the ""tribute scene"" to the young Simba. It's visually and aurally gorgeous in every way, and worth seeing the film for in its own right.In ""Dumbo"", an OBVIOUS error is that ONLY mice and crows can talk to elephants - not humans! So here, it is distinctly unsettling that 'real life' animals can speak and sing. It's also inevitable that the animation of eyes and mouth, present in the original version, saps the scenes somewhat of emotion.I'd heard this mantra repeatedly in the critic reviews I'd seen, so was honestly bracing myself for the worst. In reality, it had less of an impact than I was expecting it to, and although never moved to tears at any point, the scenes that were supposed to be moving... were.As with the recent ""Aladdin"" remake, I found many of the songs distinctly underwhelming. ""I just can't wait to be king"" lacked the energy and verve of the original, and Chiwetel Ejiofor went the ""full Rex Harrison"" on ""Be Prepared"". So much so that the term ""song"" might be a misnomer.Above all ""Can you Feel the Love Tonight?"" was one of Elton John and Tim Rice's most beautiful songs from the original soundtrack. Yet, although not savaged by Donald Glover and Beyoncé (playing Simba and Nala), they at the very least give it a good mauling.The score by Hans Zimmer is lusciously produced. There is a new song added as ""Best-Song"" fodder for the upcoming Oscar nominations. This is ""Spirit"" by Beyoncé, although it failed to stir mine in any way. But the best new song on the soundtrack for me was Elton John's offering - ""Never Too Late"" - during the end titles. Complete with African instruments and vocals, it is both cracking and very stirring.As indeed happened in the original movie, the introduction of Timon and Pumbaa adds some much needed energy and humour. Played by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively, director Jon Favreau encouraged the pair to ad lib many of their scenes. And it shows. There's a lot more fun to be had in there than all Will Smith's genie scenes in ""Aladdin"". In particular, the famous ""breaking the fourth wall"" moment in ""Hakuna Matata"" I found priceless, and made me howl with laughter.Elsewhere vocally, James Earl Jones is back as Mufasa and in so doing makes you concious that there is noone in the world who could perform that role better. The best performance of the rest of the cast, for me, came from ""Black Panther's"" Florence Kasumba as the leader of the hyena pack, Shenzi. She venomously spits her lines our quite wonderfully.TV pundit John Oliver is an interesting choice as Zazu, but didn't nail it for me. I personally missed Rowan Atkinson in that part. Likewise, comparison between Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jeremy Irons as Scar is hardly fair. I'd rate Irons as one of the top 5 vocal performances of any Disney film of all time.For me, the word that keeps floating to the top of these live action remakes is ""pointless"". Why try, other than to fill Disney coffers? (Which I guess is the producer's point!) And my opinion hasn't changed after this. I still think its a rather pointless exercise, particularly in this case where there is no human cast.With these things, I always think of Jim Carrey's cry at the end of his version of ""I am the Walrus"". He screams ""There, I did it. I defiled a timeless piece of art"". Jon Favreau can at least sleep happy (sic) in his bed content that he hasn't managed to do that. I can't say I was horrified by this one, because I wasn't. It was majestic, entertaining, technically superb and certainly had its moments.The acid test for me would be ""would I go and see that again"". And in this case the answer would be ""yes"".(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies via Google or Facebook. Thanks.)",The Lion King

107,kjproulx,A Worthy Remake of a Classic,8,19 July 2019,"Whether or not you're on the positive or negative side of Disney remaking their classic animated films or not, they're clearly full steam ahead on doing all of them, so buckle up for the ride or turn away for the next decade or so. Personally, I'm indifferent on the whole idea. Although I loved Jon Favreau's recreation of The Jungle Book and thought the live-action Cinderella was very solid, I would argue that with Dumbo, Maleficent, and Beauty and the Beast, even though enjoyable, felt very much unnecessary for the most part. Now, we have The Lion King, which is one of Disney's most beloved classics and it's going to absolutely divide fans, but gladly, I happen to fall on the positive side for this one.After the death of his father Mufasa, Simba (a young Lion cub) is forced away on his own. Learning the real lessons to know in life, his journey becomes one for the ages. I'll remain vague for the very few people who don't know this story, but it ultimately follows every single beat the original animated film presented over 25 years ago. This is the definition of a film that comes off as a cash grab, simply due to the fact that it seems like they made it for money, as all the same songs and images are used, but updated.I'm not going to be one of the reviewers out there that complain though, because I happen to love the premise of the original film, and since it's just recreated here, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this version. The visuals are truly something to wonder at. Not only do the animals look and feel realistic, but the scenery around them wasn't even filmed in-camera, and the movie feels the complete opposite of that. It truly feels like National Geographic went out and captured footage, only to add moving mouths on the animals in post-production.Yes, I can see where the criticisms have been here; Viewers have been adamantly complaining about the fact that this film doesn't do anything new and is pretty much retreading the original movie. While that statement may be true, nearly everyone loves that original film and even though many of the animals may not show deep emotions in their facial expressions, I find that to be one of the largest nitpicks in the history of cinema. This was an experiment in taking a story and making it feel as realistic as possible, and for that alone, it deserves all the credit in the world.In the end, I'm someone who will shout out on the rooftops about the fact that remakes need to slow down, but when a good one comes around, I won't shy away from calling it as it is. The Lion King (2019) is a very, very solid remake, with a few new admirable moments and great direction by Jon Favreau once again. Yes, the fans will complain that this movie took no chances, even down to the dialogue, but I walked out of the theatre with a big smile on my face, so I'm not going to lie to myself. The Lion King (2019) is a great movie, even if it's unoriginal and prevents it from being called one of the best films of the year. For fans and newcomers alike, I recommend seeing this one.",The Lion King
108,katyayan-12892,Lion King,6,9 February 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe Lion King wasn't really one of my favorite movies growing up, but I enjoyed it as a kid and you can't deny the great animation and great voice acting that still holds up. It's definitely a movie millions remember fondly of, and appreciate till this day.The 2019 remake of The Lion King however, doesn't carry the magic the original had. I must admit the obvious, and say that the visuals are spectacular. All the animals throughout the film look amazingly detailed and will definitely amaze everyone watching it, but the visuals are also one of this film's flaws. Unlike the animated classic, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, and Nala are now real-life lions that fail to show any emotion... because they're real-life lions, and lions don't exactly tend to show any emotion at all really.The voice acting has it's ups and downs, the voice actors for Cub Simba, Mufasa, Zazu, Timon, and Pumba really steal the show. But other's like Older Simba, Nala, Scar, Rafiki are just kinda...there, and only serve to sing covers for the originals already great soundtrack. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar really tries his best and I appreciate his efforts, but his representation of Scar doesn't come close to Jeremy Irons. I don't blame him for this, since it's most likely that he had to work with the original film's script.This movie is great...if you want to watch something you've already seen before that is. The digital artists have done some amazing work here but it feels like it lacks the emotion and soul of the original animation. The sound track is okay with Beyonce shining as you'd expect but again you've heard the songs before, you've felt the emotions and you know what to expect throughout. If you want to watch a shot for shot remake of an already amazing movie, or you've lived under a rock and never seen the original then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately it doesn't do enough to stand out from the original, to which it will always be compared, and there's a feeling the studio just played this one that bit to safe.If Disney start to worry a little more for making new movies than remaking its old successes only With the purpose of making tons of money I will consider to have a little more appreciation for this greedy company, I am starting to think that disney is Like the villian of the movie.Honestly whatever you rated the first movie rate this one the same minus one. Ultimately it is bland and boring with a lot of the humour taken out of it, still no acknowledgement as far as I noticed to Hamlet or Kimba. The American actors, save for Jones who is Mufasa and Glover who did well with what was there, were the weakest part, Eichner especially. The non-Americans outshined their counterparts and gave their characters depth even though they had so few lines. Ultimately the movie is underwhelming, and I would have liked to have seen more African born actors playing roles rather than singers with limited range.It's strange to see the hyper realistic CGI of lion king, as far as content. The animation for the movie is astonishing, although making it as real as possible loses its emotional touch. And that's what makes the movie flat. The emotional moments are usually the most gripping moments but because of the hyper realism they're just THERE in the moment. You don't see the emotions displayed thru the characters......Other than that, the film's story and music are phenomenal, but the original Lion King had already made those.........This movie is very difficult to believe because it is not very realistic.

James Earl Jones seems flat here and Scar is monotone, only a few voices come across as interesting. I don't get why they replayed scenes and dropped certain songs. This made so much money, but it is a poor imitation of the original classic film.

110,tm-sheehan,Adds nothing and too dark in every way,6,19 July 2019,"My Review -
Lion King 6.5 / 10At the risk of repeating myself and I've said this about the remake of Dumbo ,Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin if a remake of a much beloved and brilliant animation feature doesn't add anything to the original, why make it?
Of course I know the answer, especially from the viewpoint of the 21st Century Disney film Empire they bring in huge box office dollars and that's ok I suppose but I wonder what Walt Disney would have thought?The Walt Disney Studios under Walt always were striving for originality and breakthrough new projects. You only have to look at some of the extra features on Classic Disney DVD's to see how the Animators and technical teams worked expertly and together with Disney to bring something new and exciting to the screen. Unlike Studios today risks were taken like Snow White the first feature length movie cartoon that nearly everyone said would be a financial disaster but that risk saved the Walt Disney Company from bankruptcy.This Lion King remake features photorealistic CGI animals that look like the real thing so basically it's really another animated feature . Many creative and talented people have put together a pretty fair version of the 1994 original even featuring James Earl Jones repeating his original voice over as Mufasa.The problem with this version for me was unlike the fabulous 1997 Broadway musical version directed by Julie Taymar which added great songs ,choreography and gave audiences a brand new version which featured spectacular production numbers and amazing puppetry this new film adds nothing .In fact Director Jon Favreau has made a much darker version and seems to have cut back on the music and the humour. I found many of the scenes too dark visually apart from the beginning and the end it seemed to concentrate on the horrible hyenas and Scar .I might be wrong but I think very young children would be frightened by this Lion King movie , better to watch the original and best.",The Lion King

113,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,19 July 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I don't know how I should start, but I guess I'll address something that people might ask: yes, it's a SPOILER-FREE review. Why? Well, the story might follow the same essential plot points, and the characters might have similar narrative paths, but there are so many details that make this movie stand on its own. From tiny little improvements to moments of the original that wouldn't make sense in a realistic environment to adjustments to character's backstory, musical moments or other significant parts. With that said, I need to discuss the controversy surrounding this remake, but I won't take longer than one paragraph.People need to understand that these Disney's remakes aren't here to replace the originals. They're here to honor them, and bring their stories and characters to this new century so that new generations can have an additional look at something they love, and 90s kids can remember why they love these films so much. Emphasis on the ""additional"" part of that sentence. Then, people also need to get their preferences right: would you want to watch a shot-for-shot remake or something entirely different? Or a blend of these two? If you don't know what you want, you might be in danger of turning into a hypocrite if your speech goes from ""I don't want these copy-paste remakes"" to ""they changed that specific moment, why didn't they keep it the same?"" Just be clear on what you wish. If you simply don't want Disney to do these remakes, then just don't watch them. Don't go online try to beat it to the ground with negative comments if you haven't seen the movie. Moving on ...I love it. I absolutely love it. I cried the exact same 4 times as I did in the 1994's original. My whole body got chills during the opening sequence, which is one of a few things I love more about the remake than in the original. It's NOT a shot-for-shot remake! I don't understand how so many critics are calling it so. Either people's memory of the original faded or someone clearly didn't watch the same film. I can write a whole review of 1000+ words just describing the new stuff. Of course, the story goes through the same iconic moments in the same way, and some dialogues are extensively repeated, which was something that I was hoping they developed more. Despite that, I still feel that the scripts have a different take on it from the voice actors, even James Earl Jones.One proof would be that I cried on a scene that I never felt like it in the original. I don't know if it was how it was shot (one of the various different angles that the remake provides of known scenes) or if the dialogue just has more impact this time around, but the point here is that this remake is NOT a cheap copy-paste. I always look forward to seeing what they come up with to solve or adjust some questions that the originals leave us with. Let me just write that Jeff Nathanson has some truly brilliant changes/additions. Remember people criticizing Scar's look when the first teaser came out? With just ONE WORD, its entire physical shape, scar, and past are explained. One word. Imagine that. There are little elements like adding a word or a sentence here and there, and it makes so much more sense with the character or the story in question.Speaking of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor is astonishing. Scar might be my favorite character of the remake. He's more menacing and scarier, his voice is darker, and his arc is better explored. Jeremy Irons will always have that iconic voice associated with the character, but Ejiofor did a crazily good job in replacing him. However, if there's one voice that I could never watch another actor do is Mufasa's. I have no words to express how emotionally powerful James Earl Jones' voice is. As soon as he says ""Simba"" in the reflection scene, my eyes drop waterfalls. His voice is an emotional trigger, let's call it that. I love Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) even more this time around. Their scenes are hilarious, and the characters' relationship keeps being a standout. Oh, and if you were worried that the hula scene would never be as good let alone surpassed ... You might need to rethink that. Also, I enjoyed the stretched last act (I found the original's final battle too abrupt), and I would advise parents to be careful showing this remake to (very) young kids since the violence on display feels much more real (duh).JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph (young Nala) are amazing, and their voices are crystal clear while singing. Donald Glover and Beyoncé (adult Nala) are also terrific, and their voices are even better. The new music Spirit fits better in this remake than Speechless in Aladdin. Moving on to the music, it's another aspect that I genuinely think the remake does better. Hans Zimmer proves that he can bring an old score of his back to life in a much more robust, epic, and passionate way. Every song feels more prominent, every soundtrack feels a lot more impactful and stronger. Be Prepared is the only one that goes through a significant change, and while it might sound a bit strange at first, I love it more each time I listen to it. It's a score that will never be forgotten, and this remake just helped people remember how great it is. Oscar-winning score.I left the best to last: the visuals. I can't possibly describe how impressive and eyegasmic the CGI is. Animals talking was never an issue (people keep sharing GIFs or short clips and immediately started complaining that it looked awkward ... a 30-seconds video without context watched on a laptop will never give you a hint of how the movie will actually be). Yes, the expressiveness of the original animation can't be achieved, but going as far as saying that the film lacks soul or that the characters don't emote is just inaccurate. You don't need a PhD to understand that a lion with its ears down or up means different things. There are tiny little movements in the animals that are so complex that I'm still astounded how they were able to do it. If a bug flies near their faces, they flinch or move in such a characteristic way that I felt like I was truly watching real animals. Once again, Oscar-winning VFX.I don't really have major problems with it. Minor gripes with a few things, but the biggest one would be the lack of more uniqueness. There's no element of surprise in regards to the story or the character's decisions. We always know what's coming, so we're prepared (no pun intended) for anything they through at us because, well, we've seen it before (with the exception of one particular scene that made me jump out of my chair and I think not a single person will be able to avoid it). I find the ""animals don't emote"" argument one of the biggest nitpicks in the history of cinema. It might be true that they lack the emotion of the original animation, but going as far as saying that they show absolutely no emotion is just hating for the sake of hate. Same goes for people criticizing the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight is sung during broad daylight ... In the original, it isn't nighttime as well.Finally, I just want to address the ""these remakes aren't necessary / no one asked for these"" discussion. No one asked for the 1994's movie until it came out. People didn't know they needed it. Seriously, everyone needs to realize that these remakes aren't here to replace the originals. How many of you have watched The Lion King (1994) or showed it to someone in the past 10 years? How many times have you heard its score in the same period? I bet that most of the answers are simply ""none"". That's how important this remake is then! It makes you go back, it makes everyone remember how incredible the 1994's film is, by keeping its essence while being able to stand on its own. Jon Favreau did a tremendous job, and I hope he gets recognized for it.In the end, it doesn't matter if the story is identical if we cry all the same. It doesn't matter if we know what's coming if we still feel nervous and worried about the characters. The Lion King (2019) is one of Disney's best remakes so far, on par with The Jungle Book. Its VFX are game-changing, its score is more powerful and emotional than in the original, and the story carries the same heartfelt impact. James Earl Jones' voice is everything. Timon and Pumbaa are even funnier. Ejiofor's Scar is the best character in this remake. I have no flaws to point out, except that it follows the exact same path that the original's story does. I wish it would be more distinct, but I can't lie to myself, I love it deeply. One of 2019's best movies. My #1 spot will be hard to decide... Go watch it! I can't wait to see it again!",The Lion King
114,SoumikBanerjee25,The Technical Work is Supreme Here!,7,7 December 2019,"I didn't see the Classic film so can't really make comparisons with the Original here! So I will be assessing it as an Individual Film.Right from the very beginning it catches my attention with the details and setup. Every inch of the atmosphere, the setting, the backdrop looks stunning! The makers here demonstrated their peak imagination and creativity levels and that transpired to this masterpiece of a work. Although the same Photo Realistic nature ruined the essence of being it an Animation Feature! The same CGI work that must be the highlight of the film is the downside too! and that sucks.Because of the too much Realism, we couldn't really notice much Expression variety wise in the Characters' faces, so it kind of becomes a Soulless representation of the Original Hit. Whether it's an emotional scene or a enthralling one ; The characters failed to express with versatility! Though the Voice cast has done their jobs pretty well, Especially Seth Rogen as Pumbaa and John Oliver as Zazou. The Story is Predictable and a Generic one too but it still teaches us Lots of lessons that one should follow in their own lives like Moral Values etc. But I do feel it lacked the Emotional Depth or Substance I was expecting, Some characters could have been given much more layers to them. They felt so stale. Screenplay and Sound Score was Brilliant as we all expect. The main Problem lies in the 2nd Act ; It didn't impress me as much the 1st One! The last act was just decent enough nothing extraordinary! I thought we should have gotten more from the Other characters like Rafiki.In the end it's a Movie that is targeted towards Children but Adults Can Enjoy too.

115,Min111,A successful remake,5,15 March 2020,"I'm surprised with the amount of negative reviews this movie has received on here. True, it wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't terrible either. I think it was somewhere around the middle, but it could've been a lot better for sure. What can you do? A lot of people would say it's an average movie at best, but I think it was slightly above average. I still enjoyed watching The Lion King. I say it's a successful remake because it's a successful movie. This movie, The Lion King, made well over a billion dollars at box office. That speaks volumes, and that's what counts in the end. Many people watched it repeatedly for sure. It's still not as good as the original, but the movie was still just about okay. What I didn't like in this movie was the villain called Scar. He looked nothing like the Scar in the animated version, and I was very disappointed with that. It was sort of hard to tell which lion was which. They should've made him look exactly like the one in the animated version, and that was possible. I liked the Scar of that one. Probably that's one of many reasons why this movie didn't go well with many people. I'm not really a fan of remakes. I don't see the point of it other than to make money. Now, I've seen this along with Aladdin, and I think they're both similar movies. I enjoyed Aladdin slightly more than The Lion King. It looks like there will be a sequel for The Lion King due to the ending. I won't be surprised either way. Long live the king!",The Lion King

118,MrDHWong,"A visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new",6,18 July 2019,"The Lion King 2019 is a CGI photorealistic adaptation of the 1994 Disney animated film of the same name. Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book), it is a visually appealing, albeit pointless remake that adds almost nothing new.In the African savannah, Simba (voiced by JD McCrary), a young lion prince, eagerly waits until the day he takes over as king from his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). One day, Mufasa is murdered by his jealous younger brother Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), forcing Simba to flee his kingdom or face a similar fate. After covering a great distance, Simba meets a meerkat and warthog duo named Timon and Pumbaa (voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively), who take him in and teach him their carefree lifestyle. Eventually, Simba learns that he must take responsibility and reclaim his rightful place as king from his wicked uncle.While it does showcase some nice use of colour and cinematography, The Lion King 2019 offers little else worth recommending over its animated counterpart. The story is the same as the original, the songs remain unchanged, and even most of the dialogue is word-for-word identical. At best, director Jon Favreau is merely a conductor of someone else's symphony, a far cry from his work on 2016's The Jungle Book, which took risks and felt refreshingly new. In addition to this, the photorealistic CGI often had the film at a disadvantage as it fails to convey any real emotion from the animals. In the 1994 film, the animal characters were able to look a variety of different emotions due to the artistic freedom of it being animated as a cartoon, whereas in this film, each animal looks stoic whenever they're supposed to be sad or angry. Overall, to the small percentage of those who haven't seen the original, this film may be alright, however, all others should stick with the 1994 classic instead.I rate it 6/10",The Lion King
119,meydiana-65242,I cried when Mufasa died. 😢,9,4 April 2021,"The Lion King being my favorite animated Disney movie, I've watched it many times as a kid, as an adult and shared it with my kids.I'm not sure what people mean when they say it lacks heart? Yes it's the same story, same scenes etc. But it's a remade version, which you can tell Disney was very careful with. When Alice in Wonderland came out, I was hoping and excited for The Lion King. More live action movies released and I know it was only a matter of time.This movie is fantastic. Not since Avatar have I been blown away by the visuals. Disney did such a good job on the animations, the animals move realistically, they look realistic and if animals could talk, this is how they would look while talking. A lot of people are hating on this movie to be part of the crowd, I give this 5 stars because the story wasn't changed, the CG is seriously mind blowing, the soundtrack was done in justice, it's darker than the animated original and it was pretty action filled.I feel this movie benefits from its live action. Scar looks more menacing, and you do get emotional and a heart warming sensation when watching because you see how an animal would actually look like when happy or sad. Maybe the negative reviews were from people who don't have any pets?This is a must watch, and sits next to some of the best movies I've ever seen.",The Lion King
120,Alexander_Blanchett,Those who hated it apparently hated the original too,8,18 July 2019,"The original Lion King is my all time favorite animated movie so was I especially pumped for this ""´real live"" feature Remake. You can Dispute if it was necessairy or not, but I Judge it as a film itself and since it was basically shot-by-shot the same thing I of Course loved it for its Story, its tragedy and the fantastic Soundtrack. The visuals are among the best we have ever encountered on the big screen so that was another big plus. The only thing it lacked a Little bit was the emotionality that wasnt presented through the CGI characters as good as through the animated characters in the original. Sometimes the facial expressions (logically) were not as charismatic as they were and thus it was not posible to connect or engage to the characters as it was in the original. Also the Voice work was not as good, there are exceptions of Course James Earl Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor were especially good and when Beyonce starts singing ""Can you feel the love"" I was won over.
Generally Nothing new at all (except for a few Scenes especially with Timon and Pumba) but still a great film for a whole new Generation.",The Lion King
121,cardsrock,Better nature documentary than worthwhile remake,7,26 July 2019,"The Lion King (2019) is a stunning visual achievement, but unfortunately that's about the only achievement of this wholly unnecessary remake. It stays very close to the original, which is both good and bad. It feels at times like they're just waiting to hit all the notes audiences expect without supplying the raw emotion the original brought. Part of this is because hand drawn animation allows more emotional expressivity than CGI. Beyoncé can no doubt sing, however her casting here feels off. Rogen and Eichner are the only ones who seemed perfectly cast and expertly stay true to their characters while adding some new material. Ultimately, The Lion King remake is a sight to behold and nostalgia-inducing, but fails to justify its own existence.",The Lion King

It's still a must watch in theatres for its visual effects and a great score by Hans Zimmer.,The Lion King
125,dilipbts,The lion King,8,10 June 2020,"As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",The Lion King

127,andrewroy-04316,"The Lion King is a competent remake, but there is less of a true emotional arc for Simba",6,22 January 2020,"The claims of this remake being a soulless, cold twin of the original Lion King is certainly overstated, but the emotional punch is lighter. The visuals do look great, and I never had a problem with the look or talk of the animals. If this is a way to reestablish the impact of The Lion King to a new generation, it seems completely worthwhile for me. More than any film, this one truly begs the question: to what extent is art's value affected by what came before it? What does a near-identical remake of a film deserve as its rating? I don't have a clear cut answer, but am generally going on the guideline that other films are just context and it should be judged primarily on its own merits. As it is unchanged from the original, I have no problems with the story, though the second act was duller than I recall. My biggest problem was the ending: several cliche lines about Simba ""remembering who he is"" rang hollow, as did the whole transition from Hakuna Matata nihilism to Circle of Life generosity. The visual splendor of the climactic fight scenes underscore how little is really going on with the characters. The songs also didn't have the same magic as the original. Still, at worst it's overly derivative of an excellent film, and it's satisfying enough on its own.",The Lion King

133,sweidman-28016,Unnecessary Remake,5,6 August 2019,"The Lion King (2019) Review:The Lion King is a remake of the loved classic Disney film but now ""live action"". It really is just all computer animated but everyone is calling it the live action version. As most everybody knows, the movie follows the life of a lion named Simba as he rubs away living a new life after the death of his father. Basically it's Hamlet but more kid friendly and with lions. This is the third Disney remake of the year. Earlier we had Dumbo, which I thought was just ok, and Aladdin, which I did not like. All of these remakes weren't necessary. The one I think was acceptable was Dumbo because they at least tried a different plot and something new. With The Lion King you don't watch it for the plot, characters, and something special. You watch it for the stunning animation. I don't really know anyone who said they were excited specifically for the plot and stuff. Everyone really has just been talking about how it's ""live action"" followed by someone arguing that it's not live action or jokes about how it's incredible that Disney can make the lions act. I think the animation was truly amazing. What they did had come a long way. The Oscar winning visuals from The Jungle Book a few years ago we're really good and still continue to be. They got even better somehow this year in The Lion King. So far there's no doubt that they will win the Oscar in February. It all looked so realistic. They made the animals more realistic by making them act more like how they would in their natural habitat. This brings me to a major problem I had in the movie. Because they made them act realistic, there was no emotion on their faces. It was kind of boring to watch them sometimes. Almost two hours of detached animals with no emotion got a little boring at some parts. The movie didn't need to be that long either. Yes, they added a few things and dragged some stuff longer, but other than that it was the exact same movie. It was literally a shot-to-shot remake of the original. The Circle of Life sequence was exactly the same. People were saying the same, which I absolutely believed, but it was after that where I started to feel kind of annoyed because I at least expected some differences. I liked what Jon Favreau did with The Jungle Book, having differences in the plot and making it a fun time, but that vision wasn't really brought over to this. I don't know if it was his idea or he was told to do that since we all know this was a cash grab. I would have to look into that but I have other things I'd rather do. But honestly it lacked imagination. My mother even mentioned how the colors in the original were more vibrant and it was just visually pleasing. Everything seemed dull. I mean I guess that makes sense for it being realistic but even though the animation looked beautiful, it seemed off. The characters felt kind of off. It didn't feel like the animals were saying the words but it felt separated and you could tell it was actors voicing over most of the time. Sometimes it even sounded like it with the audio. It was a little weird. Could've just been the theater possibly. The voice acting was fine. There were only a few minor people that bothered me but it was fine. It was just a little hard to appreciate them with no emotion showing. The two that bugged me the most were Rafiki and Scar. Rafiki wasn't really that crazy in this one. He was so fun in the original but he seemed more normal in this. We didn't even get the part where he hits Simba on the head with his staff. It's stupid but it's hilarious. Also with Scar he didn't feel that evil. Be Prepared was so disappointing. It really wasn't a song. Chiwetel Ejiofor just chanted it and it was boring. That is one of the best Disney villain songs and it probably could've just been cut since it was strange chanting. The reds of the songs were fine though. Hans Zimmer's score was good just again. It makes me mad that he only has the one Oscar but it is a great score. There's not much to say about this remake. It's exactly the same. It may sound like I'm bashing it but it wasn't absolutely horrible. The plot was still entertaining to watch and with visuals that amazing it's hard not to watch. It's not a must watch. I probably won't watch it in the future again if I had the choice. It's more of something to put on in the background. I totally understand if people enjoy this. It's not bad but just entertaining.My Grade: C",The Lion King
134,funtasticfour,"Very unnecessary reboot, but also very good.",8,21 June 2020,"The Lion King is a classic that doesn't need messing with...but the result is very good anyhow. The scenery and animals look amazing, and the story remains much the same. The voice changes don't make a lot of difference aside from Timone and Pumba, which went a different direction but still worked out nicely.

It was hard not to expect every scene to be the same as the OG. Once I got over missing and changed lines. the animals were ttl and not making facial expressions , still I kept hoping for somethinh like ears drooping.
It seemed to have started in part of the movie or maybe it was added for affect.
It was hard to reconcile my expectation for each and every scene . My own disappointment is not a fair way to review a movie: - it's a beautiful movie and each scene felt comparable -the only thing I didn't like was that Nala said had to say lions twice .I also thought Timon could have used some more expressive eyes .
Had I never saw the animated version, repeatedly , I would have been blown away , like I was blown away by the animation - the realness which was so well done that I took it for granted !!

141,Magow-Intermean,THE LION KING REVIEW,9,19 July 2019,"2019's The Lion King is a 'live action' remake of the 1994 original animation flick which went on to become an iconic film for all ages. Those who have watched the original Lion King will vouch for its strong emotional connect, rousing, heartbreaking moments that left a lasting impression and of course the legendary soundtrack and background score. When the royal lion cub, Simba is born to Queen Sarabi and King Mufasa, animals in the forest rejoice at having a new heir. But their joy is short-lived when Mufasa dies trying to save little Simba's life. Feeling guilty for being the cause of his father's death Simba runs away from the forest. And now his evil uncle Scar takes over the throne. So does the 2019 version of Lion King match up? (In India, the film is releasing in four languages - English and also dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telegu.) The big draw of course of the Hindi dubbed version is actor Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa and Aryan Khan as Simba. The father and son duo had earlier lent their voices to the Hindi dubbed version of The Incredibles in 2004. 2019's Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor. Everything you see on screen is etched out with spellbinding detailing and the visual finesse gives way to near perfection. Some scenes especially ones with the fire flies in the night, open starlit skies and expansive views of the forest look stunning. Where the visual appeal falls short is in the expressions and emotions on the faces, especially the eyes of the animals which the animated version had got so right. So while you do feel sad when Mufasa is killed, you are not particularly moved to tears like with the original. And while Scar looks evil, he is not menacing. Also though the film is thirty minutes lengthier it pretty much remains an almost scene by scene copy of the 1994 version, losing its potential to surprise and intrigue further. 2019's Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor.

However, the principal voice cast is a delight - Shah Rukh Khan as Mufasa is captivating from the word go, Aryan Khan shines as the young Simba - capturing every emotion perfectly. The scene where Simba speaks to his father's reflection in the water, with Mufasa's voice emanating from the sky stands out as a whole - visually and otherwise. Ashish Vidyarthi as Scar is particularly good, his voice adding the required dimension to the character.Perhaps to contextualize andgive it a local flavor Pumbaa (Sanjay Mishra) and Timon (Shreyas Talpade) speak in tapori hindi here - so there is a generous sprinkling of 'Bhai' 'Jhakaas' ' Apun' 'Bindass'. And the gang of hyenas speak in Bhojpuri.While it may connect with the audience and elucidate some laughs, it robs the classic film of some of its original flavor. Shreya Ghosal, Arman Malik and Sunayna Sarkar do a fine job with the Hindi renditions of the soundtrack. But for those who have reveled in the original 'Circle of Life', 'Can you feel the Love tonight' and 'Hakuna Matata' it may not match up totally.

""The Lion King"" may have some problems, but visually it was amazing.We all wanted a movie similar to the animation, and so they did, but deep down, we felt a frustration, that of not seeing something new, of knowing the steps following the script, of not feeling the same emotion of the drawing. Coupled with a troubled voice acting - both the Brazilian and the original - and even, a detachment from the characters caused by the passing of more than two decades, are ingredients that end up creating a cold film, we do not feel its update or renewal, It's like looking at something spinning around itself.Despite the great looks, beautiful scenery, excellent animations, the new re-read of ""The Lion King"" does not match its original, but is nonetheless a good movie, which will serve as a technological standard for cinema and even a readjustment lesson for Disney.",The Lion King

The original lion king I love very much. When the 2019 version received negative reviews from critics and audiences, I was still determined to watch it in theatres and finally I saw it.First of all, the visuals were absolutely stunning. Its completely a CGI remake and the CGI work is amazing. The animals looks, their movements were very realistic. The locations make you feel straight from national geographic channel. Hans Zimmer's score is as usual fantastic and this time he tweaked the tune to fit the tone. The voice casting was pretty good especially bringing back james earl jones who is irreplaceable as mufasa.Now coming to the negatives, the biggest drawback is it being a copy paste remake with hardly any creativity in writing. Lion king is a classic and I know makers don't want to take risk in tampering the script and spoiling it. But due to which it does not make sense to watch the same story again due to which everything is predictable. Another drawbacks is zero emotions. In the original lion king, animals were very expressive as they were anthropomorphic. But in live action, the animals look real and since the real animals don't emote here also they don't have any expression. The songs are very disappointing on screen especially the circle of life does not make you emotional like the original.On the whole, the 2019 version is visually stunning but emotionally weak. Since its a shot by shot remake, you won't get bored because of the original's brilliant script. Its old wine in new bottle.",The Lion King
150,shawneofthedead,More Misfire Than Masterpiece.,4,19 July 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: For the past decade, Disney has dedicated an immense amount of resources to translating its classic animated films into live-action blockbusters - with varying degrees of success. This new incarnation of The Lion King is unusual because it is, in itself, another kind of animated film: all its creatures, great and small, are computer-generated to look photo-real. The technical wizardry on display is undoubtedly impressive. But the final film winds up undermining its own existence - what is the point of re-making something that evidently works so much better with traditional hand-drawn animation?THE STORY: If you've seen the original 1994 film, there'll be no surprises here. We are introduced to the adorable Simba (voiced by JD McCrary as a cub, before ageing into Donald Glover), the little prince who will one day lead his pride as a king. But even the best-laid succession plans crumble into dust when Simba's sinister uncle, Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor), plots against reigning king Mufasa (James Earl Jones). After tragedy strikes, Simba is forced to build a new life for himself - even though his true destiny lies far closer to home.THE GOOD: There's no denying that the cutting-edge technology used to bring Simba's pridelands to life is really quite remarkable. It's photo-real in a way that probably wasn't possible even a few years ago, and you'd be forgiven for thinking you've stumbled onto a sublimely shot nature documentary if you watch this film without the sound on. That's not advisable, however, as director Jon Favreau clearly put some effort into engineering a new soundscape for the film. Elton John's score is beautifully refreshed, mixed with a fresh energy and rhythm that work very well (even though the new songs - Beyonce's Spirit and John's end-credits number, Never Too Late - aren't particularly memorable). The new voice cast is mostly very appealing. Glover never quite manages to slip under Simba's skin, but Ejiofor deliciously unearths several shades of evil as Scar, and John Oliver is a hoot as fluttery hornbill advisor Zazu.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: The biggest problem with this film is that its best feature also happens to be its worst. This new kind of photo-real animation looks great, but it somehow manages to appear life-like while lacking any actual life. As it turns out, hyper-realistic lions can't emote or talk like humans, so it borders on the ridiculous (and unnerving) to have them do just that. Moments that broke your heart in the original 1994 film might make you giggle 25 years later. It's unfortunate, too, that Favreau's film hews so closely to its predecessor's script and story beats. With that crucial spark of life - or soul, as it were - already missing from these lions, you'll only become more aware of the weaknesses that have always been a part of Simba's rather patchy emotional trajectory. (Chiefly: does he actually learn anything? Guilt and grief alone do not a character's growth make.)COMIC RELIEF: Favreau's film almost slavishly follows its predecessor, except it allows comedians Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen a little room to riff as Timon (meerkat) and Pumbaa (warthog) respectively. Together, they provide some of the film's funniest - as well as its most annoying - moments. In one instance, they make an inspired reference to another classic Disney movie that's a surefire crowd-pleaser, even though its cheeky meta-textuality adds to the film's tonal woes.RECOMMENDED? Not particularly. This Lion King is more misfire than masterpiece.",The Lion King
151,saraccan,Another unnecessary remake,4,16 November 2019,It's one thing to keep making these unnecessary remakes that literally nobody asked for; but it's a whole different thing to make them incredibly disrespectful to the original and just overall very bad. It feels super disconnected and none of the characters are likable in any way.A very bad remake of the classic Lion King that looks nice.,The Lion King

154,Trevor-Kerensky,A pretty good film,7,9 October 2019,"I went to see this on opening day and while it felt predictable, I enjoyed it. The visuals were stunning, the music was still good, and the animals were all so cute. Some things you can do with traditional 2D animation; while others are better with photorealistic CGI. And James Earl Jones made quite the comeback. If you've enjoyed and seen the original, this is probably too familiar territory, but if you've never seen the original, you might want to give this a chance. Why not?",The Lion King
155,aarongnr,To the people who rate 3 and below,9,18 July 2019,"First off: If you didn't like the original, this is not for you.If you are one of the people who loved the original, how does it make logical sense to give this movie a <3 rating? Yeah, it doesn't.If the movie is a shot for shot remake, how can the story be bad? It can't.The dialogue can be worse, of course. But it's so similar, that it can't be much worse.The animation is stunning. So no bad ratings to be given there.Emotionless characters because of the phororealistic CGI: That's really the only point where you CAN rate this movie very low, if you want. Because that's the only thing that's very different from the Original.So basically, if you liked the original or even thought it was a masterpiece, giving this one a bad rating is straight up illogical and idiotic. And most of you give it a 1 without seeing the movie!Gz, movie fandom has reached is absolute lowest point. Can only go up from here right?EDIT AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE:
All the above is absolutely correct.To me, this movie is great. There are a few dialogue problems against the end and there is a problem with emotions because of the CGI, but otherwise, it's fantastic.Get over it people, Disney wants money. As every business does. Great thing is: You don't have to support it, if you don't want to! :)",The Lion King

And is based on a young cub called Simba preparing to be king of the pride lands with the advice and wisdom of his father Mufasa. However after mufasas evil brother scar kills him Simba runs away and Scar rules. And simba is left with a tough decision weather to stay in relaxation with Timon and Pumba or fight for his rightful place as king.wow the lion king remake was a true visionary masterpiece lets talk about why this is.Lets start with the fantastic soundtrack. Every single time a song came on it gave me goosebumps. Yes nostalgia was a big part of this film but it just worked. They changed some of the songs to make them catchier and make a lot more sense whilst watching and all the voice actors did fantastic jobs with all the songs and not one was badly done at all. Some of the songs like be prepared were shortened but still very much a part of the film and Beyonces song also fitted perfectly into the film as well. And i loved how they added more layers to the songs by adding extra vocals or extra animals just to make it more fun. And i loved how they made a large majority of songs more African inspired which i thought fitted in really well and added to the thematic richness of the film. This was also done in Aladdin with the more Arabian and Egyptian themes and tones which they incorporated into the soundtrack and set pieces.Next the films CGI visuals and aesthetics were absolutely incredible and revolutionary in what studios can achieve. every single animal and set piece looked real it confused me at how real everything looked and yet none of it was real. I was just sitting in awe at how beautiful everything looked in many scenes. This is a really big step forward into what people can achieve with visual effects it should get awards.Next i loved the new scenes that they added and more character depth and development was used for some characters that perhaps weren't used enough in the original film. Yes a few scenes were cut involving Rafiki and some involving Timon and pumbaa but in my opinion they still kept plenty of the visuals and script from the original but added a new flavour to everything from the original. Whether it was new songs things added to songs or slightly changing how scenes looked it all still worked. And i loved how they added more of a character arc to Sarabi and Shenzi. Sarabi had much more of a known presence within this film and they went into more detail about her unwillingness to be with scar but yet still wanting to protect her pride. And what they did with Shenzi was fantastic. They made her more of a intimidating presence and the leader of the hyenas it really suited her character. And all of these extra scenes also added to the entertainment value of the final act. Instead of just having Scar and Simba fighting it out which was still a lot of fun to see. They added more action with the lionesses with Sarabi and Nala leading them. This just made the final act even more fun to watch especially with the fight sequence between Nala and Shenzi.Now the only slight little nitpick that i can think off is that due to the photo realism on all the animals faces. There acting and facial expressions were slightly more limited. This only slightly effected some scenes where Young simba and other characters could not emote there feelings as much as the original for example the stampede scene. However the emotion was shown more in there voices so therefore this was hardly an issue for me just a observation.Now ending on my last few positives. Firstly the voice acting in this was incredible. When i heard that apart from Mufasa ( James Earl Jones) they were getting completely different voice actors i was admittedly very nervous. But i have to say every single person knocked it out of the park. There was not one single weak link and all the voice actors sounded fairly similar to the original characters but with there own twist on them still happening. Everyones singing was on par as well which was great. However my key standouts for me would be JD mccrary as young simba who captured the mischievous and energetic energy of the young simba of the original and sounding surprisingly similar as well. But the main star of the film for me would be Chiwetal Ejiofer as Scar. He was just fantastic here. With Scars character design and Chiwetals intimidating voice it really made Scar even more intimidating and dislikable on screen.And my final two positives,firstly they added more humour into the film which was great considering the original was already funny. The main source of laughter came from Seth Rogen and Bill Eichner as Timon and pumba but also John Oliver as Zazu. As well as keeping the same jokes and humorous tone as the original. They also added more funny one liners for Timon pumbaa and zazu. Whether it was joking about woodpeckers or adding a beauty and the beast sequence there was many belly laughs for all the family. And Seth Rogen and Bill Eichners comedic chemistry was great and they really bounced off each other with the one liners about Simba which was great.And finally most importantly the film captured the same emotional weight as the original. I think nostalgia plays a key role here. Whenever any song came on it gave me goosebumps. It also captured the emotions of mufasas death very well as well. And the most iconic part at the end where simba crowns himself as king on pride rock gave me chills maybe even more then the original so this was executed perfectly.Overall the lion king is a revolutionary achievement for disney who keep proving that they are the rulers of the film industry. With there strongest live action remake and the remake that i consider to be better then the original.",The Lion King

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Lion King. It's been a year of live action remakes for Disney, first we had Dumbo, then Aladdin. This third outing brings us that world stage and screen phenomenon The Lion King. I heard a discernible intake of breath as those iconic first notes of Circle of Life burst out on the surround sound and felt rather than saw the settling of bottoms on seats as people made themselves comfortable to watch this newest version of the classic film. We were not disappointed. As in Jungle book, it was a little strange at first to see the animals talking in a live action film but I found myself very quickly drawn into the story and forgot I was watching something so lifelike yet fake. The animation was incredible. The voices well suited to the animals, if I had to make one complaint it was the lack of Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. My favourite scenes had to be the ones that included Timoon and Pumba, somehow they transferred their cartoon versions into lifelike real creatures and as with the lions and the hyenas the close up of their eyes were beautiful, enabling you to read real emotion in them. The audience ranged from about 5 to 85 and there was even applause when it ended. Totally worth waiting for.",The Lion King
160,kermitkid,Um....Why?,6,30 March 2020,"Did not need to be made! It adds nothing! It improves nothing! It's just a visually impressive film. It's meant to show off, like how Polar Express was made to show off motion capture, or the old Disney films like Snow White and Cinderella were made to show off animation. This just seems like an advertisement to other studios for a new CGI program. They also ruined Be Prepared! You will miss nothing by skipping this film.

162,movieman6-413-929510,The live action Lion King comes across as a well-known nature documentary with a different look.,6,17 July 2019,"The Lion King is a live-action film version of the 1994 animation film of the same name. The film is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of Chef, Iron Man and he also directed the live-action version of The Jungle Book in 2016.The film is set in the African savannah where a new heir to the throne is born, the young lion Simba (voice of JD McCrary). Simba is the next king of their kingdom after his father Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones). Simba his uncle Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor) has lost his place as the future heir to the throne with the birth of Simba. Scar comes with a dark plan to still be king.
When Scar executes his plan, Simba is banned and ends up in unknown territory. In this area Simba meets the carefree duo Timon (voice of Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (voice of Seth Rogen). Together with these two, Simba grows up with a carefree life. When the now mature Simba (voice of Donald Glover) meets his old girlfriend Nala (voice of Beyoncé Knowles) again, he is confronted with his past. In this way he is faced with the choice to continue his carefree life or to return to his ancient kingdom and to assume his rightful title as king, but for this he must make the mistakes he has made in the past undergo and see to rectify.This new live-action film from Disney is actually not a real live-action film, because all the animals in the film are placed in the film with good CGI. All African places and backgrounds were also placed in the film with a green screen. With the live action of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau managed to capture the animals and the jungle in a realistic way in 2016, making it seem like you were really in the jungle as a viewer. With this film, Jon Favreau and his technical team have managed to improve the effects. This makes the film look even more realistic than The Jungle Book and looks like a nature documentary about the African savannah with the story of The Lion King.
To keep the film realistic, the animals do not really show their emotions with their posture as they do with the animation. The animals communicate and show their emotions more with their body language and attitudes. So as a viewer you have a lesser emotional bond with the characters compared to the animation. The emotional moments are the same as in the animation, but do not have such an emotional effect as they do in the animation.Because the story of The Lion King animation is actually a perfect story that you do not need to change anything about, they have not really done that with this live action film either. So this new film comes across as familiar if you know the animation version. A few minor adjustments have been made, but these do not change the familiar story. In the live-action filming of other Disney films such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, they managed to adjust the films a bit to give it a different and individual style and also to give it a more modern look. stop.Most of the voice acting is done well in this film, but if you are familiar with the animation it may take some getting used to hearing the famous characters with a different voice in this film. Fortunately, James Earl Jones can be heard as the voice of Mufasa, but just like when he returned as the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars spin-off Rogue One, you can hear that he has grown older. The younger actors, who speak to the young versions of the animals, do a bit better work than the older actors, because with the young characters you can still hear a little emotion in their voices. With the older cast you hear the emotions less in their voices, which is probably done to keep it fitting with their emotionless facial posture. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do their voice acting in an appropriate and comical way. Seth Rogan's unique smile is also nice when Pumbaa has to laugh in this film.
The singing work is also done well and in an appropriate way by the cast. Beyoncé and Donald Glover are both singers and are suitably cast in the front of this film. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan do sing in a somewhat lesser way, but this fits in with their characters. Most famous songs from the animation can also be heard in this film, but in a somewhat different way. Artist Pharrell Williams has done his best to bring the music back in a good way in this version of The Lion King. Hans Zimmer is also the composer of the soundtrack for this film, just as he was for the animation. In this way he brings the soundtrack back in a slightly modified, but also in a well-known way in this version.",The Lion King

now that's a brilliant idea if we talking about films like.....snowhite, maleficent, alladin, cinderella etc..etc......but not such a good idea if we talk about LION KING.
and the reason is we had an animation film...we have again a new animation remake. not a real live action film in the sense we have no real actors like we do with cinderella and the rest of the live action films.
that's cause we are dealing with animals this time so what's the need for A Useless remake ?
combined with the fact the original and best film and even it's sequel were far better than this remake in all aspects then if u need to watch lion king watch the earlier animation films again and ignore this useless remake which don't even have half the heart the originals had.
soundtrack was also bad compared to the 1994 score.Grade // C+",The Lion King
167,cinephile-27690,It made me love the original more-that's worth something! (9.5/10),9,15 August 2019,"I saw this on July 22nd, 2019. I live with my Grandma due to some personal troubles, and she took me to live with her 6 years ago that day. The Lion King is also her favorite Disney movie(mine is The Hunchback of Notre Dame, by the way), so I thought that seeing this could be our way to celebrate.If you've seen the animated movie, you have seen about 80% of the new movie. You may have heard that this is practically a shot-for-shot remake. That's sort of true. Many scenes appear that way, though there are minor differences throughout that make it a slightly new experience. Though many parts like the climax made me feel this way. (Mufasa's death is more heart-wrenching in this adaptation if you ask me.)The best part for me was the songs. With the exception of a Beyonce song, they are all the same, but seeing lifelike animals perform them is astonishing. I felt a rush of joy when the songs came on. (We actually entered the movie a minute late, but even The Circle of Life's middle sucked me right into the movie!)Be Prepared was heavily modified, however, and while that wasn't so memorable, it wasn't terrible either. That's one issue I had with it.I must also admit that some lines were not given strong emotions, for example Scar's lines were sometimes simply said and weren't as frightening as Jeremy Iron's work. However, the voice-work is overall decent.While I had minor issues with the movie, I didn't think it was worth heavily deducting my rating. No movie is perfect, and such small details aren't worth trashing.The movie is also exactly half an hour longer than the original, but I could hardly tell. The movie runs at such a fine pace!The CGI that make the animals is also well done. I honestly believe that the animals make this a landmark in live action computer generated imagery, and for movies that use it in the future!There are also some new jokes, all that made me laugh out loud. EG, near the end, there is a Beauty and the Beast reference that had me howling in the theater, along with the others in the audience! That was my favorite part, in fact!I could give this MUCH more praise, but I will stop here. Is the movie ""necessary""? No. But are 20 Marvel movies? Disney remakes are here to stay for awhile, whether or not we want them to.Was it worth seeing? ABSOLUTELY! It's a grand production at LEAST worth seeing in theaters. It's a notch short of the 1994 movie, but this made me appreciate the original all the more! That's worth something!

172,Jerique,"Unimpressive, underwhelming, underachieving...",4,22 July 2019,"It's great that we live in a time where the 1994 animated film can have the star role of Mufasa get his iconic voice actor to return. It's great to also be in an era where musicals like The Lion King and Aladdin can get musicians to fill roles with song numbers attached to them.That's where the greatness ends. The Lion King is an epic film and so should the remake be. However, everything about this film falls short. You can't expect a brand new experience really just some slightly altered scenes, maybe a few new ones and some adjusted dialogue. But when performances seem phoned in, songs fall flat and lack a big punch, the film itself lacks substance and the only thing viewers can walk away feeling is the bit of nostalgia that comes with this is still The Lion King.Song numbers of ""Just Can't Wait to Be King"" and ""Circle of Life"" have a feel of powerful and epic, especially half way through and then there's the build up at the end of each song in the original film. Here, the songs have no real power behind the vocals and the build up seems missing.Be Prepared is done in a capella and almost completely omitted. It was almost entirely skipped over. Although Chiwetel Ejiofor does a good job as Scar overall, his song is one of the worst that Disney has done. Even though I welcomed an expansion on Shenzi and Sarabi, it really felt that the only voice actor that had a passion for the character was the only one who returned: James Earl Jones.Overall, this one was a big disappointment. In contrast, I believed seeing the previews that Aladdin was going to be ruined and I was wrong. Will Smith made that film truly exciting and the song performances in that film were epic. It's a huge letdown that The Lion King couldn't deliver the same standard. Jon Fraveau may have put more of an effort in The Jungle Book remake and just maybe wasn't as passionate about this project. Whatever the case may be, this one didn't deliver the grand spectacle that audiences fell in love with in 1994.",The Lion King
173,Aly200,"A decent remake, but won't surpass the 1994 original",6,19 July 2019,"Jon Favreau has once again worked a technical marvel with this updated rendition of Disney's Oscar winning feature from the mid-90s. Although it's updated in the visuals, the story is still the same one that a majority of the audience has grown up with from childhood.The casting is fairly top-notch with the likes of award winning singer-actor Donald Glover as the older Simba (far more believable than Matthew Broderick in 1994), comedian John Oliver as eternal punching-bag Zazu (who is quite braver than his counterpart, but still hilarious with straighter humor than Rowan Atkinson's slapstick-like routine which makes the character Oliver's own), Florence Kasumba as a more sinister Shenzi who joys in terrorizing Nala, the beloved return of the magnificent James Earl Jones as Mufasa (and once again my childhood got to endure that trauma that makes me sob like a little kid) and JD McCrary and Shahidi Wright Joseph as young Simba and Nala respectively.However not all the casting fits quite as well, but this is not to say the actors are awful or are utterly poor in their performances. They just don't deliver quite as much as many of their costars. As the big bad, Chiwetel Ejofor's vocals sound more like an impression of Idris Elba as Shere Khan in 2016's ""The Jungle Book"" which is a shame. The man is a great actor, but he mostly lacked the gravitas that was brought to the role by Jeremy Irons in 1994 (especially when he is opposite James Earl Jones). One major highlight is that Ejofor gets the menace of Scar correct and is quite vicious with his actions and is so self-serving he doesn't care what happens to others.In the role of comedic relief with the always hilarious Timon and Phumba, I feel we got a downgrade from the hilarity that was Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella who had an Abbott-Costello chemistry as the duo. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner feel more like two loud-mouthed buddies who try to replicate some of the beats from the original film. To Eichner's credit, he does capture Timon's arrogant attitude on-point more than Lane's smarmier meerkat and his 'Be Our Guest' parody is a gut-buster (though I miss that 'Luau!' hula, but this worked on so many levels). Rogen was the ideal choice for Phumba in concept, but he is clearly the smarter one as opposed to his original counterpart who is dimmer but is what made the humor work between Lane and Sabella; having two characters act alike isn't really that interesting a dynamic.As for the badass Nala, we really didn't need Beyoncé in the role. While yes she can sing (although plugging her own song in wasn't needed or asked for by most) her vocals lacked what Moira Kelly was able to balance with the same character. Moira Kelly was more stubborn and sharp-tongued (while singing was done by Sally Dworsky who was excellent for the Oscar winning ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"") compared to Beyoncé' who seems content to live the 'Hakuna Matata' life. Beyoncé's Nala gets huge credit for rallying the lionesses in the final battle and taking on Shenzi in a girl-on-girl fight that was a nice twist.The visuals are obviously one of the greatest parts of the film. Styled in the same photo-realism that won 'The Jungle Book' an Oscar for Visual Effects, this seems like an homage to how the Disney animators got inspiration for the original film's designs (the '90s team went to Africa and sketched the savannah and wildlife). However this technique takes away much of the expressive features that the original animation was able to imbue (like Andreas Deja incorporating Jeremy Irons' facial expressions and features into Scar). It's wonderful to see realistic animals though I suppose.One final note goes to the wonderful score by original composer Hans Zimmer who took home an Oscar for the original film and the songs by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice (who also took home an Oscar for Best Song). From that opening chant by Lebo M and the chorus to the glorious triumphant 'King of Pride Rock' at the climax, I felt the tears welling in my eyes and wept; bringing those happy childhood memories back and fresh. Even Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen singing 'Hakuna Matata' was a blast (their singing was on par) and having Donald Glover just own the end of the song elevated it to coolness. Sadly the song that fell the shortest was ""Be Prepared"" which is basically the greatest villain song ever written of the Mouse House canon. Chiwetel Ejofor doesn't sell it like Jeremy Irons' throaty and foppish sly slickness. It's more like a talk-sing monologue that takes less than a minute which is no way to treat the darkest song of the film. The child actors during ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" really brought the bounciness and youthfulness required with John Oliver adding a straight-man spice.",The Lion King
174,austin0731,Basically The exact same thing,6,11 August 2019,"The live action, animated remake of The Lion King, is..... Good? Well, it's the same exact story with the same exact shots, a little shaving here and a little extra there but essentially an almost shot for shot remake with photo realistic animation of animals. Which begs the question: when will Disney stop this train of remakes of classic Disney films and what is the point. Especially since Disney's main studio generally still puts up excellent original content, you can't help but wonder how far this is gonna go. Unnecessary and a waste of time especially since from the get go it was set up for failure, as it would never have bested the original.",The Lion King
175,jamesjustice-92,Soulless piece of garbage with a strong taste of nostalgia,5,26 July 2019,"There are not enough words in English language to describe my love for The Lion King (1994): it is a piece of me, my childhood, sweet memories and better times when fresh ideas were in blossom. And what do we have here? Almost shot-for-shot remake of the original cartoon with some scenes extended and it just looks pathetic and unreal despite all its realism: the voice actors are trying their best to be believable behind all those animals but opening mouths and speaking isn't enough - there are no emotions, no feelings, no soul and their performances are just not as exciting as they could have been. Casting Beyonce as Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar wasn't the wisest decision as they lack the charm of Moira Kelly and the great Jeremy Irons completely. The singing numbers are overall bad choreographed and plain dull because of this photorealism. So what was the point of making a movie? To show what a group of tech guys can do with the help of a computer? Only they shouldn't have done this experiment with the classic such as The lion king to many generations of used-to-be kids and the kids of theirs. This product is made simply to grab a quick buck, or which is more likely, a billion of them and brings absolutely nothing to the great legacy of cinema.",The Lion King

It's a very beautiful live-action film, like the original. They did the exact same lines and scenes from the original, but in a different way of making something new out of it.

179,galahad58-1,A Roaring Mess,4,11 December 2019,"Remaking a top notch film is never a good idea. Typical for the greediest corporation on Earth to make a money grab film that leaves a lot to be desired.First - the decision to make everything related to the hyenas extremely dark was a mistake. The interaction between the hyenas, in the original, was part of the charm and brought a lot of humor to the movie. ""I'll have what's lion around"" and ""Make mine a cub sandwich"" were lines that delivered properly would have brought some life to this dud.
Second- all the animals look sickly and the cartoon brought more life to the creatures.
Third - voice acting. The original had wonderful voice actors and this film was just ruined by the voice acting. Seth Rogan is god awful as Pumbaa- he is annoying and ruined the entire Pumbaa character. Timon feels forced and lacks the heart and soul that Nathan Lane brought the cartoon version.
Fourth - Jeremy Irons was classic as Scar - a wonderful rendition - Scar is very forgetful in this film - looks bad - sounds bad.
To wrap it up - this was a poor remake that may visually have some nice moments, but lacks the heart and soul of the original.",The Lion King

182,Olicosmic,"Beautiful, yet soulless",3,28 December 2019,"It's a bit of a weird time for Disney nowadays, as they seem very content with making mostly remakes nowadays. And while sometimes it can work, like with the great ""Jungle Book"" remake, there are times where the only thing that the remake will do is make you wonder why it even exists. This film takes the latter to a whole new level, as it is one of the weakest remakes I've ever seen from Disney. It takes everything great about the original 1994 classic and either changes absolutely nothing or does them worse. The story, premise, characters (with the exception of Timon and Pumbaa), and structure are all the exact same with little to nothing fresh about them. The facial expressions from all of the animals are incredibly static from start to finish, meaning that it's really hard to get any sort of sympathy for any of the characters, since they look bored all of the time. I understand Disney was going for realism, here, but when the lions from National Geographic show more emotion than this, then there's definitely a problem. Because of this, this was one of the most boring and predictable films I've seen in recent memory. I felt no soul or excitement. To be honest, I was mostly bored. That's not to say the movie was a complete train wreck, as the animation and CGI are incredibly stunning. They look lifelike and just beautiful throughout. The voice cast is fantastic, and everyone did a great job in trying to bring life into characters that would've been as close to dead in the face as possible without these performances. The writing of Timon and Pumbaa is the only thing that's truly new and appreciated, as they had some of the funniest lines in the film, as well as the most memorability. Aside from that, however, I am struggling to find any good reason for anyone to bother with this, as this is the exact same film as the original, but not as engaging or as fun. It's a case of flair over function, as it looks beautiful, but it's completely devoid of any of the soul or heart that made the original such a classic to begin with. Do yourself a favor and just stick with the original.",The Lion King
183,TheVictoriousV,Even Disney sycophants seem to be catching on (mostly),2,18 July 2019,"It seems I am impossible to please, doesn't it? When you take a Disney movie and remake it into edgy fanfic with a ""more relevant"" girl-power theme á la Maleficent, I complain that you made needless modifications to the fairy tale. When you follow the original beat-for-beat, I complain that it's so similar that it takes the pointlessness of the ""remake"" to new heights. Why can't I ever be happy?Well, it's because you've yet to see the point: you shouldn't be doing ANY of this, to ANY already existing film version of something (provided you don't have actual updates to offer and are indeed just doing it for the money). If you're this allergic to coming up with new ideas, why can't you at least do, say, a unique interpretation of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale? Why not do a Jungle Book adaptation that retains the darkness of the Kipling novels? Why not rip off Kimba the White Lion and Hamlet in a different sort of way this time?This, naturally, brings us to The Lion King, which raises a question of how much of your film can consist of CGI before you lose the permit to even call it a ""live-action"" remake - or how much of a copy it can be of a more expressive and colorful animation before failing to qualify as its own movie at all. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it. Maybe this is the best thing to happen to cinema since Michael Haneke made a shot-for-shot remake of his own film Funny Games in 2007.James Earle Jones (sounding just as tired of all this as I am) still voices Mufasa, the first king of Pride Rock, and his child Simba is played by JD McCary as a cub and Donald Glover when he's an adult, hiding from the treacherous Uncle Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Need I tell you what Scar does and then pins on Simba, to chase the latter away from Pride Rock and claim the throne? Probably not, but I can tell you that this supposedly bigger film does not remotely do justice the ""stampede"" sequence of the original. Again: why do you think more grounded-looking visuals and fewer colors make something more spectacular? Even the maddening Simba the King Lion is more fun to look at than this.Nala, love interest of Simba, is voiced by Beyoncé because who needs voice actors? John Oliver is decently funny as Zazu, the sycophantic hornbill. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen provide comic-relief annoyance as Timon and Pumbaa. John Kani is Rafiki, the wise but eccentric mandrill who observes everything. Alfre Woodard gives motherly warmth as Queen Sarabi. Lastly, Keegan-Michael Key, Florence Kasumba and (most welcome of all) Eric André play the bumbling hyenas who answer to Scar. So there you have it. It's celebrities you recognize and characters you recognize, which is apparently all it takes. Tag a friend you HAVE to see this with!Jon Favreau has now answered the question that, judging by fan comments on Facebook, has been on everyone's mind since seeing the original Lion King: what if I could see this exact movie again only this time I'm just looking at regular lions, Rafiki stares at me blankly, and the lovable Pumbaa is just kind of a pig? The Lion King is too real-looking to be as fantastical as the 1994 film, but too obviously artificial to be as awe-inspiring as the beasts of the real world (Favreau ain't no Jacques Perrin). Even what Disney did with Dinosaur made more sense than this, as there is a shortage of real-life dinosaurs that we can photograph.I can hear your arguments already. ""If you don't like it, don't watch it!"" ""Let people like what they like."" ""I think it's fun to see my favorite movies with updated (sic) visuals and more hip-sounding music."" I get all of this, and I wish it were that simple.On some level, you have to know what you're voting for when you elect to pay for a film like this. You're telling Disney that you're satisfied seeing the same thing over and over again, hence their creative bankruptcy is not an issue, and even worse: you're apparently okay with the fact that those who made the original storyboards, wrote the original dialogue, invented the characters, and actually MADE THIS MOVIE in any meaningful sense reportedly don't get much of the cash.In case you didn't catch it: this remake is not only a ""f-ck you"" to 2D animation as an art form (with its implication that a graphics update is at all necessary to ""introduce the film to a new generation"") but a bigger one to the artists who created it, doing the heavy lifting for those who are now making the money. That, in a nutshell, is the 2019 Lion King.When a film is this repulsive, not because of content but because of what it essentially stands for, I usually give it 0. Don't be too shocked about my 1 rating. I'm being generous (mainly to the tormented VFX crew).",The Lion King
184,jackgdemoss,Shockingly realistic visual effects take away from emotional expressivity,7,25 July 2019,"For only rating this movie as a 7/10, I sure feel like I have a lot to say about it. The vision of the film was clearly to make the most realistic version of the classic tale as possible, and it succeeded spectacularly in that way. The wildlife and natural scenery were bar none in the world of CGI grounded in realism. This also happens to be its greatest downfall, however. By creating ultra-realistic lions, they sacrifice a huge part of what made the original lion king so special: emotional expressivity in the faces of the animals. So now we have reached an interesting point in our movie-tech, where we can create animation that looks worse but portrays human emotion well, or we can make things hyper-realistic. I look forward to the day we can have both. The voice acting cast was phenomenal. Specifically, John Oliver, Donald Glover, and Seth Rogan came out to play. Beyonce and Glover were interesting to hear sing together, with Glover holding down the lower, constant melodies, and Beyonce controlling the song. There were times that it felt Beyonce was going a bit too far and the character no longer felt like Nala, but rather, Beyonce.",The Lion King

187,carlos37andre,"The level of technology we have reached is insane, the movie is astonishing real",7,24 July 2019,"One will argue what was the point of doing a remake that is almost bit for bit what the original movie was. And this is a fair point. But I'll talk about it later.
First I have to talk about the movies' positives. It's insane. The photo realistic animals are almost flawless, if they didn't talk, you could think you were watching an Animal Planet show or something. It's that level of perfection. And even the talking part, I think they handled pretty well, it doesn't feel strange. The voice acting is awesome too. Mainly Seth Rogen as Pumbaa steeled the movie for me.Well, and I think that's it as far as positives go. Of course, you will watch it, be amazed by the technology, and also entertained by the story, cause it's the original Lion King's story. But I understand the ones who asked for more in a remake as big as this one.The Lion King is a difficult property to reboot, knowing how well received the first movie was and still is, it's really difficult to think about a way to re-telling the story while still doing something new without pissing fans off. But when you have that much money and minds behind it, you have to do it. The technology is awesome, and this will certainly be remembered as a turning point in animation history decades from now. But still, I believe you needed more to justify rebooting such an important franchise.The story is almost bit for bit the same, there are 3 or 4 new scenes, that don't add nothing new to it, it's just to get to the 2 hours run time. The photo realism is amazing, but it can also be viewed as a problem, because of that realism the characters show very little emotion (I mean, it's hard to make a Lion show human-like emotions), I also found that because of realism as well, it was really hard to distinguish between some characters, namely the lionesses, when they weren't talking I had basically no idea if it was Nala or Simba's mother. Those are some of the two points I believe the original one beats this one quite easily.To sum up, the movie is entertaining, and it's for sure a turning point in movie technology, as Star Wars or Avatar were before it. It's historical. However, in the end, the question that remains is if we really needed this turning point to be in a Lion King re-imagination, that isn't really a re-imagination.",The Lion King
188,dormesher-21565,Remember who you are..... Good remake,8,27 July 2019,"The Lion King. A great live action remake with the same story that I love and grew up with.
The characters are great and this movie just looks fantastic.Is it better the animated original... No of course not and it has some flaws.

I am however annoyed with the fact that Be prepared got shortened in this version.The effects are great and Timone and Pumber are hilarious in this version Scar was also great being scary and a great villain like in the original.The ending battle was amazing and Mufasas death still got me as always.
Just a great film that adapts the film beautifully I will say the animation is better and does handle the emotional scenes better but this is still a fantastic watch for fans.Verdict 8/10 a great live action addition not as good as the animation and the original handles some scenes better but it's a fantastic story and a wonderful movie to watch.",The Lion King

It was nearly a shot for shot remake of the 1994 version.Problem number 2: Real lions cannot emote. Therefore in scenes where emotion is required of the characters - the lions presented on screen simply cannot deliver it. It's almost like those earlier movies where real life animals were used and only the mouths are animated.Problem number 3: Scar, despite being voiced by the brilliant Chiwitel Ejiofor, lost all of his humour and cunning wit. It was one of the main reasons Simba trusted him in the first place.

191,AdrenalinDragon,The King of Soulless Lazy Cashgrabs,1,19 July 2019,"Disney has managed to hit rock bottom by turning arguably their best Disney movie of all-time into one of the biggest pile of garbage I have ever witnessed on the big screen. Imagine all the colour, emotion, life, magic, joy, and personality sucked out all in an instant from one of your all-time favourite movies. That's this 2019 Lion King remake in a nutshell. As the end credits were rolling, I felt nothing. I didn't care about anything. I never felt sad, happy, overjoyed, or any emotion the entire time. I was soulless, just like this entire movie was. It was Disney at their absolute worst. They took the weakest and blandest possible way out of making this movie. If you've watched the 1994 original, you've seen this movie, and anything they added or changed was pointless filler or bad changes that made the movie much, much worse than you could have ever imagined.Why would I want to see lifeless versions of my favourite songs with the dullest visuals and animals doing nothing interesting just so this movie can stay ""Realistic""? I have no idea but someone thought it was a good idea! Was it worth it Jon Favreau? Improving your visuals so much that the goddamn animals can only open their mouths and do nothing else with their movement? Oh right, animals can't emote properly because they can't emote much in real life! Geez, I wonder why in the original Animated version these Animated characters had over-exaggerated features to be like Human beings? Oh right, so we can emotionally connect with them! It doesn't translate very well in ""Live Action""!You can imagine alot of these shot-for-shot sequences being much worse in this ""Live-Action"" CGI remake. Scenes were dumbed down or replaced with crappy alternatives because the CGI animals couldn't do them in the movie or had no emotion to pull it off. In one of the most iconic scenes of the original movie, the audience were laughing at a very serious scene that is played to extreme
dramatic effect because of how dumb it looked in ""Live-Action"". There is nothing funny going on in this scene at all. They turned one of the most emotionally devastating sequences of the original movie into a huge embarrassment. How could you do that? Why do we feel nothing for Simba and these other characters? Why do almost all the voice performances feel like they only used the first take out of so many of these talented actors? Very dull and uninspiring.They butchered the villain Scar big time as well! In the original he was a sly, snarky, sarcastic, and quotable evil Lion with so much personality and wit behind him. In the new one he just sounds like a generic bad guy Lion who is always angry. In fact, I didn't even notice it was Scar at first! They made all the animals look so realistic you can't tell some of them apart until a character mentions them or you connect the dots with their lines taken from the original, which I have to say was very lazy as it was basically like 90% of the same dialogue. Thanks for also butchering one of my favourite characters Rafiki by the way. Even though you guys were basically doing a shot-for-shot remake, you got rid of his best moments for no reason! Timon and Pumbaa now have unfunny jokes constantly and just feel like pale imitations of their originals who were so beloved back then.What about the filler and new stuff? Well, you get one forgettable song sung by Beyoncé in it. It doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all and just felt like Disney had to add some random song in there so they could get the Best Original Song Oscar nomination. Shenzi the Hyena is now the leader of all the Hyenas but it doesn't really go anywhere or develop her character at all. There's a new scene which shows Nala escaping the Pride Lands ruled by Scar that is just padding and adds nothing to the table at all. The Lion Sleeps Tonight gets a bit more screentime but it's just showing off bugs and animals and nothing more.
There's probably more but I've already forgotten alot about this movie. They changed some of the dialogue here and there, and most of the time it's worse jokes or lines that don't feel natural at all. Even stuff like cinematography, music, and line delivery all felt off and unprofessional in large parts of the movie.You know? The more I think about this remake, the more I get angry about it and I wish someone would just snap this piece of trash out of existence. The original was close to perfection already, so why bother remaking this movie? This is the laziest Disney cashgrab I have seen so far, and I'm getting sick of them releasing these ""Live Action"" movies being made over and over again now, but it doesn't matter because Disney is going to make loads of money anyway. This Lion King remake in particular was easily the worst one so far, because all it needed to do was rely on the brand and make the exact same movie again bring absolutely nothing new to win people over. What happened to artistic integrity, originality, or effort? I hate having to think this stupid movie exists with the original now.1/10",The Lion King

194,scb_coldsteel,A beautiful but ultimately shallow adaptation.,7,21 July 2019,"So I just saw The Lion King at the theater. Honestly after the disappointment that was Dumbo and the mediocrity that was Aladdin my expectations were pretty low. How could Disney possibly make anything that could live up to the iconic animated classic? Overall I have to say I enjoyed the film. Sure it wasn't perfect and it was a shameless cash grab, but I still had fun watching the movie and it is sure to please a new generation of viewers.Of course everyone knows the plot of The Lion King. It is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Honestly very little is changed regarding the plot. Ninety-five per-cent of the film was a near shot-for-shot remake so don't expect anything original plot wise. The film hardly reinvented the wheel, but the original Lion King was a blatant copy of another film so that's not really a negative.Where the film really shined however was the CGI and set design. This may have bene one of the most incredible lookingDisney films I've ever seen. The CGI was rich and layered and really captured all of the diverse characters. On top of that, the setting was simply beautiful and wonderfully designed. In every way the film was pure eye candy and absolutely captured the beauty of The Lion King.I also have to mention the soundtrack. The original Lion King has so many incredible songs. I am happy to say the new cast really did a great job recording the classic songs. It was hard not to smile and burst out into song while at the theater. There really was not a bad performance song wise. The entire cast perfectly replicated the magic of the original songs in their entirety.The film had an absolutely phenomenal cast, but John Oliver and Seth Rogen really stole the show. I was skeptical about Seth Rogen but he perfectly captured Pumbaa and made the character his own. John Oliver was absolutely perfect and easily delivered some of the best lines of the film. Of course as expected Donald Glover and Beyonce were all around great and James Earl Jones was iconic as ever.That all being said the film was hardly perfect. With so much of the movie being a shot for shot remake the question has to be asked why even make the film? The new songs for the film were unmemorable and I was sad to see the film change a number of iconic scenes for no reason. The movie also toned down quite a bit of the comedy and whimsical factors that made the original so mesmerizing as a youth. While the CGI was beautiful the attempt to set the film in a realistic tone really hurt what made the original so special. The character design just seemed like it had a problem emoting with the line delivery.I also really had a problem Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. His voice never really matched the character and the changes to the song Be Prepared definitely were a step backwards. The same can be said for the entire cast of a hyenas. Some of the delivery of the lines were also a bit questionable from the young actors playing Simba and Nala.Ultimately the biggest problem with the movie was not with the film itself but with just how iconic the original Lion King was. It would be near impossible for someone like myself who grew up on The Lion King to not unfavorably compare this to the animated film. That doesn't quite seem fair however to the film as a whole.This was easily the most entertaining and well-made adaptation Disney has produced so far. For a new generation I could easily see this becoming a classic. However for those of us who grew up singing Hakuna Matata this is sure to feel like shallow and unnecessary adaptation.

197,RhapsodyReviews,Unnecessary Remake.,5,10 November 2019,"Review:
'The Lion King' is a musical-family film directed and produced by Jon Favreau. It is a photorealistic remake of Disney's traditionally animated film of the same name.
This movie has a classic case of rehashing the same story scene by scene with some dialogue changed up. Sometimes it worked, but more then often it didn't. It messed with a lot of the classic things we all know and love from the original Lion King, tweaked them into something new, but in the end never really pulled it off.
I was really missing Jeremy Irons as Scar; Chiwetel Ejiofor just didn't bring anything to this character at all. He didn't seem menacing or scary for that matter. I remember watching the original movie and knowing that Scar is a villain that could get away with anything, and it was because of the voice acting done by Jeremy Irons. The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. Other than those two, it is a very forgettable and hollow version of the story.
First let's start off with what I liked about the movie. The CGI. It is incredible, it's mesmerising and beautiful. But that's all it is, is beautiful CGI, they've completely lost sight of the story, the emotion and the magic. There is a lot of people that complain that the animals are too realistic, so they can't capture the raw emotion of the characters like you could in the 1994 Lion King. I don't believe that to be true. You can make things lack emotion psychically because they're a realistic looking animal, but it is then the actor portraying that character's job to bring the emotion to it. Unfortunately, not a lot could pull that off in this movie.
Overall, this movie was one that I was really looking forward to and it let me down. The voice acting is forgettable almost as much as the story itself. I wouldn't be choosing this one over the original version to watch.

198,totalovrdose,The Lion's Share of Nostalgia,7,12 July 2019,"The Lion King is great - that is a fact. The original animated film is Disney gold, and this film captures that, for the most part, incredibly well. But...so often, the film is just a carbon copy of the original, scene for scene, with the same soundtrack, songs, cinematography and moments. True, there are some additional scenes added in, and some changes do occur, don't get me wrong, and occasionally, John Oliver as Zazu and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa insert some alternate, and very funny lines, but the film is, at its core, so close to being a mirror image to the original, that it's surreal. I will admit, the special effects are utterly perfect, and truly breathtaking to watch. It is impossible to tell this utterly perfect work of art apart from reality. That aside, it is still just a copy. Who has seen The Poseidon Adventure? Who saw The New Poseidon Adventure? Who saw Poseidon? All different - similar story, but each offer their own unique take on the narrative. Who saw Godzilla 1954? Who saw the 1997 American remake? (God help me, I'm actually using this film to make a point). Who saw Godzilla 2014? Each of these films bring something new to the properties, with each project being vastly different. The Lion King however, is thoroughly predictable.Some people will argue that is a good thing, and I understand that. Those I saw the movie with this evening said it reminded them of their childhood; their old friends, and what they used to do. It was incredibly nostalgic and melancholic for them, and I can't deny that I occasionally felt chills just watching it (in a good way, mind you). Donald Glover and Beyoncé absolutely knock it out of the park with their rendition of the tunes, and their voice acting of the central protagonists was really on the mark (though Beyoncé deserved significantly more opportunities because, you could just tell, she was loving the role). Florence Kasumba as hyena leader, Shenzi, was a definite stand out; she brought an undeniable sinisterness to the role that was absent from the animated feature, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was just sublime. Ejiofor's voice alone gave amazing presence to the film, capturing Scar's cunning ruthlessness, making him just as appealing an antagonist as ever. As for James Earl Jones as Mufasa, what can I say? I could listen to that man's voice all day long - he still managed to offer some changes in the way he performed his lines in contrast with the original, despite there again, being vast similarities, and it was brilliant to listen to him give the grand king life once more.The changes to the elephant graveyard scene were especially brilliant, and the many new faces added to the habitat that Timon and Pumbaa inhabit were cute, cuddly and added more character to the environment, making it feel more lived in. One massive change from the film however, is the significant lack of any physical emotions. Though the actors deserve kudos for the emotive performances they provide, the faces of the animated characters presenting these lines, remind stoic at best, even in the most emotive moments. Don't get me wrong, this feature still has some emotively powerful occasions, though some of the animated films most tragic moments did not affect me as dearly in this adaptation, whereas others had an even more profound affect.At the end of the day, I would recommend this movie, however, so much that it does right, is just lifted from the original. As a teacher, I often tell my students that copying is a bad thing - having your own spin on it, and adding your own personality to something, to make it your own, is what makes it great, and I just wish that director, Jon Favreau, would have taken the opportunity to do something more with this beloved classic.",The Lion King
199,Padreviews,So much better than I expected,9,19 August 2019,Animation has reached a huge new height and it's hard to see how more realistic animated films can be - ok this isn't true animation it's real animals using cgi to give them human qualitiesThe story is great - many of you would have seen it before - as a result many might be disappointed as they might prefer the stage musical or the original animated film .It's raised the bar very high but probably won't be a classic or loved as much as the original but it was a worthy remake .Pad.A 9/10,The Lion King
200,arabnikita,Even worse than what you think it is,3,24 July 2019,"Naaaaaaants ingonyamaaaaa bagithiiii Baba!!! These words stir up a fire inside of me and the animation that comes after it along with the beautiful music and songs create a whirlwind of emotions and pleasant feelings that have a special place in my heart. With the way re-makes have been going for Disney, I was expecting it to be subpar to the original but I was not expecting to be that dissapointed.To be fair, the animals do look good as long as nobody talks but as soon as they open their mouths, the facial expressions and animations simply lack any emotions which were the strongest point of the original. The Pride Rock itself has lost all of its grandeur and feels small and unimpressive making it look like the movie is happening in a zoo. The musical performances are weak due to the above mentioned reasons coupled with poor editing and transitions that take out all the magic and that breaks my heart more than anything.The thing that vexed me was Scar who looks like he has been subjected to intensive shock therapy and was forced to work in the sewers before being in the film. What made me rage, was the fact that ""Be Prepared"" which is one of the most electrifying songs and performances in Disney history has been flat out reduced to ashes. There were two good points though. First is Seth Rogen who was a hand-in-glove fit to voice Pumba and probably the only character who looked organic in his role. Second are Hans Zimmer soundtracks simply because you can't mess them up. I just hope Disney will stop ruining the classics and will focus on new ideas from now.#moviesshmovies",The Lion King
201,MinistryofDoom,An Incredibly Gorgeous Film that brings Lion King and the African Savanna to life,8,16 October 2019,"Jon Favreau is back with another amazing film experience. After showing what he could do with the incredible live-action/cgi version of The Jungle Book, he's back with Lion King. I won't go into the story too much because unless you've been living under a rock, you already know the story of Simba the Lion Cub. Favreau's film truly shows us how far we have come in terms of technology and film-making. Lion King is a film that could have never been made 20 years ago. The photo-realistic CGI is absolutely incredible. The film truly captures and brings to life the magic and beauty of the Disney animated classic. It's so detailed, so beautiful, so realistic that you might actually think that you're watching a National Geographic documentary about the African Savanna.This is a fantastic film for kids (and adults) of all ages. Though some of the photo-realism lends itself to being a bit scary for younger viewers. Particularly when the Hyenas emerge from the darkness to attack young Simba.The voice-acting was top notch. Most of the main cast were African actors, which I'm very happy about. James Earl Jones reprises his role, from the 1994 classic, as Mufasa, while Chiwetel Ejiofor voices Scar, the evil Lion. Beyonce Knowles is adult Nala, while Jaydon McRary and Donald Glover play young and old Simba, respectively. Look out for John Oliver as Zazu, the bird advisor of Mufasa and Simba, and the hilarious Seth Rogan as Pumbaa the warthog, bringing to his portrayal the same infectious laugh and witty banter that hes' known for.",The Lion King
202,gk303007,An ok movie,6,19 July 2019,"I watched this movie with my kid and frankly, we dint like it the way we had our expectations. Somehow something was missing in the core of movie, maybe emotions or the zeal to keep watching it. I felt bored in between. However, would still give 6 for the good CGI effects and an ok effort by the creators. Would say its ok if you watch it on DVD or Web if it comes.",The Lion King
203,achyutaghosh,"dreamy visuals, nothing else",7,22 July 2019,"""Nostalgia is a file that removes the rough edges from the good old days""- Doug LarsonFinding joy in nostalgia when it comes to movies is rather easy. The sense of growing up with characters, and having them influence the person that you may have become is such a strong sentiment. These memories cannot be taken away, and that is true for the Lion King remake.The 2019 Lion King version is impressive- the painstaking efforts that have gone into making the visual effects come alive are to be experienced. In 2019, going gaga over visuals effects is pretty much passe, but still The Lion King is downright astounding. The thing is that beyond the visuals, there is little else that it adds to the original, which in my humble opinion, was a seminal movie. The script, music, the voice acting, the traditional animation remains unparalleled till date.Replace traditional animation with modern live motion capture, and the 2019 version is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 original. All the animals assemble as Simba is born, and as he grows up with his best friend Nala, Mufasa explains to him the circle of life. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill Mufasa, and Simba is chased out of the Pride Lands. He meets Pumba and Timon and grows up with them leading a hakuna matata life, till Nala comes to get him back to his rightful place as king. Scar gets his comeuppance and Simba completes the circle of life when his newborn cub is presented to the assembled animals.Had it been a National Geographic special, there would have been no equal- please take that as a compliment, Lion King. However, even with a stellar voice cast with James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa 25 years on along with Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Beyonce, John Oliver and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Elton John's all-time classic songs, the movie lacks the emotional impact that the original was able to create. Call it corporate greed, lack of creativity and artistry or just plain laziness- nostalgia notwithstanding, it brings nothing new to the table. Director Jon Favreau did a much better job with 2016's The Jungle Book, which, in my mind is one of the best live action remakes ever.But hey, whatever Disney touches these days turns to gold. The Lion King will might make a few billion for sure, and kids will surely enjoy this round too, but Simba's roar is decidedly low this time round.",The Lion King

207,Breumaster,Simba has grown up. :D,9,27 December 2019,"I think it sure must be a lot of brain work to imagine how the real scenes in Afrika will match with the animations. Jon Favreau, which I do admire for his works, did a real good and visionary job, and so did the camera department and the animators. I really liked the little changes that show a more developed story than the full animated original. I would give it the full 10/10, if there would have been a better dub in Germany, because not all of the voices did fit. Scar's voice was way too soft. But that's not the only voice. When it came to the sequence with Timon and Pumbaa, it really got very strong and had funny moments, I didn't expect. If Walt Disney could see it, he would be delighted. For most of his 22 (!) Oscars he was awarded for animal documentations. This movie unites both worlds of cinema - fictional animated and dramatized story with landscape documentations. I like how the animals look and specially how they move! The story is all in all the same.",The Lion King

209,plasticanimalz,"Mmm, Okay",6,23 July 2019,"My overall feelings is in my headline, it was okay. I had my expectations high because this was one of my favorite Disney movies, and the live-action Beauty and the Beast was really good. One thing I didn't expect was the animals to be so realistic. Yes, it showed them that way in the trailer but it didn't really use dialogue, so I wasn't aware they were going to entirely animate them like real animals, and not add any extra zing. So, it looked like a Nat Geo nature documentary with dialogue and occasional singing, which, got a little boring at times. I would think Favarou, even though not an animation guy, would have learned by movie number 3 of turning animated movies into live-action, that what sells animation is the facial and visual gestures. Otherwise, why animate? Even in Beauty and the Beast the cups and teapots weren't simply cups and teapots, they still made them a bit cartoony. Because they didn't do this everything came off wooden. There was no emotion other than slight hints of it in the eyes of the animals. I would think this lesson would have already been learned with the great failure of the Polar Express - animation needs to emote.The pluses were Poomba and Timon, where they put some effort into playing up their humor along with their delivery. The two hyenas played by Keegan Key and Eric Andre were kind of funny, but, again, like the lions, the hyenas had zero emoting or expressions so didn't come off as interesting as Poomba and Timon. Beyonce's vocals are great, obviously, and I was surprised to find out Danny Glover was adult Simba, as I didn't know he could also sing. The voice sounded familiar, but didn't place him until told later. He did a great job, but he's a great actor, so, no surprise there. Young Simba while a good singer but was not a particularly great voice over actor.Mulan looks great, so, hopefully that will be better. I've heard mixed reviews about Alladin, but that's on my list to see. Too many big movies out right now it's hard to keep up. I'll still check out Mowgli, despite how lackluster this was. It just needed some oomph. Given how spectacular most 3D films are these days, I expected to be blown away with the visuals, and, like I said, this looked like your standard nature documentary. I'm curious how this will do in China since they're all about VFXs, and this, while VFX heavy, you can't really tell 'cause everything looks too real. An achievement in one sense...but, didn't really deliver overall.",The Lion King

I came out a little but disappointed that they didn't change it at all. Besides making the scene where Simba and his father talk about the grass. They shaved 5 minutes of that scene off. That was a key scene that made the movie better. They also made the Can You Feel My Love Tonight scene in the day time. The some of the actors though felt life less and bland. Some of the good things were the start. That scene was great. It was really moving and maybe even better than the originals opening scene. Also the effects were great. The whole film look real.

Fast cars, Toys that talk, Prehistoric animals are cash cows for production houses. Its taken 25 years, yes 25, for Disney's animation classic The Lion King to do a full circle and grace us with its re-invented presence. One might say, it is the ""Circle of Life"".25 Years later, from VCR to VR, The Lion King is a visual masterpiece. Director Jon Favreau (Jungle Book 2016) is leaving no rock unturned on this one. The recreation of the Savanna, Pride rock, Rafiki's Tree and those characters close to our hearts elicits nothing but awe and wonderment. The rising sun over the savanna and the opening soundtrack ""Circle of Life/Nants' Ingonyama"" and the immaculate attention to detail in the astute recreation of the 1994 megahit that remains the highest earning G-rated movie of all time is the pinnacle of the VR fueled marvel. Nails gripping the armrests and tear filled eyes awakens nostalgia of a childhood of a then 10-year-old. The bar is now set.Reprising the powerful role of the murdered King, James Earl Jones as Mufasa is joined at the helm of Pride Rock with Chiwetel Ejiofor(Scar), Donald Glover(Simba), Beyoncé(Nala), Billy Eichner(Timon), Seth Rogen(Pumbaa) and John Oliver(Zazu). If you were between the age of 6-10 in 1994, these characters are etched in your memory and Simba's adventure requires no synopsis. It is now safe to assume that a majority of any audience is viewing a re-make whilst the bubbly younger generation is witnessing Simba's story for the first time. Re-makes are always a risky business.""Timon and Pumbaa, you learn to love them"" is the infamous quote that should resonate in your mind if you have memorized the original as this reinvention lacks heart. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner saves Simba in more ways than just one. Running approximately 30 minutes longer than the animation original, the duo keeps the story alive and buoyant and does absolute justice and fills in for the void left by the absence of Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. John Oliver is tasked with big shoes to fill and fill them he did not.Verdict: The visuals alone unquestionably justifies the remake. The soundtrack personifies heart.

Alas, the remake or should i say clone just felt stale, flat, and lifeless. OK it looks amazing in its immersive VR universe, but the Lions in particular came over as very wooden actors. The music sort of saves it, i say sort of because all the musical numbers are inferior to the 1994 original, i did however get the feeling that my audience that I shared the film with were on side with it, as there was very little restless rustling from the mostly young audience, so i guess that i have to assume that the new Lion King is at least a competent flick, but sadly no more.

215,bastille-852-731547,Woefully Inferior Remake of an Animated Classic,4,21 July 2019,"I've always loved ""The Lion King."" I grew up with the original movie, and always have absolutely loved it. I saw the stage show in Washington, D.C. about a decade or so ago. Even though I haven't always been receptive to the idea of Disney remaking animated classics (as that sometimes seems rather ""cash grab""-esque in my book,) I was genuinely excited for this one given the strong connection I have to the original, as well as its seemingly outstanding voice cast and music. Even if the film ended up being somewhat of a cash grab, it would be an entertaining nostalgia rush good enough for me to be perfectly content with having my cash grabbed by the Mouse House. Sadly, the film is actually quite poor and does not even come remotely close to the quality of the original. The 1994 ""Lion King"" is a masterpiece, and I was never expecting them to top it, but the fact that such a talented cast and crew made something this inferior is highly problematic.Since we all know the plot of the story, I won't spend time spelling out the main storyline here. What I will first note is that the film's photorealistic CGI feels incredibly realistic, but fails outright at generating the emotion and colorfulness present in the original. This leads to many musical numbers that are far less interesting than the original. Gone are the exuberant smiles and ""choreography"" of the characters during songs like ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" Instead, we just see CGI lions trying to hop over each other and run side by side, which ends up being a lot less interesting. (""The Circle of Life"" is still outstanding, but that's one of the only things to genuinely like about this remake.) The realism of the CGI also severely limits the emotion conveyed in the film, which makes moments of heightened emotion in the story feel regrettably blasé. For such a talented voice cast, the voice acting isn't as strong as you would expect. Donald Glover and Beyoncé are fine, but underwhelming. James Earl Jones is terrific as Mufasa, but his character is (sadly) far less developed compared to the original. The lack of character development pertaining to both Mufasa and Nala compared to the original are both pretty striking, and completely reduces this remake of much of the charm the original had. Some of the supporting cast ends up being pretty annoying at times, like Seth Rogen voicing Pumbaa. Finally, the script is far more lowbrow and cheesy than the animated version, regrettably settling for juvenile jokes and the lowest common denominator of plot development even in the middle of musical numbers like ""Hakuna Matata.""The 1994 ""Lion King"" is a masterpiece and one of the best animated films ever made, but this remake is an astonishing disappointment. It's not unwatchable by any means, but it's definitely not good--and, even more unexpectedly, forgettable. Stay home and watch the animated version again. 4/10Note: I saw the film in 3D because it was filmed that way, and I wanted to see how the ""photorealistic"" CGI technology was in 3D. It ended up making no difference besides making the image a bit darker, which was disappointing. The only really good 3D during the whole experience was in the ""Spies in Disguise"" trailer before the feature.",The Lion King

However if I try to see it as a movie on its own without any comparisons it is an honest 6.
If I put the two movies side by side this one is terrible. Its lack of emotion is evident and it can not be covered up by the good CGI (good not excellent, I think they could do much better). The plot is there, it is good but good is not enough. The scenes I liked was 1) mufasa rescuing simba and nala from the hyenas and 2) timon and pumpa were delightful in all scenes. I found them funny.
BUT the most important scene of the movie( mufasa's death) was uninspired and emotionless. I always cry when I watch that scene, I was not even feeling emotional.
Scar was not well animated because at the scene where Scar was fighting Simba I could not tell who is who.They should at least try making him more recognizable(or Simba). Also many meaningless scenes from the original were really prolonged (the mouse at the beginning and when Rafiki realizes Simba is alive when hair from his mane travel to his tree). They were not that important scenes. But Mufasa's death on the other hand was fast.
I watched this movie 25 years ago (boy time flies fast..) and I was 10 at the time. I was blown away. And I still am blown away when I watch the original masterpiece. If I try to imagine myself being 10 years old again and having watched this movie as if it is the first time..I honestly believe that I would not feel the same.But I would not rate is a rubbish either. If this stood alone it could be 6 or more.
Btw the songs were not good either. Lion King's soundtrack is impeccable. No one can deny how beautiful it is. It can not be compared to these songs.

221,pokemon_trainer_lucas,A genuine and heart-felt portrayal of The Lion King,10,22 July 2019,"I went to the cinema to watch this movie 2 days ago, and it was clear that everybody in the audience loved it. There were moments of laughter, for example when the hyena needed personal space, and there were moments where the entire cinema (which included young children) was silent as an emotional scene took place.
Throughout the whole film, I felt connected to the characters, and I genuinely felt the hairs on my arms stand on end when the film reached its climax.

222,cadillac20,"A Fantastic Looking Retread Of The Original, Without The Magic That Made It So Wonderful",5,22 July 2019,"I was just getting into my teen years when the original Lion King came out, but it was still something special for me. And I wasn't alone. It was a critical smash, one of the highest grossing animated films of all time, award winning, and considered one of the best animated films ever. In some circles, it is even considered Disney's greatest animated film ever. For me personally, it remains the pinnacle of Disney's animated vault. With the recent spate of Disney live action remakes of their Disney classics (the second one this year alone after Aladdin), it seems like this remake was inevitable. And while it may rekindle some nostalgia for others, while capturing the attention of kids who didn't get to see the original during it's prime, the film largely left me feeling the same way Aladdin did, wondering why this was necessary at all. It still has some quality points, this is Disney after all, but it feels so derivative of the original, I have to wonder what the point of a remake at all was.The story here is the same, almost scene for scene, so anyone who has seen the original will know what to expect going in. I will say, this may be one of Disney's best ever looking films. It begs the question of why you might call this live action at all, considering the film is almost 100% digital effects. And they are pretty spectacular. Disney has set a new standard for what can be done with photo realistic effects. It does create some immersion issues, which I will get to later, but as far as the films look, it's pretty spectacular when you consider how real it looks. Disney will almost assuredly go home with all the visual effects awards for this movie. The film also sounds great. The voice acting is top notch, the singing is excellent (minus some Seth Rogen singing....not a big fan), and the music is great (once again, minus some changes that left a bit to be desired, particularly the iconic Can You Feel The Love song). I think Disney will probably also find itself in some sound categories for this film. I also enjoyed much of the cinematography, which does an excellent job of pushing us through the African wilderness, sending us on exciting chases and adventures, from the ground up. It makes for a wild ride at times.Sadly, for all the great technical achievements, the film left me with the same feelings I had when I left Aladdin, or pretty much any other live action remake. There's no way to distance myself from the original, so it's impossible to see this film with fresh eyes. Part of the issue for me was what the realistic animal effects done here loses from the original. The film is so driven to give us realistic looking and acting animals, that a lot of the magic of the original is gone. We don't get the expressive characters we got from the original, who told their story and sold their emotion as much on how they looked as how they sounded and acted. I will admit Disney did an excellent job not making the animals look weird when talking or singing, but the grounded nature of the film does away with the imaginative singing numbers that drove the original. By comparison, these scenes feel ordinary and kind of dull. Especially disappointing is the centerpiece song, Can You Feel The Love, which feels short and rushed. The original film set this up so well, but here, it feels like Disney kind of forced it into the film. What this film largely shows me is that these movies were animated originally for a reason. Not simply because of the technological constraints, but because the imagination of the script, story, and characters demands the kinds of things that can only be shown through the medium of animation.While I applaud Disney's technical efforts, the film does little but reinforce what made the original such a timeless classic. While children of a new generation might find this film wonderful, it's hard to believe that same feeling of exhilaration is there. While the original animated Disney films because classics for their ability to bring our favorite stories to life, or bring us new ones for the ages, films like this, that are very nearly identical to their originals feel like the same old car with a new coat of paint. It makes one wonder if Disney is still interested in creating new classics, or if they are intent on remaking every original film into a pale imitation.",The Lion King

It pains me to say this because I'm a huge fan of Favreau's directing but the delivery of some lines feel either rushed or dull, the animation (while very well done) takes a away some of if not all of the facial expressions which makes it feel very underwhelming, and while the film doesn't try to be the ""New"" Lion King, it doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the classic, which will have you thinking of it while watching this film, I hate to say it again but after seeing ""The Jungle Book (2016)"" I was expecting a little more from this film, but if you'd like to see a lion documentary with some classic songs now sung by famous celebrities, it's worth a watch.",The Lion King

Everything about the 2019 version I found a total bore, it was so dark in parts, watching it at home at day time was almost impossible. I watched the original straight after and finally I was happy again the see this.I thought the new ALADIN was bad until I compared it to this and now. I am certainly turned off Disney remakes. Hate to think what the new MALIFICENT will be like so I will give that a miss. Also LADY AND THE TRAMP I am sure will be just a bad especially with the Siamese Cat song deleted.As for Disney+, this is one viewer who will NOT be subscribing.

226,EasternZZ,Movie is only good because it is a shot for shot remake of an already good film,6,28 July 2019,"This is Lion King with nice HD graphics. There is maybe one or two new scenes that help flesh out the story, but if you have seen Lion King, you have seen Lion King (2019).The music is still pretty epic, but there is a very weird out of place pop song towards the final 20 minutes that just did not mesh well. Another issue is that ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" was performed in this movie during the daytime, so the lyrics made no sense at all. People already talked about the facial emotions of the animals and and angry lion, sad lion, or happy lion look the same. I would just prefer them to make it a little bit ""fantasy-like"" and just have these lions emote better with eyes or mouths.This movie kinda ruins some of the classic scenes, like the final battle was cool and a lot longer, but Simba and Scar's final showdown was better in the original. The remake didn't have the awesome slow motion slap that the original had.Lastly they ruined the most classic scene in the Lion King, the ""cloud"" scene. In the original you saw Mufasa's face in the cloud cleary, but in this remake all you see are clouds and lightning, with a very very brief glimpse of Mufasa. It kinda loss the emotional impact.Anyways it is a 6/10 because it is pretty much Lion King with god graphics.",The Lion King
227,samyoung-82648,Mixed Feelings,7,18 July 2019,"I've read the reviews. I've watched the film. I'll review this from both perspectives.Progressive view: The film is very true to the original. It could have been so much more. Nala could have given more speeches about misogyny, forced marriage, equality. We know lions are physically stronger than lionesses, but do we have to reflect reality? Nala should have been faster, stronger, smarter and featured much more than Simba. We should be educating our children that girls always come first. The male characters had WAY too much dialogue. Also, if Disney were serious, they wouldn't have human washed this film. They would have cast real lions and warthogs!Alternate view: This film is very true to the original. It's the first Disney movie in ages that hasn't pushed sexism onto our children. If you haven't seen the original, i'd recommend this version being superior because the cinematography is amazing and the story is almost identical. Some of the actors in this version are not as good (eg. Chiwetel as Scar was terrible as he was far too ""serious"" rather than devious and his singing was very poor. Timon and Pumba weren't funny. Shenzi was poorly acted: arrogant rather than sly and a scrounger like Whoopi Goldberg was in the original). But, the story maintained the heart and fondness from the original. If your children haven't seen the original, this one is worth watching.I found it enjoyable. Danny Glover was good (but the male singer in this version wasn't a patch on Jason Weaver from the original). This version doesn't stand in its own right, but it's an excellent remake. This film is politically correct free (meaning no sexism or racism). That alone makes is a cut above most modern Disney. Favreau should be commended for creating the most child friendly Disney movie since the Jungle Book remake.",The Lion King
228,theredsky,The Lion King (2019) Review,1,21 July 2019,"What a pathetic, unnecessary, crappy cash grab. Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film. I give The Lion King (2019) a 1/10.",The Lion King

233,martinpersson97,Fantastic remake!,10,17 July 2019,"I just watched this movie, as it was released two days prior to the world-wide release in Sweden, and I was blown away!The 1994 film (which rightfully substains a spot on IMDBs 250 list) is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've watched it many times growing up as well as an adult. This live-action adaptation manages to bring back the sense of fun, tragedy and hope that made the original such a masterpiece, as well as bringing some new things into the fold. You get a little more backstory for characters like Scar and Mufasa and whilst the film is mostly a faithful retelling of the original story, that was exactly what I expected personally, and that's not a bad thing at all in my opinion.I went to see this movie to experience the story of The Lion King in live-action with a new cast of fantastic actors as well as some of the best CGI I've ever seen, and that was exactly what this movie delivered.While I understand that some people might find the similarities to the original off-putting, I don't mind it at all. I don't watch these movies(Disney's Star Wars movies and Disney live action remakes) to see a whole new angle of the story, but rather as a homage to the movies I love.However, as stated above, there are some appreciated tweaks to the story that made it compelling. For example, the hyenas, who were mostly just comedic minions in the animated movie, are more fierce and terrifying foes in this, and their leader Shenzi manages to convey some threat in the first act of the movie and later retains the title of secondary antagonist.Some characters are a little different compared to their animated counterpart as well, most notable Scar, who in the original was more of a cunning and sly puppet-master, who, when it came to a fight, appeared to be somehwat of a coward. This version of the villain however is absolutely terrifying. He's still intelligent and manipulates people, but he also has more of a temper and won't shy away from a confrontation.The CGI, as I mentioned earlier, is absolutely fantastic. You can never tell that you aren't looking at real animals, and I am truly amazed at what is possible with todays technology.John Favreu truly outdid himself with this movie, and I say that about a man responsible for movies like Chef, Iron Man and the 2016 Jungle Book.To me, this movie might even be supperior the the original movie, which I love as well, but the way they cleverly retold the story in live-action whilst still adding their own touch might put this a little bit above.Truly a masterpiece, and I can't give it less than a 10 out of 10!",The Lion King

240,rcolgan,This new remake of Kimba the White Lion has some issues...,4,20 July 2019,"With the success of Faverau's Jungle Book and the leaps forward in CGI technology, it was only going to be so long before a Disney exec thought of doing a remake of their most successful film during the Disney Renaissance. But they were so preoccupied with whether they could recreate the Lion King almost shot for shot that they never stopped to think whether they should. The end result will undoubtedly be a massive money maker for Disney by capitalizing on the success of one of their greatest films, but it's also quite possibly the most creatively bankrupt film to come out this year.We all know the plot of the first film and this remake follows the original almost verbatim. So much of the dialogue is just taken word for word out of the original and many shots are so identical that I'm convinced that they just used stills from the original as storyboards. Other than one extra scene showing how Nala set off on her journey where she finds Simba and some extended sequences following some random animals unrelated to the plot, including an adept metaphor for the film where we're forced to watch a beetle pushing around a large piece of dung, there's very little here which departs from the original story.So if this does follow the original so closely then how did it turn out so bad? To start off with, as impressive as some of these photo realistic animations are this style wasn't well suited for the Lion King. Instead of having the expressionistic and lively characters from the original, we get these lions who are unable to emote and deliver on the films emotional moments. It's very difficult to connect with these characters since they just can't convey as much visually as the original was capable of and characters like Mufasa just don't resonate in the same way.The original animated films more minimalistic style also works to its advantage so that shots flow together smoother and allows for quicker edits because we are capable of reading all the information in a shot in a shorter amount of time. The heightened realism of this remake just isn't capable of doing this as it needs to hold on its shots just so we can absorb all the information on screen. Plus on a more simplistic level, the original animation just looks better. The epic scale of some of the shots in that film feel permanently engraved in my mind, but whilst the remake has me appreciate the effort and time that animators must have put in to these shots it just doesn't deliver on the same sense of awe it attempts to recreate from the original.Then there's the new cast and in spite of having a lot of great names attached to the film, it ends up feeling as if the characters are going through the motions of the story with little emotional weight. Very few of the performances are able to bounce off one another effectively and feel completely disconnected from their surroundings. This is with the exception of some of the comedic support like Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and John Oliver who were all entertaining. Though this is partly because these seemed to be the only characters where the actors brought their personalities to the role and felt like they delivered on some funny lines.But my biggest gripe of this film is it's complete lack of originality. Most of these remakes of Disney animated classics have copied the originals they were based on, but they all added at least something to the story. Even for as much as I disliked the live action Beauty and the Beast, they still made some attempts to improve characters like LeFou and tried to add their own ideas to how the curse works. But here they don't try to add anything substantially different to the characters or story, instead only adding new shots of the surrounding nature to show off the photo-realistic animation and pad out the films run-time.They even skip over some of the small moments that made the original film so incredible to begin with. One example is how they take out Rafiki's lesson about how the past can hurt and instead just cut to Simba running off to catch up with Nala. This is replaced by a montage of the two Lions running across the wild to a new Beyonce song, which feels completely out of place and was likely just added to the film so they could sell an extra Beyonce song on the films soundtrack.Ultimately the film just feels like a carbon copy of the original. It's like listening to someone speak the lyrics to a great song, all the words are there but it lacks the same beat which made the song connect with you to begin with. Whilst it's not necessarily the worst film of the year, but it is definitely the most pointless.",The Lion King
241,larosaj-26666,A pure masterpiece. Ignore the delusional critics,10,21 July 2019,As good and perhaps even better than the original. If you have common sense then you'll know going into the movie they can't put emotions on real live looking animals. The emotions are on the voice acting and they are perfect. Sure nobody can top Irons and some scenes are not as great ( the stampede for one ) but the score is just as hauntingly beautiful and the battle at the end is spectacularly better.

242,crosswalkx,"The Boring King with no emotion, how Disney ruined the greatest cartoon movie.",1,27 October 2019,"I have watched and read reviews online about The Lion King remake, when the Disney company announced a Lion King remake I wasn't as excited. I skipped going to see it in theaters and saw it on DVD.First of all I did actually like the scenery and the realistic looking 3D animated animals, I did like the songs and ""The Circle of Life"" opening song, but I was disappointed when the ""Be Prepared"" song was altered and didn't feature ""Can you feel the Love Tonight"" in the credits, but the music was amazing. With that said I want want to share my rant about this cash grab film which let me down.To the Disney company I remember back in 1994 when I seen this 2D animated movie in theaters and on VHS and DVD, I enjoyed it, I liked the color the visuals the facial expressions and special effects, I liked the cartoon characters, they were fun to watch and made me laugh.Fast forward to 2019 remake and what happened, they made it a cash grab. What happened to the emotions? where's Rafiki's walking stick? Where's the amazing song ""I just can't wait to be King"" where the animals stand on each other? Why is ""Be Prepared"" with having Scar just talking? What happened to the volcano geysers blowing up? Why isn't the stampede epic like the cartoon? Why aren't Timon and Pumbaa dancing to the beat of ""Hakuna Matata""? Or their dance song Hula song? Why is Can you feel the Love Tonight sung in the daytime? Why isn't the movie colorful? How come Elton John's song, Can you feel the Love Tonight is missing.This movie remake is awful, the colors were dark and depressing, the movie bored me to tears, I was bored the entire time, this reminded me of ""The Last Airbender"" movie. I didn't like how the lions showed no emotion at all especially Scar. The movie was too slow at times and didn't spend enough time on Simba.I'm very disappointed in the Disney animators, you have all of this amazing CGI technology and amazing looking birds, rodents, lions, other African animals and yet they show no emotion, just voice actors reading their scripts. This is very disappointing, they should've shown emotion like a CGI cartoon, take a look at the 2000 Disney movie ""Dinosaur"", you can still tell what they're feeling by looking at their faces. But in ""The Lion King"" 2019 you don't know what they're feeling. I can't believe people would go flock to the theaters to pay for this letdown CGI movie remake. This is soulless, dark and depressing along with the remakes of ""Beauty and the Beast"" 2017 (at least they had some emotion and a spectacular song ""Be our Guest""), and ""Dumbo"" 2019 (Although the ringleader was the only character I liked). Disney should've made it more fun like ""Cinderella"" 2015 or ""Aladdin"" 2019, those movie remakes were the ones I actually enjoyed watching.In the meantime I'm going back to watch the original 1994 2D cartoon which was memorable in every way. I will skip this boring remake and forget it ever existed and just get the soundtrack which is the only thing I liked about this film. Also I would rather watch a real nature documentary show about lions which is more interesting to watch than this boring movie. I would also watch ""Kimba the White Lion"" which is very funny to watch.",The Lion King

But the enormous production behind this works (we are still talking about Disney) makes the movie interesting for the eyes.

This started a role of films after with this lion king being the 13th film they've adapted to live-action.But the question is does the lion king live up to the animated film? to which im gonna say easy and no there is a certain area of the film that I thought kind of let the film down a bit but I will explain that in dislike, but let talk about the good things about this film.Visual this film is incredible with the Perfect CGI with all the spiece of animals across the plains that plays out a play by play of the original animated film, the cinematography of actually bring these moments to a lve action is breathtaking.The creator of the film have done an amazing job with the way the animal talk, it's like looking at a Real animal in real life talking in a natural way like they havent done stupid animation for the mouths, they keep the natural animal look and just given slight movement of the mouth when the animals talk, I think this is great and actually works for the film.From the trailer, I was a little concerned concerning Scar, not with the way he looks because I mean the way he looks was Perfect, its more the voicing. Scar had this Charismatic charm about him which Jeremy Iron voice was perfect for in the original animated movie when I saw the trailer Chiwetel Ejiofor was voice scar at first it showed a little off, but watching the film as a whole Chiwetel actually did a great job with the voice over which I was pleasantly surprised with as he does give this slight evil tone to the character.The return of one of the best actors ever in acting and voice-overs James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa character just wouldn't be the same without him, He has this Commanding powerful voice of a philosopher that I could listen to all day.Donald Glover voice over for Simba was brilliantly done, alone with Nala voiced by Beyoncé who has great chemistry with each other in the for the character as well a great singing voice. Few funny moments with Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) who scene was just like the animated film with a few tweaks here and there.I can't express this as much as I can this film Monumental Technical Achievement achieves with digitally Enivorment that David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is a jaw-droppingly photorealistic landscape and animal that looks so real you would believe that it's just a film.It's a film I can recommend watching.Dislikes: The Critical issue I have with this film is the Musical moments, they feel a little bit flat in the film where the animated film actually had better musical moments, I feel here the music could've been better done in this film.",The Lion King
247,mattrochman,"Pointless remake, strange average review score",2,23 July 2019,"This really was not worth making. The first one was a masterpiece, so the thinking behind a carbon copy with different performers and visuals is baffling.I might be in the minority, but the stage show did little for me - a lame remake. Somehow this film gives me the same feeling.when I flicked through hundreds of reviews on IMBD, I see that other reviewers are panning it beyond belief. How it is achieving an average score about 7 can only be explained by the number of people giving it an undeserving ""10"".Awaiting more original content rather than remakes. Some classics should simply be left untouched. They could do a bonanza remake of Mary Poppins with unbelievable effects, but redoing a historical masterpiece is unnecessary - as is the case with the Lion King.",The Lion King
248,wisemantonofski,Head Without the Heart,7,13 September 2019,"There's something fundamentally awe-inspiring in the level of digital detail on display here, from photo-real animals acting out a story we've all grown up with to lovingly intricate recreations of iconic shots from the animated classic, it's a landmark of computer generated effects as much as its predecessor was to hand drawn animation. However for all its artistry, the digital character models almost utterly fail to capture the raw emotion of their '94 counterparts, leaving a lot dependant on the delivery of dialogue which is oftentimes flat and lifeless; while odd choices on some of the film's best songs do more to hinder the flow of the narrative than complement it.",The Lion King

Only cons I feel is the voice overs, which are not as connecting & with emotions as they should have been.

I loved the animated version since childhood times & have watched it dozens of times. I'm going to watch it again this weekend. 😉 This is also good.",The Lion King
253,leoxatzian,Way too similar to the original for it's own good.,5,26 July 2019,"While ""The Lion King"" might be a better put together movie than most live action Disney remakes, it also doesn't take nearly as many chances as some others did. The CG-animation is undeniably gorgeous but it's realistic style doesn't capture the original's expressiveness, the musical numbers are either kept exactly the same or changed for the worst and while the voice cast is really talented and charming, they don't really bring anything new to the table. In conclusion, while it is a pretty good movie in its own right, it is just so insultingly similar to the original that it barely feels like a remake at all.",The Lion King
254,tmc-59064,I have some notes,2,27 July 2019,"Some things I liked that they changed, and some things were a travesty. The things I liked were the singing voices for simba, the realism, the lion sleeps tonight scene, and John Oliver as zazu (I cant stop laughing at the news joke cause of LWT). The realism added a scarier element, and had my heart racing and the floor was shaking with each roar.Things I hated:
A lot of emotion was just forgotten with lines we already know. ""Scar help me"" had NO CONVICTION. Sounded like he got a paper cut. I'll get to Timon and pumba later, but they had no real character so it felt bland. Scar had no emotion so it was hard when he said old lines (and again I'll cover him later).Timon is a guy white man. Seriously. Why. That was his character. Timon and pumba were like will and grace in the jungle with no personality. 
Scar in the cartoon was sassy and lively, and I personally liked him. He is one of my favorite villains. You enjoy watching him on screen and it sucks to see him be so evil, but you also like it in a way. You love to hate him. This scar? The voice is wrong. And he has...no personality. He's just...blah. This works for when he kills mufasa because you hate hate him, but it makes any scene with him boring or uncomfortable.WHAT DID YOU DO TO BE PREPARED?! Omg it's ruined. What is it, a spoken word song? Ugh it was painful to sit through.They cut a lot of rafiki out. All of his speeches, all of his crazy, and the main moral!...instead now you have a bunch of new characters in the oasis for some reason? Totally worth it. Totally.You gave Ed words and now he isn't funny. Seriously, none of the hyenas were funny. They also made it so that scar wasn't already in charge of them, which was a strange change that I can't decide if it was good or bad.What was that weird new song that has nothing to do with the movie that played while simba ran home? So many songs you could have played but you chose some weird song about spirit?Beyoncé as nala (rolling my eyes)All in all if this were the last live action ruining I'd be so happy. I'm sick of Disney taking my childhood and lazily plopping together remakes that make me feel bad. Mulan and the Little Mermaid are up next and they both will be bad if not worse than this. They just need to learn that we don't want change. Good idea, bad execution.",The Lion King
255,CountVladDracula,Very disappointing.,2,19 July 2019,Where do I begin? First there seems to be no passion. No heart. Much like Beauty and The Beast and the Aladdin remake I almost think it's a conscious effort to be subpar so that people will appreciate the originals more.The animals are supposedly photo-realistic but they barely look like they're actually there. At times Simba looks like he's floating. the movements are stiff and wooden.Be Prepared sounds like a 1960s beat poem that is only sung for the last few minutes.Can you feel the Love Tonight is sung in daylight...It's kind of awful.,The Lion King
256,NatashaJAmos2015,Ignore the haters!,9,15 July 2019,Honestly don't bother reading their negative reviews. The only thing I didn't like was the voice of Scar and no Be Prepared song. The original was much better. Otherwise I'd give it 9/10 stars.,The Lion King
257,ninjaboyballer,Decent remake,7,19 July 2019,This movie in my opinion doesn't beat the original. But you cannot sent the technical brilliance of this movie. From the animals and the backgrounds and the settings everything looks beautiful. It looks realistic is what I'm saying. And all the vocal performances were really solid. James Earl Jones once again is a beacon of hope as Mufasa and I really loved him. And Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Pumba and Timon were really good as well. I even liked Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar even though he is no Jeremey Irons. Although this film feels like a repeat of the original with a few parts added in there. But is just feels the same. Overall this film has amazing visuals and a good voice cast but it feels like the original but in live actionFinal rating: 7.2/10,The Lion King
258,gamerz-18042,"Amazing visuals, subdued performance",7,10 August 2019,"The original was my favourite Disney film.
Sadly in this remake some moments were modified for worse and the film's script felt choppy.Interactions between the characters feel slightly robotic at times, the voice actors could have been better. Seth Rogan was the best part.The script is simplified at times and parts of the original movie are watered down.The father clouds scene was a major let down. Nala's introduction to Simba as an adult is ridiculous.Overall the CGI is great, but the execution of key moments fail multiple times.",The Lion King
259,trevorwomble,"Technically proficient, visually stunning yet strangely soulless",6,21 July 2019,"I can see a LOT of effort went into this remake. Cutting edge technology and a talented voice cast, nice direction and a great sountrack. But unfortunately despite all this, I felt it didn't hold a candle to the 25 year old original.Part of the problem is that I felt it stuck too closely to the original rather than expand upon it. At times it was almost a scene for scene remake and that was a major issue as they were too similar. Sure, stick to the story of the original but at times this was incredibly predictable because it was so close. Even many of the gags and a lot of the dialogue was lifted ad verbatim from the original and I felt it took away from an otherwise impressive effort.The screenwriters should have added their own flourishes whilst keeping in some of the crowdpleasing moments from the 1994 version. Granted the film contains the great songs from the original, albeit it done in different styles, but i'm afraid I felt a little underwhelmed at times. As wonderful actor as Chiwetel Ejiofor is, I badly missed Jeremy Irons memorable turn as the voice of Scar complete with that menacing delivery, although at least Jon Favreau had the common sense to keep the wonderful James Earl Jones (now 88 years old!) as Mufasa to give it some of the class of the original. Some of the other recasting has been well done (John Oliver as Zazu for one captures the essence of the Rowan Atkinson turn on the original).I really wish I could have rated this higher but I can't but help compare it to the fabulous original and think this is a pale imitation that should have been allowed to take it's own path to bring something different t the table.",The Lion King

263,felipepm17,Lion King,7,25 July 2019,"I'll start with the best part: Timon and Pumba are fantastic. Now I want a whole movie just of them.
The cast was well selected and I feel that Beyoncé and Child Gambino don't bring anything special to the characters, any voice actor that can sing would do the same job. Beyoncé's original song didn't amaze me too, the song is beautiful but doesn't blend well with the rest of the movie.",The Lion King

I also like that they used a diverse cast, so defo extra props for that. I think it's worth mentioning that I watched the original a very long time ago, so I'm not comparing them; and I feel that a lot of these negative reviews are comparing it to the original.",The Lion King
265,stefstars,Nice but not quite there,4,22 July 2019,"The visual effects are great with this one. At some point it does feel like you're basically just watching a nature documentary, that's good in terms of the visual department but bad when it comes to the story. This adaptation doesn't live up to the 1994 classic.
While the casting was great, with the exception of Scar - feel like in this one, Scar lost what made him a memorable character and just became the typical ""bad guy doing bad guy things"" and who evidently can't sing his iconic villain song; this was probably the most disappointing part of this film. There wasn't as much as an emotional impact as it's predecessor.
Prior to seeing the film I had read the complaints about the cgi animals looking emotionless and at the time felt that it wouldn't be that big of a deal, boy was I wrong. That really took away from some of the most powerful parts of this film (i.e: Mufasa's death and when his soul visits Simba by the river) the emotional impact was missing. At the end of it all, you're left feeling empty, really.
I liked the casting for Timon and Pumba, these two worked wonderfully and made me laugh. The same for the two hyenas as well, they were enjoyable. Rafiki was good too, as well as the two young actors who brought young Simba and young Nala back to life. Still, it wasn't enough to let this production shine as bright as the animated version. It's not that bad of an adaptation but it's definitely not great either. It's definitely just a nostalgic cash grab, they would have been fine just re-releasing the original into theaters again. In fact they would have been better off doing that.",The Lion King
266,irishboy141,A worthless rehash,1,12 July 2019,"The direction is flat and without style or substance, most likely due to the constrictive nature of having the entire movie be ""photorealistic"" CGI.The environments themselves are dull and shallow, it really shows off how excellent the original 2D animated one was in it's colorful settings and inventive musical/dance numbers. In this imitation whenever a song plays here we just have realistic (and sometimes terrible/rubbery looking) animals jogging along a boring, drab jungle.Most of the characters are hollow shells of their original counterparts, especially Scar. Instead of being a sleek lion (expertly voiced by Jeremy Irons) who chews the scenery , and genuinely loves being evil; Now he's just some dirty/malnourished looking lion who sounds like some random guy off the street. Not intimidating in the slightest.I don't really have much else to say... It's the typical modern Disney cash grab remake; they use the same plot with minor alterations, with ""live action"" slapped on it as some sort of gimmick to get the dumb popcorn chewing masses into the theater. It's the visual equivalent of highly processed pig slop, it is to art what drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa is (the same thing, but slightly altered).",The Lion King
267,Harry_Gleeson,Disappointing...,5,1 July 2020,"Pros:The visual effects are astounding, very documentary like.The songs, even though they don't hit emotionally like the original songs did, are heart-warming because hey... it's the 'Lion King'ConsWell... I don't want to sound too harsh but I didn't particular like the voice actors who played the respective characters. Donald Glover is clearly a talent, but for me him voicing Simba never settled with me. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar echoed a similar feeling put of me, even Seth Rogan as Pumba.. and that surprised meLike a few of the Disney 're imaging's' that have already been released such as 2019's 'Aladdin' I just felt this version of the 'Lion King lacked the heart. It was never going to replace the original but I just couldn't help but take this view away from the filmI thought many scenes were very cheesy and over actedOverall, I thought this version of the 'Lion King' lacked many aspects that the original gave to us. While I very much appreciated the aesthetically pleasing visuals of the film, like I previously mentioned, I thought many scenes were very much over acted and the voice actors attached their roles were not the right ones in my eyes. I've watched this twice now and hoped it would be better second time round, unfortunately not.Quote - Everything you see - exists together in a delicate balance. While others search for what they can take, a true king searches for what he can give.Score - 5/10",The Lion King

274,shweta-51657,Goosebumps throughout the film,8,11 February 2020,"Let me say first off, the 1994's version is the epitome of my childhood. I would cry every time the wildebeest scene would come (like all of you did too, I am sure), the music shaped my childhood, the beloved characters I recognise as my own friends. The backyard of Pride Rock is where I played and grew up. The 1994 movie is one of the first clear memories of my childhood. My father bought the LCD (laser disks for you Gen-Zs and Millennials who dont remember this relic from the 90s) and after it became obsolete, the VHS copy which we still have, safely tucked away somewhere, collecting dust. I was a year old when the movie came out, yet my father's pride in his LCD sound system resulted in the Lion King being played quite frequently on the weekends at my house. I remember my elder brother crying and running to the kitchen so he wouldnt see the wildebeests in that pivotal scene.What I am trying to tell you is The Lion King holds a very special place in my heart. And I was very very worried on hearing it was to be remade. What I feared worst was a repeat of Ghostbusters. Thankfully this isnt the case here. When I heard Jon Favreau was behind the helm, I felt we could all rest easy, he wouldnt botch it up and he didnt! He understood what it was to stay true to the real spirit and magic of the film and still take advantage of modern technology to only make the film experience better.This movie from start to finish, was a sensory experience of unbelievable proportions. Goosebumps from the opening scene, right until the end. The music, oh my god. The music! They have stayed true to the original versions and still managed to incorporate music from the original African roots. I loved the life John Oliver, Seth Rogen, Beyonce gave the characters through just their voices. So grateful that James Earl Jones, the one true king, was able to lend his voice to bring to life the majesty and regality of Mufasa. Have to say Chiwetel Ejiofor did not bring the magic to Scar the way Jeremy Irons did. If anything thats my only complaint.The visuals, oh my god.. The magic of animated version was brought to life so remarkably, it takes your breathe away. Imagine revisiting your favourite childhood haunts as an adult, with every vague and hazy memory brought to life with such vivid colours and detail, you cant imagine how the artists did it. And the music.. the new versions by Hans Zimmer will have you singing along and bopping your foot and still catch you by surprise.Dont listen to the haters, the movie is a treat and a trip down childhood for all us 90s kids.",The Lion King
275,ajzeg,Ah. My arch-nemesis in the form of a movie. We meet at last.,1,13 October 2020,"This movie is a travesty. Don't watch it. I would just like to leave it at that, but I guess I'll elaborate. I guess first I will address the photo-realistic CGI elephant in the room, the animation. Not live-action, there's only one live-action shot in the entire movie. This is an animated film. And the animation is technically some of the most impressive ever put to screen. Seriously, this makes Life of Pi look like Madagascar by comparison. It was absolutely mesmerizing to watch...when the animals weren't talking. Whenever they were talking, it was awkward and laughably bad at times. What everyone has been saying is true, realistic animals cannot convey the emotions necessary for a story like this on their faces. In some scenes, I actually had trouble telling the characters apart or even understanding what was going on in the scene because of the lack of emotion on the characters' faces. That's a huge problem. I think Zazu got it the worst. Seriously, the animatronic birds in the Enchanted Tiki Room are more expressive than he is in this film! His face is frozen in a permanent frown, just like the real bird he's based on. The design does not fit the personality of the character at all. Same goes for most of the other characters. They were just off-putting. Speaking of the characters, how is the voice acting? While the film does feature a (mostly) talented cast, the dialogue in this movie is beyond awkward and the line delivery is just awful. I don't know how they possibly messed that up, but they found a way! It's very stilted and unnatural. The line delivery coupled with the characters' faces made me laugh out loud during Mufasa's death scene. Funniest thing I've seen in a movie all year. It's so bad, it's good! Look up the scene on YouTube, you'll be in for a laugh! As for the story, it's exactly the same as the original except they really nerfed the hyenas. They weren't funny and they weren't scary. They were boring. Eric André and Keegan-Michael Key are absolutely wasted in this movie. They also cut out the best song, Be Prepared, and cut most of Rafiki's interaction with Simba, the best scene! As for the comedy, it was just boring at best and absolutely obnoxious at worst. I'm not the biggest fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I'll take the originals over these guys any day! Literally all of their jokes are self-referential. Sometimes the jokes don't even make sense unless you've seen the original, which you really should not do in a remake! As for the music, the score is just as amazing as the original but the songs are pretty bad, honestly. I already did a whole post about it months ago so I'll try not to repeat myself, but they are either butchered, cut, shoehorned in, copied or copy-pasted! The new Beyoncé song especially sticks out like a sore thumb. Many of the most memorable scenes from the original are dumbed-down and heavily simplified to make them more realistic, I guess, but it just goes to show how traditional animation is the only medium this film can work in. In the 1940s, Disney was experimenting with giving the characters in Bambi a more realistic look. They decided against it and made them more stylized because the characters were not expressive enough to convey the emotions of the story. They knew doing something like this was a bad idea in the 40s! This movie is a mistake! I think that's all I have to say about this movie. It's just bad. Nothing about it works as a film. Just look up the opening scene on YouTube. That will give you just as much enjoyment as you would get from watching the whole movie. But yet again, just like Aladdin, it seems like most people disagree with me and love this movie. It's actually now the highest-grossing animated film of all-time. I can't even get angry at this movie anymore. It just makes me sad. Is this what Disney has become? What was once the company that defined the industry with their creative new takes on classic stories is now just regurgitating their old movies for profit? That just depresses me, honestly. Oh how the mighty have fallen. Oh well. At least Mulan looks kind of cool. Anyway, that's all I have to say about this piece of crap. Don't bother, just watch the original. That's what I'm going to do, and I'm never going to think about this movie again.",The Lion King
276,plex,Why?,2,29 January 2020,"Well, we know why. MONEY. Other than that, this was a waste of resources. The hand-drawn version was vastly superior, it had more soul.
This version plods along and is poorly paced. The dialogue is sub-standard.
The script is simple and slowly delivered.
This is strictly a young-child's fare.
A lot of people praised the original music score. I was NOT one of them, Elton (sorry, SIR Elton) hasn't done anything of merit since Rock of the Westies. Famous names don't impress me, great scores do, and the underscore sounds phoned in.
The lead vocals in the circle of life are horrendous.
I didn't hear much sound design or foley, they just used the VI East Meets West Hollywood Choir and Strings libraries to cover things up.
Does it look good? Of course its does. It's Disney after all, and Favreau is in full stride theses days. The CGI and art direction are immaculate, top notch.
I know the story, but 10 minutes-in, I was bored.",The Lion King
277,Benslie,Disney should just STOP making Live action remakes,5,21 July 2019,"First of all, the special effects in this film are outstanding and you can see all of the effort that went into it. All of the animal's act like their actual animal counterparts if you saw them in the wild. Timon, voiced by Billy Eichner, and Pumbaa, voiced by Seth Rogen, stole the show in their scenes. They both were perfectly casted and brought some of the humour in this film. For the rest of the cast, I can't really say the same thing. Don't get me wrong Donald Glover/Childish Gambino, who voices adult Simba, and Beyoncé, who voices Nala, did decent enough jobs with their parts and I could easily hear them with their parts but others just needed a change in casting. My main problem with the casting was with Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar I just couldn't hear him as the villain. Trust me I tried to forget about Jeremy Irons but I just couldn't. Jeremy Irons made this character iconic for a reason and I feel like if they got somebody else it would have been a bit better. This film added forty extra minutes on to the run time, probably to show off the effects, but you can feel it especially when they change something or add something in. For me, this happened at the ending where they changed not just one of the funniest scenes but also made a scene longer than it should have been. The songs in this version just didn't give off the same spectacle as in the original version. The original used the sets and lighting to help bring you into the numbers this one has nothing to make you interested in them. At certain points, the lighting would change for no reason. What I mean is that it would be Day time and then just a couple of seconds later it would be dark. But hey, at least we have another great score by Hans Zimmer. In the end, The Lion King (2019) just doesn't live up to the original. If nothing else is showing and you need to beat the heat this summer than go ahead and check it out but if not just stay home and watch the 1994 one. I give The Lion King (2019) a 5.5/10.",The Lion King
278,christophershobris,Do I feel the love tonight?,9,27 July 2019,"Oh I just can't wait to see it again!! Wow, this film was marvelous. Was as great as the original film? No, but guess what? It doesn't have to be. The film isn't perfect obviously, no film is. However, here's what I liked about this film. Firstly, the visuals are outstanding and spectacular. The visual effects crew did a great job making me feel like I was in the African savanna, with every footstep and splash of water I was entranced by the world that was created. Next, my favorite character from the original film was to many people's surprise is...not Mufasa, not Scar, not Simba, Timon, Zazu, or Pumbaa, it is Nala. However I felt she was a bit underused in the original film, but not here. They improved on not just her, but all of the female characters. Sarabi has more to do, Shenzi is more menacing, and even Sarafina (Nala's mom) has more lines. Continuing on Nala individually, I thought Beyoncé was perfect for her voice, capturing the power, elegance, and majesty she possesses. She as an adult and cub both were enhanced and I was enjoying every minute she was on screen. So I thought they executed wonderfully on the female characters especially Nala. Lastly, I think the story was well done. It wasn't an exact replica of the original, and it didn't mess with the original story too much to where it became destructive and disruptive. Favreau added a bunch of smartly placed new elements as well that kept the film his own. Just like he did with The Jungle Book. Here's what I has issues with. There is one thing I notice with Favreau is...while he is a great director he isn't generally great with the songs. I know he doesn't actually write the songs and sings them but he does control how he wants the songs portrayed hence being the director. He isn't great with that, he struggled with that in The Jungle Book, and he struggled here. All the songs save for Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight were poorly done. The one that I think was the weakest was Be Prepared. While Chiwetel Ejiofor is a fabulous actor he didn't sing very well in this song, maybe he is a talented singer but this was not his day. He was actually a good Scar while not singing. The song itself felt rushed and too short. Lastly, my biggest pet peeve I have with The Lion King as a whole both here and in the original is I don't care for the whole 'Pumbaa has a flatulence problem.' These writers (from the original, so this is more their fault) did such a good job coming up with wonderful, iconic moments in the film whether it's The Wildebeest Stampede, Mufasa's Ghost, The Elephant Graveyard, and many more, yet they could come up with something a better reason for why Pumbaa is an outcast rather than just flatulence. It's the most childish aspect of the whole film, and way out of place with the rest of the film. So if you have this in the original film, of course you've gotta have it in the remake as well, except they put more influence on it. When it came to that part of film I just looked away because it felt so out of place. It's not 100% their fault but for me, they should have edited it out entirely or not at all. Overall, this film was very enjoyable and for somebody who was born the same year the original film was released in 1994, and having watched it since I could walk and talk, this was a treat, and a relief for me considering the other critics giving it a hard time. I'm glad I am on the side that loved it. 8.4/10",The Lion King
279,KathleenK22,People are regurgitating reviewers,8,25 July 2019,"'Don't copy the original!' 'Keep to the Original!'
And on it goes, people spruiking what they hear and see by the professional reviewers.
I took my husband along today and warned him it was a remake, and basically the same, so he is did not go in with predetermined notions of wha it would be. I thought he probably won't like it, thinking it is a kiddy movie. It was not a small child's movie anyway.
Visually beautiful, with the natural beauty of Africa, and appropriate for the world we have been affecting. Sounds of Africa in the music and using the language of Africa. The music is the first thing my husband commented on.
The animals are so real and could be the actual African animals except we know they are not.
So what have we so far, beautiful cinematography and amazing music with the drums of Africa.
So, where's the problem? There is nothing or little that is new. That would have been deliberate. Empowering the female lion and making her more expressive, of course also deliberate. It is not a cartoon and less expression on the faces of the animals but it NOT a cartoon.
Judging a movie on what's it is not or does not even purport to be is not rational.
Have we become so jaded that we grade something on what we think it should be. It is a creation of its creators and they have made the movie they intended to be.
The animals are representations of people, some evil, some good, some funny, but all as intended by these particular creators.
I felt emotion that had been tapped before in the original. The music did that. The innocence of the cubs did as well. The beauty of the landscape did as well.
The message is the same...the circle of life. We are all connected.",The Lion King
280,Amthermandes,Unnecessary,3,24 July 2019,"The CGI remake of arguably Disney's most popular movie of all time was a bullseye in animation, and a floppy miss in everything else. Disney wanted to create a ""realistic"" adaptation of the original 1994 film, so they spend a whopping sum on the CGI effects, as well as the cast. When comparing to the original (because that is inevitable), the original is like a large fruitbowl of a wide selection of fruits in all sorts of striking colors and shapes, whereas this remake is a plain rice cake. With few very (and one specific) exceptions, the voice talent was atrocious, with Zazu and the hyenas being the utmost worst. It seemed like most of the actors were just reading straight from the script for the first time. The voices in the original were all unique and brimming with character, but many voices in this 2019 version were simply bland and forgettable.The script and dialogue felt like it couldn't make up its mind whether to stick to the original script or go in a new direction, making the flow feel rushed and confusing. The musical performances felt like neighboring countries had filed noise complaints against the characters, and Scar's ""song"" was just pathetic (for the record, in the original performance of ""Be Prepared,"" the hyenas' march wasn't a rendition of a Nazi formation; it's a MILITARY march, to give the mass of hyenas the feel of an oppressive army, NOT a direct reference to the Nazi regime specifically). Almost every single joke added in, that wasn't in the 1994 movie, fell as flat as Zazu at the end of the original's version of ""I Can't Wait to be King."" Our theater was silent through most jokes. And with this version being more ""realistic,"" emotion and character expression was completely nonexistent.All in all, even if you're a huge fan of the original (who isn't?), this should be a hard pass.Originally wanted to give it a lower score, but a 4 is more deserving because the animation was incredible, and there were a couple good moments that differed from the original story (LOVED Timon & Pumbaa singing ""The Lion Sleeps""). Additionally, it's good Beyonce didn't have as prominent a role, but that's just personal opinion.",The Lion King

Watching the newest Lion King feels like I'm watching the Discovery Channel, as the scene and animals are incredibly lifelike, but that is also the problem, all the silliness of the original was taken out just so the film could be more of a visual masterpiece.

What we got was the same exact plot and story and somehow this was worse than the original, how thats possible is easy to spot. Having a star studded cast never guarantees anything as this ensemble completely lacked any heart worth mentioning and the characters just don't mix, theres absolutely no chemistry. The effects are on point without question but at no point did i ever feel any sort of connection with the characters on screen. Sad that they severely hindered the possibilities that could have been but forcing themselves in a box like that. Unfortunately these live-actions are hit or miss as heart seems nonexistent at times and they appear to be cash grab claims by Disney.",The Lion King
284,blackwidowis7cool,"Nothing new, but still an excellent movie",10,21 July 2019,"Two days ago, late afternoon, I went to the theaters to see The Lion King remake in 3D. Now, I haven't been to the theaters since Happy Feet, so going to the theaters was a new and unusual experience for me. And The Lion King is the very first movie that I have seen in 3D - so that was also quite an experience.
Before the actual movie started there were ads and a couple of trailers for upcoming Disney and Disney/Pixar movies - Onward and Frozen II. I saw the trailer's in 3D and it was so amazing!! I had already seen the trailer for Frozen 2 on the computer but to see it in depth and louder sound was so amazing! Well worth it and now I officially can't wait for the movie to come out! There were one or two times in the Onward trailer that I had to remind myself not to duck when a dragon came running ""towards"" the screen. Again, I had never seen anything in 3D before.
Anyway, then the movie started.
Oh, my!
I could tell from the very first shot that this movie will be a visual treat.
This movie is pretty much the same as the original one, so I won't go into the plot. There was a couple added-in scenes, and slight changes to stuff such as actions and lines, etc., but otherwise, it is still basically the same as the original.
And I don't care.
I love this movie!!
I strongly urge you to see this in 3D. It is sooo worth it to see it in depth. There were a few times where I had to remind myself not to swat the bugs away as they weren't really there in the theater. Whenever a bird flew around on screen, it really looked as if it flew into the screen. It was absolutely an unforgettable and amazing experience! I would love to see other movies (such as Frozen 2) in 3D.
While it lacked the humour and comedy of the original, I actually really liked and appreciated how more serious and darker the remake is. Of course, there was humour (such as the live bait scene - they make it different, but so much better than the original), but it was overall much more serious than the 1994 movie.
Regarding the songs, I'll tell you now if you want to see it but are concerned about what they do to the songs - Be Prepared is in the remake despite what the filmmakers claimed. It's just a shorter version with the wording changed slightly. While I love the original song, I also really enjoyed this new version of it.
All the original songs are still there - such as Can You Feel The Love Tonight?; The Circle of Life; and I Just Can't Wait To Be King. And still just as fun to listen to. There is a new song sung by Beyonce (I think I spelt her name correctly). And it's really good.
They made some slight changes to Scar - don't worry, he's still the cold, power hungry, calculating lion that he is in the original - except he's not comic. He's a much more serious Scar. More scary and darker. While I love Jeremy Irons' comic Scar, I also really love how Chiwetel Ejiofor made him more serious and darker. More psychological. In fact, I think I enjoy Ejiofor's performance better than Irons'.
I also enjoy how Nala has a much bigger role in this movie. Beyonce does a really, really good job as Nala and really brings her to life. Nala is much more headstrong and independent and I really love some of her lines - especially one particular one in the climax.
I also really loved the added detail of Scar trying to get Sarabi as his queen after becoming king. I had been wondering if they would do that when I went to see the movie and was pleased that they did. It's much more real and I totally loved the scenes where she rebukes his advances. Really cool!
Timon and Pumbaa are still just as great and comic as ever. Really enjoyed their scenes.
Another bonus to seeing this in theaters was that the sound was louder. Listening to the music and roars with louder sound was so thrilling!
I really enjoyed how more tense and suspenseful it was - especially in the climax. Excellently done!
There was one jump scare that I did not expect. And seeing it in 3D caused my to literally jump sideways in my seat, trying to duck. (My Grandma did as well, in my defense).
Even though I have seen the original several times and own it on dvd, seeing the remake with how well done it is, it was like I was seeing the Lion King's story for the first time. My eyes were wide the whole time the movie was playing in utter wonder and amazement - and I'm not ashamed to admit that.
A really exciting and excellent movie that I strongly recommend you go see in the theaters now - so worth it. And see it in 3D!!!",The Lion King

288,WooderIce64,A Visual Spectacle - That's About It.,7,22 July 2019,"The Lion King is possibly the crown jewel of Disney animation, being considered one of, if not the, best in the Disney lineup, and also making nearly $1 billion in 1994, which was unheard of at the time. Given that the remakes have been extremely profitable, having Lion King come up was inevitable. Unlike the others, though, this is practically a shot-by-shot remake of the 1994 movie. The only changes are very slight, with very little being added. Therefore, the story and characters aren't changed at all to any extent. While it's true that there's very little in the way of originality, it's still a great story and these are still the great characters we know and love. After all, the original isn't beloved for no reason.This movie has one major saving grace: it is also easily one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. It's up there with the likes of Avatar and Life of Pi. The levels of realism put into everything in this movie - the animals, the beautiful landscapes, the plants, everything about it is incredible. The downside is that CGI animals, while they do look fantastic, do not connect to the human audience the way the animated characters do. Take Mufasa's death for instance. In the 1994 movie, it's one of the all-time saddest movie deaths. Here, the emotional impact is largely drained because these lions don't emote the way humans do. That, and we all see it coming. It's partially made up for with the talented voice cast, but it's not enough to save it.The cast is full of all-stars. Donald Glover is Simba, Beyonce is Nala, and James Earl Jones returns to play Mufasa, which is awesome. The songs are there, for the most part. Circle of Life is great as always, Can You Feel the Love Tonight and Hakuna Matata are classics, and I Just Can't Wait to be King was reinvented, taking out the stuff that only works in a cartoon. Be Prepared got nerfed, which sucks because that song's awesome. There's a new one called Spirit. After all, you don't hire Beyonce just to give her one song, right? Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score, kept from the original, is severely underrated.Lion King is a movie that I'm glad I saw in theaters, if only for the visual effects. If it doesn't win the Oscar for visual effects, that's a disappointment. I wish I had seen it in IMAX or something like that. Aside from that, it's just the same story we've known and loved for the last 25 years. And, I must admit, having been born in the late 90's, it was pretty cool to see that opening shot on the big screen. After all, these movies are made for 90's and 00's kids as much as today's kids.",The Lion King

290,eparazak,"The Lion King 2019 can be compared to an unsharpened pencil, as in they're both pointless.",3,23 July 2019,"The Lion King 2019 is the live-acion remake of the 1994 animated movie of the same name. It is directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us The Jungle Book in 2016, goode start so far. This movie tells the tale of a young lion named SImba who is destined to be king after his father Mufasa, and the journey he goes through to become king in the process.I'm gonna be upfront, tis movie is a prime example of pointless. It doesn't need to exist at all and I have my reasons for saying that. For starters, the plot is a total rehash of the original animated film. Nothing of substance has been added to the film, and the stuff that is new is just useless padding. They didn't try to add in anything that could propel the film, I mean I'd be happy if we got some character depth from Scar. If you've seen the original Lion King, you've basically know what happens in this movie. Heck, there are several instances where lines from the script have been totally copy-and-pasted from the original movie. Second, all throughout watching this, I kept asking myself ""Why was this re-made in live-action?"". I asked this because remaking a movie who's only characters are animals is totally unnecessary. In order to add the animals in, they'd need to utilize CGI or train them. This movie is just CGI animals plastered on live-action backgrounds, and the CGI characters are expressionless. It was necessary for the original Lion King to be animated in order to showcase the characters' body language and facial expression properly, it works in that movie as they have the power to move people 25 years later. With this movie, I couldn't feel any emotion because you can't see it in their faces. The movie wants to focus on being realistic all-around that it doesn't think outside the box with the CGI.Are there any good qualities that this movie has? Well, yes, it has some good to it. I think that the shots of the movie are beautiful looking, and I thought that the CGI animators did a good job with animating any animals that weren't the ones that were the main focus. I thought that Hans Zimmer's score was great here, like usual. FInally, I thought that the voice acting was good, mostly. There is some great talent here and I think most of it was used well, such as Seth Rogen as Pumba, and Donald GLover as adult SImba. However, I think some of the other actors could have done a better job with what they were given, such as the voice actor for Scar, where he could've given him a more intimidating voice.Despite all the talent on display here, The Lion King 2019 fails to be good with its re-hashed story, wasted script and overly-realistic CGI. Sadly, Disney knows that this formula of remaking classics works because it's bringing in cash, and seemingly satisfying audiences. If you hate this decision like I do, then by all means vote with your wallet and don't go see Disney live-action remakes like this.3/10",The Lion King

292,ernestsavesxmas,The epitome of unoriginality,2,4 December 2019,"In the lead-up to this film's release there was a semi-viral piece of marketing from one of the late-night TV shows. It was a side-by-side comparison of ""Hakuna Matata,"" the 1994 animated version vs. the 2019 remake. It was shocking how much more appealing the original seemed. This... was not the point apparently.When the movie began, my daughter groaned. She thought this was supposed to be a cartoon. For someone her age who pays such close attention to commercials/ads (it's troubling), I was shocked she didn't know what she was in for. This paragraph doesn't have much to do with the review, sorry.How unnecessary and blatantly anti-creativity are these live-action remakes! I don't have much else to say! Disney could have just done a re-release of the original and still made bank at the box office (with zero production costs), right? Enough. It would be one thing if they built off the original characters/story and took it someplace new. But this pitch was essentially: It's Simba but also Childish Gambino, and all the animals are real but also fake. The songs are exactly the same only worse. Yuck. Yuck Yuck Yuck. 1,000 times Yuck.In Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories (2017), Dustin Hoffman's character is fond of saying ""it's my protest, like McEnroe,"" referencing the tennis great's proclivity for protesting points during matches.

294,Martinito_08183,Disney continues to be more unoriginal than ever.,3,7 November 2019,"This is it. This is the movie that i was questioning its existence and it's the remake that nobody asked for at all. It also proves that Disney are so disrespectful to their classical 2D animated movies and personally: it dishonors their origin as a studio and as a company. Now they have become the biggest corporate company in the world and care more about money than anything else.I get angry, when i hear that there are people, who defend these remakes and make excuses for them, which is very dumb and at the same time - it scares me that some prefer them more than the original animated movies. If i hear again the ""They can be taken more seriously, because they're live-action"" nonsense - i'll definitely going to lose my mind. If you think the same way like everyone else, then you don't know that there are animated movies that are made for adult audience and many that still have dark moments, even when the animation look very silly.The only positives that i can give to ""The Lion King (2019)"" is the sound and the CGI animation. There are many moments that the CGI animation is jaw-dropping, but unfortunately it's not perfect, since we still haven't reached that point yet and you can still tell that everything isn't real, except the environments, which looks fantastic. There is no denying that the CGI artists did a fantastic job, but sadly their hard work and talent was wasted by this movie that doesn't have a heart or a soul in it.""The Lion King (2019)"" may be better than ""Aladdin (2019)"", but that doesn't mean that i'll watch it again. If i have to choose between this and the original 2D animated movie from 1994: i'll always choose the original, because it's a timeless movie that can be enjoyed by every generation and the animation will always hold up no matter what happens. I'm sorry, but i don't want to support these movies at all and for that - i'll never going to watch anymore of these Disney remakes, that will be released in the future, since there is no point to them. It's very sad that now when i google ""The Lion King"" on the Internet it will always show me the remake first and not the original 1994 version.P.S.

And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.The original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it ""Live-Action"", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.
I was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!The Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.The movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!The casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!The movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.The Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!I'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of the original Lion King.

296,Wikkid_Gamez,What is with the bad reviews???,10,18 July 2019,"I mean seriously?
It's impossible to make people happy! Its hard to turn something into live action and change things around to fit into the live action area. Half of these 1* ratings are just angry in general because they don't like what Disney is doing with their animated features because they think that they are too close to the original or because they love the originals too much and don't want them remade. Then the other half of the 1* ratings are because they changed things and they are not word for word exactly like the originals.....
Disney has done it all, so now they are focused on turning their wonderful animated features into live action movies. I personally absolutely LOVE what they have been doing!!! All of them, we have been collecting them all as well can through the Disney Movie Club... My kids have absolutely loved them as well, and it has been nice to have a few movies this summer (mostly Disney) that I have been able to take them to see. My daughter and I are especially looking forward to The Little Mermaid!!!
As far as I am concerned they can remake all of their animated features and we will see them all and collect them to add to all the animated features we have collected (which is all of them). The basic stories of most have been the same with some change to the details line wise (I have the animated movies memorized at this point and the movies do differ a tad in detail) ... A couple have deviated a bit i.e. Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty) and Dumbo, but they are all wonderful and we have loved all of them so far including Aladdin, The Lion King and my absolute favorite Beauty and the Beast.
I absolutely LOVE that James Earl Jones returned as Mufasa... I do wish Jeremy Irons had returned as Scar, but it is what it is. Still loved it.

Basically everyone's favorite Disney movie.There's no point on telling the story, it's all rehashed from the original movie. Not much to say other than the small changes. Mainly from certain scenes like when the hyenas called Pumbaa chubby instead of a pig where it was actually funny and the whole scene of this disgusting ball thing getting, ok never mind. We also hear Pumbaa say ""And then I got downhearted everytime that I farted"" during the ""Hakuna Matata"" musical number. The story is rehashed and it's does it fairly.The animation looks very realistic and captures nice shots of the live action footage in Africa. The lions and other animals do have very realistic designs, but they are definitely too realistic and as everyone says they do lack emotions. You can't really feel a character much in this movie since they don't show any emotion here. Also Pumbaa looks kind of bad, he's not even close to his colors and, he looks kind of scary for younger kids.The voice acting alright I guess. Nothing special at all and sounds less like the original. Yet Mufasa's voice actor did reprise his role surprisingly and I honestly wasn't expecting his return for a live action remake, which kind of ruins the whole point, but I don't know honestly. It seems strange. Simba and Nayla sound good. Zazu sounds okay I guess. Scar sounds a little below meh. Pumbaa's voice is probably the worst though, he sounds too far from Ernie Sabella. Timon sounds fine. The hyenas sounds okay. And Rafiki is fine as well. The voice acting is all just meh.The songs have really good instrumental, but the singing honestly sucks even for the voice actors. The songs sound nothing like the first film unfortunately, especially Hakuna Matata, my favorite song and sounds totally off with the new singing. These are great songs with poor performances sadly.The Lion King remake is all just meh to me. Not good or really THAT bad, I mean they atleast didn't change the story like they did in Dumbo with Tim Burton as the director and the animation definitely goes live action. But it's definitely full of flaws thag downgrade the experience.Story: 7/10

298,seige-hound,"Doesn't Do Enough to Distinguish Itself, Most Changes it Does Make Are Bad",5,22 July 2019,"I give this one a 5/10 because it is mostly the same great movie from the 90's. Aside from a few additions and subtractions, the film is almost entirely a shot-for-shot remake of the original. So instead of focussing on that, I'll be focussing on the (very few) significant changes made to the plot of the film.Firstly, the film is almost entirely photorealistic. Meaning, certain more surreal and cartoony scenes are redone, most notably the musical numbers ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"". You've already probably heard of the small controversy surrounding 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'', which for some reason is now set in the afternoon instead of evening. It's silly changes like this that are most distracting.Another change is made to the Hyenas. In the original, the Hyenas are more-or-less meant to be representations of the underclass of society, with Scar representing a populist Dictator promising more to the hyenas to get their allegiance. They are shown as stupid and gullible in the original, and some people have interpreted this as classist. This is something that I guess Disney wanted to 'Fix' in the remake, so instead, the Hyenas here are shown as a rival kingdom who has exhausted their resources, and Scar offers an alliance with them, promising to share the food in exchange for them starting the stampede that killed Mufasa.Which brings me to the main villain, Scar. In the original film, Scar was one of the many campy villains of the DIsney Renaissance, being smart, cunning, and a little effeminate, as opposed to the brutish and masculine Mufasa. In the remake, they decided to remove the campy elements of the character, and instead he is both jealous of Mufasa's power, and the fact that Mufasa won the affections of Sarabi. Yes, in this version, Scar is motivated by lust for Simba's mum. I guess that's a bit closer to Hamlet? Maybe? Who knows? I won't say it's a bad change, just a neutral change that makes Scar a competent but less memorable villain.Now, one thing I do like about the remake that is different from the original is Timon and Pumba. Billy Eichner as Timon definitely plays up the 'gay' vibe that the original character had. And Seth Rogen as Pumba works really well. His casting as Pumba was spot on, while still being distinct from Ernie Sabella's original portrayal of the character. The duo is also the most 'self aware' of the film, in the sense that they make several coy fourth-wall-breaking jokes at the expense of the remake. I think that they were given the most creative freedom in terms of riffing off the original, and while it's not 'better' than the original, I can certainly appreciate its attempts to distinguish itself, especially compared to the rest of the film that makes barely any changes.There are also a couple more scenes added with adult Nala (to justify the casting of Beyonce, no doubt) but they don't add much to the plot or change it in any significant way.My biggest problem with the remake is just the overall pacing. While it is for the most part a shot for shot remake, it feels like a cover band whose drummer isn't the best, and occasionally misses a beat. The original film is short and sweet at 88 minutes, while the remake is 118 minutes, meaning they needed to make up about 20 extra minutes of runtime, which for the most part, aside from the few changes, was done by stretching and squishing the original scenes to different lengths, which throws off the natural rhythm a person who saw the original would have when watching this. There were several moments where I cringed at just the pacing of the film. I felt how off it was. It was weird and uncanny, moreso than the character design.Overall, this film isn't really worth watching. It's gonna make millions of dollars off the nostalgia alone, but seriously, just find the original movie online streaming somewhere and watch that instead. Have a party where you watch the original, and call it the ""Spite Disney Party"". I'm not going to hold it against you if you do watch the remake. I mean, I watched it, I'd be a hypocrite if I made a moral judgement against people who watch this version, but seriously, don't do what I did. Save a bit of money and rent the original. This movie isn't bad, but there's a better version of it already out there.",The Lion King
299,juliendussault,Chiwetel........You had one line....,3,7 May 2020,"Chiwetel was a bad choice for the voice of Scar. He can't sing, and apparently can't do voice over as when it came time to give that famous line ""Scar, brother. Help me!"" instead of a voice dripping with malice and vemon as Jeremy Iron so graciously delivered in the original we got a lame ""Long live the king."" As if he were just speaking the line, not acting it.That's what the majority of this film is. The only real great thing is the visuals, the acting sounds more like a read through rather than a finished product.",The Lion King
300,garethwooduk,"Charming, heartfelt ... Brilliant!",8,1 August 2019,"I really don't get the negative reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed it from the moment it started.Lost in a world that was all cgi that you forget isn't real.A lovely film, with lots of heart, funny scenes and great voices to the characters and some great action sequences, setting was beautiful and lived up to the original Disney animation, equally as funny as the real world movie of The Jungle Book.I strongly recommend those that haven't go see it, blu ray movie for me when it gets released!",The Lion King
301,JamesIan2021,These Disney Remakes Are Getting Worse....,1,29 July 2019,"After the torture of sitting through 2019 Aladdin as well as Dumbo, I actually at first refused to see this remake of The Lion King, mostly because the original is a near masterpiece, to many as well as myself, and watching it as a kid religiously, it seemed completely pointless remaking such a fantastic film that hasn't aged a day.However, as me and my fellow Cineworld card holders have cleared the cinema roster, The Lion King was the only thing on this weekend we hadn't seen. So I sucked it up and caved in and went with my mates. I wish I'd stayed at home.This is a hollow, bland, dull and completely vapid, shameless cash-grab from Disney. A visually beautiful yet dramatically and emotionally inept movie. The animals look photo real and that's an achievement, but without the expressive faces seen in the original, you can't buy into the drama and emotion. This is a shot for shot remake without the beauty, fun and heart of the 1994 classic.There's no magic, and that's what Disney prides itself on. The newly added scenes bring nothing but more length to this extremely slow remake. The colour, pop and brightness of the original are nowhere to be seen this time, instead we get a rather sepia looking film, any given David Attenborough documentary has more colour, style and emotion than this film.The cast are a mixed bag. Donald Glover couldn't be any more boring as older Simba, he sounds like he's either high or falling asleep. Beyonce brings some class to Nala but doesn't get a lot of screen time. Chjwetel Ejiofor who I normally love gave me a headache, and John Oliver is painful to listen to. Keegan-Michael Key feels like he's been stolen from another movie and dumped here and it doesn't work, though Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, surprisingly, did a good job.There's nothing remarkable about this film bar its visuals. It's just a cold, pointless remake that some will enjoy due to recognising certain shots which will trigger nostalgia. Even the kids in the cinema last night were wondering around bored, distracted and fidgeting, because the film has nothing to offer. Comedy falls flat, emotions are zero and what can be said other than it's just a pale imitation of a beloved classic. Well done Disney on churning out another pile of dung remake that's hit the billion dollar mark.",The Lion King

We spent most of the movie in awe of what we were looking at & not the movie itself, as it just didn't grab your interest.
Dull voice overs. Lack of humour & emotion & every song ruined.
6/10 for the realistic look of it but everything else, lets it down.

304,KreamLeehan,I guess it's on me.,1,11 October 2019,"No it's not actually. Yes, I did hoped a lot from this but the movie itself was light when it came to emotions and the musics were all tuned down so the hired voice actors could sing them. Speaking of, voice actors are so cliche and some of them didn't even match the characters except the monkey.
If you haven't watched the animation version of this movie then it would be okay to watch this? But then I would highly recommend, in fact anyone would recommend, that you watch the animation version rather than this one.",The Lion King
305,aaronjbong,Beautiful Remake in the Most Literal Sense,8,23 July 2019,"In the age of advancing CGI, ""The Lion King"" is definitely one of the best visual movies I've ever seen. The animals are highly realistic, the surroundings were vivid, and at times when there was no dialogue, you might think you're watching a documentary on Nat Geo. It is a beautiful movie but if you've seen the original movie, you'll see that this movie is a near-replica of the original, with scenes that come right out of the original, adopting identical framings, etc. It adds very little to the original movie and its status as a ""remake"" is very spot-on.The animals are very lifelike and beautiful to watch. That said, just as I think real lions are hard to distinguish from one another, I also feel like the lions here are very hard to distinguish from one another. It helps Mufasa and adult Simba are never in the same scene, because I would be very confused. However, the lionesses are very identical to one another, and it's only because I'm familiar with the fact that Nala is the main lioness in the story, that I was able to distinguish her from the other lionesses. The standout design was Scar, though, and while he's not as colorful as the cartoon version (black mane, green lions), his rugged look, and not to forget with an actual scar across his left eye, presents a terrifying villain, elevating one of Disney's best villains into another level.Another drawback with realism is that it's hard to discern emotions from the animals, aside from smiles, etc. But it's difficult to obtain the same amount of expression as in the original, where the eyes are so much more flexible. It loses a certain degree of charm, and has to be made up by the voice actors. I personally found Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Timon (Billy Eichner), and Pumba (Seth Rogen) to be highlights in the movie, and their vocal performances were top-notch.Ultimately, ""The Lion King"" is a beautiful movie that is the definition of a ""remake"" in the most literal sense. Even the dialogue is highly identical, save for some modern updates to connect with today's audience. It's visually splendid and I had a good time watching the movie, and while everything is highly familiar, it was still a great experience getting to see how those animated frames get translated into the hyper-realistic renderings. However, now having watched both, I'm still unsure in the future, which version I would watch when I want to revisit the story. This remake is a technological marvel, but the original had strong colors, vivid emotions, and just an overall animated charm that a live-action version just can't have. Let's leave it at 50-50.",The Lion King
306,randomStuff101,"Technically brilliant but long, safe script, linear, slightly dull and predictable. Voice acting shallow at times.",6,19 October 2020,"I found the Jungle Book a much better, bolder and more energetic and cheeky movie. More expressive and artistic than The Lion King.It's the obvious comparison since it was the same director and involved mostly cutting edge animated animals and nature.The Lion King is like a technically superb animation was made, then voices slapped over the top. Compared to The Jungle Book, it falls behind in harmonious voice acting, and character charm. Even the animation and visuals in the Jungle Book seem more charming and sensitive and expressive. Lion King visuals are brilliant but washed out, less warmth than Jungle Book.Scar and Mufasa are great, but other voices sound like they're ""reading their lines"". Perhaps it was a casting error for some of the characters, or not enough takes.John Oliver was an irritating choice. He hams up every line with the same over-cooked emphasis, like he's doing one of his lefty comedy rants on his TV show. Odd casting choice. Some fun moments, but stale.Story is okay, but lacks twists or depth after Simba leaves. The first half building up to Simba leaving is really good, but it lost me somewhere between then and the linear journey to the end. The script is somewhat conservative and safe. I know it's aimed at younger viewers, but still, it's taken the very plain and safe road.",The Lion King

First impressions were good, it looks fantastic. Then the ever familiar tones of James Earl Jones rumble in as the Dad everyone deserves. John Oliver's unmistakeable delivery provides the smiles in this piece of heaven on earth, while Chiwetel Ejiofor's voice drips with derision as he plots and schemes.There are plenty of other talented actors and guest stars - Alfre Woodard, Keegan-Michael Key, Donald Glover, Beyoncé - but none of them really have speaking voices I would immediately think of as being distinctive, lines feel flat where they need depth; voice is character in animated films. About halfway through the movie Seth Rogan shows how it's done, and brings some welcome humour and bounce with him.Plotwise, it's Disney basics 101: Good v Bad with no shade in between. The set up is as predictable as it gets - good king, scheming brother, naive prince, what could possible go wrong. That.I can't imagine that if The Lion King was written today that so many female lions would be so easily dominated by one male. Alfre Woodard's Sarabi would kick Scar's ass far sooner.The songs are uniformly forgettable, except for two.",The Lion King
310,kingsx_64,When great cgi hurts a movie,7,24 October 2019,"The faces look so real. The movements, real.
So how did the great cgi hurt the movie?
Because it was too real. It left no room for emotion
on the faces. In real life, animals can't smile like cartoon
animals can. Or look hurt, angry, sad. At least not the way
an animated animal can. So when some say it had no emotion,
they are indeed correct.

least once. it is something visually remarkable",The Lion King

Again claiming he was 1st in line ""until the prince (Mufasa) arrived"".
So did Mufasa's birth get in the way of Scars rain, or did Scar make a mistake that forced him to step down from his place?
In other words..... WAS Scar originally innocent but driven to his insanity out of disrespect (by birth order) or a simple mistake from jealousy? Leaving Scar's causing him to lose the ability to eat right & losing weight/strength which then caused him to lose fight for rank from Mufasa; who was healthy.
Again was Scar actually innocent?The visuals in this was AMAZING!!! The storyline is still touching & u wouldn't be human to not understand.
I do however have a question now that they re-made the original....",The Lion King

It actually felt like I was watching real animals in live action (hard to believe it's animated).The same meaningful, deep and emotional story as the original.

315,Clank_Zoka,"One word, ""Lifeless""",3,21 July 2019,"I'm getting sick of these remakes of classic Disney animated films, they don't have the same charm, creativity or originality as their animated counterparts, a few can be good or even better, Pete's Dragon is a great example, although the original film is technically not animated but it has a animated character in live-action but the live-action 2016 remake is so much better, after the surprisingly great and successful 2016 Jungle Book remake, Jon Favreau decided to direct yet another live-action film based on a animated classic and what is that?.... the Lion King of course, now I really like the original animated film even though it's not flawless with it's big story telling, revolutionary animation, amazing cast and wonderful characters with unforgettable songs and a beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, it's a classic, so will Favreau do something amazing like he did with the Jungle Book?, well I saw it yesterday with a little bit of optimism and.......... wow, this is the most lifeless, empty, emotionless, heartless, pointless and boring remake out there, although I have seen worse but this is so bad so let's talk about it.You all know the story of the Lion King so let's just get into it (Seriously look it up online it speaks for itself), Jon Favreau who is usually a good choice has completely did the opposite of what he did in the Jungle Book, he's now doing what the 2017 Beauty and Beast did, making this new remake in the same way of the animated film, only with very minor changes and a few things cut out of the movie to make it longer and drag on, when it comes to the classic scenes and song sequences they are ruined with something that was once expressive and fill of personality to something very boring and dull, which is basically what this is film is, it's just the animated film only with no effort and energy along with heart and emotion, it's just as stale and boring as it is, it's tries to be emotional but comes off as laughable and dull, it has a bit of chuckle worthy moments and only one laugh that came from me, but besides that what else can be said about this directing, writing and execution, this is why you don't need to remake it again, along with making classic scenes go on forever, so it shows that Favreau and his team didn't try... like at all.The visuals are probably the only best thing about the film, the animated film looked a lot better then this but it still looks impressive in a way, it's very beautiful, it looks photorealistic, the animals look like actual animals which is quite impressive also and it have wonderful textures, however as impressive as it looks, it has a massive downfall, as well textured as the characters are, most of the lions look the same and don't really stand out, Timon and Pumbaa look very normal and everyone else look like their animated counterpart in a way, at the same time, the scenery can look dark in lighting and it can be hard to see, most of this is achieved very well in the animated film, but this live-action film has certainly found a way of making the world of Pride Rock look real and beautiful!.The characters are just like how they are from the animated film... only emotionless, boring and bland, so Simba, Nala, Mufasa, Scar, Zazu, the Hyenas and Rafiki have completely changed and not in a good way, none of them have the charm, personality, heart depth or comedy of their animated counterparts, they are exactly the same but worse, but Timon and Pumbaa were the worst ones, now I liked them in the original animated film, here they are sooo annoying now, Scar is no longer a threat and more boring then ever, the hyenas are unfunny and I can't tell them apart, although with dull, repeated and uninteresting characters, the voice acting makes it slightly better I suppose, I think John Oliver, Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and John Kani fit their roles extremely well, it's nice that they brought back James Earl Jones but he sounds incredible bored through out this entire film, as for everyone else, they do a decent job, Donald Glover is okay as Simba, Beyoncé is actually half way decent as Nala, Chiwetel Eijofor is time as Scar but is certainly no Jeremy Irons, Eric André, Keegan-Michael Key are the three main Hyenas who are also just okay, point is the voice acting is okay, so how do you recreate great characters again?, well take the life and heart out of them, then using different actors who are mostly doing fine and then you got boring and forgettable characters.The songs, the score and everything about this music is exactly the same, they are there for people to go ""Ohhh I remember that, that was from the original!, I like it"" and that's it, nothing else.Wow..... this remake was just.... pathetic!, do I really need to say why you need to avoid this?, I mean if you are curious to see if it will be good?, then skip it but if you really want to then go ahead but don't expect a good movie, it's exactly what it is, a lifeless, boring, pointless, unfunny, painfully emotionless and has no heart, yes it has nice visuals with okay voice acting and I did get two chuckles and one laugh, but unfortunately that's not enough, this is one remake I don't like at all, sure it's not as terrible as the Nutcracker and the ""Bore"" Realms, but it's pretty close, I'm now sick of remakes and I think I'll stop watching them and stop giving them money for something pointless, we need originality, not doing the same thing in different visuals!, but no.... they only do it

People have criticised talking animals but how is that any different to cardboard looking talking and singing animals?The CGI that Disney now employ is absolutely state of the art. How on earth they achieve this is beyond my comprehension, totally. Genius's they are.The casting for the voices were all spot on and first class acting.This version really brought the story to life in a way that the original didn't and oh how pertinent is this story now in these dire times.During the final scenes which talks about lies and more lies this reminded me of Trump and Boris Johnson, but they will reep their cumupance as the bad guys always do, in the end.This film made both my wife and me cry, for me it was the sheer masterpiece of a production that got me going, as well as the deep morale storyline.I wanted to stand up and applaud at the end and in the final moments where 'The Lion King' title suddenly hits the screen with a bang, that was it for me, totally choked and couldn't speak for a while walking out of the theatre.If anyone from Disney read this, please keep up this grand work.

323,dineshaishu,The lion king (2019),10,23 July 2019,"As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",The Lion King

Unfortunately some voice acting doesn't work the best-Scar and Nala especially.Scar isn't menacing enough (despite being much angrier here than in the original)and he was more boring to me this time than the animated Scar.Be Prepared was awful,but the rest of the music was decent.The movie also felt to me like it has no soul.Not the best.5/10",The Lion King

328,resireg,"You know what, I liked it, more than the animated version.",10,17 September 2020,"This Lion King is very entertaining. First of all, we can relate to him better, they are portrayed as animals, but coild totally be humans. For example, the main plot is the son who is groomed to succeed his powerful father, but is betrayed by a corrupted uncle. In real life, that could happen if a tycoon has one heir, and he misteriously dies, and the son join a commune/hippie society instead of fighting for his inheritance. That happens in real life too. Throughout the centuries, rich kids became Christian monks, nuns, Buddhists, even Hare Krishna, because they wanted a life free from responsibilities and power.Simba found the Hakuna Matata cult, buf that could totally be some new age collective, it is all so relatable.Then the animals look natural. They don't have those antropomorphic expressions from the animated version. I really liked that. Then Sarabi and Nala (the lionesses)are not mere expectators, they have clear roles, and just like in the savannahs, they work instead of sitting around like useless housewives.Zazu, the yes men, is more likeable and useful this time. The plot makes ore sense. There is less singing and more dialogue. I believe this version was aimed even more on adults. The animated Scar looked flamboyant and feminine, this one looks more menacing and normal too. His main reason to be king and betraying his brother is better explained",The Lion King
329,jaywensley2004,A new version of the Uncanny Valley,7,19 July 2019,"When I was a kid, Sunday night was ""appointment television."" NBC would broadcast the appetizer: ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom"", immediately followed by the main course: ""Walt Disney's World of Color"".""World of Color"" was my introduction to all the great Disney cartoon characters. But most weeks the show would feature a great nature movie; an animal or an environment would be gently anthropomorphized into a story that I found very relatable, informative, and quite often emotionally moving. I still recall my favorite of these, a 1965 episode titled ""Minado the Wolverine"". These nature-films always used voice-over narration to tell their story; talking animals were for cartoon-use only.Which brings me to Disney's new version of ""The Lion King"".I really wanted to like this new ""Lion King"". I wanted to REALLY like this new ""Lion King"". And I think its execution is flawless. The cinematography is breathtaking, the rendering of the CGI animals is miraculous. The story is familiar, and deservedly loved. In the movie's action sequences, these all come together to make those moments riveting, perhaps as good as anything Disney has produced.But in scenes when the dialogue becomes crucial, when the words are meant to evoke most strongly...""The Lion King"" falters. I think the problem is that watching photo-realistic CGI animals talk, is too incredible to allow for suspension-of-disbelief. The reason the old ""World of Color"" films were so effective is that they relied on narration to reveal the thoughts of ""nature."" And the reason suspension-of-disbelief allows viewers to buy into animals-as-avatars for humans in animated films, is that the visual cues (animation) are copacetic with the conceit of talking animals.And there's the rub for the new ""The Lion King"".""The Lion King"" is a fine movie, and definitely worth seeing in a theater. The scenery is lush, those animals are...dangerously beautiful (the state of the art in CGI is so exactly real, that I am uncomfortable thinking about what could be done with such technology should someone choose to use it maliciously), and the music and story transfer intact from the 1994 version of the movie.But because I could never get comfortable with seeing ""real"" animals speaking human words and thoughts, the emotional power of the original gets lost in translation.",The Lion King

It's worth watching just for the exquisitely beautiful CG effects that are completely indistinguishable from reality - making the film a real landmark in cinema effects history.But, unlike the original cartoon-animated Lion King, the film falls flat on fun-loving excitement. The characters aren't as lively, and maybe this is due to the constrains of re-telling the story with photo-realism.Also, parts of the film are too dark for a young audience. The hyenas will give kids nightmares, the evil Scar is as creepy as the Grim Reaper.Inexplicably, one of the funniest side-splitting scenes from the original was changed to the point of being terse. This is the scene were Timone dresses in a hula skirt and plays a ukulele to distract the hyenas. Why change it at all? Was the idea of Timone dressing in drag considered tasteless, or un-PC?Similarly, the three hyenas came off as four-legged Three Stooges in the original film.

336,Abranth-d,Slimy .... Yet satisfying .,5,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of 'The Lion King'. Now I've watched a lot of movies , a LOT ! But if you ask me what is my favorite movie of all time , it's very hard to bring it down to one , but if you put a gun to my head and ask me to choose , I would say the Lion King in a split second , but not because of nostalgic reasons , but because it's just that flawless. With that being said I was talking about the original 2d movie , not this one . Before I start here's a heads up for lion King spoilers , I can't review the new one without comparing it to the original , but seriously who hasn't watched the original ? Unless you're one of those kimba protestors on Reddit.So the Lion King is directed by Jon favreau who I believe got the job cause he made the live action jungle book and a little movie called chef which is pretty much the Lion King without scar in a food truck. And I think he's the guy who holds up the vision for this movie . Speaking of Scar , he's not even half as menacing as Jeremy irons' scar from the original , I understand how they were going a for a "" live action""( cgi) scar and that they couldn't give him yellow eyes and a black mane , but the guy who played Mordo in Dr. strange voices him and he didn't work for me , Jeremy irons is up and running , I don't see why they couldn't shove 40 million down his throat and get him to come back.Just like scar , there are a lot of new actors in this movie , like John Oliver who replaces Rowan Atkinson as Zazu , but you don't know that until the credits roll . It's like Troy Baker doing Mark Hamill's Joker voice but also doing his own thing while he's at it , I felt they should've done something similar with Scars voice. Even Pumba is replaced with Seth Rogen and he was really good . Oh yeah , Timon and Pumbaa absolutely kill it in this movie , hilarious ! Despite having different voices and live action cgi bodies , they are show stealers all the way.I should've mentioned this at the start but this movie is gorgeous ! You just stop for a second and notice how much one can do with cgi . But the problem with a live action / cgi adaptation is that you have to remove a lot of things from the original animation , like a lot of the cartoon quirks for example . Such as the hoola distraction dance ( that still cracks me up even now ) , music videos like that shot where Simba is on top of a bunch of animals , The marching Hyenas and geysers from 'be prepared' and even little moments like scar singing to "" l like a lovely bunch of coconuts "" and just much more , but you get the idea. The other problem with a so called ""live action"" adaptation is that even though the characters have pretty much the same lines from the original , they come out as rather ""stoic"" than real .Now this movie is Ctrl c and Cntrl v of the original but with cgi , so how can that go wrong ? It can go wrong if you mess with the original. The truth is they didn't change anything about the original but instead added and deleted stuff to increase the time and package it into a two hour movie . Like for example there is a scene of Nala escaping from Pride rock past the Hyenas and scar . nope . Not in the original . For those of you who don't know , there was actually a scene from the original which got scrapped for not being very pg 13 , it involves Scar forcing Sarabi to be his queen , you can even see the leaked storyboard on YouTube. And it was scrapped for the right reason. They somehow tweaked a few lines from it into this movie which felt completely unnecessary . That's the additions . The deleted stuff from the original are both big and small moments which didn't work for me at all . Big moments like Mufasas' ghost in the sky was replaced with dense clouds which doesn't resemble any shape even . Rafikis speech about the past was cut , the last shot at pride rock with Timon and Pumbaa standing next to Simba was scrapped and even that little hug Simba gives Rafiki before ascending the throne was cut too , of all the things they cut for time , they cut these iconic moments and those little lines which make such a big difference.These are the part I was looking forward to , the songs ! And Hans Zimmer's out of the world soundtrack.When the movie began and the sun rose in Africa , I could just feel the energy among the audience who by the way were 20 something year olds or 17 at the least , no pesky kids or annoying babies. And the songs by Elton John certainly delivered even though they lacked some of the quirky comic visuals from the original , they delivered. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is iconic as it was two decades ago , but with a few tweaks , here and there but in a good way. The thing is , if you've watched the original , you'd know the cue for when a particular soundtrack is going to play and it plays right at the stampede sequence . But for me personally , the score when Simba goes back to pride rock past the desert is the best of all and when I was pumped for the cue / drop they replaced it with some Beyonce song which didn't work at all . Speaking of Beyonce , I didn't like her voice as older Nala either. Just like some of the scenes , some of the score and songs were added and deleted as well , ""be prepared"" was replaced with "" be prepared "" but a shorter version with less energy , I understand why cause unlike the original you can't do that song without the quirky visuals and the neon colour tone. Unlike the deletes , the additional songs were actually good , especially the extended version of "" in the jungle , the mighty jungle""I know I said they only deleted and added stuff but didn't change or improvise. Guess I was wrong . You know the scene where Pumbaa beats up the Hyenas cause they call him a Pig . They replaced that with "" chubby "" like wtf dude ?! Either Disneys trying too much to hold on to the pg rating or kids these days are really sensitive. One of the other changes I noticed was fast cuts and reactions but I guess you can't blame them cause you have to cut from actions quick when you can't delay with emotion , since emotions come off quickly and stoic when you use cgi for a movie like this.But nevertheless , I still had fun with this movie , had a few man tears from the very same scenes from the original , loved the father - son dynamic b/w Simba and Mufaasa and laughed hard at the Timon and Pumbaa moments . It's visually striking , more like a nat Geo safari with talking animals even , has great talents and is aware of what it is. It's the kind of movie you watch on Imax and buy on Blu-ray. Even with all that it doesn't capture the magic of the original .In short . It was slimy .... Yet satisfying.",The Lion King

Sitting still, the animals were animals. Moving, though, was dangerous for the poor things. Sometimes jerky, sometimes not. Lion laying down? Either have the Lion hit the ground smoothly and naturally or keep the creature standing up. Chase scene needs multiple openings just small enough to slow down the predator, except for its big ugly face? (Maybe in 3D that becomes more exhilarating)I've also seen more than a few films where the actors look onscreen like they're waiting for stage direction and somehow the awkwardness makes its way into the final cut.

348,tommystans,It's the original but with CG,5,22 July 2019,"I LOVED the original as a kid and I still do today. I had it on VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray and now I can stream it. The 1994 classic still lives up today with its gorgeous animation and art style, memorable story and characters and timeless songs that would last many generations thanks to 1994 movie. But with Disney remaking old classics you know that The Lion King was done the line given its popularity over the years.Now I honestly don't have a problem with Disney doing them, especially to movies like Dumbo because of its age. Remake the classic to give it an update. However remaking The Lion King to me sounds like a bad idea because the film really didn't need to change. The Lion King didn't really have the same problems in the style of Dumbo. But because of this trend of remaking classic, Disney are bound to do it anyway.In the end, the visuals are good but the story is the same and even adding in little different scenes like the 'Be Prepared' scene and all really doesn't impact the film's narrative. While the visuals are good I REALLY HATED the emotionless faces of the animals. I remember the director saying that they wanted the animals to look realistic but here's the thing, emotions are important because it visually shows how the characters are feeling. He also said that there's body language but I'd hardly ever seen that much body language through the characters. It's a shame because the actors playing in this had done it their all with the emotion.However I felt the story was a bit rushed with its pacing around the third act and the scene with Simba talking to his dad in the cloud really didn't have much effort put into it unlike the original. No fault towards the VFX artists who worked hard on this film, this is more to the director of the film. I do like his films like 'Iron Man' but the direction was not really good here.This is geared towards Disney's marketing but I also hate how they keep saying these remakes are 'for a new generation'. How can these films be for a new generation when families have great access to the original films through every home media variation there is. Disney had been harping on the words 'Timeless classic' for a reason.People might say, 'If they changed the story then everyone will be up in arms.' and yeah that's a good point but there are choices for this film. Either remake it the same, change it or just not remake it at all and I feel. I feel that the Aladdin had done a far better job with its remake. It feels like its own film and while there were scene that weren't in the original they felt needed and moments like the Genie having a girlfriend didn't drastically deviate from the original story of the 1992 classic.At the end of the day, at least the original is still with us. Disney will keep playing the original classic more often on TV, streaming services etc. and the remake, while it will exist, it will be released on DVD, Blu-Ray, TV and streaming service (Disney + more likely) and that's it. I hardly see any of the recent remakes getting the same love post-cinema screening the same way as the originals.In the end, the film is the same as the original with dull emotionless animals. If you hate the idea of the story being similar, just watch the classic you're not really missing out anything. If you like the remake more power to you.",The Lion King
349,marcgreenman,very impressive animation looks almost real if you're not watching too carefully,7,29 December 2019,"The animation is very convincing i almost believed that the animals were real. if you look closely you can tell that they are not, so it's not completely true by any means. there is so much detail in the animation that some people i know described this as live action, it is that good. i still remember the fully animated version. this story possesses an almost shakespearean quality to it, scar is a little bit richard iii, simba is wracked by guilt like hamlet. some careful cuts make sure that the violence is pushed into the background, which is right for a family movie. it struck me as being really odd that the other animals were all celebrating the birth of more lion cubs. lions hunt and kill other animals, so this is hardly a matter for celebration. perhaps somebody overlooked that part. at its core, the whole plot rings slightly wrong there. there are some similarities with the jungle book and bambi, with jungle book for the circle of friends and the growing up story, with bambi for the sudden, dramatic death of a parent creating an orphan. the actor behind scar was perhaps the most convincing of the actors and almost made me feel sad for the character, in spite of his selfish, arrogant actions and murderous streak.",The Lion King

We noticed during the movie that a lot of other people were singing along or even predicted out loud what would happen next. And no we didn't attend a matinee, so there were no children present, they were all grown ups. But that shows how much people loved the earlier animated version (as a part of their childhood) and perhaps that explains the bad reviews. I've read a lot of them and there are people that complain that this version is the exact same and others complain that it leaves out too many details. It seems that it could never live up to the expectation no matter what. We really enjoyed it, I get that the animated older version gives the animals more expression. But choosing to do it in real life form, is choosing for less expression. Because in real life a lion does not have human expressions.

Compared with the special effects of bombarding the look and feel, it even seems too low-key, which is exactly what it is most revolutionary.

354,shinedowness,Disney Went Greedily Coldhearted,4,27 July 2019,"This film will NEVER be better than the original film. Why? Because the voice actors and actresses in this film made the characters have less emotional voices, less facial expressions to represent emotions, and less passion in their singing except for Beyoncé. Speaking of passionate singing. Jeremy Irons had very much more passion in his voice when he talked and sang in the original film for the role of Scar than Chiwetel Ejiofor did. Especially when Jeremy sang the song ""Be Prepared"". ""Be Prepared"", ""Circle of Life"", and ""Hakuna Matata"" were my song favorites from the original. However, I only liked ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata"" from this 2019 remake. Thankfully, James Earl Jones reprised his role for the Mufasa character. For a digital film such as this one, the people responsible for making this film could have made the digitized animals have more emotional expressions like in the original film. Also, this film had missing lines from the original film that I really loved when I was a kid. Simba's lines were ""Help! Somebody! Anybody!"" when he tries to find someone to help his father Mufasa who died because of Scar unknowingly when he was a cub. When Simba said the words somebody and anybody, I felt an emotional reaction to that. But, this film decided to remove that. Even though the people tried their ""best"" to make this film, I only felt coldhearted greed on Disney's end. And Beyoncé's song ""Spirit"" gets repetitive and I can't seem to feel any deeply emotional meaning in her song compared to the song ""Circle of Life"". Removed lines from the original film just made this film like it was cutting corners instead of trying to make a deep meaningful message from this film. Shame.",The Lion King
355,mc1382,The fart jokes say it all,2,21 July 2019,"As much as it might seem I would rather not be hateful towards things. In fact, I don't want to be one of those people that just trashes Disney remakes based on principle. There is potential for a remake that expands and improves the emotional depth of the original. The Lion King (2019) is a far cry from this philosophy and opts for the exact opposite. The film rushes through each emotional beat of the original and fails to understand how facial expressions and dialogue can be used to sell a scene. Take Scar, for instance, everything he says feels misplaced and voidless. He doesn't feel intimidating and is honest to god a slap in the face to the original. A lot of the voice acting feels very underwhelming and could've used some refining. Others have mentioned it but realism doesn't make for a good movie.People want to see movies where they can attach their own emotions onto it. This film completely disregards this and ultimately doesn't understand how to make a competent film. If I want to see real animals I'd watch Animal Planet. I'm in the minority on this but I think the CGI on the animals looks awful. The animation aesthetic looks dated to me and is completely devoid of colour or vibrancy. Not to mention some unintentionally goofy scenes. The jokes in this film that worked in the original, completely fail here. This due to no comedic timing and lack of body language. The new ones they've included don't appeal to me and feel like a lesser version of the jokes in the original (The fart jokes ooft). I just want to make it clear that I don't think the original is a flawless masterpiece. The second half of the original feels rushed and misses the emotional strength of the first half.However, this one makes this issue even more obvious. This new remake stretches the pacing too its very limits. At times I felt like I was watching a 5-hour movie and I was just waiting for the sweet release of the end credits. The music was handled okay but none of the instrumentals, production and vocal performances captured the urgency and expansiveness of the original soundtrack. There is also some ill-fitted terrible Beyonce remix during the film that almost made me block my ears at how bad it was. The last thing I want to mention is the lack of originality. They didn't try to create a unique vision instead they opted for a safe version. If you have seen the original there is no reason to see this. Apart from additional jokes, alternative lines and unnecessary exposition, it felt like a more stale carbon copy of the original.So yeah, everything I dreaded it would be. Disney has hit rock bottom and for a company that has brought so much happiness into people lives, it feels downright manipulative.",The Lion King

But alas, while it was enjoyable enough, it just wasn't that remarkable. At least with the other two Disney remakes this year, they brought to life an animated movie, breathing new life into an old but beloved property. As cool as the ""photo-realistic"" lions with the moving mouths were, I couldn't figure out why Disney was doing this other to say they could and to continue minting money hand over fist. The story is the same, the beats are the same as in the original, but it lacked much emotional oomph and didn't foster any kind of connection with the audience. (Turns out the eyes really are important to convey emotion.) Billy Eichner stole the show as Timon, Seth Rogen was great as Pumbaa, and the rest of the voice cast is all good, but Beyonce fans probably won't be happy considering how little she's in it.",The Lion King

The thing is that they are some shot that has been remade just to fit in good in this live action movie, like for example the one where the animals is like standing above eachother and so.
Also they putted out some new scenes that made some more charisma to some character, like Timon and Pumpa.In the cinema Everyone was laughing laud and was quite in exictment scenes or more seriouse and of course the one scene we all knew was coming... yep get my tissues already.But i recomend it for nostalgia and to see a more light up and is a change for a whole new genaration to see this as they may have not seen the original.

364,bodhi-13262,"Slimy, yet......unsatisfying.",5,25 July 2019,"'The Lion King' (2019) is yet another classic title in Disney's long list of live-action remakes. However, with acclaimed director Jon Favreau at the helm, will this film the mold to become something more than mediocre?1. If you've seen the original 1994 animated film, there is nothing different in terms of scene, story and song in this remake. The goal was obviously to review the original and copy each scene with CGI effects. On a positive note, the CGI was breathtaking! From the vastness of the African plains to character designs themselves. If you thought Avatar (2009) was still groundbreaking with its CGI world, this film rivals that immensely. There was never a moment to which I though anything looked fake. The art department should be nominated for their work on this film cause this is as realistic as CGI effects will appear nowadays.2. Overall, I had mixed feelings about the new voice-casting in this film. James Earl Jones' voice is obviously irreplaceable and I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mufasa. However, Jeremy Irons (original voice of Scar) also has an iconic voice and whilst Chiwetel Ejiofor does a good of a job as anyone can, Irons still seemed like the better fit. I was appalled to learn that Jeremy Irons himself approached Disney and was more than willing to reprise his role as Scar only to be rejected as the studio only wanted Black actors in the film's leading roles.
The only other voice actor I had a problem with was Beyonce as adult Nala. Obviously she's an amazing vocalist but her actual speaking voice is too deep to the point where it is more so deeper than co-star Donald Glover's(adult Simba).3. Lastly, the music of the original film is iconic in its own right and very much timeless. Of course the newer voice actors do covers of the original songs but to no greater effect. It serves its purpose but there is nothing special about it overall. There are some new song written for the film but they are God-awful! Having Pharrell Williams on board as the music producer on this was a terrible choice. Hans Zimmer knew just how to represent Africa with his organized orchestra headed by African singer Lebo M. who brought traditional African instrumentals to the original film. Here, injecting a hip-hop and R&B over-tone to the score was utter garbage and a slap in the face to Hans Zimmer's Ocarina's-winning work.'The Lion King' is just an okay film. There honestly was so much potential to recapture the magic of the original but seemed like the film-makers were trying way too hard to make this great that they completely missed their target.",The Lion King
365,Skippy489,A little slow and boring,3,28 November 2019,"Watching the film it is hard to not compare it to the original. All of the iconic scenes are present, but overall, its not spectacular. The film spends more time showing scenery shots and ignoring the plot.
The best, new, part of the film was the casting of Timone and Pumbaa, Seth Rogan was great! But the best was Seth Rogan recording his lines, as seen in the bluray extras, he cracked up the director with his improv. That was better than the film itself. John Oliver, from Lion King 2, and Lion King 1 1/2, gives a great performance. James Earl Jones did a great job of reprising his role as well.
The animation was pretty good too, but overall its not the best movie ever made, it is worth the experience of seeing it, but the original animated movies are much more entertaining.",The Lion King

The Circle of Life is something that is not only special but is the heart and soul of every believer that watches something so spectacular that your jaw just drops, or your heart just melts because of the music and the scenery. But it all comes down to 2 words: Hakuna Matata.
Jon Favreau did, not just an amazing job, but an incredible job, reimaging the beauty of what was done 25 years ago in that little-known movie called The Lion King. With an all-star cast that was beautifully casted and crafted - from Donald Glover to the ever-funny man Seth Rogen to the conniving and evil Chiwetel Ejiofor to the beautifully talented Queen of R&B and Hip-Hop Beyoncé - I could go on, but I will stop there.

I mean, if it ain´t broke don't fix it I guess, so the story itself, since it is just like the original one, is really good. But there are some minor changes with the songs, the character, and some of the way the film is structured that don't fit well with the film. But, the reason why this film is not nearly as good as the original are the animals themselves. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is OUTSTANDING and beautiful to look at, but the animals barely show any emotions with exception of some, and the scenes that require actual emotions kind of fall flat.

369,darryl-jason,Be Prepared...,10,20 July 2019,"...to be dazzled with mirrored material from the original Disney 1994 classic. After much excitement of wanting to see this movie, I finally watched it the day it hit the cinemas & as soon as the movie started I was blown away by the CGI effect - amazing! The way the film starts (the opening scene of all the animals coming together during ""Circle Of Life"") was just exactly the same as the original. Plus the script is the same as well.We all have our disappointments & I'm going to try and concrete what may stand out to you the most as it did me:
Don't expect Scar to look and especially sound any similar to the one of the original movie because he doesn't. Jeremy Irons really nailed his performance and terrified me to hell in 1994 but here we are in 2019 and we're given the voice talent of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who, in my opinion sounds a little wooden, and could have given much more to playing Scar.
Plus his signature song ""Be Prepared"" was way much darker in the original. Here it seemed shorter and a lot more plain. Where was the infamous line ""You won't get a sniff without me!!!"" They cut it!!!The hyenas were especially more effective & funnier in the original but I guess we can expect that from Whoopi Goldberg because she was incredible in 1994. Such an awesome addition to the original movie. But I guess 2019 is all about featuring voice talents of unknown actors.I also have to agree with another user review who mentioned the very similar look to Adult Nala & Sarabi, yes they looked the same. You couldn't tell them apart.I'm not a fan of Beyoncé so I can't really say how thrilled I was when I saw she joined the cast of this movie. I'm sure she's a great singer but nothing special in my eyes.The soundtrack could've given a lot more too, a lot of the original hits were there and it's nice to see Elton John back contributing to this but again, the 1994 classic gave a lot more to us than 2019's version.There's a nice little added extras here as well in regards to the script. As much as they've kept to the original, there's a few extra surprises thrown in, especially with Timon & Pumbaa.Mufasa's death - I'm going to try not to spoil anything here but I will say it all seems to happen a lot faster than the original classic. But then I thought the whole movie seemed to be a lot quicker than the original. The suspense wasn't as good. Before I came to the cinema, did I tell myself repeatedly ""I'm going to cry!"" Yes. But I did I cry? No! I think I was a little let down with how fast the movie moved, Scar's reactions again were too plain and showed very little emotion in his voice especially when digging those claws into Mufasa before sending him to his death.All in all I will say it's a great movie and you can't argue the fact that the CGI is just mind blowing. It's like watching real life lions in Africa. Really impressive. 110% effort there!Be prepared to be taken back 25 years with very much originality plus a lot more additional creativity.",The Lion King

Seeing this 25 years later, it reminds of how good this story actually is. It is really neat to see how this remake has used photo realistic animals. I must admit that at first it is a bit odd to see them speaking but I got over it pretty fast. The parts with young Simba , Timone and Pemba were my favorite. They even throw a bit of meta humor in there for those of us that know Hakuna Matata by heart. Once he grew older was a delight as well with Donald Glover and Beyoncé. Beyoncé is and will always be a highlight in anything she is a part of. Some of the other parts suffered like Scar. I remember him being more theatrical. They didn't give him his campy sneer that I enjoyed from Jeremy Irons in the original. Having James Earl Jones back is pure magic. His voice is so iconic to Mufasa. The setting is beautiful. With everything looking so real it's surprisingly not as exciting at the same time. Sadly I was more taken in by the story when I was a child. Which I am sure your kids will take to this one as I did the original. Families will love it as well as animal lovers. This is a pretty straight forward remake.

The 2019 remake of The Lion King is a fairly entertaining update!",8,25 October 2021,"Recently, within the past decade or so, Disney has been releasing remakes of their animated classics. While some, such as Jon Favreau's remake of ""The Jungle Book"", have been great, others, like with the live-action adaptation of ""Aladdin"", have been good, even if their updates lack some of the energy of the original. In July of 2019, Favreau again appeared on the set directing his newest feature: a photorealistic computer-animated remake of ""The Lion King"". The Lion King is one of my favorite animated movies ever made, and so when I heard about them remaking it, I was eager to see what they had to offer. To my surprise, this turned out to be a thoroughly entertaining experience. Sure, it has a very similar plot line to the original, but who cares? The visual effects, music, voice actors, and execution are more than enough to make up for the fact that its talking animal characters are bland and expressionless and the story follows a near scene-by-scene formula of the original film.My favorite voice actors from this update are Donald Glover, Beyonce, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, and Seth Rogen. They do a fantastic job capturing their characters' personalities in this remake!Also, contrary to claim, this is not a ""shot-for-shot"" remake. That term would mean every scene would have to be the same as the original's, which is clearly not the case. Only the scenes that stay truly faithful to the original are directly shot-for-shot.""The Lion King"" remake may not have the most originality in its story, but its ability to be visually stunning, full of fantastic actors, and great music, as well as well-structured execution are more than enough to make up for its flaws. Also, the final battle has more prominent action, which allows for more fights to break out, especially a personal one between Nala and Shenzi.Definite recommend for anyone who wants to have a good time with stunning visuals and for those who have never seen the original film.",The Lion King

Seriously, you have to be sad as Scar to give the low 5 out of 10 average score I've been seeing on IMDB for this live action retelling of the lion king. It is a masterpiece technically, amazing cgi. We've come a long way from 'Babe' the talking pig. I get the deja vu comments and going in I was worried about how I was going to cope with all of that. Add on top the 'suspension of disbelief' dilemma (given how real the animals are now compared to the characterization animation allowed originally) and I understand some apprehension. But geeze Louise, you have to be picky and really hate Disney (I know there's a lot of you out there) to call this movie average. It's hard to believe adults like this exist but I took my partner who had never seen the original and I watched her laugh and gasp at all the same points I did when I first saw the story.

388,ChristianLeFeuvre,Visually impressive but otherwise stick to the original,1,20 July 2019,"As I have mentioned before, Disney's 'live-action' adaptations of their classic animated movies have been disasters, and most certainly, not necessary, 'The Jungle Book' was horrendous, 'Aladdin' was ridiculous, 'Dumbo' was worse, and the less said about the reworking of 'Pete's Dragon' the better! However, to give it it's dues, the adaptation of 'Beauty And The Beast' was actually not too bad.
Well, Disney has done it again!
The original 'The Lion King', released in 1994, is easily one of Disney's greatest animated movies and yet they decide to completely waste millions on a completely unnecessary remake and......well there is so much to say about this.
Jon Favreau is the director of this version, he was also the director for 'The Jungle Book' live-action remake. I can't understand how they can call this a 'live-action' adaptation, as every scene and every animal in the movie is created via CGI, surely another version of 'animation',......so they have just remade another animated version of 'The Lion King? Well, yes technically.
Ok, let me say this about it first, as far as visuals go, it is seriously impressive. It does look so realistic and praise goes to the digital artists responsible for the look of the movie. The vocal casting was alright but no way as good as the original casting, I for one missed Nathan Lane and Whoopi Goldberg as 'Timon' and 'Shanzi' respectively, but James Earl Jones is back as the voice of Mufasa.
I would say that James Earl Jones' voice reminded me of the original but everything did! It's the same movie! And before you say 'of course it's the same, it's a remake of the original', it is more than a remake, it is shot for shot the same. Kids who have never seen the original will probably like this version.
The power of the opening 'Circle Of Life' scene is now lost cause it's been done already, the musical score no longer has an impact cause we've heard it before, the emotion of Mufasa's death is lost because we've seen it before, the characters were no longer funny cause we've seen them all before.
There are no surprises here, there's very little that's new, and what is new is so completely unnecessary and well, annoying. The 'Be Prepared' song is heavily shortened, there's a new song added, for absolutely no reason as far as I could see, the scene featuring the 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' song was, in the original set at night, hence the title of the song, in this remake it's set during the daytime so the song title no longer makes any sense and some scenes from the original have been removed.
What annoyed me about this movie besides the changes, we all know how I feel about change, is that all the personality from the original is non-existent. This movie is soul-less, so much of the humour and mysticism of the original has been completely removed and replaced with an overly serious attempt to make an epic movie and it does not work.
With hand-drawn animation you can create emotion in the faces of the characters, in this that has disappeared and especially in the scene of the stampede and Simba screaming 'Nooo', it just looks like a cub opening its mouth, there is no emotion in the eyes that we saw in the original.
Jon Favreau did great work directing films like 'Iron Man' and 'Elf', but here he hasn't even attempted to make it his version, he has copied original directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff shot for shot. I remember when Gus Van Sant remade 'Psycho' in 1998 and it was a shot for shot remake of the Hitchcock classic and I watched thinking 'why?', the original 'Psycho' was already a classic, it was already magnificent, everybody loved it, so what is the point if you are not going to put your own spin or vision into it. Same goes for this remake, WHY???? What is the point?.................oh yes, of course, money! It is basically a cash grab.
I will always love the original. I will always want to watch the original over this. I know that there will be people out there that will adore this movie, who will want to see it to see what it offers, the same movie but with a different look and more realistic characters, and if that's all you want from it, if that's all you're looking for then you will enjoy it, as I said before, the visuals are seriously incredible, but if you are a fan of the original and are planning to see this for a new spin on it or for something fresh or unique then you are going to be very disappointed.
However, there is also the argument that if Jon Favreau had done a new version, a reworking that changed everything then there would be a mass outcry of 'Oh my god, you have ruined The Lion King for me, what have you done?', so it brings me round again to, 'What's the point?' It should never have been done!
I would recommend waiting for this to come out on TV or Sky etc, don't waste your money at the cinema. Or better still, please just stick to the original.
I also understand that there are more 'live-action' remakes in the works, 'The Little Mermaid' is apparently the next one and I can see them destroying that one too.

I don't care how ""evil"" you are, there's no such thing, just because your a villain in a movie. Scars evilness doesn't change nature. Just a stupid movie all around. The voice work it's pretty weak too. They have some well known actors in this, but it's for name only. None of them really stand out.",The Lion King

It looks absolutely magnificent, the live actions animals are amazing. It is largely a shot for shot remake of The Lion King though with some changes. I am not surprised about the low ratings though because ultimately the heart does not shine through this beautiful story like it did in the original, and its very difficult to explain why.",The Lion King
392,walkingwithprimeval,Jon Favreau was a great director until now,4,4 March 2020,"I'm aware that some people like this movie and to that I say ""good for you"". Feel free to love whatever you want. I mean, what right do I (or anyone else) have to take that enjoyment away from you. These are just my own thoughts on why the film in question didn't quite work for me, so if you don't agree with me then that's fine because we're all entitled to have our own personal opinions. For the most part, I've been totally fine with Disney wanting to remake their animated films into a live-action setting because at the very least they try to differentiate them from the originals. I can't however say the same about The Lion King.So why didn't I like this? Well, it's probably for the same reason why I'm not overly fond of Peter Jackson's three-hour-long King Kong remake (2005). It was nothing more than an exact shot-for-shot remake which, in my personal opinion, is one of the most laziest things a remake could possibly do! They just didn't try to put any effort into making the story feel different at all, which is the whole point of remaking something in the first place, so therefore this pointless remake has no real reason to even exist. It shows a serious lack of creativity and originality in Hollywood today, which is something I find really sad. This is why I like the new Spider-Man films so much, it's because they're trying to be different from the old Toby Maguire ones.Another aspect that kind of irked me about the film was the fact it isn't really ""live-action"" like how people say it is because they made the film entirely inside a computer so it's technically all animated. The bone-idle filmmakers could've been practical with their decisions, by going on location to shoot some scenes in the vast landscapes of the real African wilderness and then add the computer-generated animals in later on during post-production. But I guess they just couldn't be bothered so they settled on doing the whole thing in ""photorealistic-CGI"" instead, which is why most of the so called ""natural habitats"" and supposed ""real-world environments"" all felt artificial to me, because it didn't feel as if I were watching a live-action film actually play out (the human eye can detect fake stuff fairly easy, especially when it comes to digital graphics).At the end of the day, what it all boils down to is the fact that the Disney Company knows their unnecessary remakes will sell like hotcakes because they're strategically targeted towards the very large demographic of people whose nostalgic minds are permanently stuck in the past and as a result are unable to move on and broaden their horizons by giving new and original films a try out.",The Lion King

We go to relive a childhood film and see it's transformation into a computerised real life film.
Nothing in this film was real, even the trees, but it all looked so real and impressive.As the film starts and you hear the start of Circle of Life you should get that instant body chill, but this version just wasn't as powerful as the original. It left me unsatisfied, and to think this is only the beginning of the film where it needs to live up to expectation.This film publicity circled SO MUCH around Beyonce to hype fans up for the Beyhive fans. I like her as an artist, but personally I feel as though her voice for Nala was a terrible choice. There was just no emotion in her voice and seemed to always be one tone. I'm sure there would've been a better choice than Beyonce but I understand they locked in a huge pop artist to promote a film and bring in some coin.Overall I really enjoyed the film, the graphics were impressive and so real life looking, but it was the music and Beyonce that let it down for me.",The Lion King

I'm torn on whether more CGI emotion should have been added to the animals. Millennials have emotions too! I'm torn on whether or not Beyonce should have been cast to talk as opposed to just sing only. Her singing was great! So, for those reasons, I give the movie a 9/10.

397,DJKwa,"If Anything, It's a Monumental Technical Achievement",7,12 July 2019,"As nature documentaries go, the modern remake of The Lion King (2019) gives some of the best a run for their money, quite literally. With a $250 million price tag, it achieves digitally what David Attenborough has spent his life capturing on camera. The result is jaw-droppingly photorealistic, but it also makes for a strange first impression. Imagine watching a Disneynature feature but with actors reading The Lion King screenplay over the top of it and the effect would be eerily similar. It takes time to accept lifelike looking animals talking like cartoon characters, but the ground-breaking technical skill in which they are brought to life makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.Every tress of fur, crack in the arid soil and sun-swept vista is rendered in such immense detail that it's unsurprising that many people are calling this reboot live-action. It's a monumental technical achievement and the level of visual fidelity on display alone warrants seeing this film on the biggest screen possible.However, in terms of the story, the film follows the original so closely that it can't help but feel second rate. Scene-by-scene, it dutifully ticks off the story beats of the 1994 original, with little by way of surprises in-between. It also doesn't help that film's photo-realism unavoidably limits the ability of the animals to convey emotion without looking unnatural or (naturally) cartoonish, and the result is a film that often creates indifference where there should be wonder. With jaw-dropping visuals, plenty of humour and solid renditions of timeless songs, it's hard to see this modern remake failing but, as it turns out, The Lion King's (2019) biggest achievement also ends up being its biggest flaw.",The Lion King
398,jared79,It's unfortunate,5,7 March 2020,"This movie looked amazing, the CGI is the best I've ever seen.Herein lies the problem. Because they looked like real lions and animals, the voices felt disconnected. Add to that the lack of emotion an animal shows and you've got not much else. The main music was great, Hanz Zimmer is a master. But the songs didn't work. There was no fun in them, I get they where trying to make it realistic and therefor giraffes and hippos building a pyramid would be far fetched, but you notice when it's not there. Also, Beyoncé, bad choice, she over sings everything.The new song she sings is forgettable and made me wonder why they bothered.The only decent part was Timon and Pumbaa.And what happened to Ed?It feels like they sat down and said, which of the best characters and voice actors can we remove or replace.Too many in my opinion.",The Lion King
399,bestfootie,I'll try to be fair.,6,23 June 2020,"I'm a massive fan of The Lion King (1994). I watched it
when I was about 13 and remember crying at the two relevant points. I'm trauma-bonded with it.First the positives. I thought the way the animals were generated were very life-like. They looked incredible in 4k. The created environments were also fab and gorgeous. I liked the fight scene with Nala and Shezi which was a new addition. Timon and pumba are probably the best characters.However:-1. The film lacks all emotion. The actors speak terribly slowly and with no pinache.2. Scar is rendered oddly.3. The songs (which were so excellently done in the original) fell flat.4. What happened to the birdie boiler scene. Just removed. Young Simba lacks the courage he has in the original (e.g. where he goes back to help Nala when they're in the elephants' graveyard and scratches the hyena).",The Lion King

In this politically correct madhouse we live in now, Jeremy Irons would have never voiced Scar...you see, he's too white and Anglo.

403,jericha-27402,Missing the Soul of the Original,6,23 July 2019,"Children will like this movie. Adults may have a hard time with it. Obviously the biggest downfall of this film was the fact that it didn't deviate enough from the original. Did the director truly believe that it was a good idea to make a carbon copy of the original? Apparently yes. Did Scar deliver a fine performance? The actor did okay, but the problem is the audience is accustomed to Scar's lines being delivered differently. Maybe if the director would have made a total different characterization of Scar, the movie would have been better. Why was Beyoncé in this film? Who knows. Her version of Nala contributed nothing to the story itself. Why was Donald Glover casted? Because he is black and hip. And I'm a black woman saying this. The voice actors' skin color did not matter! Lions are neither black or white. They are lions, which makes the decision to cast Beyoncé and Donald Glover even more frustrating! I don't see how any director can sacrifice great voice acting because of race (especially since the race isn't important to the story). Jeremy Irons should have been brought back. End of discussion.On another note, young Simba was fine until the death scene. The crying sounded a bit fake, but he was okay in the film despite this. Young Nala was excellent. Timon and Pumba are almost as good as the original actors. James Earl Jones is great too. The hyenas have some nice characterization as well.I will also say that the Afrocentric aspect was lost in this film despite the fact that the cast was mostly black. There weren't enough African drums and rhythms in this remake. Honestly, the original captured Africa better than the remake. I would have loved to see Ryan Coogler's interpretation of the Lion King instead of this lifeless Afrocentric interpretation. Overall, the original Lion King was gorgeous (despite the fact that it was plagiarism) and the remake is only impressive on a technical level.",The Lion King
404,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,Superfluous version of the most beautiful story ever developed by Disney,5,18 July 2019,"The problem with the LK19 is that a repetition of a work of art only works in 'life art' (theater, music, etc.) and not in 'recorded' art.Having said that, Lion King is a dramatic story and needs dramatic expression from actors. Real animals cannot deliver that on their faces. It makes all characters in LK19 like paper-dolls in a human dramatic setting.
Furthermore, dramatic highlights in the film do not get room to be processed by the viewer, due to too quick transitions in story-line and/or hasty edit.
Then music.... o boy...
The music score is not surprising. The songs are not sparkling new and lack all the humor and sensitivity of the original. The 'classical-music' sequences were repeated too much, so that their effect of compassion and forgiveness was completely weakened. Disaster, because that emotion makes the story transforms the stories energy to a spiritual one.But the biggest problem of LK19 is the actors and their voice-over. Not only badly acted, but also a sloppy volume control that makes it not consistent with the mis-and-scene. And above all...no stratification in interpretation; so every dramatic possibility in voice is hopelessly killed (how I missed J Irons as Scar, who made me feel compassion for this psychologically imprisoned villain)In short, a superfluous remake of the most beautiful story ever developed by Disney.",The Lion King

1, Voice acting is monotone, forced and devoid of genuine emotion (except Seth Rogen).
2. Though the animation in general was amazing, there was a lack of emotion on the faces and in the eyes of the characters. It's a bit like those shows where it's real animal footage with human voices.

407,vandrist,"Slimy, yet satisfying, with none of the Disney magic!!",7,19 July 2019,"Visually this movie is phenomenal and realistic, it felt like you were watching and experiencing a true live action remake which felt like you were watching an episode of LIFE. Unfortunately what it made up for in visuals, lacked it almost every other way. There are key moments from the original that I felt spoke to me the most were omitted from this remake. It felt as though the actors were just saying their lines and didn't show the emotion or soul that viewers were owed. For the most part there weren't anyone that stuck out. James Earl Jones has always been the standout with his voice still being as powerful. I think casting was a bit of an issue. I think Donald Glover would have been more suited for young Simba and probably would have killed it. Timone ane Pumba started to grow on me the more the movie went on, but there's no replacing Nathan Lane. John Oliver came across as annoying sometimes as Zazu. I didn't feel the soul in Rafiki for most of his part. The beginning was a tad disappointing, I couldn't wait for young Simba to grow up, middle was very good and the ending was just okay. And the songs just didn't really do it for me. Spirit wasn't really put in the right part of the movie. The songs that weren't sung by the actors still held true to the original and Hans Zimmer did his thing.In my honest opinion if this was a shot for shot remake of the original it would have been a slam dunk but it get more like a cash grab. I think it was better than Aladdin, but maybe if they took Mulan's approach it could have been a different movie entirely.Visuals: 10/10

Disney... there you go, there's your answer. Even the voice acting is what i can only describe as half assed, but then again i'd expect nothing less from someone like Seth Rogan doing a Disney film.I'm so fed up with Disney, Marvel, DC Comics. all their movies are designed to be is just giant cash grabs.

434,AnAverageNerd,Worse performances but better looking,6,31 August 2020,"The visuals in this film are incredible and steal the show as they should do. However, this may be one of the more underwhelming films of recent times especially, if like me, you swear by the original. The dialogue is almost copy and pasted from the first film (James Earl Jones may as well not have bothered turning up) but if you grow up with the original than that's who that dialogue belongs to and anyone else does it a disservice. The music is also not as emotionally invoking and just feels like an extra thrown in to add more to the film. I feel it is unjust to rate this below a 6 due to the visuals being so amazing however if you have to pick then the original is the way to go.",The Lion King
435,pirlo2004,Looks fantastic - Doesn't sound great - lacks soul!,5,20 October 2019,"Visually I found this stunning, and I liked the fact it didn't move away from the original too much!That being said, it just didn't seem to have any soul and I can't really put my finger on why! Some of the voice acting was pretty poor, particularly adult Simba and Nala, there just seemed to be a disconnect to what was on the screen and how it was voiced. You need voice charisma by the bucketload to do these sorts of things I feel, and it just wasn't there, which is unfortunate!
Also, some of the songs missed the mark too, I mean it's quite a tough ask to replicate such iconic originals, but a few did actually work, it's just that most didn't, particularly Circle of Life at the beginning!So, an ok film, wouldn't watch it again though and my 7 year old went off to play after an hour or so! Says it all really!",The Lion King
436,ilpo-surokivi,Great adaptation,8,17 September 2020,I liked this movie and I do acknowledge the characters have less facial expressions but duh...it's Lion King with real looking lions. In my opinion it is unfair to compare realistic looking lions to realistic looking ones. The plot is basically the same so nothing to review there. Same great story as it used to be. Great movie in my opinion if you just acknowledge that it's a live action version.,The Lion King
437,mwcanadian,"It wasn't bad as some say, but it's not the original",5,24 September 2019,"I didn't hate this, in fact it is the best of the 3 remakes that I've seen. Scar was as slimy as the other character was, if not more. The only thing I hated about his character is he didn't sing ""Be Prepared"" and more or less spoke it.
Simba and Nala seemed to be getting trashed here, but I didn't hate them. They did as well as to be expected, though again it's not the original.
Rafiki isn't as silly and how he found out Simba was alive was a nasty scene when I stopped eating popcorn. No need for that. Timon and Pumba were just ok, nothing like the original.
So I give it a C plus, 5 stars only, just an average movie, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast were FAR worse",The Lion King
438,palistineroyal,Stunning Movie,5,19 July 2019,I haven't fully watched the original but something about this one just felt forced.

The original was a masterpiece and this isn't for sure, however it is still entertaining and fun. The casting of ?Beyoncé was a huge error and Glover is not much better.

441,WillsFilms,The Lion King Roars Like A Cub,2,26 July 2019,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be good and it really wasn't. There isn't much to say about this movie as it's pretty much exactly the same as the 1994 classic. It's pretty much a copy that misses everything that made the original so amazing. There are a few decent changes, such as a few hints about Scar's backstory and a few nice new lines, but overall there isn't anything I can say to justify wasting your time. The voice actors are alright, but inferior to the ones from the original film and even James Earl Jones sounds bored throughout most of his screen time. However, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was terrible. He delivered way too many of his lines with his voice raised, shouting a majority of his dialogue. What made Jeremy Irons so fantastic was that he delivered a lot of his lines calmly, but sinisterly, while Ejiofor went for the complete opposite approach that doesn't work nearly as well. The CGI is fantastic, but the realistic looking lions causes the characters to be completely expressionless, despite the emotion coming from the voices of the actors. The score is also incredible, but it's still mostly the same music from the original film. In summary, watching this movie is a complete waste of time and money when there's a much better movie out there that is completely identical. Don't see this movie, watch the original classic and thank me later.",The Lion King
442,Ryan_Barbakins,"A Lifeless, Pretentious Throwback",3,24 July 2019,"The biggest problem Disney's live-action remakes have encountered centers around the personification of real-life animals. In animation, the artist has the ability to express emotions on an animal's face, because the canvas is not heavily based upon the reality of the animal. However, in the Lion King 2019, the animals are CG and rendered to look like real animals, and they do, however it is at the expense of the ability to personify the characters. And since literally every single character in this movie is a computer generated animal, every single one of them cannot show emotion on screen. This absolutely kills all emotional sequences in the movie that touched viewers in the original animated version. You know that there is a problem when I am laughing at one of the saddest scenes in all of Disney movies (Mufasa's Death). The way Simba looked when he saw his father falling to his death was just how any normal lion would look if their mouth was open. Taking away the personification of the characters made the entire movie feel Lifeless.
Every new thing added to this movie felt unnecessary. Right at the beginning, after the Circle of Life, we get an extended sequence of a mouse moving around the dirt and grass to eventually fall victim to Scar. Why was this in the movie? Because Disney wanted to show off their photo realism (which I cannot deny, does look very impressive) and fill more time in the movie. Not much story aspects were changed, probably because the average person considers the original Lion King to be a masterpiece, but the main thing I noticed, was that the leader of the Hyenas was much more assertive, and powerful. This caused the 2 other Hyenas of the trio were intimidated by her, and even go as far as to lying to the leader about Simba's ""Death"". This never really got a payoff, and just feels plain unnecessary, and just a second but lesser version of Scar. Speaking of Scar, ""Be Prepared"", one of the most epic Disney Villain songs, was downgraded by 50. The entire song was building up to the climax of the familiar chorus, and then when it got there, it just stopped. The entire song was only buildup meant to excite. Overall, everything new added to the movie just felt like a way to show off, or get a positive reaction, even if what was being shown wasn't anything too extraordinary, and came off as Pretentious.
However, in all the rubble, there are still some good things in this. The voice acting was pretty good, (however this doesn't serve as a substitute for the lack of visible emotion in the characters). The CGI looks real, and the opening scene with the Circle of Life is actually really cool! The songs aren't even that bad either. Most Disney live-action remakes have an abundance of auto tune in their remastered songs, however this movie doesn't seem to have that much. And that's it. That's all the good I can say about this movie.
I don't hate all Disney Live-Action remakes. I liked Aladdin, because it had a lot of changes to the original, and even improved upon it in some areas. (also the main characters are humans not animals) Judging from the trailer, Mulan looks like it will be much more dramatic, and will twist up the original story with new elements, and that is great. However, I cannot bring myself to say that I liked this film, when the characters all have the same emotionless expression, and it barley has any new elements, and those new elements feel unnecessary. If you want to watch this movie, just watch the original 1994 animated version instead, because it is the same thing with actual emotion heart.",The Lion King
443,VOIIIXI,Insulting and terrible.,1,1 October 2020,"These Disney remakes and especially The Lion King are a perfect example of why it's a terrible idea to do realistic versions with no emotions of animated movies. It's insulting to ruin an iconic movie with this cash grab national geographic documentary. It's an embarrassing film and more embarrassing are the brain dead people who give it high rating. This movie has no emotions or impact or soul or anything, you can't connect with any character or feel anything. This is basically a movie just to show how good CGI has become, an experiment. And Disney won't stop because stupid people will keep paying for these things because people are so gullible to anything they'll watch Fast and Furious 28. This movie ruins the creativity of making good movie and encourages big film companies and producers to just make cash grabs instead of creative films. Terrible 0/10.",The Lion King
444,stuartpbottomley,Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should,5,25 July 2019,"The original Lion King is one of the best traditional films of all time so why remake it almost frame for frame. It add nothing significant to mix. It feels like some handed in a handwritten school essay that got a A+ then someone copied the essay, typed up on a pc with an extra sentence here and an extra paragraph there but it's still the same essay. I don't mind remakes as long as they bring something new to the mix. Had this film not already been made and made very well, I would have given it a 9 maybe even 10. We can only hope the remakes of Mulan and The Little Mermaid add something new",The Lion King

446,deandsouza15892,"Decent, if you've not seen the original",8,30 July 2019,"As a person who walked into The Lion King 2019, with no past baggage or childhood nostalgia, I'd say this was quite a pleasant experience.Let's go over the pros -for starters, this film is visually incredible,no doubt about it. There are legitimate moments where I would believe that these are real animals in the wild; they look,act and sound like their realistic counterparts. It's a beautiful movie to watch.The humor,when it's there,is incredible. I am,of course, referring to Timon and Pumba. I have no idea how they performed in the original,but I'm sold on a Lion King 1.5 sequel. They share genuine banter, which really lighten the tone of the film.In terms of negatives, you've probably already heard,but the film is pretty bland. The lions have no real emotion, nor are they allowed to,cause it would be hard to animate. In that sense,this comes off as a nature documentary, with A-list actors performing mediocre dubs. I don't even blame the actors,it's just that since the animation is so real, the emotions couldn't be. Speaking of which, there's also a weird disconnect between scenes that are clearly meant to be brutal (the stampede, the final fight),but are toned down to PG13 . It takes you slightly off rhythm, because you want it to be real,but you know Disney won't show you the blood and gore.All in all, I'd say this film works best as a chapter in a photorealism course for budding visual effects artists. I enjoyed it (having nothing to compare to), but if anything, it's gotten me excited to see the original,as well as the Broadway play. I know there's better versions out there, so I'm comfortable not thinking too much about this one.",The Lion King
447,dtrani,Beautiful...But just a simple copy,6,10 August 2019,"I want to rate this film an 8 so badly. The art and CGI in this film is beyond beautiful, accompanying a beautiful soundtrack that is so pleasing to the ears. This film brought out many emotions out of myself and I definitely enjoyed it.
Unfortunately, all the emotions I was feeling, came from the features that were already present in the previous film. The film brings nothing new to their film and tries to be as similar to the original as possible. This is not necessarily wrong, since its a remake, audiences criticize filmmakers when they change things up from their childhood films. But it seems like when I watched this movie, everything I was loving about it, was not creatively made by them.
The score, for example, is beautiful and toys with my emotions the most, but was originally produced for the original film. This does not mean that I believe that they should've developed their own totally new soundtrack, but it's not like I can applaud John Favreau and his team for this either.
Favreau did an absolute amazing job with making sure his film had the top-notch CGI and I can applaud him on THIS. All I can say is that it was well-crafted, but has nothing new brought out except its CGI.",The Lion King

454,burkholdermicah,"Hail to Disney's powerful, visually stunning Remake!",10,13 July 2019,"It's back. Bigger and better than ever.It's ""The Lion King.""How do you improve on a classic, which the 1994 animated Disney movie indisputably is?Indisputably, Disney has done it with this remake, coming to theaters July 19.The original is visually stunning, deeply moving, splendidly acted. The new version, a half-hour longer than the 98-minute original, likewise.Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have wisely retained all the elements that make the '94 picture - directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, and written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, Linda Woolverton and a host of story contributors - so powerful and narratively complex. Also, all the great songs from Elton John and Tim Rice have been retained.Many of the scenes in the remake are shot-for-shot re-creations of passages from the original. Cub Simba placing a tiny paw in the big footprint of his father, Mufasa? Big shoes (er, feet) to fill. It's there. Young Simba gazing at his reflection in a pool of water, seeing the image of his father and thereby understanding his destiny to be his father's living legacy? You saw it once. Now see it again.Why mess with success?The new version amplifies and deepens all that is good in the original. The key is in the visuals. Photorealistic computer-generated imagery renders its African landscapes and animals with astonishing realism.Favreau and the studio's production team did the same thing with the 2016 remake of ""The Jungle Book."" Their work in ""Lion King"" is even more impressive.From the movie's opening moments - sunrise over the savanna, animals of all species converging on Pride Rock to celebrate the arrival of baby Simba, held aloft by the mandrill Rafiki, accompanied by the triumphant cry that introduces ""The Circle of Life"" anthem - the power of the imagery takes the breath away.In a later scene when Mufasa (voiced as in the original by James Earl Jones; why mess with success?) stands atop a high promontory with cub Simba by his side and explains how the vast veld that stretches before them is the lions' kingdom, the vista is indeed remarkably expansive and magnificent.A change from the original is the presence of primarily African-American and African actors as the voices of key roles. These include Beyoncé as the voice of Simba's betrothed, Nala (Shahadi Wright Joseph voices Nala as a cub); Donald Glover as the grown-up Simba, taking over from Matthew Broderick (young singer-actor JD McCrary voices him as a cub); and Alfre Woodard as Simba's mother, Sarabi.Most significant is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who supplies the voice for the villain Scar. Where Jeremy Irons delivered Scar's lines with silky malevolence in the '94 version, Ejiofor infuses his delivery with a roughened rage.Great villains often make for great stories, providing great challenges for the hero to overcome, and Scar, scuffed-up and mangy-looking in this incarnation, is an apex bad guy.Fueled by his resentment at being denied the throne by the existence of his brother Mufasa's son, he murders the father and insidiously guilt-trips Simba, making him believe he is the one responsible for his father's death. Scar's recruitment of the hyenas as his enforcers deepens the evil. And the CG hyenas, slinking and predatory, are vile as vile can be.Offsetting the evil are the clowns in the piece, Pumbaa the warthog (Seth Rogen) and his buddy Timon the meerkat (Billy Eichner). Their comic byplay - Pumbaa, ever overeager, and Timon, vainglorious and slyly mocking of his pal - are delightful scene-stealers, and their singing of ""Hakuna Matata"" is a giddy high point.With its message of reverence for the interconnectedness of life (it hits ""The Circle of Life"" theme hard and repeatedly), ""Lion King"" is a deeply moving experience. All hail this ""King.""",The Lion King

457,maidwell-45616,Don't believe the 1 star reviews.,6,12 October 2019,"This post is a direct response to the 1 star reviewers...
First off this is a scene for scene remake of the original 90s movie.. if you wanted something else then you are confused about the difference between remakes and reboots.
Secondly people seemed shocked that Disney are cashing in on their heritage, that's what they've done since (ironically) the original lion king.. do you not remember the truly woeful lion king 3? And all the cash ins since. This is not a new Hollywood concept people.As for the movie itself The CGI is nothing short of jaw-dropping, truly spectacular in every moment of the two hour run time.
Story and script wise it's almost word for word the same as the original (my favourite Disney cartoon).
The criticism about it being emotionless stems in part from the utterly life-like animals not having cartoon faces with over the top facial expressions, they are made to look completely real (except for the talking of course!) I loved seeing ""real"" animals on screen substituting for the now outdated 90s cartoon versions.
Yes there are some casting missteps, in particular Beyonce.. if you like her over-singing style then great but the delivery of her acting lines is incredibly wooden.
Is this movie a masterpiece? No, not even close as it plays it far too safe in copy and pasting the original but It's a faithful remake of a Disney classic using achingly beautiful imagery and that makes it so much better than 1 stars.",The Lion King
458,creedreaper,Actually came back home afterwards and Re-Watched the Original,3,22 July 2019,"Okay after reading all the negative reviews I really wanted to like this re-make and went in with full open mind but it definitely fell short BIGGGG time. I am a fan of Jon Favreau but sadly I think he got too caught up in the CGI of this and totally overlooked the voice-overs.Besides Seth Rogan as Pumba, I think they butchered every character development. I actually came back home after watching it in theaters and re-watched the original and it's by faaaar waaay more superior. Every voice over actor nailed it, humor was top notch and it had the emotion which I did not get from the new one unfortunately.Personally I feel if you were going to keep everything the same, then the voice acting should've surpass the original OR don't bother.

Story wise it's the same, I personally don't have a problem with a same storyline but I guess other people might not prefer it.My no.1 problem is Scar. His appearance is meh but acceptable since the haggard look gives it justice.. it's the voice that's the problem. Nothing against Chiwetel, he's fine in his movies but here though. If you're like me who loves OG Scar's sassy, flamboyant villain voice then Chiwetel sounds dead. He sounds like D movie villains. No emotion except to be butch and deep sounding.. the added short song of Be Prepared was just heartbreaking. I mean even at the beginning of the trailer when he says ""Runaway Simba and never return"".. it was just like somebody reading their lines. There are of course some good moments where he did sound like a crazy lion which is nice but overall eh.Next are the song sequence paired with bland facial expressions. Okay I get that they are going for a hyperreal look but seriously? Realistic can also include dream sequences. The Can't Wait To Be King sequence should have been more fun (the va for Simba is spot on btw!). I mean prey are already acting weird around a predator already (ie celebrating Simba's birth) so why not go for broke instead of just choosing some scenes to ground in realism.The Can You Feel The Love Tonight was also dead. No hate on Beyonce but she basically drowned Donald. Girl stop. This is a duet. No love. No magic. No tumbling down the hill.They did it right with Timon and Pumba. Even with the real face they paired it with more body excitement so you can actually feel their reactions like the peeter patter of Pumba when they got to keep Simba or when Timon jumped up when he realized Simba's a lion. I mean even dogs and cats have a lot of facial expressions so why would giving lions facial expression be wrong?",The Lion King

(5/10)It seems the Circle of Life nowadays is being a grown man watching a Disney reboot of a beloved animated film from childhood. We've had three of those this summer alone, and the latest - a remake of one of their greatest - The Lion King is aggressively mediocre in every department except for the visuals. Jon Favreau's aggressively mediocre retelling lacks heart and nuance.
The story remains the same, but if you're only interested in gawping at the visual boundaries a film could push The Lion King will blow your mind because there is absolutely no way to tell where the 'live action' ends and the CGI animation begins. Everything, from a blade of grass to the eyeballs and fur of the lions is 100 percent photorealistic. Director Jon Favreau employs the same hyper realism technique he did in the terrific The Jungle Book, but the results here are far less effective.
Making this film hyper real looking exposes two vital downsides of the original - that it has a simplistic story, and cliché and cringey. The original was such a classic because it hid those downsides with beautiful, colourful animation, sympathetic, emotionally charged faces on the animals, and an extraordinary soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Elton John to tug at your heartstrings during the emotionally heavy moments. Favreau removes these very elements in the remake, making this a drab looking film bereft of colour, with the animals having no emotional core, and adds atrocious remixes of the classic songs.
Things 'happen' in this film - but they don't carry much weight. Simba's journey is supposed to be transformational and heroic, but the transitions are too quick and lack energy. The message is very much there - that a man shielded by privilege needs to step out and live with the commoners to gain a better perspective on life, and this remake had a golden opportunity to dig deeper into these themes, but the script by Jeff Nathanson makes no such effort. The final fight isn't as exciting and emotional as the original, and the same goes for Mufasa's death.
Disney has retooled some of its classic stories to make them more progressive and nuanced, but we don't see that in this Lion King. The comic relief comes predictably from Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumba (Seth Rogen) but here's the thing about this whole cast - there's no shaking away their personalities which are given a bigger focus that the characters in the story. The film pushes celebrity faces rather than good storytelling. If there's any statement this film makes it is that voice actors need to get back into recording booths - films like these are not going to make less money by giving experts jobs that utilise their expertise.",The Lion King

Sadly, the music was massively underwhelming with 'phoned in' vocals by 2 of R&B's reputedly finest vocalists Beyoncé and Childish Gambino. And why are the best moments of this PC 'child friendly' version - though spectacular sonically and visually - the most violent parts of the story? All of the poignant and hilarious moments of the original movie have been diluted and in some instances, surgically removed. Are the makers seriously catering to a new generation of kids that will suck up and feast on this modern way of telling stories?

What's good.. the CG looks very real and at no point in time does it look unreal. You want to believe that the Lions are really talking or moving. It's almost a remake of the original movie scene to scene.. almost. What's bad.. certain scenes in the original movie had a lot of charm.. like Rafiki advising Simba to come back, which I thought was quite tame in the remake. Because the original movie was animated the expressions from the characters added to the emotional scenes which could not be achieved in the remake. Watchable.. but I am still a fan of the original movie.",The Lion King
477,taywarren29,No facial expressions?,6,29 January 2020,The only disappointment I had with this movie was the complete failure in CGI with the lions facial expressions. It took me an entire 24 hours after the movie to figure out why I didn't like it and I had to go back and watch the original to see why and that was it. The movie was BEAUTIFUL though. They did an amazing job from an artistic standpoint and even switched up some of the scenes and the humor which I appreciated.,The Lion King
478,jre-5,"Not very emotional and a little too predictable, but still fun",7,26 August 2019,"It's unbelievable how realistic the animals and scenery appear, it's hard to believe that it's animated and not filmed. I remember as a kid being astonished by the animation of the original film, but that was nothing compared to this. It's a shame that the realism made it so that the animals couldn't really show any emotion. I guess ""real"" looking animals and emotional stories just don't mix. The makers undoubtedly could've given the animals emotional expressions if they had chosen to. But when you stop and think about it, it is ""understandable"" why they didn't. I'm not necessarily saying that it was the right decision, but since the animals look real (as opposed to hand drawn artwork), it probably would've looked a little weird if they had showed emotions, since most real animals do not.The voice acting wasn't very good. I never thought there was anything special about the voices in the original film, but they were better than most of these. It also seemed a little weird that so many of the lines were pretty much identical to the original, this undoubtedly makes the new voices seem even worse for those of us who remember the way they sounded before. I really think they should've rewritten most of the lines and made more new events. The movie does have some new scenes, I liked the scene where Nala flees the land, this was a nice addition. But most of the scenes are pretty much the same as the original. It also became a bit boring at times. I think it would've been better if they had made more additions and changes, and perhaps some new songs.I think it's really neat when animated movies are remade in live action form (or seemingly live action form in this case).

They can't show emotions the same way as humans. If they did that, it would take away from the realism. I was also actually quite impressed with the voice acting. I also appreciated the amazing realistic graphics and choices they made. For example, the leader of the hyenas being female, which is true to the matriarchal society of hyenas. Also, you're not going to feel the same way after seeing a movie a bunch of times and then setting it again as a remake as you already know what's going to happen.

Another thing I didn't like were the amount of useless scenes in the movie. I know that those were present in the original as well but they can still be cut out. The animals looked great and they actually ""filmed"" in Africa. There was also a fairly subtle Beauty and the Beast reference from Timon and Pumbaa that I liked and all throughout Zazu, Timon, Pumbaa, Kamari, and Azizi were our comic relief and they were good at it.

At times, you would hear the voice over but there was no movement from the CGI animal's mouth. Yes, it's not the same as the animated film, but come on, the comparisons are inevitable when you make an attempt like this.The song Beyonce did (Spirit, I think it's called) added nothing to the story line or to the film itself... and hey, while we're at it, why was Beyonce's involvement so hyped up??? Nala isn't the main character, and adult Nala has even fewer lines than the young Nala. I've always found Beyonce to be overrated as an actress, and here she sounds like she was reciting the words for the first time.
Rafiki had a somewhat reduced role in the film, which was disappointing given how he's the one who truly convinces Simba to return by knocking him on the head with a stick. It seemed like that was done to better showcase Beyonce's role as Nala.My favorite song ""Be Prepared"" was completely butchered. It's such a great, powerful song by a truly contemptible Disney villain willing to do anything to get ahead. However, it was spoken instead of sung, and was terrible. Scar didn't seem vindictive here, or even evil- just permanently cranky. I like the actor doing Scar's voice (I never spell his name correctly though so I won't attempt it now), but this was completely wrong for him. The role needs an actor like Jeremy Irons, whose powerful voice conveyed so much emotion and delivery of his lines made Scar come to life. Irons was a match for the power of James Earl Jones' commanding voice- this actor, sadly, is not.The only saving graces, for me, were James Earl Jones as Mufasa again, and surprisingly Seth Rogen as Pumba who added the necessary comedy to the role.In a film where the animals are supposed to be so life like, this film seemed incredibly lifeless.

There were some scenes left out that were in the original that I wanted to see. The singing for the most part was good. The only song I didn't like was ""Be Prepared"".

490,PradoCedric,"A massively disappointing live-action adaptation that serves as inferior to the original, with no further improvement",4,15 July 2019,"As much as the live-action adaptations from Disney have been controversial as of late, the live-action of The Lion King (despite being all rendered as CGI) is without a doubt, the most pointless and unnecessary live-action remake to date.Nothing about this remake improves anything and it even doesn't take a risk. It's utterly shot-for-shot, which almost draws unfavorable and negative comparisons to the infamous Gus van Sant's 1998 remake of Psycho (a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 Psycho), of which The Lion King original and the remake had the same story, with the remake giving no further improvement. The difference of the two, in terms of the technique, is that the original features traditional hand-drawn animation, whereas the remake features photorealistic CGI animation.Another problem that The Lion King remake faces, is with the inability of the CGI lions to convey emotions and its difficult translation of its voice talents within the emotions of the CGI lions, which makes it difficult for audiences to relate to the lion characters' emotions and its expressions, which can turned towards uncanny valley.Another problem within this remake have, comes with the voice acting performances and the results are truly underwhelming, to say the least. Donald Glover and Beyonce are seem to be miscasted as both Simba and Nala, and despite their incredible singing performances and particularly their rendition of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" song, their voice acting comes as the weakest. Chiwetel Ejiofor tries to bring his unique style and menacing qualities as Scar but falls short to the more superior Jeremy Iron's Scar. John Oliver serves as a poor substitute for Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Worse of all, Alfre Woodard's, John Kani's, Keegan-Michael Key's and Eric Andre's voice performances, were underutilized and wasted.Still, The Lion King remake is not without its redeemable qualities. Even with the problems of the CGI lions in its difficult expression of emotions, much of the CGI qualities of the lions as well as other animals is featured as utterly realistic, which makes it the most mind-blowing CGI creations that the animals are featured into cinema, given the fact that the technology that was used in The Jungle Book was used to the higher degree within this remake, of which that use of the visual effects being displayed in this remake as groundbreaking.Out of all the voice cast, only a few stand-out as the best; with Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen giving out their best chemistry and performances as Timon and Pumbaa, nearly stealing the whole show. Other stand-outs within the movie, were James Earl Jones as Mufasa (a performance that remains endearing and powerful, despite being oddly weary and underutilized), Florence Kasumba as Shenzi, JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph as both the younger versions of Simba and Nala.In the end, The Lion King remake features no heart, vitality, spirit, magic, mysticism, and power that the original possesses, and is considered as inferior to the 1994 animated original. The Lion King remake is considered as a massive disappointment and will end up age horribly, whereas the 1994 animated original remains as a superior and timeless masterpiece that will remain to stand the test of time, and for generations to come. All the visual effects in the world cannot replace the pure Disney magic that was brought to life by the original entire cast and crew in the 1994 animated masterpiece.",The Lion King

493,joshteggert,Jon Favreau's 'The Lion King' strips the original of all its heart and soul to the point where each and every shot - no matter how aesthetically appealing - feels hollow.,4,12 August 2019,"Twenty-five years since Pride Rock first graced the big screen, the timeless story of The Lion King makes a strangely perfunctory return in Jon Favreau's (The Jungle Book, Iron Man) reconceptualization of the 1994 classic. Once again, the narrative follows Simba (Donald Glover/JD McCrary) through his early years under the tuition of his father, King Mufasa (voiced by a welcome return from James Earl Jones), right up to his adult life living in isolation with Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), as he learns to ""take his place in the circle of life"".Yet remove the unquestionably stunning visuals from the equation, and what's left is a shameless re-skin of the original masterpiece, executing everything with a bizarre sense of confident mediocrity. It never wavers in its vision to provide constant photo-realistic spectacles, and it is undeniable that The Lion King is an incredible display of masterful CGI filmmaking. However, for a film which is possibly the greatest achievement in visual effects this year, it is rather curiously one of the least satisfying in general.This new iteration strips the original of all its heart and soul to the point where each and every shot in this remake - no matter how aesthetically appealing - feels hollow. Favreau's version also adds nothing new to The Lion King story besides unnecessary, time-filling exposition, resulting in a dull, oft-times boring viewing experience. Indeed, Hans Zimmer's score is just as spine-tinglingly epic, though he's barely had to change a thing, since The Lion King is more of a shot-for-shot, word-for-word copy than a reimagining. It's therefore easy to feel slightly cheated by the shoddy façade of this visually striking retelling.Emerging coincidingly is the inescapable truth that 2019's The Lion King proves Disney is in full 'cruise-control' mode with its re-released material, and the magic so commonly associated with animated Disney films is dwindling as a result. What's more, unlike the distinctly 'live-action' format of remakes such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin separating them from the original, The Lion King is not 'live-action', yet nor does it feel animated; instead, the blank-faced, high-definition CGI talking animals replace the relatable humanlike expressions of the original. Consequently, the ability to convey emotions from these characters is fundamentally weakened. Coupled with the largely unconvincing voice-acting from this new cast (bar a couple of stellar performances from Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen) and the outcome is a bitter pill to swallow.Never before has such an expensive nostalgia-instilled blockbuster felt so nauseatingly cheap; what Jon Favreau's The Lion King lacks in heart, emotion and integrity, it attempts to make up for in photo-realism and cinematic spectacle. In this ambition, The Lion King loses its focus on the aspects that made the source material so downright brilliant; the dynamism of the characters, the challenges of morality and duty, and - most importantly for an animated family film - its sheer fun.This interpretation of The Lion King quite simply isn't as exhilarating, funny, or as headily enjoyable. Thus, the 1994 original masterwork continues to reign supreme. Long live the King.",The Lion King

495,grantpaulsen,Why?,1,19 July 2019,"I left the theatre with one thought in my head, ""why?"" I fail to see why this was remade other than for money, because there is no sort personality or style of its own, and this remake doesn't offer any new kind of spin on this story, it's basically a shot for shot remake of a film that's already a classic. Why would I ever choose to watch this over the original? It's basically the same movie just without the personality and style of the original. With the photorealistic animals, you can't sympathize with any of them because they don't have any kind of expression, and therefore they can't express emotion. This just goes to show that there was a reason the film was animated in the first place. Also the original was a film that Disney didn't want to make at first, the artists were so passionate about this story that they started to make it anyways out of their own garage and no support from a studio, and yet they still crafted the greatest Disney film of all time. And now that same studio is using their story and milking it for money, because they know how popular it is, which is kind of slimey in my opinion. I can't give it a 0.5/5 because the visuals are spectacular, but none of the changes made to this film were for the better, and nothing of their own was added really. The only difference between this film and the original is that some scenes were shortened and some were drawn out, and all those scenes were terribly executed. So I ask again, when you're remaking something that you know you can't improve, and something that you're not going to change or add your own spin on, then why? Why remake it? It's already a classic, you're just redoing what is already perfect, but you're doing it without the passion, personality, and perfect execution.

498,ShanTeaTime,"""Live-Action"" does not always work",2,1 August 2019,"A computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.So...I took a few days to compose my thoughts after this one. I already knew going in that this film would be a tricky one to watch for me. I hold the original animated film at such high acclaim, it's one of my favorite animated films of all time. As a child and as an adult ""The Lion King"" had a huge impact of me, so obviously this remake was never going to live up to that. Jon Favreau had an impossible task to do and I can't even imagine the immense pressure he was probably under. But with all that said, I'm still going to post my honest thoughts about the film unfiltered.The first thing I need to say is I do not hate live-action films. The live action ""Beauty and the Beast"" was fine and I didn't have many problems with it. It added new story elements which is the point of a remake. Though granted most of the other live-action films Disney has come out with recently I haven't enjoyed. ""Aladdin"" this year was not very good, but there were parts that I thought were enjoyable enough. That could be because again, I don't have that strong emotional attachment to ""Aladdin"" like I do with ""The Lion King"".Without tiptoeing around it, this film made me upset. Like many I've known have said, its creation is so pointless other than for nostalgia inducing money. If those reading this felt differently I'm glad you found enjoyment out of it, but I don't understand! Do the visuals look very realistic and state of the art technology? Yes, but nothing about this movie is ""live-action"". Seeing these realistic looking animals open their mouths and talk was just so surreal. It looked so laughable! You're taking literally all of the visually interesting traits from every character and dulling it down. Scar's black mane and Mufasa's red mane are bright contrasting colors for a reason! I couldn't tell the difference between any of the lions in this film. There's zero distinguishing traits.All the bright fun colors of the original film are gone and replaced with fifty shades of tan. This is why animation was created and some mediums should just not be adapted into live-action, especially when an all animal cast is concerned. There's also no emotional expressions to be seen because again, the animals look realistic. Any of the key emotional gripping points of the original film are recreated here, but it's apparent when ""the scene"" happens and I felt absolutely nothing that facial expression in character is so important. That scene in the animated film resonated with so many people, but this recreation didn't do that.So there isn't much that is added to the overall plot of the film, little things here of there. But what is added adds nothing. There's also many things taken out of the film, ""Be Prepared"" no longer exists within full song in this animal planet universe were seeing. This is probably because Chiwetel Ejiofor could never replicate the sassy legend that is Jeremy Irons as Scar, but this is just a theory. Rafiki is also gone as we know him, which saddens me deeply. They just stripped so much of the humor that it's kind of depressing at points when I remember that the animated film exists still and I'm not watching that.I can't comment on the soundtrack because it's just the original soundtrack repurposed for this movie. So that credit goes to the Elton John, Tim Rice and composer Hans Zimmer. I can however comment on the voice acting in this film. So Donald Glover was fine, I didn't have any issue with his voice as Simba. Beyonce as Nala was literally just Beyonce in my head, especially during her continuous riffing during songs. Girl we know you can sing, but it's a lot. Timon and Pumbaa can never be replaced, so Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen never stood a chance. John Oliver as Zazu was especially bad though, what even was that? All the replacements obviously pale in comparison to the original cast, but I can't necessarily flaunt them for that.Last thing...""Can you feel the love tonight?"" was played in broad daylight. That's such a simple detail that bothered me so much amongst the rest that bothered me. Again, many will probably disagree with me on this film but that doesn't change my immense disappointment with it. It makes me worry for the many live-action remakes in the works currently, however all of those at least have humans to work with. I'll eventually forget about this film and just continue loving the animated masterpiece that is so dear to me.",The Lion King
499,NBates1,Somewhat Lifeless,6,18 July 2019,"The Lion King is without a doubt one of the greatest animated films of all time ( if not THE greatest). It was already flawless, and so there was no reason whatsoever to remake it, especially if there is nothing new to be added to the story.
The visuals are breathtaking and unsurpassed, but the very realistic looking animals look rather awkward when they talk and show no emotion whatsoever, something that has been achieved exceptionally in 2D animation.
The voice cast in general is fine, but no one really stands out.
It is the same story exactly, but the magic is not there.",The Lion King
500,ivann_1987,National geographic dubbed by beyoncé,2,20 August 2019,"Borning, emotionless picture. Its just like watching national geographic dubbed by Beyonce... come on... ""they tried to keep it realistic"", well animals dont have buddies, talk or have this drama.. so put some emotion into the characters face for once.... it was just sooooo bad. So bad",The Lion King
501,alexhenderson-11711,"While nothing is new in this remake, the visuals are worth seeing",7,31 July 2019,"If you've been thinking about watching the Lion king again, by all means go see this, cause it's the same shot for shot remake as the original, with some minor to larger things removed. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about this movie, is that it's the same story. The visuals are Damn good, and sometimes left me with my jaw dropped at how beautiful some scenes looked. I recommend people to see this if they want to see beautiful visuals.

506,Rachael-Harper,Great Family Movie for Fans of Original,8,23 July 2019,"Ok, so if you go in there expecting this movie to be the same or better than the original then you will be disappointed. The original was iconic and had such a wide range of voice talent. This movie to give it its dues, has amazing CGI, a few funny jokes added, the original Mufusa is in it and it pays a great tribute to the original. The downsides were that nobody could really replace Jeremy Irons as Scar and I think they made a mistake not inviting him back, Beyoncé added nothing to this movie besides her name and to be honest I really hated her duet of Can you Feel the Love tonight and it's one of my favourite songs. Is it good quality likeable entertainment?? Yes! Will it capture a whole new generation of children? Probably! Does it live up to the original? No, but I really don't think that's what they were going for...after all it's a remake.",The Lion King

However, I was totally distracted from the rest of the movie because of that. Not like it mattered. I know the plot already, so it's b it's not like it's trash. Just the execution of it. I blame Disney for training entire generations to think that animals should emote like humans do 😂 talk about digging your own grave. All I wanted was to see the same expression on the lion's face as a human in those situations. And I got that from watching Disney movies my whole life! Just strange.",The Lion King
508,sharifahzahira,Amazing CGI with no emotions,5,15 August 2019,"I watch it finally just because it was school holidays for my kids and I had to drag them somewhere with lesser sweat.The story is just fine because it's the same with what the former version had. The CGI is undoubtedly superb, but maybe not refined enough to have the animals show some emotions or any facial expression. It was like watching a natgeo documentary, only with animals voiced over tale. I think if it wasn't for Zazu and Pumbaa, the story would have felt flat. James earl Jones voice was totally wasted due to mufasa's stone face. Same goes with Simba kid and adult. Very bland expression. I wonder why they can release a movie without checking if there is any further complaint from, say, test viewers i.e. insiders in the company? Maybe the deadline is tight i suppose.",The Lion King
509,lowefreddy,Sublime!,10,31 December 2019,"I am very saddened to scroll through this film's reviews only to see 1-star rating after 1-star rating after 1-star rating. I know for a fact that I am not the only person in the world who loved this film: where are they?
My title summarises it all: this film is sublime, and it is one of the best films I have seen all year. The live-action version of our beloved cartoon is a much darker and grittier version of the tale, yet it still retains several of the gloriously heartwarming things about The Lion King. It has a delicious balance of feeling like the cartoon we all know and love, AND altering elements to make the story more hardcore and serious.Not being a fan of modern songs with lyrics, I don't feel qualified to fully review Beyoncé's contributions to this film, though I don't think she deserved nearly as much cynicism as she received from most critics. The orchestral soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal! The star highlight musically was the ""Stampede"" sequence, which is a masterpiece: it was much improved upon from the first film, and completely stunning.
Additionally, though many people criticised it, I loved the new version of ""Be Prepared"". Yes, it is not the elaborate, fun, twisted, and slightly camp song from the cartoon; it is instead a rather dark and disturbing battle cry. Who cares - it was brilliant! Bravo.Character portrayals were different from the original, in some instances, but still very interesting to watch. The character of Mufasa still has his verve, strength, and impressiveness as before, although his character does seem a bit more elderly than his cartoon-equivalent (obviously because James Earl Jones has got older since!). As the director says, it serves to help him sound like a long-time ruler!
The character of Scar is much less effeminate and much more evil, which was the same treatment the hyenas received. (Shenzi is a total psycho!)
Timon and Pumbaa were hilarious as always; Simba and Nala were delightful (both in young and old form). While I preferred Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of Zazu, John Oliver was still fantastic, and brought out lots of laughs from my family.Of course, last but not least, the visuals in this film are just stunning. Beautiful scenery, and ingeniously made CGI lions. This film deserves far more online credit! A masterpiece.(It is laughable that the Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards nominated this for the 'Time Waster Remake' award. I respect their opinions, of course, but creating an award for a remake that shouldn't have been made? Intemperate and ridiculous.)",The Lion King
510,oscardomingueziiiod,Animation vs real life movie,8,22 March 2020,First of all I would like to give a couple feedbacks reviews from the lion king. Different points views. The first point of view is a basscaly a variety. About this 2019 version. In this real life version remake. In this movie I got interested in. How would change into animation to real life. Not only the characters and the settings. Now I define more the landscaping of environments in there life habit. I also learn how to recognize there life cycle nature. Into there inupte life movie scenes. Amazing job well done indeed.,The Lion King
511,oscardomingueziiiod,Disney classics movies THE LION KING,8,22 March 2020,My second review point of view. About the enfouse in between the movie. As a fan of classic Disney movies that I recall when I was young. This was one of many first Disney classics of all times. I loved the original animation movie. Don't get me wrong. But I can say too envlove and improve to get better well done. Besides from the casts Beyonce well played for the role of Nala great job and rest way to go,The Lion King
512,martinmatt-81974,DONT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS!!,10,30 July 2019,This movie is beautiful and amazing!!! The voice cast works perfect as well! Scar is represented perfectly. He is evil and a perfect manipulator. Don't listen to the bad reviews...they are wrong! Jon Favreau did an amazing job!!! It is just as good as the original!,The Lion King
513,zaidmnomani,Lifeless,2,11 May 2020,"The only reason I don't give this film a one star is because the CGI was pretty great. You could tell that a lot of hard work had been put in the effects department, and they deserve credit for that. Unfortunately, everything else is pretty bad.The original Lion King is one of the greatest Disney films ever made. I was reluctant to watch this one because I feared that it would not compare to the original. And I was right. This is a dull, lifeless and utterly bland movie. Despite the movie's commitment to be an absolute remake of the original, it completely misunderstands what mad that film so good. The original was energetic, heartfelt and full of life.The plot does not even try to add anything new to the table. It's just the same thing but worse. When watching, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm not lying when I say that watching this film was the worst cinema experience I have ever had. There is no justification for it's existence whatsoever.If you have kids, let them watch the original Lion King film. That film had a sense of wonder, and it makes you cry harder than anything. It's beautifully animated and superbly told. This is neither.",The Lion King
514,yorktown_hawk,Perfect example of what's wrong with modern movies.,1,2 October 2020,"The original was a perfect combination of story and character development, combined with a perfect selection of voice actors. Each part seemed like it was picked blindly based on their voice.
This version is pretty much a soulless attempt at money-grabbing. Throwing as many big name stars into it as if they alone will make it a success, ignoring that they're just not suited to the character they're (re)creating.
Oh, and was Hanz Zimmer, a top 3 movie composer, too expensive for you considering you threw most of the budget away on Beyonce, who was phonning it in? Again, showing how out of touch producers are these days. Ignoring how the music made the original movie as big a success as it was.A special shoutout to Seth Rogan for being one of the most talentless voice actors to ever have been employed, and a tone deaf singer who couldn't even be saved with auto-tune. Not a good idea to employ an actor with a 2 note singing range to play a role that involves singing.",The Lion King
515,yourz_sanju,No where near original nor it was intended to be.,7,17 August 2019,"After watching this movie, I felt this was a version I couldn't enjoy due to three major mistakes that was not looked into.
1) Emotionally this version doesn't keep you connected like the original one did.
2) Few artists used for voice overs aren't as convincing as the original one had.
3) Few scenes were improvised which ruins and feels rushful while watching the film.I am not huge on live looking CGI as I have enjoyed animation. Sure Disney has pulled off awesome job but not worth it.",The Lion King
516,MrLucasWarHero,"While the Narrative Holds Up, This Shot-For-Shot Remake Poses a Moral Issue",6,8 August 2019,"I have always believed that the purpose of a remake was to produce a creative and new way of looking at an original story.When I went to see the remake of The Lion King, what I did not expect was a shot for shot remake that simply had better special effects. Honestly, I don't see why they even bothered hiring new actors to do the voices when Disney could have used exactly the same audio and simply reanimated it.The only new approach that this version brings to the table is more realistic special effects. I worry that a future generation of children will not ever bother watching the original Lion King because they'll say things like ""Why bother? The 2019 one is the same, but it looks better."" Next up we might as well do 3-D digital reproductions of Picasso that look sleeker than his old oil painted originals.Also when you create animation of animals that looks that real and yet they're talking and singing and dancing it produced an effect that I found a bit unsettling. What's next, anthropomorphic cats in harmony?",The Lion King
517,rob_4,It's Familiar,1,19 July 2019,"Jon Favreau just thinks he can direct! He does nothing special! Disney needs to leave these movies alone. Live action doesn't make anything better. The fact that they cast Beyoncé just ruined it. Donald Glover is like able& he is talented!

However, this film struggles to capture some of the feelings and emotions of the original cartoon animation. In particular, the facial expressions of the animals suffer. In their defence though, animation will always have more creative freedom than a live action film, a brilliant example of this is Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse. Elsewhere, the score was good not really much different to the original, perhaps lacking courage to try something different for fear of the fans of the original complaining.",The Lion King

Zazu is probably the most frustrating character. He was so significant and awesome. Now, I just want him off the screen.
The new and ""improved"" dialogue is woeful. And as much as I love Queen B, she should not have ever been cast into this.

I hated how they had about 85% of the original script. Sorry to say but worst villian voice actor!!!! Absolutely no scariness into his voice unlike Jeremy irons (what a rugged voice). Scar seemed like he was reading a script and bored himself and just played along to get paid. Horrible acting on his part!!! Horrible singing for scar!!!! Come on!!!!!!!!! I was e pecking so much from that song!!!!!! No flavor! No goosebumps!!!! So boring. Once again, just giving maybe 15% in the singing to get his millions. I heard Jeremy wanted to reprise his role!

526,wittkecmission,"The Circle of ""Eh...""",7,11 January 2020,"Another one of Disney's most beloved films gets a live-action(ish) remake. I do wonder when CGI was used in this film as an aid and when it was used as a substitute. Besides being 30 minutes longer, it is not much different from the original. In fact, ironically, many of the films most beloved moments actually seem more rushed and even less emotional, especially Mufasa's death (don't call this a spoiler because it's not). During that scene, I didn't feel the same sadness and gravitas as I felt in the original. The 'Be Prepared' scene was heavily abridged. Contrary to what the poster suggests, the colors in the film were muted and dull. The movie seemed to take the term 'realism' too seriously and too much realism usually makes something unimaginative, ergo unenjoyable. If you've never seen either the original or the remake, watch the original first. On the plus side, though, I will give this movie an 'A' for effort to retain the spirit and the nostalgia factor of the original. Because of that, I will give The Lion King remake a 7/10.",The Lion King
527,raphaelmarcelino,"It miss some emotion and key points, but it´s still a good movie.",7,19 July 2019,"First the good points:
The look of the movie is sensational.""Timon and Pumbaa will piss you off with a laugh.""
The soundtrack, although not as good as the original, can still excite us.Now the negatives:
The dubbing comes from somewhere outside of the movie, it does not seem to be in the same environment as the characters, and it greatly undermines the experience of really feeling what they are saying.Before watching the film I saw that they would have a few minutes more than the 1994 film, however these scenes that are ""unpublished"" nothing add to the story, and some of the classic scenes were removed, which made me feel that something was missing as the movie went by.Finally, and more importantly, the reality of the film is so great that the characters can no longer convey the emotion that makes me cry every time I watch the original version. I left the theater without shedding any tears, and it made me a little disappointed.Conclusion:
Despite all the bad points quoted, I really recommend watching this version of the Lion King, it remains a good movie and the history of the life cycle will never be outdated. Comparisons are inevitable, and the superiority of the original is inconstant, but it is a great experience to see the ""adult"" version of a film that marked me as a child.",The Lion King
528,iamdrumil,Not worth your time.,6,11 April 2020,"I haven't watched the original Lion King (1994) so to me, this was almost like watching a new movie. And yes I am quite sure the original is much better as it was animated when we could see the emotions of animals.
This movie was excellent when it comes to CGI every shot feels photorealistic. Once you move on from that fact that what you are seeing is beautiful the movie just has nothing to offer I was bored for the most part while watching this movie.The most fun I had was when Timon and Pumbaa showed up. I really never felt any connection with our main characters. It was just like things were happening and I was not really curious to know where the story goes.",The Lion King
529,garabedbaghsarian,Original > Remake,4,14 September 2019,"When I saw the trailer of the remake for the first time, I had goosebumps all over and super excited to relive my childhood. But unfortunately, the only good part of the movie was the graphics, as at some point I thought I was watching a real-life film (but only the very first scene was shot in real life while the rest was CGI). But other than that, it lacked emotions. For example, the musical scenes were all over the place, and the fact that the songs were not sung by the original singers was already disappointing. Not to forget to mention about the most critical scene in the movie that was supposed to be the saddest moment (Simba crying at Mufasa's death) it didn't touch me at all, while if you watch the original, no matter what your age is, you would at least tear.
Furthermore, as much as Bomba was funny and perfectly played by Seth Rogan, the character was badly CGI-ed, looked like a cheap quality and ugly character.
All in all, I only recommend this movie for the sake of beautiful graphics and to remember the story, other than that you'll be disappointed for the lack of emotions (even though it's the exact storyline as the original movie)",The Lion King

Visually it's stunning Disney look like they have spent an absolute fortune on this and it shows, but a few things with it there is no emotion being shown like 0 you can't tell if they're happy sad angry the only relation you have is with the voice, and that brings me to the sound. You can tell that the voice actors have done this in a studio from the first word spoken I was taken a back with how out of sync it was it just didn't fit. The whole film is almost shot scene for scene with the original which isn't that old at all. Scar's voice just wasn't menacing enough for me he was no Jeremy Irons I can tell you that, everything seemed rush, the scene when Mufasa gets thrown off the cliff by scar when he utters the word ""long live the king"" when Irons done it, it was slow, dark, scary like when the new actor does it, it's literally like they're having a normal conversation. I don't like the beyonce song the score was pretty much the same from the original. 6/10 is being generous from me, I would leave it for blu ray, I don't think the original is that old to justify a remake so soon and if you are going to do it change it up enough to make it worth while.",The Lion King

540,n-middleton-117,Compromised,6,20 August 2021,"When you take one of the greatest stories to grace the silver screen and then combine it with exceptional visual effects, you'd expect the end product to be a wonderful contemporary refresh, ready to captivate young hearts and minds all over again. However, in the process of trying to out a slightly new spin on the Lion King, they've tampered with some elements that have detracted from the value of the film.So many reboots of classic films have fallen victim to the same adaption of storyline's to try and appease more contemporary audiences, but almost always end up being worse. The Lion King doesn't deviate from the original script and story as much as some other modern remakes, but it does still mix it up. Some of the changes arguably a small improvement, but some are significantly worse. The original film has so many subtle lessons, but sadly some of the best ones have been altered or removed entirely in this new version.Overall, the story is still close enough to the original to be decent, and the visual effects are quite remarkable. Although, the animals' faces appear somewhat dull, as the hyper realism doesn't allow for the same range of expression as the original cartoon.Overall, it's not a bad interpretation of the original, but a far cry from stellar heights of its predecessor. It's a movie that definitely didn't need to happen though.",The Lion King
541,gatheringsnow,"Not the worst thing ever, but far inferior to the 1994 version",5,22 July 2019,"This recent spade in ""live action"" remakes of classic Disney films from the 60's all the way to the 90's has got to stop, as it is perfectly clear that their sole purpose is to cash in on the nostalgia and fond memories many of us now adults had as children watching the original animated versions. In regards to their inherent quality they vary from really bad to just okay for the most part, so I dislike more than others, but the Lion King is one of the worst. I don't even know where to start.I guess the biggest disappointment here would have to be the photo-realistic 3-D animation of the characters which does indeed make them look a lot more like the lions, hyenas, zebras, etc. that they were in the original animated film from the 90's but on the flip side they managed to suck just about all of the life and warmth from them in the process. They honestly would have just been better off filming actual lions and then providing voice overs for them like they did in Disney live actions films in the 90s, notably an earlier ""remake"" of The Jungle Book. All of the life, expressiveness, emotion, and beauty which went into the design of the original characters is almost completely gone here, with the possible exception of Timon and Pumbaa and even they can't live up to the original.I understand that given their more realistic appearances they can't really go as far as they could with the original then they could here, and as a result it seems that director Jon Favreau, who also directed the recent live action Jungle Book remake from 2017, told them not to be as emotive in their voice work as it would create too much of a clash between the fairly static expressionless faces on the more realistic characters. Which I suppose makes sense from a technical stand point so either way it was as if this film was doomed to failure from the character animation alone.But then this brings us to the dialogue and humor of this film, which though not the worst ever it's mostly because the vast majority of the dialogue is simply cut and pasted from the original along with the music and songs and they couldn't even do that right. Most of the humor comes from, as might be expected, the characters of Timon and Pumbaa and the time Simba spends with them growing up after leaving Pride Rock, along side several of their friends and fellow prey animals who are extremely wary of being in the presence, and rightfully so, of an apex predator such as a Lion, even if he's technically on ""their side"" due to their influence on him.I did genuinely laugh in a few scenes, but aside from that I rarely got anything emotionally speaking from watching this film, not even the scene where Mufasa, again portrayed by James Earl Jones, although noticeably not as strong, perhaps due to his age, but I suspect more so because of the limits imposed by the ""realistic"" character designs. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar is a far cry from the greatness Jeremy Irons embodied in his role as the original, having little to no menace and personality to him, he doesn't even have his signature black mane and aside from his scarred face it barely even looks like him aside from the fact they are both played by British actors. His version of Be Prepared as also shorter in length and not remotely as memorable as Jeremy Irons version, there almost like two completely different songs. Both Beyonce as adult Nala and Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) as Simba also seem to have very little chemistry or depth regarding their characters and seem almost bored when delivering lines which held far more of an impact in the original.The story line overall is with a few exceptions the same one as the original with Simba, supposed to be dead, runs away from his place as king of Pride Rock leaving Scar to turn it into a dry deserted hellscape which could also be a pretty good analogy for this film, as just about every character, even Zazu and Rafiki are not even close to as memorable as they were in the original. Zazu barely even looks the same, I think he's an entirely different species of bird, although personally I could care less even if he did look the same.One thing I guess that I did in fact think was an improvement over the original was the portrayal by newcomer JD McCrary of Simba as a cub, in that he was far more endearing and innocent and therefore likable then the 1994 version played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who came off a lot more bratty and even annoying before going through his character growth following Mufasa's death. Here he's just so adorable as a cub you can't help but feel bad for him and hope to see him grow up and take his place as ruler of the Pride Lands, even if he's a little childish and disobedient you're much more likely to forgive him because of his inherent sweetness.Aside from that there really isn't much to commend, although I suppose the more realistic backgrounds and landscapes are pretty and well detailed, their overall isn't much more to see here worth the price of a movie ticket. A real shame that something so magical was completely sucked dry just for the sake a nostalgic cash grab.",The Lion King
542,kevs5612,Breath taking animation,9,24 July 2019,"The animation in this movie is completely incredible it leads some beautiful reworks of the original songs like the circle of life. The animals do not have facial expressions for the most part however this ties in with the realism looked for in the remake and instead emotions are shown through body language and voice acting, it might feel a little odd at first but I really enjoyed it. Timon and puma steal the show on the remake as they get a little more dialogue and they're completely hilarious.
An incredible remake that is not as emotional as the original due to the realism but it doesn't take away from how incredible it looks and the nostalgia of every scene hits home in a different way.",The Lion King

546,abasu0819,A visual spectacle.,8,13 October 2019,"A delightful endless journey of bag full of emotions, Disney's Live Action Adaptation of their classic ""Lion King"" serves you the platter with not so satisfying garnishing. Packed with one crunchy first half comparatively, the second one causes a lot of pace issues and overall ends up being a let-down to one extent. But overshadowed by magnificent piece of work of CGI and VFX and lots of comedy and enjoyable melody, the film hardly ever felt boring and therefore, making it one perfect treat for the kids or even family. Clearing up my doubts of about being able to balance the line between realism and artistic values, Disney manages me to surprise me for, now, the countless amount of times. Yet again. At the end, with the film being awkwardly satisfying for adults, it turns out to be pretty much one must watch by Disney as you'd usually expect, especially if you're all set for a quick visit to the memory lane.",The Lion King

Now, that being said I don't really think it was necessary making this movie. I also thought it was bizarre that Disney decided to not have Jeremy Irons return to voice Scar. Unfortunately the voice of scar in the remake does not sound as nearly as sinister or intense as Irons But the film I hold in high regards for its photorealistic visuals. In addition, to the visuals most of the actors do a good job but I felt Seth Rogan, John Olive, and Billy Eichner gave the best performances ( Puumbaa, Zazu, and Timon).

I just couldn't deal with the voice overs and singing for some reason.Beyoncé's voice as Nala just doesn't fit the character and charm. Scar looked old and his mane wasn't really dark. The hyenas were not goofy or crazy like the 1994 version. The expressions were empty and lacked emotion, and I think it's an important part to grab the audiences' hearts and attention. The catch phrases and jokes were predictable and sometimes didn't match the intention. Some scenes are a bit too dark and it might be scary for younger kids.The lions and scenery looked beautiful nonetheless. I think Leona Lewis would have been great as Nala.

This endless remake parade is the antithesis of ""art"", this is the final nail in the coffin for Disney creativity.

James Earl Jones wasn't putting any emotion into it and seemed like he really didn't care as much this time around. Adult Simba and Scar were completely miscast, especially Scar.

Never heard of most of the ""actors"", probably because they aren't any good. That kid who played little Simba should never have sung because he can't. Nala's voice was too ghetto sounding. If James Earl Jones was Mufasa again, Woopie Goldberg should have been Shenzi and Jeremy Iron's should have been Scar. The one star rating is for at the very least getting Timon and Pumba right.

No. That's what the original is for. Me personally, I don't like this ""live action"" remake kick Disney is on.

The film is not really worth seeing in theatres. I would wait until it comes out on Netflix or Disney's streaming service, which I imagine is what all these live-action remakes that came out in 2019 were for. Ultimately it is bland and boring with a lot of the humour taken out of it, still no acknowledgement as far as I noticed to Hamlet or Kimba. The American actors, save for Jones who is Mufasa and Glover who did well with what was there, were the weakest part, Eichner especially. The non-Americans outshined their counterparts and gave their characters depth even though they had so few lines.
Ultimately the movie is underwhelming, and I would have liked to have seen more African born actors playing roles rather than singers with limited range.",The Lion King

569,aka-45316,A Needless Half and Half Venture...,4,23 February 2020,"A prime reason for why I saw this movie was because, despite being aware of its mixed reputation and anticipating that it likely wouldn't be great, I wanted to have my own personal opinion on it. But, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, as I anticipated this was a so-so film at the most.Before I start my berating of this movie, I'd like to start with the surprising positives that I found.Similar to a great many others, I found myself unexpectedly pleased with the performances of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa. The same with Keegan-Michael Key and Eric Andre as Kamari and Azizi, might I add. Out of all the performers, they not only delivered the best comedic-timings, but they gave their characters outstanding life, depth, and personality.Also, minus the characters not having facial expressions at the most, the special effects used with the animals and landscapes were quite impressive. They looked extremely realistic, that's for sure.And as always, Hans Zimmer never ceased to amaze me when it came to making a magnificent musical score. He pretty much kept it at the same kind of level as that of the animated film, of course. But, he didn't keep himself from being creative and really throwing himself into composing for this film either, which was great.However, like I already said, the film wasn't without its Achilles Heels.With the exceptions of Eichner, Rogen, Key, and Andre, the performers were hardly able to bring ANY charm or life to their characters. Everyone sounded like they were a lot more bored than having a good time, and the fact that the characters were peppered by obviously recycled or creatively uninspired dialogue certainly didn't help any. At least Chiwetel Ejiofer was TRYING to make a good impression as Scar, because he definitely brought something interesting and unique to the role.In my opinion, the person who gave the worst performance out of everyone was Beyoncé in her portrayal of Nala. One reason is because I can't help but question what director Jon Favreau ever saw in Beyonce that would prompt him into casting her as the character. The biggest reason, though, is because compared to Moira Kelly's performance as the character in the animated films, Beyonce's portrayal sounded incredibly bare and lifeless. Along with that, Donald Glover sounded like he was a lot more bored playing Simba in this movie than the opposite, and I can tell that the script was quite likely a contributing factor to it.As I already commented, I enjoyed how Hans Zimmer was able to help his music feel inspired and creative. But, the film's musical numbers, apart from the rather short but fresh take of ""Be Prepared"", were the exact opposite of the words I mentioned. Unlike the highly renowned animated version, the songs hardly held the spark that made them so pleasurable in the original, and the limitations of photorealistic imagery compared to hand-drawn and computer animation appeared to be making themselves apparent thanks to the animals just walking or running around as they sang instead of dancing, which made them far from lively.My biggest gripe, though, comes from the direction by Jon Favreau and the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. Before I saw this movie via the free cartoon website I used, I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt because of being a fan of many of Favreau's movies and Nathanson's work in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"". In spite of this, though, I found that they were sadly unable to make the film worth something. It seemed like their creativity was completely restrained by this unnecessary need to be nostalgic, repeating the same story and providing nearly nothing new. The worst part about it was that all of the delight that made the hand-drawn animated version so spectacular...was missing. Everything mainly felt like it was just going through the motions, like it was done by a factory machine instead of people. The newly-added moments of the film also did nothing to help the story not feel like some shot-by-shot remake. For instance, I appreciated the fact that Nala's story was expanded some, but I also didn't think it helped the film not feel like some mere excuse to experiment with photorealistic effects.Perhaps if Favreau and Nathanson had created an all-out remake of ""The Lion King"" instead of making a carbon copy of it, this would be something worth seeing more than once.In the end, ""The Lion King (2019)"" was mainly a 50/50 venture at the most, and despite the positives I already mentioned, it'll never compare to the sheer awesomeness of the animated film.",The Lion King
570,tonysobon,Really bad with realistic looking CGI.,3,19 July 2019,"The C.G.I really is top notch but so much so that it takes away from the story and characters.Toy Story C.G.I is the kind that you need to make a movie like this work , the C.G.I they used is what you want for movies that have things like dinosaurs and not dinosaurs that talk.It'd weird to because i liked the recent Jungle Book movie a lot better yet they made the animals real looking too , i just think because the are no Human Characters there are parts of Lion King that just can't be re-done in this way.I dont know all i can say is the original Lion King is so much better mostly for reasons of how they choose to make the characters look visually",The Lion King

If there is a minor thing than it's Beyoncé's singing voice. But I just don't like Beyoncé. ;-),The Lion King
572,Koma-Mo,The same story + CG + blandness = pointless,5,22 August 2019,"Yes, the CG for this film is phenomenal and it looks absolutely realistic. Yes, this film is an exact copy of what we have seen in the animated version. Yes, the film totally lacks the necessary emotion and intensity that was present in the original. If you've seen the original Lion King, then there is no point of watching this movie. Unlike Jon Favreau's previous film, this film doesn't present anything new and just follows the same beat and pace of the original with some very minor scenes that I actually thought was both good and bad for the film.First, the good: This is a bit of a nitpick of mine, but one of my major gripes that I have toward the climax from the original was that the film mixed in cultural references (Pumba saying a line from ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!) and Rafiki going all kung-fu. This movie took these parts out of the film and actually made them relevant enough to the climax and not feeling out of place. Another is that the movie adds extra scenes that explained how Nara escaped from Pride Rock and came to Timon and Pumba's home. Also, their home now has more side characters living there, making it more lively and less empty than how it was in the original.Now to the bad: Rafiki had nothing to do and the whole scene involving him giving the speech to adult Simba about the past is totally absent; taking away the great message that the film had. Another factor was that, although it is not 100% bad, the characteristics of the hyenas changed. I don't mind them changing Shenzi from a comedic character to a menacing one. What I didn't like was that the other hyenas had nothing to do, had no personality and had one joke that was both unfunny and awkward, especially coming right after the death of Mufasa. One more factor that really disappointed me was that when it came to the big song numbers that people loved to listen to, there would be a lot going on in the scene. However, if the musical number is not so, then it just looks bland and uninteresting to watch. An example is ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" and ""Be Prepared."" The duet number has the characters going around and has them enjoying their time together, in the daylight. Whereas the latter is just plain and simple, with nothing going on.The major complaints that people have mentioned was that this film just felt lifeless because the characters do not have any sort of reaction and that is partially true. The characters all look realistic and because of that, they lack the expressions that we've seen in the original. But that is not the only reason why I felt that the movie didn't have the proper emotion. In the original, the characters would not only have expressions that were easy to understand, but the film had great dynamic shots that added an impact when you saw something intense happening to the characters or when something tragic occurs in the film. The directing and in my opinion, most of the voice acting really liked the actual emotions that were present. Even James Earl Jones, whom is always great to listen to, felt like he was just reading the script to him and didn't have that deep emotion that was present before. This really shows as, other than Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and the kids who played young Simba and Nara, everyone else gave a flat performance and didn't help add personality to the character. Mixing all of these mistakes will make something that has been loved for many years look weak.Just like some of the other remakes, this really felt like it was only piggybacking the success of the original and because of that I felt that the movie missed out on some potentials to be as successful or surpass the original. I didn't absolutely hate this and I see how many people will feel disappointed or will hate this movie. It's just an okay film and overall I recommend watching the original instead of this. If you want to see some amazing CG, then by all means you should check it out.",The Lion King

Simba brushes by a plant that's near water and the water ripples from the plants roots just the right amount. That attention to detail is so thorough that unless you look for it any disbelief is lost and you're enjoying dramatic or funny talking wildlife at National Geographic levels of realism. I am a CGI fan and this was more awe inspiring than the first Sully fur. The story is the same with some side by side exact scene copies, the actors, all of them, are great. Seth, John Oliver and Billy Eichner are the real treat redelivering old lines with such modernity, you think you're hearing them for the first time.

It really makes no sense for people to freak out and lose their minds the way they are....if you really are that turned off by live action remakes then don't watch them...you can still just enjoy the original....though, being so close minded may be depriving you of the opportunity to really enjoy that same magic you felt when you watched the originals as kids.They did a terrific job with this. I found it to be just as funny and touching as I did the original decades ago. If you love the original, and keep an open mind, you will LOVE this....the cinematography in some of the shots really is magical. I definitely recommend this movie to others....tune out the noise and negativity and form your own opinion about the movie.

584,Sevenmercury7,"Safe and uninspired retread, with amazing CGI",6,22 February 2020,"Safe. Pleasant. Uninspired. Pretty much every aspect of the film falls under those descriptions, especially the 3-D. The only surpassing element, for me, was the stunningly photo-real CGI, but even that brought its own baggage in terms of the characters' emoting. Animals' faces can't express human emotion; animators have always had to anthropomorphise them to an extent (it's what Disney was always great at); but here they don't. The lions' faces are blank. Their mouths move to speak human words, they sing to one another, but they're stuck in that too real/ unreal paradox, and it kept distracting me. There's just something a little ""off"" about the whole approach. I didn't have that problem at all with The Jungle Book, probably because the animals all had Mowgli to interact with. But here it kept me at a distance, emotionally. Didn't spoil the film for me, but it did make me question what I was looking at.The 3-D was immersive at times - it added dynamism and tactility to some sequences. It definitely wasn't a waste of time. But after the impressive 3-D in Aladdin and Dumbo, I felt it was a step back into the timid, afraid-to-be-noticed approach we've seen so often from Disney. The extended sequence with the clump of lion hair reminded of the floating ticket scene in The Polar Express. But while Zemeckis worked the Z-axis overtime - in IMAX, it's still one of my favourite 3-D sequences - here they stay comfortably in the Goldilocks zone, and it's all a bit shrug-worthy.Oddly enough, the 3-D conversion of the original cartoon was also a let-down.",The Lion King
585,kamalkph,So boring.,3,15 January 2021,Too disappointing! The CGI is the only thing they cared. This movie is nothing compared to the 1994 animated version.,The Lion King
586,Snowgoat,Faithful and visually dazzling remake that's probably a little too faithful to the original to become a classic of its own.,9,22 July 2019,"This is a faithful and visually dazzling retelling of the hand-drawn classic - but its reverence to the original film is likely to hold it back from becoming as well-loved a classic in its own right.Favreau clearly loves the original - and he's so scared of messing with what was perfect in the cell-drawn version that there is often a feeling of an elaborate cover-version rather than the film finding its own unique identity (as his version of Jungle Book successfully did).I think most people would agree that the best thing about the original film is its opening act - both in terms of story and visuals. And Favreau is so aware of this that he lovingly recreates the whole thing almost shot for shot. Unfortunately, it's so close a recreation that anyone familiar with the original is likely to be left feeling a little torn by what they're watching - undeniably impressive as it is visually. It doesn't help that the re-casting's are sometimes a little off (why bring back James Earl Jones but not Jeremy Irons? This was a strange choice - and a jarring mistake) and just as you get used to hearing the same lines spoken by someone new a new line comes along to jar things - or a familiar one is omitted. It leads to a general feeling of unease in fans of the original. That said, if you were coming to it fresh, having never seen the original, I think you'd be just as bowled over as I was watching the 90s version for the first time - if not more so.Where the new version fairs far better is in its second half - after Simba has left the pride. In my view, the original film, classic though it is, really fell off in the second half - slightly in terms of story-telling but especially in its visuals - with character and background art paling in comparison with that wonderful opening half. This remake however, maintains a benchmarking level of visual splendour throughout - which gives the story a lot more weight in the second half. The appearance of Timon and Pumbaa invigorate this new film as too - with the re-castings here being such a success that they instantly strip away memories of the originals. This sections departs slightly more from the original too - in terms of visuals and dialogue - which makes the whole film suddenly feel a lot more like its own animal.A lot has been made by detractors of the animation being ""emotionless"" in comparison to the original. While I can understand this point to a degree - I also think these people may have misunderstood the filmmakers intentions. What Favreau has done here follows the same animation template as established in Jungle Book - i.e. setting a constraint that the animals' faces and bodies should not move much beyond what would be physically possible in the real world. This means you won't get grinning lions or warthogs blowing raspberries, and that expressions are never going to be as over the top as they can be in cell-animation (which has no rules). If they were it would look absurd. Instead the animators use more realistic (and less anthropomorphic) tricks to get the animals to emote. It's a far more low-key approach, but a lot of thought and effort has clearly gone into it. It may be lost on a lot of people perhaps (and maybe children) - and is probably the main reason this version won't be as big a crowd-pleaser as the original - but anyone who really knows or loves animals (the real kind) is likely to find it pretty captivating and ingenious.I'm a little surprised this remake has been so polarising and generally went down poorly with critics, since it's unequivocally a technical marvel of a film - and absolutely heads and shoulders above all the other Disney ""remakes"", other than perhaps Jungle Book. But I guess anytime you revisit a classic like the Lion King you're going to rustle some feathers. Take out the loony posters howling at the moon about ""political correctness"" and you still have a lot of sane-minded people unhappy with this remake. While I can sympathise with some of their grievances, at the end of the day, as someone who really loves the original, I still found this version hugely enjoyable and emotionally captivating. I only wish it had taken a few more risks - and that they hadn't dumped my favourite Hans Zimmer music cue (Simba running back to the pride over the desert)!",The Lion King
587,elixirr,Gorgeous CGI. Lacks Emotion and Soul.,3,4 September 2019,"Let me start off by saying, the original Lion King is one of my favorite (animated) movie and I have seen it numerous times... and I was kinda excited for 'live-action' adaptation but after finally watching it, I didn't feel any emotions or excitement.While the CGI was absolutely beautiful but the raw emotions that were in original, made it so special and personal. I understand, it may not be possible to bring those 'emotions' in CGI version but maybe they need to think through what movies are worth remaking.The cast didn't do much for me either especially Scar and Zazu. Chiwetel's voice just didn't had the villainous tone to it like portrayed by Jeremy Irons, which caused shivers down your spine and Oliver's Zazu was just blah... didn't had the nosy/intrusive feel to it.The gorge scene, which to this day still makes my eyes all watery... made me feel absolutely nothing and that's is such a pivotal part of the original and story.The also took out the clever quirks between Timone and Pumba and didn't leave much to imagination.Overall, while the CGI was on spot but this was NOT the movie to be adapted into 'live-action'.",The Lion King
588,murphdog1234,Is it better than the original? No. But I really enjoyed it,9,30 July 2019,"I really loved this remake, I don't understand the hate it gets. This might be my favorite of the Disney remakes",The Lion King
589,bigblack2009,"The Original is a Masterpiece that made animation history, this is very easy to forget",1,12 July 2019,"The first question we need to ask is ""are they necessary?"" This could be said about any film, but in the transition from an animated media to a live action one, several things happen. Within animation anything can happen. You're not limited by real world physics. Yet, the suspension of belief when watching cinema isn't altered. You're still whisked away into a new world and captivated, regardless of it not looking real. Without today's technology, animation was the tool to anthropomorphic characters. We could share the emotions of a deer or fox or even a bear. Mice became your best friends and could sing. The limited became limitless within animation.Now animals can be rendered in CGI, making them look almost completely real. While you can still change their look to give them human qualities, they still can retain a life-like appearance. Suddenly, The Jungle Book can look real. Yet, does it have to? Do we need to see a realistic looking Lion taking his place at Pride Rock? Of course not. Yet, the movie was made. And the result was disappointing. I mean, what's the point in making a realistic looking Lion King if none of the characters are human? It defeats the whole purpose of these kinds of remake, not that they need much of a purpose besides banking on nostalgia.Personally I think these animated animals look more plastic and weird than most CGI humans. That fur just don't look right. The Jungle Book and Tarzan were... okay. They had humans in them. The Lion King doesn't. It's just a ton of CGI animals in a CGI environment and the visuals are horrible. What's the point of this?Disney's live action remakes are draining the soul from their films, and it shows the most in their villains. Jafar and Scar were lively and dramatic characters. It showed in their visual design and personality, but these feel so flat and reigned in.I'm not feeling the muted colors either. Even with realism, dynamic use of light and color can add a sense of wonder to what is still a fairy tale. It feels like they're taking themselves way too seriously these days, and are ashamed of the fact that they used to make cartoons.I think Jungle Book did it better in terms of light and color. It also had something Lion King does not as I said: Mowgli. A human presence grounds the story in realism making the style a more natural choice, and also gives us an emotional human face to relate to. The Lion King doesn't.
In the first film we can see Mufasa's fear. Scar's calculating gaze. The look of betrayal as his own brother throws him to his death. The design choices of the remake prevent us from reaching this same level of emotion, and the scene lose all of its impact. The infamous scene that traumatized so many generations and marked his way in the history of animation if not of all cinema history just came out in the live action as bland, generic and emotionless.
While one CAN convey a range of emotion on a realistic animal face, that is not what we saw in this movie. You can google pictures of actual live felines I found conveying a greater range of emotion than the soulless husks Disney is trying to pass off as 'realistic.' But hey, it's almost like traditional animation can do things that a washed-out blur of photorealistic CGI can't!I must say I fail to see the point of a live action Lion King. The Lion King is an amazing movie in great part due to it being the absolute pinnacle of traditional animation.It's even more so because they dragged poor old James Earl Jones out to do more voice acting. Here's hoping he gets paid a tidy sum. John Oliver being Zazu is not a positive, especially when compared with Rowan Atkinson. John Oliver is basically a bad reboot of Jon Stewart and his involvement with the new Lion King symbolises the mediocrity of modern movies. Donald glover is the worst, I hate his portrayal of Simba, he sounds so weird and offplace, his voice is terrible. And don't get me started on Beyonce... I never liked her ""music"", I like even less her attempt at acting.",The Lion King
590,mnsmb7,nostalgic Childhood Memories,6,29 July 2019,"This movie offers nothing new on the original and while the cinematic aspects of the movie are fantastic; the voice acting, singing and emotion was not there. I felt as if the voice actors failed to watch the original movie and experience the passion portrayed in the characters. I felt like the flat animated 1994 movie had more heart than this revamped movie. I didn't agree with the casting of many of the characters. It's as if Disney chose people are viewed as ""popular"" in today's' world instead of the best talent. Beyonce as Nala was a very poor choice especially when matching up with Donald glover's Vocals. Scar made me miss Jeremy Irons and Seth Rogan as Pumba was laughable and not in the HA HA kind of way.

Some different voices, but still sound very similar. CGI is life-like, and I actually like Timon's look much more here.What bothered me most is some animations from the original are missing here that added much more character - Simba trying to wake his dad by biting his ear (like how they played), Simba roughing up Zazu before singing Can't Wait to be King where Zazu doesn't get hilariously bullied as much, Timon/Pumba not breaking into tears after the love song, Simba not pushing Nala in the pond, etc. But I'm not gonna give this a <5 for ""ruining"" the original or because I didn't like a song or this remake wasn't ""needed"" like so many reviews I read.",The Lion King

594,Acolyte-2,Visually fantastic. Emotionally flat.,5,29 July 2019,"There are significant pluses to be noted about this film. Visually, it's gorgeous. Renders of the characters and locations are virtually perfect, and it's easy to see why people persist in describing this as a live action remake when it's nothing of the sort. There's a lot to look at here, and for that reason I'm not sorry I saw it.Animal characters are given the behaviors of the real things without the anthropomorphism of the original film, even if some are geographically misplaced. The decision to make the hyena clan clearly matriarchal was a good one along these lines, and made a secondary line of conflict available which was sadly under-exploited. Another good decision was to much more clearly identify the disaster that overcame the pridelands under the hyenas as ecological due to over-hunting, with the conflict between Mufasa and Scar due in part to Scar's resentment over Mufasa's restraint and dedication to ecological balance.But there are so many problems. The direction was dull. Much of the time it felt as if they were simply going through the motions rather than presenting the story to stand on its own as dramatically as possible. Many have complained about the characters' expressionlessness. To me that's simply a consequence of choosing to render them realistically and not a bad thing per se. Emotion COULD have instead been conveyed by liberal use of body language, perhaps with a little exaggeration such as a human actor might use for greater audience impact. But this was not done for the most part. Only when they approach the climax do they begin to explore the full range of what they might have done throughout. The voice acting was, with a few notable exceptions, uninspired and often sounded rushed. I put this down to direction more than anything else, since I know what some of these actors are capable of. The decision to retain James Earl Jones for Mufasa was, perhaps, not well thought-out. He's now almost 90 years old, and sounds like it. While still impressive, his voice lacks the overpowering dynamism and range of his prime that made his original portrayal of Mufasa so memorable.I like some of the new directions of the script, but some of the decisions both large and small made me scratch my head. As noted above, a potentially tense secondary rivalry was hardly brought out. We saw it only at the climax. It's understandable that some of the more cartoonish action of the original was reblocked, but the new version was not always successful and sometimes came across as a lazy shortcut to the next scene. Young Simba was given a tag line ""I got this!"" meant to show off his brash overconfidence. We don't hear it again after the death of Mufasa, but why should it not return when adult Simba recovers his proper identity? Why was ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" performed in broad daylight?All in all, a wasted opportunity.",The Lion King
595,drwhowizard,Don't listen to the hate,9,28 December 2019,"I sat down to this movie fully expecting to turn off after 10 minutes. I came away surprised, it is excellent. Sure, it's different, but that doesn't mean bad. The animation is breathtakingly realistic, if you compared it to reality, reality would look fake. The main issue is that it's not a kids movie. The plan I assume is to return the film to it's Shakespearean origins of Hamlet and as a result kids will bore, but for adults it's great. There is so much depth to enjoy, the scene where Mufasa dies will shock even adults in its sadness. While it has to change to be realistic, like removing the dancing Hyenas in Be Prepared, they have adapted it well. For example the hula dancing scene with Timon is replaced with a Beauty and the Beast reference and the outdated Mr Pig joke is altered to fat-shaming. In addition, new jokes are added for the original fans such as Pumbaa being allowed to say fart when he is not originally, or Timon describing Simbas home as a 'big pointy rock' as he did in the semi-parodic Lion King 3. In short, the film exists almost as an adult version of the original. It won't satisfy alone, but as an optional extra to the original, it is extremely satisfying",The Lion King

599,spear88,Not as bad as the reviews suggest,7,27 September 2019,"As Disney continue to create live action versions of their classic animated movies it was inevitable that they were going to eventually get round to creating The Lion King, arguably one of the most popular and most critically acclaimed Disney animations to date. Due to it's popularity I felt this was destined to be hated from the off as people just don't want new versions of their old favourites, I felt like the film was always going to struggle to win over the masses and that appears to be so having scrolled through the reviews and being met by a barrage of 1/10's. For me I enjoyed my time watching The Lion King as it was visually superb and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa just gave me constant laughs, he was perfect for the role. I would've like to have seen a few more characters re cast such as Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu just to add that little extra dose of nostalgia which I felt was lacking despite having James Earl Jones reprise his role as Mufasa. My main critique with this version of The Lion King was the casting of Beyoncé as Nala, I seriously hated the sound of her voice throughout as it just didn't seem suited to the movie and I felt Nala was given a bigger platform in this film because she was being voiced by Beyoncé, trying to justify her casting and the vast fortunes she was probably paid for lending her voice to the project. With that put to one side I enjoyed the movie, the songs for the most part were good to listen to and although I would've liked a bit more nostalgia and a little less Beyoncé I came out of the cinema feeling satisfied.",The Lion King

There are several times where you will be watching it and just be in awe of how lifelike these things are getting nowdays they did a great job.That being said, the acting by some of the characters is some of the absolute worst. In the disney movies the songs are far superior, partly because it's a cartoon, but moreso because the actors in it are having fun. You can hear it in their voices, it just sounds genuine, while in this movie many of the songs are so over the top and pretentious you can't stand it, simba in particular.I think some of it has to do with the script, they changed some of the dialog from the original and so it just doesn't have quite the right tone in certain places.The voice of Scar was very well done and the dialog they gave him was fantastic. Mufasa and zazu were as well.Timon and pumbaa was just awful, and I usually love seth rogan in almost everything he does but both of those voices and dialog was just not right, probably the most boring and annoying characters in the movie, a complete 180 from being some of the most entertaining and lovable characters in the cartoon.",The Lion King

607,letande,Looks awesome but can't repeat the original impact for many reasons,4,18 July 2019,"Back in the days, Lion King was a huge thing. Not only because it had stars like James Earl Jones, Moira Kelly (HUGE fan here), Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg providing their voices for the characters. And not even because it had Elton John as the composer (huge fan here too). It was all those things plus the incredible animation and groundbreaking story full of love and wisdom. It was THE animated movie everybody should see at least once. Even today, it's one of those movies that you can find at pretty much every home around the Globe. It was one of those all time masterpieces that will stay both in history and in our hearts forever. It was one of the essentials. Now here comes the new version. Remake, reboot, call it whatever you want. Can it repeat the impact? Unfortunately, I must say ""no"". But it's not that simple.See, animation-wise, the new Lion King is... awesome. No, seriously, I can't help but remember Steve Jobs. If you remember the story behind Monsters, Inc. (check your DVD / Blu-ray extras if you don't), you remember how hard it was for Pixar to bring Sulley to life. His detailed fur that was moving in real time made a huge revolution back in the days. And today, years later, it's pretty much impossible not to remember that when you see all that INCREDIBLY animated fur in Lion King. It's just... WOW. Especially during the rain scenes. The new movie literally brought Africa to life. It's almost like you're watching the documentary. It's THAT realistic and it looks even better in 3D, where every single piece of grass feels as real as it can be.Unfortunately, there's a huge problem. The problem is - the guys were afraid of experiments. They were so afraid to ruin the original magic that... they pretty much used the old script. That's right, aside from some little details (there'll be a small reference to the Beauty and the Beast, for example), it's the same... exact... thing... And it feels totally wrong. For two reasons. First - it feels pretty boring and kind of... pointless. I mean, come on! Everybody seen the original Lion King for, like, what? A million times now? Many of us saw it even more since they're showing it to their kids now. And seeing the same exact thing all over again... I mean, I know that it was SUPPOSED to be the same thing, but when we're talking about different versions of the same thing, some things MUST be different. That's the point. And it's the differences that make... difference. If you know what I mean. The entire point to watch the alternative version of something is in those differences. Sure, watching something like that in theater is more like an event. It doesn't even matter whether it's good or not. It's just a worldwide event that you don't want to miss. You pick up your friends and family and just watch it. But when it's about watching the movie at home, those differences create the exact reason for you to pick up the alternative version. And unlike the live action reboots, this movie doesn't have a single real actor. Which alone made enough difference. For example, I did re-watch the Beauty and the Beast just because I liked Emma Watson there. This movie? It doesn't even have that. Sure, it allowed to use more money for animation (no actors to pay), but with such a lazy script? It just feels like there's no reason for all that. Did you see those fan videos based on video games on YouTube? When fans take the parts of popular old games and re-create them with modern game engines? That's exactly how this movie feels. When you buy Ocarina of Time on 3DS, you buy it for the brand new quest. Not because it looks better and has 3D. Without the new quest, it's just the same ol' Zelda. Same exact experience. Same here. There's nothing REALLY new here. Nothing new to experience. And that's a problem.Another reason why this movie feels wrong is that... OK, let's just admit it, the original script was made for the funny cartoon characters. And this movie? It's WAY too realistic for it (like I've said, it's almost like you're watching the Discovery Channel). The original Lion King had A LOT of scenes that felt absolutely awesome and were incredibly funny exactly BECAUSE they had those funny cartoon characters. The characters who weren't realistic AT ALL. And I can't even say that the new movie has bad design. Quite the opposite, the design is pretty awesome. It's just... it doesn't work with this kind script. Imagine Tom & Jerry movie with the real cat and mouse. It just doesn't work that way. Tom & Jerry cartoons were so incredibly fun because they had toons. Toons that didn't even look like real animals, but were so... incredibly... fun... That's exactly what's wrong with the new Lion King. And the saddest thing is - it was incredibly easy to fix. All they needed is to fully re-work the script. To make the funny parts fit the realistic approach, etc. Unfortunately, they were too afraid of that. As the result... a HUGE portion of the original charm disappeared. Show this movie to a kid who never saw the original... and he / she probably won't even understand why people love the original Lion King so much. Sad. But true.So, like I've said, the new movie just can't repeat the success of the original. It doesn't have the impact. The story is still good? Sure, but it's an ages old story that everybody saw at least once. Seeing the same old thing all over again with no new content or serious alternations is just... boring. Everybody's favorite characters are still there and Mufasa even keeps his old voice? Sure, but the old jokes just don't work with the new kind of animation. Incredible animal animation? Well, aside from the music (Elton John is still here and there's even Beyoncé herself, who also provides her voice for Nala), animation is pretty much the only reason to see this movie. Because yes, it looks incredible. But honestly, even though I'm a HUGE fan of the original Lion King... I'm not even sure I want to add the new movie to my collection. I saw it in theater the day one, it was an eye candy, but if I'll ever want to experience Lion King again, I'll just dust off my old Lion King blu-ray. I can't say I hate the new movie, or something like that. I can't even say that it's bad. It's just... a less exciting version of the old masterpiece. Something you see once and never want to see again.",The Lion King
608,superkt,This was my absolute childhood favorite and meh.,4,19 July 2019,"I have to point out that I could probably quote the entire animated movie if need be. I know all the facial expressions and nuances the characters project. This is a big problem for a ""live-action"" animal movie. A CGI bird is not at all capable of making any face other than that if a freakin bird.
The songs do not have the effect when there is no facial expression along with the lyrics. ""Be Prepared""? For what? A disappointing half assed attempt at that song? The dark undertones of the song weren't there.
The charm of the hyenas is completely gone. No laughs to be had, no chemistry whatsoever between them, and the classic ""say it again... Mufasa! oohhhh."" is never uttered.
The voice acting is weak for almost all characters (little Simba was terrible but who can compare to JTT). Even James Earl Jones feels out of place. Adult Simba and Scar are the best acted. Like I said, I know every nuance of each character and this version had the lines read with no ""extra"", no silliness, no intimidation, no fun, just flat.
The banter between Timon and Pumbaa didn't have the same bite and the self aware jokes were just corny. You can't CGI a realistic meerkat in a hula skirt.
""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"" in the middle of the day while we stare blankly at each other? As lovely as Beyonce sings, she definitely Beyonce-ed up the song. Save the vocal runs for the soundtrack. Watching a blank faced lion sing that song like that was just offensive.
The ending had little tension. ""Lions! Attack!"" Are you kidding me? And the zoom out scene of Simba's flash back... really? They can't seriously think that looked good.
I started out this review as a 5/10 but the more I think about it, the lower I want to rate it. I'll admit I may be overly critical but even as a stand alone film, it does not hit the mark. It didn't feel like a Disney movie at all.",The Lion King

Disney's decision to have all black cast for the lions was definitely not their best decision. During ""can you feel the love tonight"" Beyonce drowned out Donald Glover. The addition of an original Beyonce song when Simba is running back home actually made people in the theater go ""what?"" as they were expecting the music from the cartoon which really makes you feel the emotion. Scar didn't seem like anything other than an angry lion. Pumba was great but something seemed off about Timon and I noticed Hakuna Matata just seemed ""quiet"".I get trying to go for a ""realistic"" approach with the cgi but this movie is all about emotion, it's what made us love the characters.

613,getpablo-80944,"Visual feast, dumbed down dialogue and zero heart",3,26 July 2019,"As expected, the movie opens with possibly, IMO, the greatest opening scene EVER in the history of movies. The song, the scale, it's all pretty close to the original, even if one or two notes are deliberately sung differently.Visually, the movie looks great. I wouldn't go as far to say it looks incredible, but it does look pretty good. But that's about it. Like so many people, I have seen the original so many times, I can almost recite every line word for word. And that's where the problem starts. A lot of the wisecracks and humor has been discarded with, for no apparent reason.So many of my favourite one-liners and jokes have been replaced with bland, instantly forgettable lines. Beyonce just overdoes all her lines, and the new song they slotted in, Spirit, was just flat and pointless, even in its two minutes of existence.For anyone who hasn't seen the original (and I realised there were actually quite a few of those in the audience with me), it might just be an average movie. For those of us who grew up with it over the past 25 years, it is a disappointing, flat, soul-less money grab by Disney and they should be ashamed of it. But of course, they aren't. It's all about the money, and not the heart, even though that's what Disney used to claim all those years back.The recent Jungle Book, which came out a couple of years ago, was much better than this movie in every aspect.

I'll start with a positive, it is visually brilliant and having James Earl Jones was a nice touch.
It's so down hill from then.
Firstly the songs just don't have the emotion you get from the original.
The voices do not work with the characters, it really was poor casting.

618,octagonproplex,Precisely what it was meant to be. (8.5/10),8,27 May 2020,"The point of this 2019 virtually photo realistic remake of the classic 1994 Disney traditional animation was to faithfully adapt that beloved original version's cartooned caricaturing into naturalistic physics as if the same exact story and characters could have been performed by real animals through precisely directed staging in front of a camera lens on location in the African Savanna - oh, and somehow articulate sophisticated angst and language sentiment as if fully conscious of sentient morality plights.It accomplished that task astonishingly well. I have no idea what anyone has to complain about, it's not as if the cartoon version suddenly ceased to exist, so if the original animated movie's more vivid and broad anthropomorphized expressionism is what you prefer then you're in luck because it's a classic that ain't going anywhere.The virturealistic version's fan service to replicate the original animation's iconography and signature beats is precisely why it exist and what makes it intriguing. That's not creatively lazy it's meticulously devout - as it was always intended to be. Also, in the first place The Lion King was never exactly the pinnacle of originality (Hamlet + Kimba The White Lion).I think what director John Favreau and vfx company MPC accomplished along with Caleb Deschanel's virtual cinematography input is nothing short of masterful and most beautifully reverential to its source inspiration. The character conveyance of emotion through its realistic animation is sublimely subtle and nuanced, I'm sorry if the Snapchat/TikTok generation can no longer process cadence of observable emotive behavior that isn't demonstratively exaggerated, but if that's really a delimma it is certainly a personal one not shared by the fine craft on display in this rendering.And let there be no debate, upon it's release Favreau & MPC's The Lion King was absolutely the most stunningly perfect computer generated sfx ever rendered in the history of anything to do with the milieu. The fact that a phoney fanatical backlash took any prevalence against such supremely realized work is a most shameful mark against a petulantly petty society that has lost all perspective.But whatever. As far as I'm concerned the remake's legacy can be as proof of concept - now let's have ThunderCats... ThunderCats... ThunderCats! Hoooooo!!",The Lion King
619,seraphin01,Schyzo remake,1,1 April 2020,"First of all sorry for the CGI team, if anyone did a good job on this hot mess it was them.. Technically there isn't much to complain about.. But artistically.. Oh God where to begin?This movie should simply not exist.. Why make a remake of a master piece cartoon that happens to be a musical and turn it to a realistic documentary style without assuming the songs they added to it?
Pick one, make it realistic or keep the original with a new polish, but you can't have it both way, that movie is a very harsh demonstration of that truth..I guess for the ones that never watched the original they might think this is actually an OK movie, but as soon as you have it side by side in your head, everything become clear, it's a destruction of what made the original a timeless classic.The characters are lifeless, that's the first thing you'll notice, they're dead inside for the most part.. Which is actually realistic, zazoo being an horn Bill looks perfect but his eyes doesn't convey anything anymore, same goes for rafiki and worse of all the lions (maybe scar is the only one that kinda have some expression.. Which is the dead inside expression he had in the original!)When the first song (aside from the opening) starts you can see the style doesn't work, simba barely open his mouth, it's like he's not the one singing even, the fun is gone..
And you thought timon and pumba would change that? Oh god it's even worse!! Timon speaks like in the comic animal dubbing from the 80's,just snapping a dub on top of animals being filmed..The famous Disney dubs, that would be great no matter what in whatever language? GONE!
How can you mess up the dubs for the first time while doing that remake? I saw it in English and French and they're both miserable, I couldn't believe it.. Was it the dubber's fault? Probably not, it's just no voice can fit those characters.. Just like adding a voice to your cat or dog would sound weird, well there you go, that movie was flawed by essence because the team couldn't decide on where to go with this remakeI would have loved to see a realistic version of this, no song, no voice even, something that feels more like one of those Disney documentary, that would have been something worth watching just for the quality of the cgi work!Anyway if you're still pondering if you should watch this or not, just don't save yourself the nasty taste this will leave in your mouth, go watch the remastered version of the 1994,it's timeless, never disappoint in any way.",The Lion King
620,sznhgn,Loved it!....Realistic and warm,10,23 July 2019,"Having read some of the reviews of the critics we thought we'd be disappointed, but this movie and the new animation really tugs at the heartstrings in a different way than the ""old"" animation could. We had read in critics' reviews that the animation left the animals expressionless. I'd say quite the opposite because it didn't have the exaggerated visuals the old ""cartoons"" showed and the approach resulted in great empathy with the characters and their kingdom, and the animals looked like real animals. My suspicion is that those who felt the technique left the animals expressionless 1) have never had pets to understand the nuances of their feelings and/or 2) believe animals have no ""soul"". or have no imagination. This movie was wonderful. My husband, who's not a fan of what he deems ""kids movies"" even enjoyed it....I didn't get old side-eye while we were watching it. (And by the way, we do not have kids and therefore, did not have kids with us.) Also, on the user reviews, I'm not sure what all the comments about voiceovers being bad and Beyonce voiceover being sub-par are about. Maybe I was just riveted by the animation, but there seem to be more than an abundance of those kinds of comments? Makes me wonder if some out of work voiceover specialist sabotage or other anti-Disney sabotage going on since they have produced so many block busters lately.

However, the hyper-realistic cgi didn't allow for the full emotions to show through. We lost a lot of the feelings by not being able to see the more human-like expressions you could relate to in the cartoons like furrowed eyebrows or teary eyes or big smiles etc. Instead it was kind of like those instagram videos where people do voice overs for animals in funny situations except with super HD national geographic type visuals.

633,kevinthecritic-15200,"Lion King 2019: The King Has Returned in Darker, Photorealistic Remake",9,20 July 2019,"4.5 out of 5 stars (one of the best of the year)The original Lion King changed the game for Disney with its Shakespearean-inspired story, beautiful animation, and catchy songs that are still loved today. So naturally, Disney chose to remake it using photorealistic animation (Meaning the lions and environments look like real lions and environments). While most critics have labeled it a soulless cash grab, I realized sitting the theater that I would finally see this story on the big screen, filling me with more joy than you can imagine. The Lion King retains much of its predecessors' heart, humor, and emotional impact with stunning visuals and great performances that negate its few missteps. The King Has Returned.
If you don't know the story of this movie, either ask someone or experience this for the first time. The same beats are hit (albeit without most of the cartoonish slapstick). It's Hamlet with lions.
The Lion King 2019 largely recaptures its originals' greatness. About 95% of the shots and dialogue are carried over, with additional lines added. The new voice cast is exceptional, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor's angrier, more threatening Scar. Donald Glover sells Simba's inner conflict, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are hilarious as Timon and Pumbaa, and James Earl Jones is James Earl Jones. With one exception, the songs are well-sung and slightly modified for this version, and the animals' expressive eyes coupled with the performances convey the emotion their faces can't always muster.
The few flaws only stand out because of how good the film around them is. Some of the dialogue delivery early on doesn't have the right amount of emotion in it, but that dissipates after Act 1. The love ballad ""Can You Feel The Love TONIGHT"" inexplicably takes place around 3 PM and isn't as powerful. Parents should know the wackier moments of the original are absent here, and the action scenes are significantly scarier given the more realistic look. Several kids in my theater were crying, so know your kid before you let them see this.
The Lion King 2019 is a breathtaking, emotional retelling of its iconic source with amazing acting, gorgeous animation, and great humor. Minor missteps aside, I highly recommend The Lion King for longtime fans or those experiencing it for the first time. The King Has Returned.

For example, Beyoncé's voice irritated me - especially her singing voice. It was hard for me to enjoy Can You Feel the Love Tonight because her voice was way too overpowering and the way she sings it just doesn't sit right with me.

I absolutely loved Timon and Pumba - the voices were spot on and filled with lots of humour.My only gripe, and sorry if I'm repeating anyone else here (I've not read the others) was Scar. Unfortunately I don't think anyone could live up to Jeremy Irons terrifying Scar - I found new Scars voice and presence simply wasn't there. There seemed no depth or feeling in the performance. In fact his voice was rather soft and almost kind sounding - no no.I'm not a massive fan of the Disney live action remakes but this is definitely a watchable one. I'm kind of glad they didn't deviate from the story - because how can you mess with The Lion King.
I do wish Disney would work on coming up with some good new material though, remakes of classics for me seem to be a little bit of a cop out.",The Lion King

652,rehensle,"A decent movie, but doesn't offer a lot new",5,31 July 2020,"I honestly didn't watch this movie with my full attention. It was more just something in the background with friends. For that kind of movie it's pretty uncontroversial and gets the job done. It hits all the beats you remember from the original animation. The 3D rendering is pretty impressive and it's definitely cool to see photo-realistic re-enactments of scenes in the classic film. It's also ocassionaly fun to hear a celebrity voicing one of the characters or singing.It's otherwise doesn't really offer much new in comparison to the original. I feel like this remastering isn't really necessary for new audiences to enjoy. The original's animation and pacing still holds up today, so this felt a bit unecessary. However, of the Disney remasters of animated films, I feel like The Lion King is one of the least controversial. None of the character models look hideous like Beast from Beauty and the Beast (2017) and the additions of new music and character traits don't feel as shoe-horned as Aladdin (2019). So honestly it's fine for what it is, and probably a decent stream if you are subscribed to Disney Plus. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this film though; the original is still superior.",The Lion King

654,skyisthelimit925,Better than I thought,6,23 July 2019,"Although I see this remake as an unnecessary move and had plenty of prejudgement about how good it can be, it actually was good enough. It's nothing like the animation one obviously but in its on way, it's enjoyable. I didn't find it boring at all even though most of the comments said so and most importantly, it was worth watching it at the theatre. All of the bad reputation it draws is mainly because of how bad the other live-action remakes were, so don't let it affect your opinion.Some parts are directly taken from the animation, some parts are changed; voice acting is better than I expected, camera work and CGI is incredible and together they form an enjoyable movie.Criticizements towards the emotions in the movie are mainly accurate as some scenes are emotion-wise less appealing but after all, these are animals talking and it's actually a live-action movie. There's no reason to expect the same mimics and same emotional scenes like there was in the animation version. And it's not like every scene lacks emotion or anything.Generally speaking, it was better than I expected. I won't recommend it as a must-watch movie but if you do it, you won't really regret it assuming you don't have any negative bias towards it.6/10.",The Lion King
655,Some-asshole,So now a lot of people see the flaws. Took them long enough,1,17 April 2020,"So finally most of the people are sick and tired with these remakes. It wasn't The Jungle Book (2016), or Beauty and the Beast (2017), or even Dumbo or Aladdin (2019). It was this, 2 months after everyone was praising Aladdin, now they loathe remakes!
So why did people turn against Disney with this film? Well, this is a shot for shot remake with bland performances. It also insults some of the songs like ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""Be prepared,"" it's 30 minutes longer than the original, character emotions are just gone and nowhere to be seen or heard, and it's completely animated.
So, this film is so lazy that it's not even live action. It's CGI. How low can Disney go? Well they did make Monsters University and Cars 2...
When Mufasa dies, the emotion is just missing, it's like it was drained out. This film sucks!1/10, one of the worst films ever imo, it's just like Psycho (1998) only it's Disney and a bunch of people are still tricked into seeing it and loving it.",The Lion King
656,bboygringo,Well..,5,25 November 2019,"The only reason i gave this movie a 5 star is because of the live action special effects, i must admit that it was very well made picture and very creative well done, but this classic has way more to it specially for people like me that came from the original Lion King age.This version has no soul, no emotion, bad voice acting, even with the nice special effects it has a really terrible facial expression, all these facts were the main things that made the original one of the best Disney movies of all time untill this very day, this version lacks in all of it.In my personal opinion what i found most not appriciated were my 2 favorite scenes from the original...
When Mufasa dies and simba is telling him to get up, and When simba sees mufasa appering to him in the clouds.
These scenes made me cry in the original every time i watched them as a little kid, However in this movie Mufasa's death has no emotion, and Mufasa's appering scene doesn't even happen.My advice, only watch this once in life if you got nothing to do and wants to appriciate the original even more before watching it again, make sure you ain't paying for it, or just avoid it and stick to the best one..the original.",The Lion King
657,arskhemnanilack,The Lion King - 4/10,4,17 July 2019,"I feel like everybody saw this coming, if Disney was remaking all their classic movies, then The Lion King had to be one of them. Just like all the other live-action remakes, this movie is really not good, and should've stayed as an animation because some things just work in an animated movie that don't in a live-action one. I do have a few good things to say though, the battles and fights in this movie are much better in this movie, because it's a lot more intense and raises the stakes by being realistic. The final showdown in this movie is one of few scenes that I really enjoyed. Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, and Billy Eichner in specific really had their performances stand out throughout their scenes in the film. Pumbaa and Timon being easily the best part of it. Now onto the main issues. Throughout it's entirety, there aren't any facial emotions or expressions because it tries to be so realistic, and that's what I mean when I say some things are just meant to be left in animation. It's something that bothered me throughout the whole film because it makes scenes so underwhelming and makes things so emotionless. The main issue is that the film is a direct copy of just about everything from the original, just without emotions and expressions. Some scenes being missing and others just brought down due to how realistic the movie tries to be. One thing in specific that really stood out is that the film was not formatted to 16:9 in my showing and the actual movie was like watching YouTube without zoomed to fill, it was just annoying and took so much away from the immersion. It's probably not an issue for IMAX but definitely is for normal viewings. The scene with the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"" was sung and presented in daytime, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I will say that the work they've been able to do with the realism is great, but just makes the movie feel like a test demo or something like that, due to not bringing anything new to the table.",The Lion King

662,themoviedoctor,A different perspective,7,6 August 2019,"There have been a lot of negative reviews discussing the use of CGI and inevitable lack of emotions in this movie. I think we can all agree that the original animated Lion King has stood the test of time, and the emotions that the animators invoke through their work is one of the reasons. The animated film has connected with audiences throughout generations. So if it is so beloved, what would be the point of remaking it?I challenge you to think about this film not as a simple remake of a classic Disney movie, but as a form of art. Yes, inevitably the CGI versions of the animals do not invoke strong emotional ties, but the imagery created by the computer is amazing!! The CGI is incredibly well done and the interactions between the animals appears to be so natural, as if this all could have actually taken place. And the imagination that the concept artists and voice over actors had to utilize in order to perform their work is also a tribute to their skill. Overall, this film is a work of art for reasons entirely different than its animated sibling and should be appreciated as such.",The Lion King

The Lion King original was fantastic, a musical that had decent music, animation that was outstanding, drama, betrayal, romance and the greatest characters Disney have ever made! But the new Lion King is a word for word remake, different actors making the acting worse, CGI making it feel like we are in a computer (which is good) and the same action as the original. It's just that the original was so perfect that nobody wanted this to happen. But it was okay. If you have seen the original Lion King you know the action that is about to go down, and you are just waiting for the CGI. But those who haven't are waiting for a brand new story. There is mild threat and child's strong language but those aren't worrying. The only thing that is worrying is the acting. 8/10.",The Lion King
665,ma-01629,Not bad but not good either,5,5 September 2020,"I guess we should start with the goods. The visuals and CGI are absolutely incredible. It really looks realistic either. I also thought the kid actors did a great job voicing both young Nala and Simba. They both really sound like their original stuff and I also thought Donald Glover did a pretty decent job with Simba and James Eral Jones as Mufasa. Pumbba and Timon were perfect and Hakuna Matata was a great hit. Beyoncé was also ok I guess.BUT this movie really lacked the emotion, heart and color of the original. I just can't wait to be your king lacks all the color from the original, Can You Feel The Love Tonight lacked heart and it takes place during the day for some reason and Mufasa's death was horrible. The build up was intense and great but Scar and Mufasa and Simba lacked energy and emotion and I hated the slow mo. It looks laughable. The lions as well look emotionless with not one sort of emotion in their voice, making it bland.I also think Scar was miscast. His voice actor had some great lines but he just wasn't the right choice. His voice was not menacing or evil enough. He did an ok job but he was not the right actor for the job but the worst part was they cut out BE PREPARED! You know, the best Disney song and they instead turned it into a boring monologue. I was wondering when the song would start but it finished before it started. Bigger disappointment than Justice League in that aspect.This movie is overall not horrible but lacked the emotion and heart that made the original amazing.",The Lion King
666,MaarssenTheater,Such a shame,8,1 April 2020,"The new Lion King has a few moments of genius and the best animal animation that I've ever seen. But it is let down by pacing mistakes and sub par orchestration.The images in this movie are so gorgeous and the animal behavior (especially the facial expressions in the lions) so realistic, I hugely enjoyed the movie despite flaws that I feel could have been relatively easily avoided. It seems that this was a work of love for the animators but somehow the whole was off. Great to hear James Earl Jones again. Pumbaa and Timon were great. I loved the new Simba's hair scene. But why rush over the love scene and some other buildup moments that made the original so great.I also feel that Hans Zimmer missed the mark on the score. I find it wonderous how he succeeds in making an orchestra sound like a collection of electronic instruments. It's not super bad necessarily, but it doesn't match the original in warmth and depth. This soundtrack is nowhere near as good as some of Zimmer's other scores.Such a shame. The first-rate (did I say: awesome?) animation and some moments of wonder made this an above-average 8 for me. But with more love this could have so easily become a 9 or 10.",The Lion King
667,Charles_Carmichael,"Breathtaking, but there is a but",6,19 July 2019,"So visually this is beautiful and goes to show the impressive strides in CGI.Now the but, This will be compared to its source material, in this case the impressive animation. Where has the live action faltered ? for me clearest example is Scar, the animation is voice by Jeremy Irons, and pretty much every line utters you can sense the malevolence under pinning the voice, this version voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor simply does not portray that.The songs throughout the film are subtly different to the, with only Circle of Life really pulling the same gravitas as it's counterpart, the much toned down 'Be Prepared' fell so flat, mainly I suspect as Disney have been unconformable with previous references from the animated,Is it worth watching at the cinema, yes

The CGI is really spectacular on many of the eyes of the characters for example on Rafiki's baboon close up's those eyes are so detailed and expressive it was just incredible to see. Some of the lion's expressions were less so which was a bit of a let down. Felt as if they could have gone a bit more facially cognizant to present more feeling.
Once again, Pumbaa and Timon do some great scenes and just make you crack a smile. Glover was great, Beyonce did a good job but hearing James Earl Jones once more as Mufasa is the true deal.

You know it's good when you want to rewind a scene.. I've been in this ""Fast- Forward"" phase but I wanted to watch this again & not skip a thing!
1st. I love the fact they used actors from origin of where The Lion King is based out of. In this case, the best choice would be African and African/American actors for this movie. This movie is based in Africa. It's 200iq using their origin. If this was based somewhere else & they used 1 set of people then I would be questioning things. They made sure to think of great ways to make this movie work in 2019.1.5: This is a REVISION of The Lion King meaning there wont be a Lion King 2 but more remakes! This can't be the Last Lion King, not that I didn't love it but I just have hope! I'd love to see how different actors work in this. Rotating and keeping some from this in. So don't worry They'll use different actors and rotate others in! So these 5/10 ratings(reviews) are not accurate & everyone should be more loving.2nd. I have seen many movies getting low ratings when preferred actors are not included in it. I don't like that trend. If the movie is good or the show is good, or you get a great feeling of joy from it like goosebumps, that normally means the production did something amazing to give you that feeling.My Review:
Wow Disney did a great job. Making nature talks beautifully. How they made nature funny and sweet but powerful. I loved how the Little Water Elk/Deer finds Simba in the garden after Simba is playing with butterflies and he's like ""Geez you scared me Simba! I thought you were a REAL LION😂, like a lion lion! Oh Nvm! Ima go now!""😂 An Alpha Male Lion with It's Prey but they are friends chillin in a garden!I like how Disney, during the ""Mbambawe, The Lion Sleeps tonight"" scene, Make it seem like Timon & Pumbaa had a GREATER Scheme/plan! Plan To attract a huntress Female Lion to the area because they knew SIMBA WOULD SAVE THEM! So they sang, bringing attention themselves. It was all part of the plan of ""Friends Hooking friends up!"" Timon & Pumbaa are singing a song about mating and basically know they need to attract a huntress Lion so in the wild, if this were Real life, a WartHog & a Timon would make noises in the wild to bring attention, but in the movie they just sing!
If you don't understands, They were hooking his friend up with a mate, IT WAS ALL PART OF THE PLAN! They knew Simba would come to help & knew Female Lions Hunt!Wow, so I felt that I needed to write this after watching that Nala scene with Simba after she chases Pumbaa then hearing how beautiful Beyonce sounded when Simba asked ""Nala?"".. it really made the best Nala impression I could have asked for. Who else could have been a perfect Natural Female Lion? The best choice in every aspect.Beyonce the perfect Nala - I loved the voice acting! Her voice is just soothing. She must be a nice woman to be around.I would love to more Animal Movies where they keep perfecting the realistic graphics and mouth movement while making sure the animal looks real. I would prefer this to 3D animal movies. I would love to see Pets made this way or s bugs life. That is an Art. If that can be mastered nowadays, then you can make even newer movies, not just Historic remakes!I haven't read any of the reviews because I wanted to give you my pure review. I can go in detail about the acting and all the but this movie already had script and going too far from that would destroy the classic. It's a classic because we can make infinite revisions! So I rather leave everything on a positive note as I am happy after watching something for the first time in a couple movies and shows. I watch & review tons of Movies/Tv, started a long time ago on IMDb. I watch everything and I've been busy this week with things to watch but I've been in a fast forward phase where I skip parts but I was in Rewind/Rewatch Mode! You could watch this 3x in one day and be happy.
Yes, I wanted it to be longer. I will have to see the reviews to see if they agree and all that. But I will be looking over movie reviews and liking the ones that give this a fair chance with no other thing than the movie causing the rating.Thank you IMDb for allowing me to write my thoughts on what I enjoy.Thank you Disney, you and the entire team and actors did a great a job.Cheers,

The visuals are so realistic that they could easily belong to a David Attenborough documentary, however as a result they don't deliver the magical visuals you'd expect from a Disney movie.There's an emptiness which you would not expect, you'd expect to be emotional at certain scenes and there's nothing.

681,jeffreyoliverrock,It Looks Nice... That's About It,3,7 November 2019,"It's hard to say what my ""all-time favorite"" Disney movie is, but the original Lion King would undoubtedly be in my Top 5, likely even Top 3, and I'm sure many others could say the same. That said, I had high expectations, but tried to keep an open mind.The classic opening scene with the song ""Circle of Life"" is almost shot for shot exactly, but in live-action animation form, and I did think it was cool seeing it this way. Although, while the song is sung well by Lindiwe Mkhize, something felt very off about the mix. The vocals overpowered the music and made it hard to hear at times (I found this annoying in the other songs as well).As we start to get further into the film and through a bit of dialogue, I'm already starting to feel a little disappointed in the voice acting. I hate to say it, because I love James Earl Jones, but his performance is so weak in this film. Some might say it's because he's older now and can't project like he used to, but that didn't feel like the problem. The original Mufasa is a highly respected king that you wouldn't dare mess with, but he was also a likable character and knew how to have fun. This Mufasa is kinda boring, he just has a ""yeah, whatever"" tone about him. It feels like Jones isn't even giving half the effort and emotion of the original. The remaining characters do okay, but still feel kinda bland.""Just Can't Wait to Be King"" was performed fine, but again with the mix. I think it could have gone without the extended Zazu commentary. I was waiting to see the big animal choir get twisted up and Zazu getting squashed at the end, or something exciting like that, but instead the song just ended on a long shot and faded to the next scene...Another positive I'll give about this movie is the Hyenas. I actually got a little spooked by the close up Hyena shots, they at least look intimidating to me.One of the most cringing scenes to me was when the song ""Be Prepared"" appears. This is my favorite song in the original film, and an important song and segment of the original. The song is done so poorly in this film, I asked my friend to pause the movie and play the original song before continuing. Less than half of the song is in the film, and it's more spoken than sung. A drunk guy at karaoke could have done better. Huge disappointment.Mufasa's death scene is more downs than ups. I will say positively that the stampede shots were pretty cool. But I'm sorry, it just did not hit me when Simba approaches his dead father, the emotion is just not there to me. No tears from Simba or any of the other lions. Mufasa's death in this film feels like ""well, that scene's out of the way"".Timon and Pumbaa have their moments in the film, but I still prefer Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as them. I was not at all a fan of this films rendition of ""Hakuna Matata"".As far as Donald Glover as Simba... Sorry, but not impressed. I have no problem with him singing as Simba, as he does have a good voice. Acting wise, it sounds like he's reading for a high school play or something his whole role, it just feels boring.Okay, here's one thing I can say this film has that I wish the original did. I liked that they extended ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"". In the original, Timon and Pumbaa are seen singing a short portion of the song acapella. In this film, they get through a couple verses and have some music behind it.That said, some of the films other extensions I thought were unnecessary, like the mouse walking and the lock of hair in the wind that goes on for like two minutes. Scenes clearly meant for filler that could have had more important scenes in their place.""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" is performed okay, but it bugs me that it's bright daylight during the scene.The Rafiki character in this film is as boring as Mufasa to me. In fact, one of his best scenes, one of the most important scenes (if not, the most important scene to the original) was totally skipped! The scene where Rafiki hits Simba on the head with his stick and tells him it's in the past so why does it matter? The past can hurt, but you can either run from it or learn from it... That scene is not in the movie... Why? Simba decides to go back home after hearing (not seeing, the ghost never appears in the clouds) Mufasa and just realizes on his own what he has to. Another big disappointment.While I thought the dialogue during the intense ending was underwhelming, I will positively say that I thought the fight scene, visually, looked pretty cool.In conclusion, I personally think this rendition of The Lion King is nothing compared to the classic, not even close. The film is visually pleasing, and it is kinda neat to see Pride Rock and areas of the classic movie in a more real-life setting, but that's all you really get out of it. It could have been done without re-recording the music and voices. The acting isn't that great, the songs aren't mixed well and sometimes not performed well, important stuff was left out, what was changed was filled in with... filler. Whatever ""fresh and new"" idea Disney was trying to bring here besides appearance, I didn't catch it. My stars are for the animation crew on this one.",The Lion King
682,keywester-05337,Why are there so many haters?!,10,31 July 2019,"I went to The Lion King in 1994 with my children, I saw the Broadway play twice and have watched it many, many times at Disney's Animal Kingdom. I am as much of an expert on The Lion King as anyone. This movie touched me in 1994 and made me look at myself at that time and evaluate myself. That movie moved me.
I saw the Broadway musical in Tampa FL and was simply overwhelmed by the beauty.
Then I watched the 2019 version and want everyone to know - To HELL with the haters. I don't know what they expected but, this movie is amazing and steps proudly into the footsteps of previous versions. Yes, there is some dead eye in the first 15 minutes but, it doesn't last. The hyena scenes are much more intense than Whoopie Goldberg. The final battle is intense!
Love this movie like you have loved every iteration of LK. Ignore the haters, they probably have never seen the original in the theaters, have never been moved by it on Broadway and simply hate for the sake of hating.",The Lion King
683,geeboy-48854,Not worth the remake,4,20 July 2019,"I just saw this in the theater with my 4 yr old and she was really scared a lot of the movie. I'm not sure why the director would make the movie like this since he knew it was going to attract kids of all ages so who knows what his target audience was. The worst part is it didn't need to be so loud and overdramatic but thats just one of the many issues I had with it. The parts that tried to be funny were not really funny since it was simple jokes which is a shame since they had very funny people doing the voices. The songs and singing were also sub par so a lot of this just seems half ass. Like they knew it was a visual masterpiece, which I do agree with since the animals look amazingly real, but just like with high budget action movies that have no good plot and writing it seems like they sunk all their effort into the visual and lacked on the script.",The Lion King

685,papparrazzi,Is Good But....,3,20 July 2019,"The most beautiful thing about the remake is that it looks more realistic, the graphics are amazing, but the movie was a bit of a flop, I tried to get keep an open mind, but it was very very hard. Though the graphics were good, the emotions were not there. The voices were a little bit of a downfall because they weren't as emphasised which is rather confusing.The question was, how can you reenact an animation realistically?? The answer is, you can't, which put brought the movie down.
Unfortunately, the song ""Be Prepared"" was completely ruined for me as it was one of my favourite songs in the movie itself.
What the hell happened to Rafiki?????????
They moved too fast through the scenes, it was really hard not to get up and leave.Overall the movie could have been a lot better but it was rather a wasted opportunity.I am very disappointed about this.",The Lion King

687,aquawave-84891,Spectacularly close to original but paled in some aspects,9,2 August 2019,"This film kept spectacularly true to the original. In fact, the only significant differences I noticed were scenes that were added for aesthetic, world-building purposes. I did, however, feel that a couple of the casting choices paled in comparison to the original voices (for instance, Whoopi Goldberg).The visuals were so well done that, at some smaller moments, I wondered if they spliced in documentary footage. However, due to this focus on realism, facial expressions were generally lacking. While this may be a problem for some viewers, I found the music, sound effects, voices, and body language sufficient enough to see what the characters were feeling.",The Lion King
688,rdatsun,"If your just in it for the visual, not a bad watch. Otherwise stick to 94 version.",5,1 August 2019,"Honestly there isn't really much I can say about this one. Really if you've seen the '94 version, you're not missing anything with this one. Yes on a technical level, the movie is impressive, the CGI looks wonderfully realistic and a great improvement of the software. Looking forward to when they use it for more original properties in the future. But while a marvel, being more realistic means you get all the realisim of the animals on screen, namely no way to really show emotion to them. Yes their voice actors do a find enough job (Surprised that the new VAs of Timon and Pumba manage to be on par with the originals really and nice hearing James again as Mufasa though it's obvious he's aged since the original) and body movement tries it's best to showcase what the characters are feeling. But, won't lie, it just loses that magic to help convey the story. Were essentially just watching real wildlife act out ""The Lion King"", that's pretty much it. Likewise not a fan of some the shortening on some scenes such as the ""Be Prepared"" song (Seriously, you take the risk in 94 but are suddenly scared to do it in the new '10s because Nazi similarity? Wha?) . It just all feels watered down.Not saying those who want a new take or haven't seen the '94 version yet won't enjoy it. If you do, more power to ya, I honestly hope you do. Different strokes for different folks and all. But if this is indeed the case for the latter, please watch '94 version later to see what I mean and make the decision yourself which is better. Overall though, for me, this film is just a painfully average curiosity at best.",The Lion King
689,pluem_chaisiri,"Visually Stunning, but that's about it",7,22 July 2019,"The 1994 Lion King is my childhood and one of my all time favorite. I've lost count of how many time I've watched it, and that's why I have really high expectation for this remake. And, frankly, it didn't disappoint.First, I would like to salute the people behind the beauty of this film. They did a really wonderful job here with the cgi. The visual is stunningly beautiful. Everything look so real, from the scenery to the animals. The talented people behind all these deserve all the praises they could get. With all that said, I have one problem with the cgi. Because they try to go for the realistic look, they end up losing the emotions of the characters. For example, I couldn't tell that Simba was sad or happy, which I think is really important for this film. The audiences need to be able to sympathize with the characters. I didn't feel as connected to the character as much as I had when I'd watched the animated version. Moreover, because the lions are supposed to look real, I sometimes find it hard to differentiate the characters.Moving on to the story, just like many people have said, the plot is exactly the same as the original. I can actually say that there's absolutely nothing new added to this movie at all. However, it didn't annoy me, since I know it's a remake and I was expecting that it will be the same story with more realistic looking animals.As for the casts, I think everyone did a good job. I know that many people doesn't like Chiwetel Ejiofor voicing Scar, but I personally don't think he's bad. Since this film supposes to portray realistic animals, I think having the voice of Scar from the animated version might make the film less serious. Although I love Jeremy Irons' Scar, I think I prefer this type of not so cartoonish evil Scar. And may I just say that I'm so glad that Mr.James Earl Jones reprised his role for this remake. He was truly a legend. I couldn't imagine anyone else as Mufasa.Truth be told, I can't say this film is flawless. It has quite a few flaw and it couldn't possibly beat the original. It lacks the emotion and soul the original has. Still, I think it's a pretty nice take on the Lion King, and I don't think that anyone can argue how stunning the visual is.",The Lion King

695,thibault-li,Bad artistic choice and lure of profit ?,6,1 August 2019,"It is now obvious that The Lion King story doesn't suit the Live Action movie format.
Because of its realism, the movie loses the expressivity, fantasy and humor of the original one. The songs have been shorten and some dialogues have been rewritten, only not for the better.
At least, the movie could have been smarter. It is in certain points, some incoherences have been fixed but not all, but in general the ideas lack of developments.
Jon Favreau may not have been the better choice because he is not really good at filming landscapes (I already saw it in The Jungle Book). James Cameron (Avatar) and Ang Lee (Life of Pi) would have done a better job.I had shed a tear or two in some key scenes, but it was very modestly made.

I saw all the bad reviews, and thought I might just get disappointed.. but I didn't.

But I expected that going in. The original is sort of untouchable. Plus it was a cartoon, this is not a cartoon. Overall, it was was better than I expected it to be.The story is the same as the original. They didn't change much, they just mostly took the cartoony parts out so it would be more realistic, which I was fine with. It wasn't a complete shot-for-shot remake, but pretty close. They changed the lines a bit and there were some funny parts. Definitely more of a recreation of the original.The voice acting isn't amazing. I liked Zazu, Timon and Pumba the most. Mufasa is still the same voice (good call, Disney), the hyenas were pretty good, and Scar was mostly good. Young Simba and Nala were fine (young's Nala's singing voice was impressive!). Adult Simba was okay but I hated Beyoncé for Adult Nala. She was just god awful. And somehow she butchered Can you feel the love tonight. Wow. And That song has never been my favorite... but the new one is just so much worse. Very cringey..So now for the best part. The CGI. I have NEVER seen anything like it. Just ridiculously gorgeous, I couldn't believe how much work went into this. I had to stop the movie in the beginning to google if I was watching an actual live action movie with CGI over it. Nope, totally CGI. Incredible. That right there makes it worth the watch.This movie is a one-time watch for me.

The visual side of this movie is crazy, you could tell that they took time and put effort in to make it look fantastic.There are reasons this movie wasn't as good as the original. The first is the voice acting, I felt it was underwhelming. I wasn't feeling Donald Glover's Simba at all. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner? Great! James Earl Jones has his distinctive voice but at 88 years old there was a lack of emphasis.The second reason is emotion. The first movie really shows the emotion of the characters but in this movie? How can you show emotion in a real lions face? It's difficult and this movie really struggled.The final reason is that it was all near enough the same. Aside from the end fight being more elaborate and a slap in the face rather than the throwing of paws the movie is exactly the same as before. Give or take a couple of small scenes.

712,rstarzecmoviecritic,Very Faithful to Original,7,20 July 2019,"The Lion King remake might not be as stunning as the original, but it holds up to be a solid film that has only a few key differences from the beloved classic in terms of the story. If you were to watch both versions back to back, other than the obvious difference of 2D animation versus CGI animation, they would seem almost identical. Some critics have complained about how identical the two versions are since it means that Favreau's version does not take many new risks. Making a film unique should always be a priority, but how can we really expect the filmmakers to try to improve a movie that is already hailed as one of the best by Disney? 2019's The Lion King is only a little disappointing due to its faithfulness to the original, but hey, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""One problem some critics have with this version of The Lion King is that the type of animation does not allow for human emotions in the characters' faces as the 2D animation allowed in the original. This is an understandable criticism of the film, but you have to remember, the characters are animals, so do they really need to show human emotion? Even without emotion in the facial expressions, emotional scenes in this film still cause the audience to feel and sympathize for the characters in the movie. There is more than one way to evoke emotions from the audience members - Hans Zimmer's score (again) is very effective in that famous scene which revolves around Mufasa. The score with the combination of fear in young Simba's voice was able to bring a tear to this critic's eye.The biggest disappointment in this movie compared to the original is the character of Scar. First of all, his only song in the original, ""Be Prepared,"" is cut extremely short in this remake. Scar basically sings one verse of the song in this version and then it ends; it is extremely abrupt, and the hyenas have no involvement in the song at all. On top of that, compared to the original voice actor, Ejiofor's voice barely sounds menacing at all. If anything, his voice is very monotonous in his role as Scar and does not show a wide range of emotion like in the original. Speaking of voice acting, Beyonce shines as Nala in both voice acting and singing, whereas Donald Glover proves to sing well in his role, but sounds like a teenager when voice acting for adult Simba. Just like in the original, adult Simba is in about a third of the movie, and Glover does not seem to contribute to the character as much as Broderick did in the original.What Favreau and the screenwriter add to this movie proves to be enjoyable. There is a great throwback to the original during ""Hakuna Matata"" in this version, and only die-hard fans will notice the joke, but it is a very smart breaking of the fourth wall. Timon and Pumbaa also make a reference to another classic Disney movie. Disney making fun of itself; this is the first time since Ralph Breaks The Internet that Disney has chosen to do that, and it is cool the executives at Disney can have a sense of humor about their movies.While the remake of The Lion King might not be as solid as the original, it still proves to be an enjoyable throwback if you don't mind seeing a movie that is almost identical to the first one.7/10",The Lion King

I actually think that Beyonce is miscasted as Nala both the talking part and the singing part. This is not hating on Beyonce. She's very talented but her voice just does'nt fit in this.

You will be wondering if certain scenes are CGI or did they use real animals? The script is true to the original (as far as I can remember) but the visuals are unparalleled.My only complaints were the casting. Sorry guys....Beyoncé is a generational talent but that talent ain't acting. Her performance felt wooden. Like it was being read not performed. And I get that Danny Glover seems to be the flavor of the month but he too seemed disinterested with the role. I'd have preferred two nobodies who were gifted voice actors. Let's be honest. NOBODY should see this because Beyoncé or Glover are in it. I'm not even an Elton John fan but when movie's signature song plays I couldn't help but feel let down with Beyoncé's lesser rendition. That said, at no time did this ruin the film.My son was not happy when he learned he was seeing this movie. He never connected with the original but he along with myself and wife loved this one. Great family entertainment.I hope those writing/reading these reviews keep in mind that this is a child's movie and in my opinion the ideal kind. One where the parents are entertained as well. If you're a non-parent and reviewing this and think it was bad or not as good as the animated original ....do me a favor...come back in ten or fifteen years and update your review. Bet when you watch it with your little one you'll understand the greatness of the movie. Appreciating the significance of the movie's message which every parent experiences as they face their mortality, while praying they've prepared their children to take the reigns in our own circle of life. It definitely had a powerful effect on me. Not sure I'd make that claim if I didn't see this with my son.We are all Mufasa. We are all Simba. And we all know and battled a Scar.

Some of these have worked really well, (i.e. 2016's The Jungle Book and this year's Aladdin) and some not so well, (2017's Beauty and The Beast for example.) Treading on such sacred ground as The Lion King would almost be sacrilege right? After seeing this in a packed theater earlier this evening, I must say, this new ""Live Action"" Photorealistic Animated GCI version of Disney's triumphant 1994 film is just as spectacular and emotionally driven as the original animated film was, if not even more so! In fact, a minute into the movie I began to giggle. I was struck dumb just by how stunning and awe inspiring the visuals are, so much so that at multiple points in the movie I forgot I was watching an animated GCI movie and thought that I was watching REAL animals!Hans Zimmer's Music was once again uplifting and chill inducing, giving us some familiar musical cues from the original, while still treading new ground and giving us some slightly new music to fit the story. Plus, it was wonderful to hear the old classics like ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"", and I actually love this movie's version of ""Be Prepared"" better than the one that was in the animated movie, as it's much darker, sinister, and frightening!And yes, while the Story is familiar for the most part, there are some things in the story that are expanded on that were missing from the animated movie, as well as some fantastic new small additions to the story as well!Jon Favreau and Disney also could not have picked a better voice cast for this either! The young actors of JD McCrary and Shahadi Joseph Wright voicing Young Simba and Young Nala respectively were amazing, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar brought a deeper level of cunning and terrifyingly sinister schemes of villainy, Beyoncé was really great as Nala, and so was Donald Glover as Simba, but once again, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen steal the show as Timon and Pumbaa! The hilarious one liners and humor from those two are really really well done, and had me almost in tears from laughing so hard!All in all, I was left stunned and speechless by how beautiful and awe inspiring this film in not only in the photorealistic animation but in the voice work, the music, and humor and subtle additions to the story as well. Disney's line of live action remakes are finally justified by this one incredible movie! It's a remake you didn't know you needed, but when you do see it, it'll make you want to stand up and cheer! What a triumph! Long Live The Lion King!! I highly recommend it!!",The Lion King
729,hesterroozeboom,Seriously?,1,3 August 2019,"Allright. This movie was a new level of awful. All they did was copy the better version of this movie and removed some really good parts. That would've been okay if they replaced it with something better. But they didn't.
Did they really think it would be okay as long as it looked pretty?
It was really weird to see this realistic animals talk. They had a mouth that could form words, wich made the whole thing very awkward and not realistic again.
Do not see this. It's a big waste of money and time.",The Lion King
730,jessfaith-45971,One of my least favorite films,2,1 August 2019,"The ""live-action"" lion king is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The cgi was ugly, there was zero emotion and the voice acting at times felt forced. But, there are some pros:
-Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious
-Hyenas are awesome
-Soundtrack is amazing and intense and songs are sung wellAside from that, the film completely lacked emotion and was a shot-by-shot remake of the original. Many scenes felt like cheap copies and were shortened. I was angry at how emotionless some of the scenes were. Simba's reaction to Musfasa falling off the cliff was so ridiculous looking because of the horrible cgi. None of the characters looked that impressive. On top of that, there were some uncomfortable POV shots and it was kinda scary looking. The voice acting also sounded forced at times. During the movie, it felt like the voice actor was detached from the character; like it the character was just lip-syncing really badly.Scar was a big disappointment. Many of his lines sounded forced or didn't make him sound like a bad guy. One of the biggest let downs was ""long, live the king."" It was neither chilling or menacing sounding. And he talked his way through ""Be Prepared"" which was only the last verse from the original.
Another thing I didn't enjoy was how the characters started singing ""the Lion sleeps tonight"" because it felt forced and kinda out of nowhere. Oh and ""Can you feel the love tonight"" was ironically done in the middle of the day with sunlight.Overall, this movie is pretty bad. Unlike the live-actin Aladdin, which developed characters and added new ones, lion king brings nothing new. While not the worst movie I've ever seen, I do not recommend it or intend to see it again. The lack of emotion and the cgi effects will only make you wish that you were watching the original.",The Lion King
731,airsnob-18715,Wow.,9,13 August 2019,"So I read all the reviews about how little emotion there was in this version and I have to say- my kids ? We're entranced. They loved it. No one was thinking about how little emotion anyone had. In fact, no one was really thinking at all because my kids love the story so much.
Of course there was a lot of comparison. To the first version. Personally I am glad they copied it exactly . It was a great and pretty much perfect story for kids already. The songs are favorites to this day. The kids wanted the songs and they wanted to see the first movie alive.
This story is intense. It's a child's version of Hamlet. But if you think about it... this story is slightly traumatic to any healthy kid with normal parents. I mean my kids were shocked by the turn of events in this story and it really tethers right on the border of being too much for children emotionally. The slightest change, the near miss and this is a movie that kids can't tolerate. So for us I think we were glad they stuck with the story we all know. My kids especially. It would have been a huge surprise for them and totally disappointing if the story and songs changed.
It was pretty scary as a matter of fact for my kids. My four year old spent half the time with his eyes covered. Because for them, without the cartoon, it became so realistic and much more poignant I think. Darker.
I thought it was beautifully done.
If I had a complaint it would be -no Nathan Lane. I mean Pumba and Timba from the first movie were the best. Why would they ever attempt to replace them? So Pumba and Timba fell short for me. But other than that, I thought it was an amazing child's story that kids all over the world will love. Hopefully it will also teach them to love the animals in this movie and not grow up to hunt or kill them, and actually protect them.
Which would be a happy cconsequence.",The Lion King

Something was just missing.But what really bothered me was that what I thought was supposed to be a touching, special movie, kept flipping into a silly comedy with fart jokes. There's nothing wrong with combining drama and comedy - as life is comprised of both, but this film didn't segue naturally into the comedy at all. There was this constant shifting of genre that just threw me every time and ultimately destroyed the film for me.",The Lion King
735,jeremycorbyn,A film for young guns,1,22 August 2019,"This film made an old man like me feel extra old so I felt very abused and tearful when watching it. It made me very sad so I don't recommend this film for senior citizens. This film had no respect for fragile senior citizens like me, at one point I even felt sexually abused whilst I was watching it! It also lacked a lot of diversity so that was also very disappointing and unacceptable.",The Lion King

742,kara2479,Stick to the Original for your kids,7,19 July 2019,"As as an Original 1994 watcher of the The Lion King, a film that I still cherish to this time of life. There was a Magic of the Lion King that can't be replaced. The 2019 version is Visually stunning and is a Movie that needs to be seen on the BIG Screen however, making it so big and CGI, the animals are amazing. I came out of the movie feeling something i lacking, it was the HEART of the movie. No CGI can replace the pure magic that was watching the Lion King for the first time.",The Lion King

744,ddush,Don't Listen to all the Haters reviewing this!!!,9,31 July 2019,"I have watched the original hundreds of times with my children many years ago and still LOVE it. I have seen the play twice and LOVE it! This movie outdid itself, was very impressed by the new dialogue, and CGI of course, and also added more lessons I believe in being good people, perhaps some of those reviewers don't GET that part or aren't good people, just saying! I see a TON of movies and loved the remake of Dumbo but this one is way better! Disney has added the new lines which we need more of these days especially, to I believe, drive home the notion that we should be good global citizens, in every way! Don't want to give anything away but loved Timon and Pumba too, added much needed humour to some dark turns. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children too young, so parents beware, as parts are too scary/intense, show them the original first for sure. I think there are some people, those in charge of some countries and their family, no names though, who SHOULD see this movie, but they probably wouldn't get the message either, as some of the haters didn't!! The ONLY reason I didn't give this one a ten is because it's kind of weird sometimes to see very real looking animals start singing, but that was only for a few of the songs, and they couldn't not do that as the haters REALLY would have had a fit and some of the songs really add to the story/experience. All in all GREAT JOB DISNEY!!!",The Lion King
745,researcher_11,No comparison to the original,2,17 March 2020,"This is a total rip off of the original Disney!! Few very good dialogues are missing. The charisma of Muffassa is missing , it just doesn't have that feel , that music , that aura that would grip you , hook you and take you in total trance of the grandeur of the king. Nothing like the real thing !!!!",The Lion King
746,EinatB,Do yourself a favour & watch the 1994 version instead.,2,19 July 2019,"Dialogues were changed to become more shallow & simple (for example word plays were taken out). The live action animation is too lack of expression - that it simply can't do well with the voice acting (& I'm speaking even without comparing it to the 94 version).
The hardest thing for me was the music downgrade:
Yes, they went with more heavy, accented vocals than music (a positive thing), but they used it all wrong (for example using an iconic theme in a different scene or out of sync with whats goes onscreen).
There were other changes I was onboard with, and though they were a refreshing take- but it doesn't saves this movie from being a complete grey yawn.",The Lion King
747,mcleaver-41776,It was beautiful,8,20 July 2019,National Geographic is what I thought of the entire movie. I loved it,The Lion King
748,sage-42618,Get the animated version,4,7 February 2020,"When is Disney going to learn that making a live version of a classic doesn't mean you're improving it? The animation is amazing, but that's what Disney is famous for. When the animated ""Beauty and the Beast"" came out, people marveled at the capabilities that computers gave the animators. Then they issued the live version. Sure, they make a lot of money, but you lose the soul of the story. Same problem here. There is a flow and blending to the original that just isn't here. Even Elton John and Tim Rice's music, some of the most beautiful music to come out of Disney, falls flat in this version. Beyoncé sounds shrill and disappointing. You'll cry at the appropriate places, but you just won't feel as good about this version. Get the original.",The Lion King
749,albunax,Watchable but not on the originals powerful level,5,31 July 2019,"The good:
The CGI was amazing.
The Circle Of Life was just as good as in the original.
Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were great and very funny as Timon and Pumbaa. They are the best characters in the film.
John Oliver was also great and funny as Zazu.
James Earl Jones was spot on as Mufasa.
Donald Glover was good as Simba.
The actors for young Simba and Nala were surprisengly good for both acting and singing.
More Screentime and development for Nala, Sarabi and Shenzi.
It really liked the longer versions of Hakuna Matata and The Lion Sleeps Tonight.
Hans Zimmer provides a very good soundtrack as usual.The bad:
Can You Feel The Love TONIGHT was sang in broad daylight. It is not better that Beyonce almost took over the song because you barely heard Donald Glover and that is supposed to be both Simbas and Nalas song.
Beyonce's Nala overall was very bland.
Chiwetel Ejifor was too aggressive and angry as Scar. I really misses Jeremy Irons who made Scar way more sadistic and bellivable, pity he didn't return.
John Kani was pretty good as Rafiki but he got only a very few lines and not the same crazy humor the old Rafiki got.
Some scenes that were only a few seconds in the original are some minutes here like the beginning with the mouse and how Simbas mane got to Rafiki. It felt like i watched a documentary when i saw these scenes.
Some really good dialogues in the original were either shortened or skipped totally.
Be Prepared was more of a speech than a song and was disappoingly much shortened.
Mufasas death and the final confrontation berween Simba and Scar felt rushed.Overall, this movie is watchable but do not have high expectations.",The Lion King
750,Shazia_de_Sousa,Outstanding quality of animation and an improved storyline,8,21 July 2019,"I was happy to see that they took advantage and changed some parts of the film that didn't make sense plot-wise into believable points that made an enjoyable film for all ages.The animation is the best I have ever seen. Each detail to the objects and beings, their fur and all the textures, attention to their small mannerisms such as the constant flicking of ears, gentle breathing, and so on amazed me.
There were hardly any slip ups or imperfect areas, one such being the face of one of the hyena's which looked a bit CGI'ed. But that was it. Everything else was so life like that I was transported to Africa.
The humour was amazing, they managed to have some really good jobs during the hyena parts and the Timon and Pumbaa parts.
The music was great, I wish they had Elton John singing his songs, but I enjoyed the new ones too, especially the Can You Feel The Love Tonight duet",The Lion King
751,ayeshakhalife,A lovely Movie,9,6 August 2019,"Title itself depicts story turns around wild life and their kingdom. Movie is very much entertaining mainly to kids. Lovely forest nature and wild life attract everybody in the theatre and make them stuck to their seats. Little simba is so cute and all the background voice also apt to each and every character. Timon and pumba are the added colors to this movie and songs like HAKUNA MATATA is so nice which make me feel like dancing in theater.
It made me feel all the same emotions when watching the original. It made me cry, smile, laugh, inspired, breath taken etc. And as always to this day it never fails to make me cry every time we get to the scene were Mufasa dies",The Lion King
752,Mickey089,Superb....,10,23 July 2019,"First of all, I am not a fan of the original and never seen the musical on stage but this movie is an easy 10/10 within his genre.Overall, fantastic CGI, some terrific voice over like Seth Rogen (should take a few more singing lessons), Billy Eichner, the kids for the young Simba and Nala and most others. But most of all James Earl Jones and even more so Chiwetel Ejiofor was spot on as the baddie. Scar is easily one of the greatest written villian of all time and boy did he bring him to life.
I agree there certainly would have been better choices as beyonce.I will not spoil the additions the movie included to the original and musical, but all were extremely funny or enjoyable.10/10 within the blockbuster genre does not mean it is perfect, but it is fantastic in my mind.",The Lion King
753,danchi-75448,I Enjoyed This!,10,20 July 2019,"If you have watched the original animated version, thought it was great and than watch this version-there is a unconscious comparison being made in your mind that I think won't allow you to see it from a different perspective and not vet it on it's own merits. I saw it with family members who have watched the original multiple times and they seemed to have some sort of block the minute the film started. One comment was ""I don't like it"" Why? It's too real"". Another, ""It's too big"" things along those lines but no comments of substance as to why they didn't like it. I personally have seen the original several times and I enjoyed both.

754,CallMeAi,"Great, but minor details keeps it from a 10",8,17 July 2019,"It's a very good representation of what The Lion King is and what it's about. And I highly respect that. Now there were some minor details that were, not bad, just not that good. And the details were following:Voice cast - nothing wrong with the voice actors. I think it's more like how they portrayed their character. It's not very memorable.Songs - I do love the soundtrack if The Lion King. And in this they changed it a little. Again, it's not that something's wrong with the singers, songs and how the songs were written but again, morre about the way they were portrayed. It felt far-fetched, as if they were trying to achieve more with the singing.Can You Feel The Love Tonight - now a lot of people agree with me when I say that the Can You Feel The Love Tonight scene in this movie did not do justice to the original scene. I was sad about this. And not necessarily because the scene was in broad daylight. But I felt like something was missing. I didn't get this nostalgic feeling.BUT. Aside from these minor details, there were some great things about this movie.The opening - ooooh how I LOVED the opening. So beautiful, so stunning and SO nostalgic. I got total goosebumps and I really loved it.The fight scene between the hyenas and the lions - now THAT was something. It got me really pumped up and I loved how it was done. I think it conveyed a lot of Simba's determination, you know what I mean?Timon & Pumba - not as great as in the original but how can you not love these two whether it's animation or live-action? I love these two and they were so humorous.And more... - visuals, new scenes etc.Watching this movie, I felt like a little kid again. Obviously, no movie is able to satisfy the likes of every single individual. I think you should give this a shot and determine for yourself whether this is to your liking or not.",The Lion King
755,bwkolbuck,This Movie Terrible,2,11 October 2019,"I really have nothing to say about this movie, which is the ultimate sin. I would rather your movie be laughably bad or really good then it just be forgetful and boring.Let's start with some good things:................Now some bad things: The only good things (including James Earl Jones' performance) about the movie are the things from the original Lion King. And even the stuff that gets ripped from the original isn't even as good. In the first one the animation is very expressive and has a lot of emotion especially when it's a dance number or something like that. but even when in the first Lion King when characters are just talking the animation allows the lions to be very expressive. The magic of animation (especially Disney movies) is you can take a picture of a character and you know exactly what they are thinking, if they are happy, sad, angry. And then I heard Disney made the film thirty minutes longer than the original and it was pointless and made the movie more boring. You know lions are one of the least expressive animals on the planet, so when you make The Lion King photo realistic it takes away from the emotion and life from the first one. There's a lot of shot for shots. I guess the actors (with the exception Beyonce) do a good job with what there given but you'll never make a Lion King movie better than the original, that's top tire Disney.I honestly don't remember anything from this movie. especially that extra half hour it's like it wasn't even their. This movie had no reason to be made, besides the obvious ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$). A little story; My mom and I went to the theater to try and see two movies at the theater in one day, so we just watched Toy Story 4 which was very good, and we had about an hour break and tried to find a restaurant to eat at and of the two we wanted to go to they were both closed. So we found one that was ok. And when we got back to the theater I was like: now I can relax wind down and watch a fun, entertaining, good movie and what I got was a stupid, dumb, corporate mess. In short started off on a high note and ended on a stupid note. As of me typing this review now I gave it a 4/10 but this could easily go down to a 3/10 somehow managing to be worse than Godzilla King of the Monsters. By the way I'm marked as *No Spoilers* because there's nothing to spoil since it's just the same movie.",The Lion King

The only problem is that there is not much emotion, but otherwise it's still joyful, funny and visually stunning. The songs are not very good, especially ' Can you feel the love tonight' sounds like a cash-grab and 'Be Prepared' is horrible. If you haven't watched The Lion King, I recommend watching the 1994 original rather than this. It's just like a pastime and not really memorable. I must admit that a year after I watched it in theatres in July 2019, in 2020, I could not remember a thing from this movie. It's somehow very forgettable. I watched it again this year. Good movie but huge degrade from the original. Aladdin remake was much better. Please just watch the original.

And since it was heavily promoted as the ""much awaited remake"" of the original, there is no need to review this as a standalone movie.1. The effects are really good. How could they not be?
2. I hate to say this, but what was the problem with the voices? Most of the characters dialogues felt like they wrongly synced with the video. Only Timon and Pumbaa felt right. This is unfortunate since I could barely watch the whole movie without being annoyed by this, and it's a shame since I could barely stand Zazu (voiced by John Oliver, whom I love!). Eichner and Rogen were on the other hand a pleasure as Timon and Pumbaa
3. The movie took absolutely no risk as a remake. There was nothing new added, and most of the movie scenes were simple copies of the original movie scenes shown through a different medium. So what was the point of making this in the first place?All in all, if you haven't watched the original, it is fun to watch.

This was the last time I spent money on a Disney movie/adaptation, as this is getting quite ridiculous that after ruining Star Wars, that is not enough, they are ruining classics.

Disney spent tons of money so I can sit on a comfortable chair in an air-conditioned room, eat pop corn and be entertained. And I don't expect any more from them. The movie is stunning and colorful and the music is great. The animals are beautiful with lots of cute cubs, the landscape is marvelous. I'm fully satisfied with what I saw. The 1994 animation is still there last time I checked, so much so that it is trending in every platform.

Same story, same characters, same dialogue, same songs - they even got James Earl Jones to reprise his role. Everyone loves the original - it's iconic. So why is a visually stunning, breathtaking even, new version so terrible? People complained about the CG animals - but as talking, singing, animals go you'd be hard pressed to find more realistic ones.

The songs sound like everyone recorded their bits at home and posted them to Disney.But the biggest problem is in their quest for realism they completely failed to put any emotion into any of the characters, all the lines are delivered in the same way with only movement in the mouth, it was kinda like watching a Syncro-Vox cartoon from the sixties, or if every character had just come back from the botox clinic.

I remember choking back tears when Mufasa died and feeling a father's pride (no pun intended) and hope at Simba's ascension to his rightful place at the end. In short the story resonated and drew me in in such an unexpected way and I've loved that film ever since.So when I got a chance to see a screening of this live-action remake I jumped at the chance. I couldn't wait to re-experience it in a new way. Unfortunately, I came away very disappointed. The story is the same, but it's told in such an uninspiring, bland way that I found myself bored and yawning halfway through it. I don't think the live action has the power to draw you in emotionally the way the animation does. It's tough to get a live animal to convey emotions I guess. I just didn't feel this film lived up the the original in nearly any way. I'm glad I got a free screening, but I'm happy I didn't have to pay full theater price for it too.This might be a good movie for someone who's never seen the original (or even the live play), but I can't imagine it having the same impact.",The Lion King
766,Sam56800,Flat out disappointment,2,16 August 2019,"I normally don't write reviews but this movie was so bad I just had to write something. This is absolutely nothing like the original. Yes, the visuals are spectacular and photoreal. But the emotionality and excitement from the animated version are nowhere to be found. It was like watching a BBC documentary with voice actors dubbed over. And not even good ones! Scar felt like he was half-asleep, with no sinister tone at all. The songs, which were so brilliant and melodic in the original, are completely stripped, watered-down, and just... empty. When I heard the lead-up to ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", I was waiting eagerly for the BOOM moment when the song would start, the trees turn red, and all the animals work together to get rid of Zazu. Instead, what you get is Simba's mouth barely moving along, and just a casual romp through the swamp. There is a significant lack of emotion in the eyes, mouth, and overall depth of the characters. It felt like they had no personalities. I have to say, as much as I love the advancement in technology and visual effects, there is a lot left to be desired in this remake, and I still think classic animation, when done properly, portrays character, heart, soul, and emotion much better. I had no idea how good the original was until I saw how bad this one is.",The Lion King
767,rickytravis68,They call me Mr Pig.....,2,25 October 2019,"...... not in this sad, emotionless, oh so pretty remake.... no they don't. The characters are so devoid of heart it's such a crying shame. The original humour and love is totally wiped out. I still cry watching the original but this left me feeling cold. The songs are not a patch on the originals. Oh I could go on and on, it's not terrible and for the PC generation it's probably perfectly acceptable but it's really just not on. And what happened to ""old"" Rafiki? Sad, very sad.",The Lion King
768,Rstein926,Disappointed!,3,22 July 2019,I had been looking forward to watching this film for months and months. And when I finally got to see it I was just disappointed. When the film started I was at first awed by the breath taking CGI effects. The animals and the surroundings looked so very realistic. And the opening song Circle of Life was great but not great as the original film. Obviously the film is a direct remake of the 1994 classic we all know and love. Once again we see Mufusa die and we see Simba befriend Timon and Pumbaa.But this film was just plain awful. Obviously because this is not a cartoon the animals lacked emotions and I even felt James Earl Jones was disappointing as Mufusa. He simply did not sound natural enough like he was in 1994 although he is understandably elderly now. Chiwetel Ejiofor was not bad as Scar but he was nowhere as good as Jemery Irons. Even Beyonce was terrible as Nala.I also felt the film was rushed. For example the scenes between Simba and Rafiki was shortened and Mufusa never said as much as a ghost as he did in 1994 and it was annoying we never seen his ghost.I really wanted to like this film but I sadly felt Jon Favreau ruined one of the greatest Disney films of all time. I will watch it again as I did not hate it but I never enjoyed it very much either.,The Lion King
769,mitsakosdlk,Good but....,8,24 July 2019,"As a movie is amazing, the picture and all are great like watching National Geographic, but lacks the emotion the original animated movie gave us.

770,tonyjcole94,Visually breathtaking. Talented cast. True to the roots. A real treat for the family,8,19 July 2019,"As someone who grew up watching The Lion King (90s baby here), I was thrilled to hear of the live action adaptation for Lion King was in the works. With Disney essentially making a live-action universe . It was impossible to leave something as iconic as The Lion King out of the mix.I expected critics to not like this film. It was almost inevitable . Something as iconic as The Lion King is embedded in the minds of fans everywhere . Any changes , no matter how slight will get you points docked. And that's why I feel critics have mixed emotions about this film. I personally think they take themselves entirely too seriously. This is a live-action adaptation of the story , meant to give the audience and realistic re-telling of the story , or should I say as real as possible(we all know animals don't talk). And that's exactly what this film did.Yes there are flaws , such as the animals not emoting because of the realistic CGI or some scenes not looking as colorful and majestic as they did in the orginal z but hey , you can't have it all. I throughly enjoyed the film. It was nearly a scene-by-scene recapture of the orginal film with some new material added, which was a smart move in my opinion. As I said before, a film as iconic as TLKSeth Rogen and Billy Eichener stole the show as Timon and Pumba . Their chemistry and charisma brought so much life to the film and none of the jokes fell short. Beyonce did very well as Nala despite some criticism on social media from short clips. Nala also has a much more developed character in the film which I particularly enjoyed. Scar was dark and intimidating , Chiwetel really did excellent for such a hard role to fill.Overall the movie funny , heartfelt, beautifully crafted, and just an overrall treat to watch. Go see it with the family and I assure you they will thoroughly enjoy it.",The Lion King

772,EarlGenesis,Quite possibly one of the worst Disney films I've ever seen,2,25 April 2020,"The problem I have with this film is the fact that it's impossible to not compare this to the original. Almost every scene - every line in this film is straight out of the original, and Disney expects me to me impressed just because they can flex their animation technology and bring together a celebrity cast. The animation is incredible, of course, but where is the emotion that this film is SUPPOSED to have? Am I supposed to feel something while looking at these expressionless and gesture-depraved animals? This is such a soulless drag of a film and it stands as one of the worst films I've seen from Disney.Can't say it didn't work out for Disney, though. They got their money. Not from me, though, because I didn't even bother to go see this at the movie theater. I rented it for a dollar.",The Lion King
773,nunonegro,Remembering the past,8,27 July 2019,"As I was scrolling the reviews of the movie, I was on shock about all the negativity and crítics to the movie...
I loved it. Yes it's not the original no, and I must say that there are some parts that I remeber from the original that would bring and extra Edge to it (for instance the talk of rafiki with Simba it's a lot diferent, and the ""live baite"" was given a twist I did not wanted -because it would remind me the original version)Other coments here talk about Simba caring for nala while runing from the hyenas, which i did not remember, but actually was important for criating empathy with the future King. This is actually a Petty, because Young Simba looked a lot like a careless and pretty arrogant without these small details.Others state that the movie was all about Beyoncé... Trust me on this, i think nala is extremely close to the original version.... Although I must admit the ""spirit"" music seemed like ""let's give her One more Song""Overall the movie is very good, close to the original version, some details are adjustted, but fit well in the story, and it helped remembering a Simple past.",The Lion King
774,blood-lust666,Beautiful and Poignant Film,10,6 August 2019,"The Lion King is my favorite Disney film, and this movie made me realize why all over again! It beautiful, poignant and a poetic exploration of the meaning of life. I am actually astonished by all the 1 star reviews for this movie! So here's my two-cents as someone who absolutely loves The Lion King.Several people are writing that it has no emotional depth.
The original Lion King is a veritable emotional roller coaster from start to finish, and this film is no different. For me, the realism gave it more emotional depth. I wanted to curl into a ball and wail when Mufasa died. There are so many other instances in the movie when I found myself unable to hold back tears. (One other scene of particular note is when Mufasa tells Simba 'I live inside you.') In fact, I cried for a good hour after the movie was over. I was so emotional wrought from not just the heartbreak but the power of this film. It made me appreciate how well-written and profound The Lion King really is!
Some have said they didn't feel an emotional connection because the characters didn't have facial expressions. This is a ridiculous statement. This is a realistic adaption, and the reality is animals do not express facially like humans do. Had they done so in this movie, it would have taken away the realism. The emotions of each character came across beautifully. You can clearly see the father-son bond of Mufasa and Simba on display, and it makes it all the more painful when Simba witnesses his father's death.Some of the negative reviews have also complained that it was a shot-for-shot live action remake of the original with nothing new. For those who are saying that, I think you've missed the point of Disney's live action movies. They are meant to be exactly like the original but realistic. I would be incredibly upset if Disney changed anything about the story.
Another gripe I've noticed with the 1 star reviews is they're upset Disney is doing live action versions of their animated cartoons instead of making original content. True Disney fans aren't complaining about this. I, as well as most fans of the originals, enjoy watching these realistic renditions of the movies we grew up with and love. If you have a problem with 'unoriginal Disney content' and these movies being shot-for-shot live actions remakes, then why are you even bothering to watch them at all? Or are you not watching them and just giving 1 star reviews to make some sort of statement? Either way, it's ridiculous.The only real negative I can say about this film is Beyonce voicing Nala. Beyonce's voice acting did not capture the character of Nala in any meaningful way. That's really my only complaint. Otherwise, this is beautiful, well told and visually stunning movie. And I must say, I am so thrilled that all these years later James Earl Jones is still the voice of Mufasa. 25 years later, and The Lion King still has me by the heartstrings! If you're a fan of The Lion King, watch this movie.",The Lion King
775,jeremiahxacosta,Disney,7,21 July 2019,What a great movie Disney is doing a great job with their live actions,The Lion King
776,cupofsoulshow,The Remix is not as good as the original,6,18 July 2019,"It's been 27 years since we received the original The Lion King, 25 years of Lion King on Broadway and now fast forward to 2019 Disney is giving us a photo-real Lion King. This Lion King has star power casting ranging from Donald Glover to the incomparable Beyoncé.The 24 million-dollar question is can this re-imaging of the classic tale expand on the original or will it simply be a film that's great on CGI but lacks personality?Three things that are vital to this story the music, the characters and the CGI. John Favreau took on this insurmountable challenge having previously worked on The Jungle Book. He said he learned a lot form the latter and applied those lessons to The Lion King.The scenery of this new version of The Lion King is breathtaking. I'm not sure if you can accurately call it live-action seeing that Lion's don't talk and sing the more appropriate terminology is virtual cinematography technology. In plain language think National Geographic, that portion of the movie is amazing. It's Disney and one would expect nothing less. The one drawback from using this resource is that it felt less personalized. There was no differentiation between the Lionesses. Nala and Sarabi looked the same. The same issue occurred with the Hyenas. The characters that were reproduced spot on were our favorite duo of Timon and Pumbaa. Although we could not see Rogen and Eichner their mannerisms were in full display on the screen.Favreau made some brave musical changes when it comes to this version of The Lion King. He brought back the academy award winning songs of Elton John and Tim Rice. Hans Zimmer returned to score however Pharrell Williams was given the task to add new life to old favorites. Naturally, Beyoncé wrote a new song called ""Spirit"". Gone is the catchy Morning Report which helped set up I Just Can't Wait to Be King. Morning helped establish the importance of Zazu, voiced nicely by John Oliver. Almost all Zazu's singing parts were cut. The songs were an extension of him without those songs he comes across as rigid.The biggest changes to the characters are in the form of Scar voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor. In this new version, he's loses his sarcasm and is portrayed darker. I missed the dark humor that made Scar such a fun villain and, in this version, his tone reminded me of Mufasa failing to draw clear differentiation between the two. I also felt the Hyenas deserved more screen time. Keegan-Michael Key and Eric Andre are two very funny guys, but it seemed in order to give Beyoncé more screen time they became the sacrificial lambs. Another misuse of talent was Alfre Woodard as Sarabi. One of the great aspects of The Lion King is the centralization of its female characters. This version neutralized her. Donald Glover as Simba was solid, and I enjoyed his duet of Hakuna Matata with Rogen and Eichner. Beyoncé was steady as Nala. The younger stars JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph were simply delightful.I saved the best for Last. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen made this movie go from lukewarm too great for me. They had the best chemistry out of all the characters in the movie. Their humor was contagious and natural. Rogen as Pumbaa got it. He dove right in and it shows. He may not be the world's best singer but who cares it's his exuberance that makes us love him. Eichner can flat out sing and may portray the smaller of the two but like Rogen his commitment comes across the screen. They simply killed it.This movie will introduce these characters to a whole new generation. Like my daughter, they will watch repeatedly but there's a part of me that wishes they would have left the classic reign supreme. This 2019 version is a visual masterpiece, but it needed more joy in the form of music. So, while I can appreciate this newer version, I still prefer the original or better yet go see the Broadway Show.",The Lion King
777,mlimufranklin,Amazing graphics! Lack in emotion,5,21 July 2019,"I guess with the realism of animals they couldn't include extreme emotions in their faces which was a shame as it was hard to fall in love with them because of this.I packed tissues thinking the real looking Mufasa meeting his death would cause nonstop tears but no, not a drop!Was disappointed Scars song was almost nonexistent. The hyenas lacked the silly comedy the originals had.Beyonce might want to stick to singing.... her own tracks. Like another viewer said, she over sung where it wasn't needed.",The Lion King
778,jgraff-20249,A live-action movie...minus the life,3,21 July 2019,"I felt nothing through this entire movie, and I was disappointed in myself if I grinned at one of the new jokes because they were just not good. Their shoehorned jokes and new dialogue was out of place, and the music was so poorly timed it seemed like it was a problem in theaters, like the audio got shifted and wasn't in sync with the movie, but it's just a poorly timed score.I disagree so much with the choice of voice actors, my top complaints being Simba and Timon. Donald Glover played Simba in this ""too cool for school"" fashion, and not the guy who just wants to forget his past. It felt like Simba just didn't care, instead of his real reaction, which should have been not wanting to go back to his past guilt.
As much as I like Craig from parks and rec, he was just wrong for Timon. He played more whiny than happy-go-lucky. Luckily I liked pumbaa's character enough to excuse Timon a little. But this is what I can't excuse: getting rid of Timon and Pumbaa's luau distraction and replacing it with ""Be Our Guest"" made me so angry I had to stop myself from standing up and booing! Not only did they get rid of my favorite part of the original, but replaced it with a plug to watch their other live action movie which I disliked just as much! That part is 100% my opinion though.Overall. I left theaters feeling like I wasted my time, also saying ""what was the point?"". It was nothing special compared to original. The new pieces added nothing, and I would say even took away from the movie's heart. I think 3/10 stars is generous, I only give it this rating because of how far special effects have come. I don't hate this movie because it's a remake, I hate it because it is a disappointment.My advice: don't watch the original to ""catch up"" before watching this one. You will just be more disappointed.",The Lion King
779,sktraut,Copy and paste (minus Jeremy Irons),4,20 July 2019,"I watched this thinking it might be on par with the remake of the Jungle Book, changing enough to make the story fresh but keeping key plot points. This is pretty much a shot for shot remake. It was boring and the voice acting was uninspired. It may look nice and realistic but the zany elements of the cartoon and music are lost. The actor who played Scar in this remake did well in movies like 2012 but can't hold a candle to the original. Without the dastardly charisma of Jeremy Irons, the villain falls flat.

3. Scars character was explained a bit more
That's about it. The rest of the cast were awful. The makers of the film didn't make the film their own. To be honest, I didn't feel much emotion towards Simba, he did come across pretty useless. Also the ending was rushed. Overall, Disney have ruined a brilliant classic.",The Lion King
781,nickrichardson-16919,Popcorn Empire - The Lion King: Movie Review,5,21 July 2019,"""The Lion King... is cutting edge on a technical level, but it fails to recapture the energy, charm, or magic of the original."" 5/10The Lion King (2019) is a ""live-action"" remake of the 1994 animated film of the same name. The original film is considered a Disney classic. With it's beautifully rendered animation, top-notch voice performances, and stirring drama, the film easily holds up as a classic even today. This new remake, directed by Jon Favreau, attempts to retell the story with photo-realistic CGI visuals and a (mostly) new cast of voices. The result is cutting edge on a technical level, but it fails to recapture the energy, charm, or magic of the original.The Lion King (2019) takes a ""don't fix what ain't broken"" approach to its source material, and the resulting story is essentially the same. I won't be reiterating the plot here, as most people are familiar with the original film (and if not, you're probably familiar with 'Hamlet'). But just to be safe...WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!One of the main draws of this film, aside from nostalgia, is its CGI visuals. It's hard to deny that this film is beautifully animated. The animals have a life-like appearance, with true-to-life physics and movement, and fur so realistic you want to reach out and touch it.While this film pushes the limits of what digital animation is capable of, it also outlines its limits as a storytelling tool. As one would expect, the animal characters in this film are limited in their expressiveness. Facial movements efficiently match the voices, but are jarringly stiff and lacking emotion, making it difficult to connect with the characters.The voice performances are a mixed bag. James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa, and his performance is captivating. A few cast members do what they can with the material, such as Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles, but they ultimately feel miscast. Pumbaa and Timon add some levity and meta-humor, but the jokes are hit-or-miss, and the talky dialogue borders on annoying at times.The film is intermittently cute, funny, and exciting, but the pacing is clunky. Things rarely kick into high gear, aside from a couple fun action sequences. The drama is often times undercut by the film's stubborn adherence to realism. The life-like visual style may have its own appeal, but it can't match the expressiveness of the 1994 film's bright and stylish animation. Ironically, the original film feels more alive than this ""realistic"" remake.The plot of this film is as predictable as ever. It's also roughly 20 minutes longer, and noticeably so. This film drags during its second act, and I found myself wanting to hurry along to its inevitable final showdown between Simba and Scar. Even then, the result is underwhelming, and the film's perfunctory conclusion is more of a whimper than a bang.The Lion King (2019) succeeds much more as an expensive piece of machinery than as a film. It's a testament to the power of technology, but not so much to the power of storytelling. It's a safe, mildly entertaining film for all ages, but if you're looking to introduce newcomers to The Lion King, you're better off watching your old VHS or DVD copy of the 1994 version at home.5/10",The Lion King

787,illmor-814-204784,Good but Need to be evaluated from 2 points of view,7,19 July 2019,"One point of view come from those people that see the original one. The second from the ones that didn't. For both of them this is a stunning visual achievement. Absolutely it is. The images are so crisp and technically perfect. The music is really nice, the scenes are funny (Timon and Pumba steal the show), most of the content is really good. But here comes the difference: for the ones that saw the original this all technical achievements comes without a soul.What happens Is basically a triumph of the art ( hand animation) over the science (computer animation). The art succeed In transmitting to you the feelings of the character. You can identify yourself with them, think was is happening in their minds, see the evil or the good or the joy on the eyes of the character. Science on the other hand couldn't get there. The visual result is terrific but lacks of emotion. Is like if Disney made a live action of his beloved Cars, no matter how good is the CGI you will not be able to see a smile coming from the hood. Here is similar, the animals looks real but their faces cannot provide the same emotions you can see on the 2d animated counterpart. Don't get me wrong, the scenes are gorgeous, but feels like seeing a 2 hour Natgeo program or seeing a movie with the directors comments audio track enabled; feels odd to say the least. For the second group, the ones that didn't see the original movie, the power of the story can give them a very enjoyable visual experience, sound is terrific, action scenes are quite good, totally worth it. But again, once they see the original they will find how way far of the remarkable simplicity but emotional original this movie was , instead they receive a superb technical tour de force. This is a frame by frame copy and I truly believe that is one of its strongest point as the original is so good that nothing need to be changed. The point of view of the ones that didn't see the movie is clean and the lack of comparison will provide a less critical opinion. No matter that, In no way this movie deserves less than 6 stars, but no more than 7 either , mostly because of the lack of searching a way to put more feelings on screen/animation. In summary i recommend to see both versions as each one have they own merits to be proud of.",The Lion King

I dont mind remakes, but people are going in the hopes to see some artist interpretation, art. like change the ending a little add some after story, put your own art on a classic and add to it. dont just substract a few things so its different and then add some realism graphics, and think thats an acceptable movie.",The Lion King

The people who are disappointed in this film were over analysing and they must not have an open mind. The movie was very well made! The opening scene is captivating, good camera shots, majestic animals and it stirs the emotions!! They stayed true to what visuals you would actually see in Africa.. the music remained the same, even the instrumental pieces, there are a few new desongs thrown in for good measure, and Beyoncé was a great choice. The cinematography (for movie geeks) was probably the best part of all.. there is so much attention to detail in the scenes, which I loved.. the voices and the voice actors were nowhere near as bad as people are saying. I thought they were just the right fit for their characters. Mufasa death scene still makes you cry too. There really isn't much to critique besides the acting ability of the voice actors, meaning they aren't as solid as the original.

I just couldn't suspend belief that much.So why did disney feel the need to remake one of the best animated movies of all time? They couldn't recreate the magic. They almost did it shot for shot too.

I wasn't a fan of the Beauty and the Beast remake, The Jungle Book remake, or the Aladdin remake, so I was worried going into this movie because I was originally super stoked for this. My girlfriend told me to go in with an open mind, as if it was a brand new movie. I told her I would, and I did. To say I was beyond disappointed would be the understatement of the year.
As a movie on its own, the performances were hardly convincing. The two main lions (Simba and Nala) had no chemistry. The music was pretty forgettable, as I can't even remember how the bigger numbers sounded. The animals had very blank expressions on their faces most of the time so I could barely tell how they were really feeling. Also, I had a hard time telling the difference between most of the lions. They all looked identical, so I spent a good portion of this movie trying to figure out who was who. Basically, this felt long and painful to sit through.
As a remake of the original Lion King, wow! This was terrible! They had a pretty good cast lined up, but none of them really did a spectacular job in this movie. Some of them I thought could at least partially save this movie (I was personally excited to see Donald Glover, John Oliver, Keegan-Michael Key, Beyoncé and James Earl Jones in this) but they all really let me down. It felt like the soul and joy was taken out in place for impressive visual effects. The original Lion King was alive and animated, but this one felt dead and dumbed-down. It's like they tried to copy the original without realizing what made it special in the first place. They even took out a couple crucial scenes (I won't say which ones but if you grew up with the original Lion King like I did, you'll know).
Overall, I'm not going to watch another Disney live action remake after this one. I refuse to have any more of my money go towards these awful live-action remakes. Everything that was fun in the original Lion King was sucked right out, just like with the other three remakes I saw, which leads me to believe that the other remakes (those out and those soon to be out) will be just the same.",The Lion King
795,korrayabousquet,Disappointing,4,2 February 2020,"Let's start with who in their right mind let Seth Rogen's laugh into the movie. Just terrible. The cgi is just too realistic and distracting. There was no emotion conveyed from body language like they claimed to do in lieu of facial expressions. The voice work definitely could've been better, it really does come across as flat and bored. Songs weren't bad but they had all the ground work laid out they just had to get the singing right, which I think they did. I'm not a fan of Beyoncé and have never heard Donald Glover sing so I was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. Taking the humour away from the hyenas wasn't a good idea either.",The Lion King
796,talizen,Emotionally Beautiful,8,20 July 2019,"As a huge fan of the original, The Lion King is so emotionally beautiful, reliving my childhood life all over again in live action. I may be a man but I teared up a lot at the most beautiful moments just like the original such as the Circle of Life intro, the ending but the saddest of all, Mufasa's death that hurt me a lot. The casting was perfect, Billy Eichner did a good Timon but however not good enough apparently. Love hearing James Earl Jones returning as Mufasa but also I would've wished they brought back Jeremy Irons for Scar as well, just those two and thats it. Hans Zimmer coming back to compose the soundtracks brings tears of joy to my eyes and really completes me, my all time favourite movie composer. One other thing that puts me off is when Simba goes back to the Pride Lands while running in the desert, Beyonce's new song kind of ruined that moment which I didn't like. Overall, beautifully fantastic movie and brings back childhood memories.",The Lion King

798,moornay,Nice CGI tho..,7,4 January 2020,"Very nice, feel like I truly am in Africa watching the animal minding their own business. But that's it! I have some concerns regarding the movie: 1) The voice and facial expressions of Mufasa and young Simba just doesn't click (but idk it's just my opinion), eventhough I love James Earl Jones's beautiful voice; 2) The scene of Mufasa's dead, I cried when I see the cartoon version, but in this movie, naahh, it's too fast and lack of feeling; 3) Young Simba is just a spoiled brat, too selfish, need some character development; 4) The lioness are the same, same build, same facial expression, I can't tell them apart (if they don't speak or sing, I wouldn't know which one is Sarabi or Nala).The Lion King is one of my most favorite Disney's cartoons, but the remake is like a different entity from the original. I still enjoy it, but slightly dissapointed. 😅",The Lion King

1. The music just didn't feel the same, it could of been alot better
2. Wasn't 100% on timon's voice
3.i feel like some scenes, you didn't feel the emotion as much e.g simba screaming while his dads falling, and when his scared or upset,
4.so upset that 1 they didn't do timon and pumba's musical distraction and 2 that it sounded like they were about to sing be my guests. God knows why.
5. Ed wasn't crazy enough, and i wish banzai sounded more like the original ( cheech)But i did like the new scenes they put in like timone and pumbas other friends.

805,ventery,An Unemotional Portrayal of a Disney Classic,4,30 March 2020,"So I watched the live-action version of The Lion King last night and was left utterly disappointed. As a hardcore 90's kid, I grew up with the animation version which might make me a little biased but this version was truly remarkably underwhelming.To start, I would like to thank the CGI team for the stunning visual effects. I found myself captivated by the beauty of the Savannah and the stunning creatures that lived there. From the opening scene up to the very last one, I felt the effects were brilliant and very real-to-life. I imagine it took a lot of hard work to bring the story to life from animation to live-action and for that reason and that reason alone, I was very impressed by the visual aspects of the film.However, the voice acting was well under par. I felt many of the actors did not express emotion enough which made the whole story seem very uninviting and flat. I mean, even the great James Earl Jones who returned as the great Mufasa was very underwhelming.What was most striking about the animated version, apart from the emotion expressed by the animated characters was the fact that the voice acting was brilliantly executed and exciting. The musical stylings of James Iron who played Scar, Rowan Atkinson who played Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg who played Shenzi and even Jonathan Taylor Thomas who played young Simba drew me in from the very first moment and captivated my heart.In this version, the songs were appalling, apart from 'Hakuna Matata' which I really enjoyed, the rest were way under par. In 'Be Prepared', I could hardly hear what Chiwetel Ejiofor was singing and the iconic 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' was bland and missed the awesome Rowan Atkinson flair I was looking forward to.All in all, the cinematography was epic but the story lacked heart due to underwhelming voice acting and bland musical numbers.",The Lion King
806,Richarduck4077,Do Not Watch This Movie,1,28 July 2019,This movie a is a steaming pile of lion crap. It is so unoriginal and it looks so photorealistic but it doesn't add anything to the characters or the story please do not waste your money on this crap.,The Lion King
807,JorgeLMC,The Best Live-Action Disney So Far!,9,10 December 2019,"Better than some reviews have made me think ... unlike other live-action adaptations with Disney's classic label, ""The Lion King"" seems to me to really add something to the original animation experience. The cruder, more realistic look turbines positive aspects of the animation, such as the tragic and poetic content of his narrative, which closely resembles Shakespeare's works.
The so-called ""lack of expressiveness"" so badly evaluated by the public and critics, from another perspective, contributes decisively to what seems to be the primordial proposal of this production: to bring to the real world this fable so true in its ability to reflect about the meaning (or cycle) of life.",The Lion King
808,DrunkenSoju,A film that had me smiling from the start and cry from nostalgia.,9,17 July 2019,"Money grab or not. For my favorite Disney film to be redone with todays technology and creativity was absolutely amazing! I'm glad that the did not alter anything to the story. I love that they made the songs different to the original in a very slim way. All the events from the original had me crying from nostalgia. I literally had a smile from the first second of the film to the end of the film. So the 2019 film deserves my rating. I am not a huge fan for remakes or live action films, but the way they took the approach for the Lion King was well put! Its a shame with all the bad reviews because of people not accepting the idea of redones for the new generations. I loved it. It didn't ruin the Lion King for me. End of story.

I think the perfect remake incorporates what we know and love from the original movie, but also ensures you don't leave the cinema feeling as though you've not experienced anything new. This film gave me that satisfaction. On top of this, there have been a lot of comments saying 'the CGI is too realistic, and therefore you can't see the emotion on the animals face'. I mean come on! If they gave animals eyebrows and facial expressions, everyone would be complaining that it's not realistic enough! That aside, I think they nailed the casting, especially Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner who steal the show. This is a visual masterpiece, which is the biggest leap forward since Avatar.",The Lion King

816,MatnvannPlatn,Rich visuals overshadow plot and character development,7,6 August 2019,"It may be because we're in the TV Series era now, and used to slow character and plot build-up that typically goes with it. It might be because I had fond childhood memories of the original, which are now tainted by the harsh realisation that we tend to romanticise our memories.But The Lion King's remake wasn't all there for me.It most certainly wasn't because of the lush beauty of the CGI. Indeed, the visuals were stunning, life-like, and I'd pay handsomely to visit one of those paradise locations in real life. You'd also sort of half expect Sir David Attenborough to narrate the story. That might not even be such a bad idea after all, come to think of it.But the story felt rushed at times, and key moments were bereft of the required emotional impact, such as Simba's mourning and sense of guilt.It may be I was less impressed because, hey, it's a remake, and I already knew what was coming. But that could just be part of the truth. I think it was too realistic to still get away with animals bursting into song and dance.And then there's the voice acting of Beyoncé. Her singing, well, nobody does that better than Queen Bee, and I seriously enjoyed her rendition of the classics. But her spoken lines for Nala sounded chronically underwhelmed.Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Maybe we should just treat it as a new story. It's a children's film after all. And to any new, young, and impressionable viewer, it will undoubtedly be an overwhelming, visual display supporting a classic story that has proven its worth countless of times.",The Lion King

It does almost nothing new and the things it does (1 new dull song and 1 changed scene) were way better in 1994.
The only good things this movie does, are the visuals, which look beatiful and photorealistic (except for the characters), and it's soundtrack.
Do we really need these sort of remakes, where they change nothing over it's original source? It's our fault these kind of stupid movies exist. We vote what we want to see. Not on paper, but with our wallets!

Boy was I wrong.The core failure of the movie is the inexplicable choice to go fully photo-realistic with the animation. There is zero, and I can't stress this enough, ZERO expression or emotion in the characters' faces. Sure, it's zoologically accurate, but why does that matter when your plot is a conniving lion plotting a political coup with another species?The voice acting was.....barely passable. Nothing remarkable, especially given the A-list names on the cast. Timon and Pumba were the high flyers here, and even they were a pale shade of the excellent originals. Classic musical numbers were either underwhelming or over-performed (looking at you, Beyoncé).All of this is made even more obvious by the fact that the movie is nearly a shot-for-shot, line-for-line copy of the original. Timon and Pumba had some clever self-aware lines that poked fun at that fact, but given how closely they mimicked the original, it's remarkable that the final product managed to come out so flat in comparison.I don't know what this means for Disney's other forthcoming live action re-releases. Aladdin wasn't up to snuff either, but had the energy and character to make up some lost ground. I've not yet seen the Dumbo remake, and want to look forward to Mulan, but if this is where they're setting the bar, I'll wait until they come to Netflix.",The Lion King

So, I kept my expectations a wee bit on the low side coming in to the theater earlier today. Visually, this ""remake"" is stunning with the atmosphere and environment looking absolutely amazing. Other than that, the new ""Lion King"" was just okay and I'd say it was merely ""acceptable"", nothing great but not bad either. First of all, the voice acting was quite disappointing throughout, with the exception of the amazing James Earl Jones who captured the same magic and power of Mufasa, just as he did in the original, animated movie. Also, one serious flaw lay with the CG animation, itself. Unfortunately those vibrant and cute faces from the animation were simply not there, and I felt somewhat empty while the characters were singing lively tunes such as ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"". In short, the remake of ""Lion King"" falls short of matching the original animated movie's magic, and could have been so much better, but it's still a visually impressive film worth watching at least once, if only to complain about later :)",The Lion King

No one can sing or act but that's because they aren't trying. They know people will like this movie even if it is garbage. I don't even know what happened with the editing it was like a 4th grader did it. Everyone Has No Character. Scar Is Just a Lion Now. They Didnt Try Writing Characters Because People Are Already Invested in The Story Before It Even Begins.

848,shahidafzal86,Deserves a watch,7,1 August 2019,"To state the obvious this isn't the original and as classic its difficult to meet that expectation that many viewers will have for childhood classic.
The CGI is amazing. If you like your wildlife programmes you will probably enjoy it.
The voice actors didn't bother me as much as others. I think Glover does a good job with adult simba and liked Rogen as Pumbaa.I think where the movie fails or rather struggles is to keep the audience emotionally attached like the original but when you're using real life looking animals it is going to be difficult.If you go to this movie forgetting about the original and not expecting that same magic then its pretty good. Its definitely watchable and does not deserve below 5 rating.",The Lion King

850,fatima_salamah,A lion's share of criticism,6,1 August 2019,I wanted to love this movie because i loved the original so much. It was my favorite Disney movie as a kid (and still to this day to be honest) but it was just so bland. Maybe my expectations were too high but it was just lacking something and I'm still not quite sure what it is. Some scenes felt forced or robotic. While some songs were great others (Scar's) were a flop and though the CGI effects were good they could have been better. I thought they were going to make Mufasa more grandiose...and i won't even comment on Beyonce as Nala because I'm still upset about that. Thank God for the classics and the 90s! Bring originality back Disney!,The Lion King

854,alana-larru,Visually beautiful but that's all.,3,3 August 2019,The animation and scenery was very beautiful! Still a little work needed there when it comes to expression. Even real lions have more expression I think then these. You don't have to over so it to make it look cheesy.. just a little more would have made a difference.The main reason I give this a low eating is due to the vocal acting. It fell totally flat. No emotion at all. They were monotone and there were no natural pauses when there should have been. The original still blows this one out of the water. The magic was not there like the original.,The Lion King
855,maxim-delaet,Lacks emotion.,6,21 July 2019,"One of the few issues in the original was that not enough time was spent on the emotional death scene and the mourning.

859,MovieMattic,Almost Perfect Live CG Adaptation,9,31 July 2019,I was 10 years old when the original came out and remember going to the theater to watch it with my family. At that time it was very exciting to see the characters making jokes and showing their emotions but the cartoon version was very cartoony.Now being an adult I see why Disney is re-releasing The Lion King as a live-action CG film. In my opinion they hit the CG spot on and made almost all the animals look very realistic. This aspect of the film was probably the best aspect. The emotional side and connection with the characters was a bit less then the original cartoon yet had an added depth because of the realisticness. They really did do a good job with making those hyenas look very nasty!So if you're a fan of The Lion King and you watched it when you were a little kid or even as an adult I feel like you will enjoy this live-action CG version of The Lion King. It is essentially the same movie.,The Lion King
860,nimishgour,This is review of the Hindi version of the film - It is not as funny and entertaining as expected.,6,24 July 2019,"I went to watch this as a fan of the earlier Lion King, Haku-na-matata and Jon Favreau. I have watched the Jungle book in English as well as Hindi. The Hindi version was funnier than the English version because the humor was more Indian and rooted.So I decided to watch this Lion King's Hindi version. But I was quite disappointed. This time the Hindi dub could not capture the essence of the English version. Due the film was felt too long and dragging.The best character in the Hindi dub came out as Scar and then Mufasa. The critics are praising Shryas Talpade and Sanjya Mishra as Timon and Pumba. But I disagree with them. The Hindi translation is quite bad and it is due to the acting of these two great actors that is making Timon and Pumba appealing.
The biggest mistake in the translation is giving fixed regional accent to the characters. While the bad Hyenas are speaking Bihari accent Hindi, the good friends Pumba and Timon are speaking Mumbai accent Hindi. This is very foolish adaptation. I also feel that Mumbai accent Hindi has been so overused in Hindi cinema that it has lost it's charm. I wish the Hindi writers have used some other accent, perhaps Tamil for one and Gujrati for other. It would have been funnier.Due to bad writing the supporting characters despite some great actors like Shahnaz Patel, Shiv Subramaniam and Achint Kaur playing them, couldn't make a mark. The poorest here are Aryan Khan and Neha Gargava. Their voices could not portray the leadership and heroism of Simba and Nala. I am still wondering the reason for selection of Aryan Khan for Simba.Same is the problem with the Hindi songs. The original composition of all the songs is so western and produced as per the norm of composition of the west, that when they are translated in Hindi they felt quite weird. Perhaps that is the reason why greatest of Disney movie songs could not become popular in India.On technical front, the film doesn't leave any stone un-turned. It delivers what is expected from it.Overall, the Hindi version of this movie is totally avoidable.",The Lion King

After watching it though I really enjoyed the adaptation they did of the original. I went in with an open mind knowing it's not the original and hoping just for a good movie and wasn't disappointed. They did a good job with the CGI and it was funny and they cut a lot of the singing from the original and made it, in my opinion, more realistic.

863,terminalsofa,Lazy re-make.,2,21 July 2019,"Here was an opportunity to re-think, re-invent, re-boot - whatever you want to call it. Instead we get a lazy, virtually scene-by scene re-make, but with LOOOOOADS of money thrown at the CGI. Some of that money would have been better spent on a script that didn't sound like breeze blocks knocking against each other. It was that clunky. When Beyonce (waste of money) says ""Lions attack"" I laughed out loud.
Back to Beyonce (and she wasn't alone)- in terms of voice characterisation, the characterisation part of it seems to have gone missing. These guys should have listened to any Pixar film to find out what's involved in bringing a character to life.
Where was Scar's villainy? Where was the hyenas' menace?
In the original cartoon Poombah and Timon were what made me squirm most but here we could have done with a bit more of them. They provided the only parts of the script that came alive and I suspect that a lot of that probably relied on ad-libbing.
I don't mind a bad film if somebody's trying, but this was just weak, poor and above all lazy.",The Lion King

So much effort was put into making the animals realistic and matching the plot of the story that there was no emotion, personality or umph in the animal's facial expressions or voice work. This stripped the humour and elements that made the original movie amazing.
The songs lacked interest and excitement. They were all a snooze fest! And the new songs, particular that one by Beyoncé are just awful! Awful!

866,EthanTheWolf,Still as impressive as the original,7,30 July 2019,"As soon as I heard that there would be a live action version of The Lion King I was extremely hyped. After the movie's release I saw a lot of bad reviews, which made me worried to be honest. Luckily, those reviews couldn't be further from the truth.The Lion King 2019 delivers a breathtaking visual spectacle with a lot of respect for the 1994 original. There were a few changes, some for the worse, some for the better.
Contrary to what many people were saying, the animals aren't lifeless at all. You could see all of their emotions in their eyes and bodily movements, of course sometimes more than at other times.Despite having seen the original 20+ times at least, I found myself completely caught up in the story once more. The music too was again stunning (thanks Hans Zimmer!). I already found myself crying two seconds into the movie. That's how beautiful it was.The only thing I really disliked, was Beyoncé. Her voice acting is flat and dull, robotic even. She oversings everything (imo she ruined 'Can you feel the love tonight'). And her singing 'Spirit' was especially annoying, it felt completely out of place. But I'm not a fan of her in general, so I might be biased. Her influence is only minor.Go see it, it's absolutely worth it.",The Lion King

Unfortunately, all the reviews on here about the movie having no emotion, are 100% correct. It was very strange. This was the first remake that I left the theater without being just amazed and excited with what I had just watched (unlike Aladdin, which is OMG amazing). I always cry when Mufasa dies...but not when I watched this. It just felt empty. And I also agree that it seems like they used the movie to push Beyoncé, she's talented, but she's no Elton John. The CGI was incredible. And I'm so thankful James Earl Jones voiced Mufasa, it wouldn't be the same if someone else had done it. The two guys who voiced Simba (young and adult) did a great job. Seth Rogan was great as Pumba! I liked Timon too. Overall, I'm sad that I paid to see this at the theater. Just wait til you can rent it if you haven't seen it.

Questioning myself whether it as good or the same as the classics. However, for my childhood I put my faith in Disney and Boy was I right. This Live Action remake truly follow like its originals to its core. The only difference is its Visuals of the animals which is quite close to Realism... And what we see from the zoo or animal shows in TV. As soon as the movie starts its the exact same scene and songs played on the originals. Thus, it will directly hit you in deep nostalgia!! Don't listen to the critics this movie is exactly what you hoped and loved from the originals only there are new scenes and extra songs for an refreshing remake with a twist. Timon and pumba is the real star for this as well. And yes I love the movie! Not the best as the originals but a new and fresh take close the best in a Lion King Classics! 10/10",The Lion King

873,TheBLTSandwich,I just watched the same movie from 1994...,4,31 July 2019,"...but it was worse this time. They basically just remade ""The Lion King"" exactly how it was before, but took out the heart and charm of it. Most of the dialogue is the same, but the new lines that the ""screenwriter"" decided to actually write (because, you know, that's kind of what a screenwriter does) aren't funny and don't flow like the original script does. For example, they take out Zazu's line about turning Scar into a throw rug and replace it with some unfunny remark about his cousin thinking that he's a woodpecker.The animals also don't really show any kind of emotion, especially the lions. Cats can be very expressive (anyone who's ever owned a sassy cat I'm sure can agree with this statement). But here, the lions sort of look the same in every shot, even when something really intense or scary is happening. You can NOT mimic the same techniques of 2D animation in 3D, especially when you're going for hyper-realistic like the animators were here.Another bad thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was ""Be Prepared."" Wow, was it bad! The iconic song wasn't even a song: just a speech that Scar gave to the hyenas. While Scar acted his speech very well (emphasizing his words and giving them passion), the fact that they ripped one of the best songs of the soundtrack out of the remake was disappointing, to say the least. Also, it was so stupid how they turned ""Be Prepared"" into this weird song/monologue hybrid. Some odd music track was playing in the background as Scar spoke, and at the end, he randomly sings one, ""be pre-paaaaared!"" Terrible, terrible, terrible job, music department.The film wasn't all bad, though. Beyonce and Donald Glover fit their roles well. Chiwetel Ejiofor brought new life into Scar. The child actors for Simba and Nala sang very well (makes sense considering the girl who voiced Nala also played her on Broadway). The FEW new things they added at least mixed up the movie a bit. The longer version of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" was nice. The ""Be Our Guest"" reference made me chuckle. And lastly, the animation was lovely. As much as I didn't think this story worked well in ""live-action"" (quote-on-quote), the backgrounds and animals are stunning to look at. It's amazing how far our technology has come.Overall, see it once to quench your curiosity, but don't go in expecting this film to be one you'll buy on DVD.",The Lion King

I appreciate you taking a stab at being more politially correct with the behavior and traits of the different animals, but the old lion king did that and focused on telling a story, an incredible story, it just looked like you weren't trying, the comedy was gone, it is understandable, but jungle book managed to excel without much comedy, you stole the magic out of so many moments, like when Nala met Simba again, or when Simba chased after her, there was a lot, i could actually feel myself getting angry and i know this kind of production is not easy but this was bad, it was Jon Favreau for crying out loud, and i loved Jungle Book, i was hoping this would have a similar pattern, but it was like marking the script of a student who didn't study for a test and banked on plagiarism, i am sorry but this broke my heart.",The Lion King

Losing her father, losing her asylum and living in a foreign land, Simba's growth is full of difficulties.

879,kalavic,The most unnecessary cash-grabby Disney live-action remake,2,11 June 2021,"The remake takes all the fanciful wonder of the original and replaces it with the stale crunch of a BBC documentary. Sure, the CG looks impressively realistic. But the original is often considered a pinnacle, a benchmark modern CG is still trying to achieve. There are ways animation can often tell a story more effectively than live-action, and CG is usually somewhere between live action and hand-drawn. The remake aims for the realistic end of the spectrum, only it's less charming than real animals. If you compare it to live-action films with real animals, like Babe, Lion King 2019 seems lifeless. There's neither the expressiveness you get with animation nor the spontaneity and fidgetiness you get with real animals - it looks accurate, but accurate for a soulless beast under a spell: predictable, mundane, overly smooth. It's like the animators' greatest fear was of accidentally surprising the audience. Heaven forbid any frame less than 99.9% predictable!Expressive animal faces? Not realistic. Dancing? I mean, Pixar doesn't so probably nobody will miss it. Humor? Let's get rid of that. Voice acting? So long as we have some voice actors adults know are funny in real life, people won't notice they're not funny in the film.I literally can't think of a single scene from the remake that was stronger than the original. The closest was the addition of Beyoncé's song, Spirit, which was nice, but overall the scene didn't move the story forward more powerfully than the original.",The Lion King

884,forchennfederation,When Black Panther is a Better Remake of The Lion King,3,7 November 2019,"The Lion King from 1994 is a great piece of animated cinema and it will always have a place in my heart as being THE Disney movie of my childhood. So, yeah, I love that movie. So, one can only imagine my skepticism and worries when I heard that Disney would remake it in a more photo-realistic style and would come out in a July 2019 release. However, I still wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt since I felt Jon Favreau did a great job with The Jungle Book 2016 and hoped that maybe he would at least do The Lion King justice as well. But, alas, The Lion King 2019 didn't do its 1994 counterpart justice, I feel. So now, let's get into why.There are things that I admire and find to be good in this remake. First of all, the visuals are remarkable; yeah, everybody's pretty much said it already, but I do agree that the film looks incredible. The animals naturally fit in with the environments for the most part and there's an insane amount of attention to detail to make the animals look and interact with various things as realistically as possible, although it is to a fault but we'll get to it shortly. Also, Timon and Pumbaa did get some chuckles out of me every now and then and that Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen did a good job at portraying those characters. Even some of the songs were done well enough here (not as good as in original but still not badly-done), like the opening rendition of 'The Circle of Life', 'Hakuna Matata', and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?', although the scene where the 3rd aforementioned song plays takes place during what looks to be afternoon so that one's a lil' jarring.Now, despite the things that are good, The Lion King 2019 still has more wrong than right. First of all, while Eichner & Rogen do a good job with their roles, I can't say the same for the actors/actresses who plays the lion characters. Donald Glover as Simba wasn't awful, but I feel he was wasted as his performance was still kinda flat. Beyonce, who plays Nala, was even more flat; while she's a great singer, her acting in this was very dry and it felt like she was reading through the script with not much interest in the material. Even James Earl Jones, who reprises his role from the original as Simba's father Mufasa, feels flat in his delivery; now, it has nothing to do with his age at this point, but it feels like he should've been able to put more emotion and authority into his character especially since he played Mufasa before. And, then there's Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Simba's uncle, who is the worst of all; his delivery was the flattest of all the actors in the film and he emulated no menace in his role whatsoever. Jeremy Irons was so perfect as Scar that, if the makers of this film were just gonna do a near-exact redux of The Lion King right down to the dialogue, why couldn't they bring Irons back when they got James Earl Jones back? For example, Ejiofor's delivery for when Scar loses his lunch (a mouse) when Zazu steps in simply does not mesh with the dialogue in that moment, which was taken right out of the original, and it's as jarring as can be when that dialogue was meant to be delivered through the sliminess that Irons pulled off wonderfully in the past.
The issues regarding the acting also stems from how it was directed in order to match with the realistic looks, which it's invalidated when one were to take into account that The Jungle Book also had photo-realistic animals yet the cast members who played said animals still brought some charisma and emotion to their roles. So, there's no excuse for why the cast for The Lion King 2019 needed to give as flat of performances as they did.
The realistic look certainly makes certain scenes that are meant to hit emotional crescendos appear awkward and even unintentionally silly; Mufasa's death at the hands of Scar, for instance, simply doesn't work as well as the original film was able to bring some emotion just from the visuals of the characters' facial expressions, so making that scene look more realistic just takes so much of that visually-driven emotion away.
By making the film look more realistic with more suppressed emotion from the cast, it takes so much away from the story and its heart. If the movie was more like the scene where Timon and Pumbaa do a number for 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' and other animals join in a sort of a capella where the movie for once decidedly to be lively in its animation in a similar vein as the original, then the movie overall would've been better for it. But as it is, The Lion King 2019 fails to translate the story of its 1994 predecessor well.The Lion King remake is longer than the 1994 original by about 30 minutes, and most of it is due to extended shots or extra visuals that seem to pad the movie out. For example, we see how Simba's piece of hair gets to Rafiki; it takes WAY too long just to get to that simple point. But, the real kicker is that, while the film is longer due to extra moments to pad the run-time, the film, for some reason, not only rushes through Simba and Nala seeing each other again and in surprise, but also, and even worse, leaves out the part where Rafiki teaches Simba that he can learn from the past which is the moment where Simba decides to go back to the Pride Lands and take back his place as king from Scar. Here, when Simba decides to return home, it feels like he missed a significant character beat like he went from A to C while skipping B; why leave out such a crucial part of Simba's development as a character, especially when the movie up to this point went out of its way to follow the 1994 film's plot beat for beat?While some of the musical numbers weren't badly-done, they still don't have the same amount of energy and charm here as they did in the original. The one case where a musical number was done in such embarrassing fashion was Scar's musical number, 'Be Prepared', which happens to be my favorite song from The Lion King, aside from 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?', by the way. Not only is Chiwetel Ejiofor's delivery in it just flat and terrible, but the song feels like it was tacked on in the last minute and only half-finished, like it wasn't gonna be in the movie initially only to be put in just to keep audiences happy; honestly, they should've either fully-committed to it or just not even have it in the movie at all if they were just gonna be lazy about it. Also, Beyonce's single for the film, 'Spirit', comes up in a jarring place which is where Simba and Nala head back to the Pride Lands; they should've just kept the music Hans Zimmer did for that same scene in the original. Speaking of Zimmer, who is probably my favorite composer of all time, while his music here is good, it's still a carbon copy of his work in the 1994 original film and isn't incorporated throughout the remake as well as in the original.So, overall, while The Lion King 2019 does get some things right from the original, it still got more wrong than right and even the things it got right wasn't done as well as in the 1994 original. I'll let the word be known: Black Panther from the MCU was a better remake of The Lion King; at least I could tell people cared about their material and actually tried in that film. The Lion King 2019 just feels like the most bloated and most expensive tech demo ever made, and I can't believe not enough people didn't see enough of just how obvious of a cash-grab this movie is to keep this movie from becoming one of the highest-grossing films ever. It's sad that Disney got rewarded so handsomely for essentially just redoing The Lion King down to a T and now they're just given all the justification in the world to do the same for other films down the road. But, what do I know, I guess?",The Lion King

No. I love animals in africa, and lions are my favourite.The Lion King was an amazing movie, with a breathtaking cinematography, best visuals ever in a Disney movie, and you could see they had worked in every single detail in how the animals looked and acted to make it as realistic as possible, and without taking the charm and heart out of it. It's simple, if you really want them to show emotions in a more human way, just watch the cartoon. Let us others enjoy the new take.",The Lion King

The iconic scenes felt rushed, there was no emotion on any of the characters, and they prolonged pointless scenes. Felt like they went down a checklist of what they needed to achieve, which scenes needed a ""twist"" and slapped it together. I felt nothing during Mufasa's death, Scar did not have a dramatic and theatrical sequence when mildly, halfheartedly sung 'Be Prepared', and Young Simba sounded like an annoying whiney kid. While it wasn't bad, it was not good by any stretch of the imagination. It felt like a poor ""live action"" recap of the original.

I didn't watch this movie in English so I can't agree with the bad acting but I'll give it a shot. The only reason why I give this a 5 is because while I was watching the movie I was just thinking, it looks great but nobody needs this! I know how it begins, what happens next and how it ends and we've been surrounded by remakes and sequels and I'm just done with it. Disney makes visually stunning things most of the time and they did the same with this movie as well. But come on...

Some of the voice over falls flat compared to the original, Seth Rogan being a notable exception. I thought the Alladin movie was a success... because of the way it expanded on the original.

909,katkarashay,Original remains superior.,6,4 June 2020,"To be honest after watching Aladdin (2019) I didn't had much expectation from this one as I figured, first of all Disney had guts to remake such a great classic and then spoiling it real bad, they won't hesitate to do it another time.For Disney this films are just profit and loss statements. They don't worry about public emotions, the Whistles, the tears and the cheering anymore, they just want there profit.The Lion King is another such example. It didn't had any emotional depth or intensity, it was quite hollow. I didn't fell anything when Mufasa died, I didn't fell anything when Simba returned from exile and moreover the animals didn't had any facial expression on their faces, we could only figure out their emotions through their tone. Hand written images were far better in this aspect.But they definately used their $ 260 million budget effectively, the VFX and CGI were damn good, much better than Aladdin (2019). The film was not at all bad, its quite enjoyable with great musical score you would definately feel nostalgic, but is this point valid enough to consider a film good , no, the film even have to score well in technological aspect, cinematography was quite average and the film was rushed at some parts, especially after half time.Just imagine if this would have been the original Lion king, it would have never even crossed a billion-dollar mark.But If you have planned to watch it and my review is holding you from that, then don't hesitate, its surely worth a watch.",The Lion King
910,Hiair,"Somebody took away the Lion's heart, along with its b@lls.",1,17 November 2019,"Sterile, soulless, rushed and pointless. Having had real animals perhaps they could have obtained some sort of emotion out of some.
You could say that it could work like a 3d filter for the original hand drew film if you prefer technique over artistry, but the original script and some imagery gets watered down.
The whole movie seems like the recording of a cold reading of the original script with some downgrades here and there to make it more baby ""safe"" while the Hans Zimmer's 1994 soundtrack is being played on the background.
No elephant graveyard; no nazi references, lines like ""Murderer, you don't deserve to live"" cannot be found in here. ""Scar, brother, help me"" is reduced to ""Scar help me"" to avoid children to think about the fact that the villain is killing his own brother.
It is curious that there is a lack of close ups that could have helped the character emote anything. The color palette is mute as any other movie out there which is odd because this one wanted to appeal to a younger audience than the original's.
If you leave wondering how they extended an 88 minutes long script to 118 minutes while having all the characters lines rushed, the answer if simple, they added a lot of walking.
Time is not an excuse, so how can a shorter animated and older version be more mature and express a lot more than a modern adaptation? It was made by very different people.
keep your home video copies of the original film safe before this new Disney decides to retouch it to make it ""saferer and betterer"".",The Lion King

Ok now maybe people will disagree with me because it's ""realistic"" animation or whatever, but could you give them a bit of facial expressions and body language? I felt like I'm watching a muppet show with better graphics.. or like talking stuffed animals.
I like the idea that they didn't change anything in the movie, like the story like, dialogues, and scenes were almost the same BUT MAAAAAAAAN!!!! I really don't know what to say!! It's just so boring and a disgrace to the original.

Of course, I saw the movie expecting it to be a money grab, but decided to give it a chance anyway, at the very least, it'll be entertaining, right?Haha, the movie was trash. The actors spoke in a monotone manner. They read the script like middle school drama students whose parents forced them to sign up for the class. The actors had no emotions in their voices, the delivery was also poor, certain lines you just... have to give a pause... wait a little bit so it hits right... nope, every line was read with the same generic pace. Iconic songs were ruined, and while I understand that it is okay to change some lines and take artistic liberties so that the movie isn't an exact carbon copy of its cartoon counterpart, there are some lines that should have been left as is, when you change some things it only makes it worse.Feel free to see the movie, but do not expect much, I warn you.",The Lion King

This movie is a joke. A very sad joke.If you enjoyed the original Lion King, please do not watch this. You will be hurt and disappointed. The director of this movie took a childhood classic and defecated on it... Glover and Beyonce must have been casted as a joke, their voices throw off the whole ambiance of the movie and turn it into something that it was not meant to be.

I was bored after first 5 min.

921,skrobdell-248-101634,Roar!!!,7,25 July 2019,"The visual effect of this film was as stunning as you can get. (Surely!) I have not seen any previous version. It was really well paced and never flagged as the storyline weaved it's way to the dramatic finale. The music complimented the stories path and the Composer of the films themes should be congratulated on his imagination and production. (Hans Zimmer has an illustrious track record already)
I can only criticise it for the attempts at humour, as the ambition to create a dangerous scenario for the young King were managed perfectly. The Film might have reached the heights for me if it had not sometimes reached the lowest common denominator in it's attempts to make everyone laugh. The puns and banter reached low levels until the plot was resumed and the dramatic tension continued.
You could watch this film merely for the stunning scenery of Africa's foliage and the scenes where the Lions really did roar. The threat of the hyena's was really well managed too. If you can put up with some Disneyesque philosophies for the reason for our exsistence and just enjoy the visual danger, you will be well entertained.",The Lion King

there are some people saying that this film should be judge on it's own and not compare it to the animated feature and while i half argee with judging it on it's on i do however feel like comparing them is more then fair this film is a shot for shot remake and that's it i honestly feel stupid for seeing this movie if your only seeing it to laugh at how bad it is don't bother because you will be so bored and frustrated you might end up walking out just watch the 1994 animated lion king.",The Lion King

925,jviaes,Shot for shot remake,4,26 October 2019,"One thing I do not like about Disney remakes is that most tend to be pretty much shot for shot remakes with live action characters. Though I have other problems with this film, my first issue was the script. They didn't even bother writing new lines. Some of Timon and Pumba's lines were more original, but for the most part most of the movie seemed to follow the old script.Second, though Seth Roger was a good choice for Pumba, Billy Eisner was a horrible choice for Timon. I don't know if they were trying to cast another gay guy to play Timon as Nathan Lane did, but the difference was that Nathan Lane did not make Timon sound gay. They could've have done a better job cast Timon. This may sound homophobic and I don't mean it to be, but Disney really needs to stop forcing gay inclusivity into their newer films. It's a kid's film for goodness sake.Third, it felt like they spent more time on the animation than anything else. They didn't do a lot to change the music, story, or characters. Aladdin was a great remake because it had so many different elements to it and it did not try to push any woke agendas.I really feel like you could just watch the original cartoon and wouldn't have missed anything the new film has to offer.

It probably doesn't hold up to the original for most people but just keep in mind that even if this is a cash grab, it still brought amazing visuals to a great hit.

A new perspective? Maybe read Hamlet before, to understand the story?You basically made a fan-made Lion King with 3d animations, burned mountains of money and added nothing to the original.

And why is ""can you feel the love tonight"" during the day? And why 1:1 copy the story of the original? A different twist and turn would have been welcome, as done in Cinderella.

945,jameshatfield-77323,"Great movie, funny, sad, happy, very similar to the original, which is a good thing.",8,3 August 2019,"The problem is we keep automatically comparing it to the original. In its own respect, it is a great movie. However, I did NOT like Beyonce. She cannot do voice over, she lingered on the end of every note in can you feel the love tonight, and the new song she made for the journey back to the pride lands just doesn't fit with the theme of the movie. I loved the beauty and the beast reference and how Timone and Pumba joke about how much Simba had grown during the Hukuna Matata song. Also it had more adult jokes compared to the original, ""the giraffes were caught necking"" and how Timone doesn't sensor the ""farted"" line in Hukuna Matata where I'm the original he says ""not in front of the kids"" in this one he just let's Pumba say ""every time I farted"". I enjoyed the way they adapted I just can't wait to be king to fit the more realistic version of the movie. The Circle Of Life was awesome, it was identical to the original except for the amazing animation (you may notice I have not yet mentioned live action) and it looked so real. As for the animals, people are saying there was less emotion because they had fewer human qualities, but it was a different type of emotion, it was the sadness you get when a lion gets surrounded by hyenas I'm a nature documentary, the happiness you get when the meerkat doesn't get eaten by then hyena. They weren't human, they were animals, and I can have emotion for animals as well as humans. Although in some places when the 'camera' was overhead it did sound a bit like a James earl Jones voice over. Because you can't see their mouths moving as much from a distance but the singing, especially in the younger lions, and Zazu, felt right and natural. We know animals sing in their own languages, we know they dance to impress a mate, why is it so far fetched for some people to believe lion cubs would joke around, sing, play fight, a bit of dancing, and some peer pressure.
There were some technical inaccuracies that were not fixed from the original, the leafcutter ants, native to South America, and yet they had been given a bigger part than in the original, they are the first in the circle of life sequence and deliver a tutu of Simba's hair to Rafiki. There are others but I am aware this is already quite a long review.Overall, a very good movie, very entertaining, very fun. I sat there mouthing all the words to all the songs, being realistic doesn't take away from the magic of The Lion King.",The Lion King

Aladdin. Jungle Book. The Little Mermaid. Dumbo. Cinderella. Mulan. One might be forgiven for starting to get weary of Disney's veritable rapid-fire of live-action remakes flooding cinemas near you. Most have been decent, some great, but we were all on the edge of our seats when the first trailer released and once-in-a-lifetime cast announced (in addition to possibly the biggest resources the studio has ever pledged to one project) for the remake of one of the most iconic animated films ever: The Lion King. Visually breathtaking in groundbreaking mocap/animative stylism with a stirring Zimmer score, strong voicework by its superstar cast ensemble, and preservation of the original's Victorian and life-cyclical thematics, 2019's The Lion King is the spectacular vision of the story we deserve.The visuals. I cannot even put into words how visually breathtaking The Lion King is. Innovatively combining mocap wizardry with the animation resources of the world's biggest animation studio, the beloved creatures of Simba's famous story are magnificently brought to life in realism-centric but equally-escapist fashion. The cinematography is absolutely JAW-DROPPING with some of the most spectacular shots of primal Africa ever put to film with varied topography and locational settings ranging from lush ultra-green rainforests to skyscraper-tall waterfalls to warm melting orange-hued sunsets to foggy ominous elephant graveyards in the badlands to night skies so starry and crisp you can't believe your eyes - the film truly paints the majesty of Africa and nature/biological life in a way it's impossible not to be wowed with and you can easily tell it's one of the most expensive films ever made simply from its photoimagery alone easily worth the price of admission.The score and voicework. Paralleling its visual magnificence is a sublime score by mastermind composer Hans Zimmer of Man of Steel/The Dark Knight/Wonder Woman/Inception/Blade Runner 2049 fame. From xylophone scales to dark ominous chanting to stirring orchestral themes and booming Greek tragedy/operatic overtures playing up and highlighting the story's Victorian bases, the score is absolutely unbelievable and together with the visuals make for a sensory-overloading experience of a package that will near move you to tears artistically. The film's ultra star-powered, once-in-a-lifetime cast complete with everyone from Donald Glover to Beyoncé Knowles-Carter to James Earl Jones to Seth Rogan (MVP comedically) to JD McCrary (biggest surprise but a spot-on innocent young Simba) is *perfect* and each play their part well in effectively retelling the iconic story on the big screen.Preservation of the original's best arcs and Victorian/life-cyclical themes with a few fleshed out additions too. What's best about this version of The Lion King is that they stay authentic to the original's spirit - despite what foolish trolls and ""critics"" might say. I cannot imagine what could possible be going through their minds when downgrading a film for simply following the story of the original film OF WHICH IT SHARES THE EXACT SAME NAME. What did they expect them to do: rewrite a legendary film completely; maybe give it a shock ending where Scar comes back a zombie?; maybe have Nara become leader? Maybe have them all give a final dance sequence to end it (seems to be what most of these people think is ""cinematic excellence"" being an exact imbecilic plot point from Guardians of the Galaxy *sips tea*)? It is simply imbecilic to expect Disney to change up an already near-perfect story passed down for generations and across cultures just for kicks (and a horrible fake criticism; Disney has definite flaws as a studio, but not here) when it was never marketed as anything different than being The Lion King. In does, in fact, make a few small (smart) changes like fleshing out Simba and Mufasa's father-son sentimental familial bond, more relevance for Nara, and a funnier Pumba by the inimitable Seth Rogan - while still feeling wholly like the classic TLK through and through both in heart and ambiance.REAL flaws in 2019's The Lion King are a bizarre misdirection of the film's most powerful scene, and some admittedly-juvenile Disney-isms added to clearly target child audiences at the expense of its artistic premise. Mufasa's fall - the most POWERFUL and emotionally-resonant point in the film and Disney's entire filmography - is weirdly.. light in tone in this version, with an inexplicably light Major-keyed buoyant (almost sadistically-happy) score in what should have been an absolutely *devastating* tearjerker orchestral accompaniment. The original's version made me cry every time I watched it as a kid as an inarguably pitch-black-dark fall of a parent, but in this one - I felt nothing and that lost a bit of the steam and power of the film/experience in surprising ""what?"" fashion. Also, the comedy gets a bit silly/stupid in parts like Pumba's - constant - farting (because funny noises are funny) I cringed at in classical pandering to immature audience members when the rest of the film feels more like an elegant adult retelling of the tale....Overall, 2019's The Lion King is a majestic retelling of the iconic original with the type of visual splendor and sensory power only mountains of money can buy. Visually breathtaking in groundbreaking mocap/animative stylism with a stirring Zimmer score, strong voicework by its superstar cast, and preservation of the original's Victorian and life-cyclical thematics, Disney's The Lion King (2019) is easily worth the price of admission as the definitive version of the generational tale we all deserved.Overall Score: 8/10",The Lion King

The lack of any sort of emotion from ANY character makes it hard to feel the things we felt in the animated film. The best characters were Timon and Pumbaa. And the flying tuft of lion hair. Animated Scar was a great character. He was slimy and dramatic and obviously a slithering pathetic excuse of a lion. Live action Scar just seems bored with it all. Even the dopey animated hyena made you feel a sorta way. 10 stars for visuals. I'll give it a 4-5 for the acting and voices.",The Lion King
957,MirkoS,This movie shouldn't have been greenlit in the first place,4,20 July 2019,"I wouldn't necessarily classify this film as ""bad"" as much as I would misguided. I honestly didn't dislike it as much as I thought it would, though admittedly I went in with very low expectations after having read many reviews.Its main problem stems from an incongruence that the striving for realism presents against a necessity to convey anthropomorphic emotions that would grant weight and impact to the underlying emotional underpinnings the film requires to be effective, and that animation allowed but that CGI does not, or at best, heavily restricts.There's simply very little emotional gravitas because the movie is beholden to its realistic approach of live action CGI animals. To be fair, I think Disney walked the line as best they could here, it's just that the combination of these two aspects simply aren't compatible when attempting to portray wildlife in such a realistic manner. In most scenes it's not too noticeable, but in the most crucial it is glaringly conflicting in its explicitness. Mufasa's death fell completely flat because when trying to wake his dead father up, Simba simply looked like a baby cub you'd see at the zoo, with no indication whatsoever he was in distress in his face, with the only way to tell he was sad was through his voice acting and minimalist body language. In the original, you could see the fear, the doubt, the guilt in his eyes. Here there's none of that. Perhaps voice acting would've been enough to compensate, but the voice acting wasn't nearly strong enough. How can you compensate for something that heavy without the ability to see that agony in the face and eyes of the one experiencing it?This movie felt to me like one that was begging to burst out to greater potential was was constantly reigned in by realistic parameters. It is a prime example of what should be best left untouched. If you want to get the general gist of what this movie is like, look at your cat or dog. Then imagine it attempting to move you in any emotional way through its facial expressions with a sad voice alongside. It's just not there, and what is isn't nearly enough. The film is an absolute technical marvel, which is about the best credit I can lay at its feet. There are other flaws but they are ancillary in relevance compared to this main fault, because they could've easily been overlooked had it not been there.Ultimately, this juxtaposition of realism vs. the necessity of emotional gravitas, and the former's complete inability to convey the latter due to the manner of it's portrayal, is this film's greatest failing. The pitch should've been shot down by the executives long before it even began production.",The Lion King

Visually it's stunning, unfortunately there's no heart and soul behind the performances in the film. It's just a lazy line reading.

Cartoon characters do all kind of absurd things and survive getting squashed and don't need to eat. But this is a movie where the animals look like real ones, so I can't help but facepalm and question things. There are too many questionable things in this movie.How can Simba grow up into a fine lion from eating worms and insects only? Please ask a zoologist..How did the Pride Land turn into a wasteland when the only wrong thing that Scar and hyenas did is overhunt? If anything, the plants should be even more plentiful because there's no herbivores to eat them.Why would the herbivores cheer for Mufasa and Simba as king? They are your predator, dudes!

962,sam_l_kay,"7 on its own movie, 5 compared to the original",6,23 July 2019,"I know it's unfair to compare this to it's original but you can't really avoid it. This film tried to take a more realism over entertainment approach which is where it falls down.A lot of the charm and humour of the original just doesn't transfer well, especially with Scar. This new Scar is extremely underwhelming and forgettable, not great as the main antagonist; he needed a comprehensive re-write since his lines from the original are much better suited to Jeremy Irons' style of Scar.The film is gorgeous, unquestionably it's strongest point, however the facial animations are very vacant and make things a little awkward. For example the films opening sees Mufasa blank Zazu's bow and pretty much turn his back on Rafiki; when compared to the original he smiles for the former and hugs the latter... see what I mean about realism vs entertainment?In summary this film is good enough and a decent take on what was a masterpiece of an original movie, but if this was your first Lion King you've been done a great disservice. Go back to the original and get blown away by how magnificent it is, I guarantee you'll never go back to this newer imitation afterwards",The Lion King
963,bonesbaby33,A fair review,8,19 July 2019,"I honestly don't think this movie warrants a 10 or a 1. It isn't perfect, but it is very good. Except for the talking animals, not much about this movie screams ""animated!"" Disney has completely mastered the photorealistic technique.Timon and Pumbaa were, of course, a delight. Beyoncé wasn't annoying like I thought she would be. Donald Glover was kind of boring. I actually forgot who was voicing Simba and wondered if they'd hired a white guy to voice him, and how odd that was. But no, Donald Glover just added very little soul to his character. The rest of the voice acting was pretty good (especially Timon and Pumbaa).Yes, this is 75% a shot for shot remake of the original. And I don't mind it. Why? Because the original has a pretty airtight and entertaining story as it is. I am glad they didn't try to extend the runtime or add filler just to get extra points.A missed opportunity with ""Be Prepared"" (but good choice on removing the goosestepping!). But the other songs gave me chills. I grew up watching this movie with my sister and this was a great nostalgia kick, but also a technical masterpiece.To the critics who are sad that the animated animals don't emote-I think the emotions were portrayed perfectly in a realistic way. To add heavy eyebrows or make the animals smile would have ruined the stunning photorealism. Emotions are portrayed well through the characters' voices, eyes, ears, and body language. If you need a smile or a frown to read emotion then you may want to look up from your phone every once in a while and interact with another living being.",The Lion King

The movie practically would of sold itself a thousand more times over the years had they did so. But, they didn't. They changed so many iconic parts, words, sounds, and ultimate the entire feeling you used to get. I don't do movie reviews but my opinion matters here. I was a young boy who watched the lion king in all stages of my life. I even got my three children into it. I will avoid showing them this version.

Except for Seth Rogen, I felt voices (whether talking or singing) lacked that connection to what the character was feeling. And I felt that across the WHOLE movie. It was directed this way.I give it a 6 and I think I'm being too good. Again, realistic animation doesn't get better than this; but it seemed to me characters were more animals than humans.

It had so much heart in it and the visuals were brilliant. This really felt to me like Lion King being brought to life. Yes they do keep a lot of elements the same. It's the same story I think is what people are complaining about. So yes it is the same movie but the whole point was taking that story and showing how it plays out in live action. I was crying and was on the edge of my seat. They used the circle of life opening starting with the sun rising as Simba is being born which was brilliant. They used the same musical montages throughout as well. Just can't wait to be king is there too. The battle between Simba and Scar at the end was brooding and intense especially by the way it was brought into reality. Simba becomes king at the end like the animated original. Lion King has always been inspirational and this live action remake keeps that inspiration. Everyone complains there is no emotional expressions on the characters.

981,kaydrelia,Overrated and way too much spotlight on beyonce,1,21 July 2019,"Lion King was the only movie growing up that actually made me cry, the soundtrack alone was amazing, but there was a magic in the cartoon version. This new one is awful. They spent tons of money on the tech and actors, but forgot to add the magic. This isn't the Lion Queen, it's not about beyonce, but it's become all about her, when she didnt actually bring anything to the movie. James Earl Jones will never get a bad review in my book, he did his job. Everyone else was simply forgettable. The cartoon version I remember each actor, each song, each joke, etc and I havent watched it in years. My guess is that Disney is making all these worthless remakes to maintain the copyrights of those movies, but there's 0 intention to do it with the same magic and formula that captivated people from the beginning. The only remake I've enjoyed so far is Cinderella, we even bought it. The rest I don't even remember and my kids prefer the cartoon versions over the remakes now too, that should say something. Not that anyone at Disney will care, their goal is to take over everything to continue being in control and taking in heaps of money for their own exploits. I'll stick with the original Lion King, including the soundtrack and the Broadway show (also amazing), and never speak of this waste of money of a film again.",The Lion King
982,kiagogs,Not good,3,23 October 2019,"It indeed felt flat. The voices alone in the original left so much to be interpreted. I didnt even tear up when mufasa died in the remake and I'm sure most of us still bawl when we see that cartoon scene. No emotion in the voices, the faces, nothing. I never liked the idea of Beyonce in this because she's so big and well known. I felt like someone with more mystery world've been better and I stand by it. The song she sang was so over done in the way a big named musician would do. I just didn't enjoy it. Beautiful landscape though.",The Lion King
983,nyrfan2000,Stop the Comparisons already!!!,9,27 July 2019,"If I read one more time that this movie was "" not as good as the original"" I'm going to lose my mind! Of course it isn't as good as the original- I mean, how COULD it be??? The 1984 film was one if the best movies ever made- certainly the best animated movie ever made. So how could a remake ever live up to that?
With that said, the new version can stand on its own. Yes- I can find fault with several things- most notably the casting of Scar (why wasnt Jeremy Irons brought back???), some of the song remakes, etc. But the movie still maintains its emotional soul, and the message remains the same. And that Hans Zimmer score still brings goosebumps to my arms when I hear it!
Don't listen to the jaded 20 and 30-somethings who saw the original when they were little kids. Their understandable faithfulness to the original is expected. See this movie with an open mind- your heart will still be touched, 25 years later!",The Lion King

People nag about the ""emotionless, wooden animals""...they are animals!! Not caricature lions from the original cartoon. Lions don't have our facial expressions. Instead they added realistic body language like flattening ears or bearing teeth. That was the point! The emotion is in the fantastic voice acting (except Beyonce) and in the realistic movements of the animals. I loved that about the movie.The CGI was enthralling, it left me gazing at every detail, every blade of grass and stone and puff of dust. Congratulations to everyone involved.

This is very cheap and easy method to grab a cash from audience. This film has no emotion, no soul and originality. It only depends on nostalgia and success of original animation.
I would give -10/10 rating for this trash. Obviously Disney only cares about money, not about the audience. They ruined MCU and now they are ruining their own classics lol.",The Lion King
986,MissFKM,You need to watch this!,10,12 October 2019,"Ok so first off let me start by saying, I'm shocked at the awful reviews, just baffled and shocked that words can't express how confused I am that some people had the gaul to give this 6 stars and under.I love Disney films so much I named my daughter Disney so take it from me If the movie was crap I would say so. I'm not suggesting my opinion counts for more than anyone else but as a Disney fan I have high expectations of remakes.Visually I personally felt privileged to watch such a stunning coming together of effects with the voice overs. The animals faces DO show emotion and lots of it. Of course it's suppose to look realistic so naturally the expressions are not going to look human or too exaggerated, if they were then people would complain they were not true to how animal facial expression looks. They actually get the animals to dance whilst looking so realistic it was amazing.Now in terms of the voice overs Myself and partner felt most of the actors did a terrific job. Mufassa was, well...Mufassa haha. Pumbaa was so close to the original with Timon sounding different but the actors spin on Timon totally worked and the banter between the two had us in stitches. I must say we preferred some of the new jokes. Live action scar was not as depressing sounding which was strange at first but Chiwetel Ejiofor gave him much presence and his rendition of 'BE PREPARED' was different but felt more natural. Donald Glover was almost perfect, could have done with a bit more spark in his voice in the end scenes but he did very well. Can't forget Zazu, was missing some of his old jokes but well fitted to the role.Now for the burning question...BEYONCE. What can I say......We were enjoying everything about the film until Beyonce began singing. I must say that for me she ruined can you feel the love tonight. She was over-riffing and getting far too egotistical over what is supposed to be a very simple song with very soft simply sang lyrics. I hated her rendition. In saying that, I'm not about to deduct a star due to that as I think that would be unfair on the other actors who were a bit more modest in their performances. Beyonce sings once as Nala and her other song is only in the background and kind of catchy. What was disappointing is that with a voice like hers, Beyonce honestly doesn't need to 'show off' she let the movie down a little by doing that here in my opinion. Her speaking voice as Nala was just fine but, yes 'Need to come back down to earth miss B' and I say that as someone who likes Mrs Bs music, usually :)To conclude. Just watch it You won't regret it. My partner actually preferred this to the original and was mind blown by the effects. Lots of laughs and great graphics and songs sung by' real' animals (even a funny beauty and the beast reference in there that shouldn't be missed) What more do you need to be entertained, just watch it and stop complaining, enjoy!",The Lion King
987,dannyinformal,A horrible remake,2,12 October 2019,"Watching this film nearly soiled my memories of what I think is one of the best Disney films around. This piece of garbage ruined most of what made the original Lion King great; the cast defecated on the songs and turned them into some kind of modern r&b pop garbage and in an effort to add 'realism' they basically removed every humoristic scene from the film. The voice acting was awful and just added to an already expressionless experience caused the utterly unnecessary need for realism.This scene-for-scene replica even managed to shorten or remove scenes that were epic in the original; what happened to 'asante sana, squash banana'?P.s. Jeremy Irons should've done Scar's voice.",The Lion King

990,Grimbleton,A lacklustre remake with pomp and flourish in the wrong areas.,2,28 November 2019,"As a disclosure to everyone I should state that I hadn't seen the original Lion King film in a while, about 7 years to be exact. Prior to clicking the play button I wanted to make sure I didn't watch the original because I knew that despite my directive to be objective in processing the movie I would end up making comparisons to the classic, most probably to a negative effect on the remake. So when I watched the credits roll, it was with fresh face and only a vague memory of the timeless original.Although it was a fresh face, it was also a disappointed one.I want to state that this review is not a comparison, but rather a look at the film by itself. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews that criticize the faithfulness of the film to the original and this is not one of them. The Lion King (2019) is a decent movie at best, and that's primarily because it put effort into the wrong areas, at least as far as I'm concerned. Even with a star-studded cast the film failed to provide me with convincing voice acting. The best performances came from Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) while the rest were quite weak. I felt no strong emotions from almost all of the cast and this was certainly not helped by the lack of expressions present on the animals themselves. I get it, we're here for the incredible CGI (which to be fair was quite underwhelming) but looking at Little Simba when he's supposed to be devastated and only seeing a blank expression on his face created a serious disconnect between the already sub-par voice acting and the non-existent emotional expressions. This led to a significant lack of attachment to the characters and in turn, boredom throughout the film.Working with virtual reality at my job, I tend to notice a lot of details. That might be why this film didn't cut it for me in regards to the CGI as I just wasn't convinced and could easily point out the black spots in the animations. That being said, I think the realism conveyed is quite good - I appreciated the attention to the body muscles of the animals and the almost-on-point execution of the animals' movement to their real counterparts.Where the film totally disconnected with me were the remakes of the songs. I felt repulsed by the ""modernization"" of the original's non-frilly musicals and hated what the new cast did to them. Attempting to add more riffs and ornamentation (rapidly moving betweeen two notes, most commonly at the end of a phrase) were terrible and felt very forced and not natural. Add additional dialogue to fit today's standards (like low-effort jokes and references) and it makes for a solid disappointment.Verdict? Don't watch it and save yourself the time. Yes, the CGI is good enough but the voice acting is dismal, dialogue is forced and songs are altered to sub-par quality.",The Lion King

998,jazzontherocks,Surprisingly decent. A wonderful vehicle for Billy Eichner.,9,2 September 2019,"As a massive fan of ""The Lion King"" trilogy - including its sequel and midquel ""Simba's Pride"" and ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" - I wasn't sure what to think when the live action version was announced, knowing Disney remakes can be hits or misses. But I decided to treat this 2019 version as just another addition to ""The Lion King"" universe like the Broadway production.To my surprise, I found it to be very watchable. While it's a shot-by-shot CGI remake, it has some updated dialogues and extended scenes that many of us hope the original would've shown. Plus the new cast line-up is quite decent, almost as epic as the original film cast.Billy Eichner really stood out in my book. He has been getting lots of praises on social media, and I completely agree. Timon made one of my favorite actors Nathan Lane a star back in 1994 and opened up many doors for him in film (he's now a Broadway legend with three Tony wins), and Nathan's performance will always be iconic. But Billy gave Timon his own soulful twist. His comedic timing with Seth Rogen as Pumbaa is spot on. Just like Nathan and Ernie Sabella (the original Pumbaa), Billy and Seth are real-life friends, making Timon and Pumbaa a solid duo once again. As an added bonus, Billy has a stunning singing voice. This is like a wonderful vehicle for him and will hopefully get him starring roles in movies.Personally, I'm down for a ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" and ""Simba's Pride"" remake. The photorealism concept of this 2019 version gives off an environmental message like the new cast have been saying, which is very positive.I can say that out of all the Disney remakes, ""The Lion King"" is my top fave. It will never top the original obviously, but it's a decent addition to ""The Lion King"" universe.",The Lion King

I rather explain Jordans perspective adapted to a give year old than letting my kids waste time on this movie.Whay happened to psychology in the world?

Sorry Disney but it's 2019, people know you're buying successful stuff and messing them up, lucky Pixar still has guts to stand up to you..And no Disney, people aren't stupid to fall for this for too many movies, there are 24 hours in a day anf people won't waste it when there are so many other great things to watch, some on Netflix, some on HBO and a lot of stuff that is free on youtube and has wsy better points than your new remakes.

The problem is that the original included cartoony aspects (like an elephant crushing Zazu, Timon filing Simba's nails, etc). The other problem is that real animals don't really show emotions in their facial expressions. So it was impossible to stay true to the original 1994 version.The animation is incredible- they were going for realistic looking animals and that's what they achieved. The problem is those animals don't show emotions. So when you're seeing a sad moment, the faces of the characters aren't sad-looking.Pros: Timon and Pumbaa, some of the songs, amazing animation

1012,d-justins,"Music cut, poorly cast, and the emphasis set on the wrong parts of the story.",3,17 August 2019,"As almost every other review states, the music was a huge problem. While it may seem more ""raw"" than the original to not mix out the singers' compensations (i.e. singing ""t"" sound instead of ""d"" sound), the lack of polish was far inferior to the original. Furthermore, if you're going to stick to the same story to the original, you can't cut out or abbreviate songs as they did. One last note on the audio, the mastering was terrible... all over the place. As the original was highly prized for its music, this attempt really is a slap in the face.On casting, for the most part not too bad. The primary issue i had was with the actor playing Timon... what? Why not pick someone who can at least act a personality? His role of ""guru"" in the storyline was completely absent. There was no semblance of chemistry between he and Pumba. I like the actor that voiced Pumba, but there needed to be more personality added considering they couldn't compensate using animation. These two characters are the primary influence on the young Simba, and therefore are even more important to get correct than Nala. Huge failure here as well. I liked everyone else. I thought Scar lacked the evil flare not being Jeremy Irons, but he did fairly well.Lastly, terrible choices in elongating certain scenes for emphasis. Mufasa's death scene should've been way shorter. There must have been millions of wildebeests running by. Emphasizing this scene just further points out the illogical process of trying to rescue Simba any further. Once he laid low on the hillside, no need to do anything but run alongside the wildebeests... other scenes had this issue as well, no need to elaborate.All around, it could've been good, but wasn't. And by not making it at least as good as the original, it just puts a black eye on the whole project. Disney would've done better to just make it a different story altogether.",The Lion King

If I had written this review when I had first seen it in theaters I would have given it 1 star out of sheer disappointment like many others. I'm not a hater of the ""live-action"" remakes, in fact I think most of these Disney predecessors are beautifully executed. This one simply had far too much to live up to. I agree, generally the soundtrack is very dry and doesn't carry the passion of the original. Beyoncé most certainly drowns out Donald Glover in Can You Feel the Love Tonight and that is a sad shame, for he is incredibly talented. The animation team deserves enough credit to give this at least 3 stars, and I give it 2 more for the rest of the cast and the subtle jokes and references that are put into it.

This remake is just another remake. I've been reading all the reviews I could and come to my conclusion that Dumbo(2019) was better. It still sucked in the end, but it at least had Eva Green and Danny Devito giving nice performances, Dumbo was cute despite the fact that he was CGI, and Collin Farrell did OK with what he was given.
This movie, even with Happy Hogan directing it, and who ironically directed the Jungle Book,is just soulless and lifeless. And that's the words to describe this film: soulless and lifeless. Characters: lifeless
Everything: Lifeless.
Story: Lifeless
Honestly, you're better skipping this film. You won't miss anything. Or if you want just wait until it comes out on Redbox.",The Lion King
1029,josepx,Disney Remakes are not always going to pay off,6,22 July 2019,"Good Cast, Good CGI, Overrated Plot, Overrated Twists. Everything we expect to see in a Disney remake. So this is gonna be my review about everyone's favorite classic disney movie only this time remade. It gets to the point where movies like this aren't original anymore. They take a classic disney movie and make it a live action. I mean, Remakes actually were good in Disney. For example, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin were good because the directors remake it their own style making the movies fun. And now we have Lion King. Only this time, They really didn't really care to remake it their own style. That's what I was hoping for. Sadly, I didn't get any of that. They take the classic lion king movie, Make it a live action, and then that's it. Nothing changes. Obviously the plot and the twists don't change. That would not make any sense. It's a remake. But wouldn't it have been more enjoyable to remake it in your own style though like Aladdin did? The movie was still overall entertaining and dramatic. And I loved the dramatic final battle of Simba and Scar. The CGI was amazing. Disney remakes can be fun movies to watch but they are not always going to pay off because they're not original anymore. Still, It is a good fun movie still worth watching. Still, I could tell Disney is running out of ideas so they give us remakes. They can make it fun and remake it their own style. Aladdin was fun and was really entertaining. Lion King was still entertaining and dramatic but it was just taking the classic lion king movie and just making it a live action. I understand Aladdin did that too but at least the director did it in his own style. Anyways, I give the Lion King a 6/10 and it's still worth seeing. But Disney, Please get new ideas. Remakes are not always gonna pay off.",The Lion King

1031,alvinseech,No Point.,1,23 August 2019,"Was the original Disney cartoon not enough? No, of course not, let's drag it out into a theatre production (which to be fair, was ok but also quite missable).
I just don't see the point in remaking something when there's no demand or even a need. What also annoys me is the casting of famous singers who are not known for their speaking voice, let alone acting. I feel Beyoncé was only cast because she's famous and can take part in a song or two but it really watered the production down for me.
The graphics are stunning and very convincing but that's the most I can say about it. I just don't see the point.
Can you imagine what good it would've done if the entire budget of this film was donated to bettering African wildlife?",The Lion King
1032,alsinaariq,Not too bad like other people say,7,18 July 2019,I don't know why everyone say this film is Bad. The Lion King have a great cinematography. But from the plot I see no different from previous The Lion King movie. There's no brand new thing on this movie.,The Lion King
1033,cdgrech,Amazing CGI in a lack lustre movie.,3,29 July 2019,"Took my young Niece & Nephew to see this.
I'll begin with giving praise to the digital artists. Amazing and beleivable work. Very impressed.
The movie on the other hand was lacking & voice acting almost felt it was being read directly from the script.
The movie plot was a carbon copy of the original cartoon animated movie but just felt like all effort went into the CGI & little to none went into making good beleivable dialogue. Even the soundtrack sounded half hearted compared to the original.
Beyonce was a terrible casting choice, she just had too much vocal attitude which just felt off. Seth Rohan was great but it wasn't enough.
My neice & nephew (6 & 4 yo) got bored & restless as were other children in the theatre.This movie didn't need to be done, as were any of the other recent live action remakes Disney has been churning out in an obvious cash grab riding on the success of the originals & another reminder that Hollywood writers have no talent for original ideas.If you must watch, don't bother going to the cinema to see & wait for streaming release.",The Lion King
1034,jadeelst,Worst Disney Remake for me so far,5,3 August 2019,"Some minor spoilers!So I absolutely love the original Lion King. I have rated it a 10 on IMDb since it means so much to me. Once it was revealed that this movie was going to come I was actually pretty excited! But the more got revealed the more confused I got over what I was going to think of this. The only way to know was to watch it. So I did...I have strong emotions about this (unlike the animals in here...). And this is definitely the most disappointing 'live action' remake for me. Even though I think Disney is making way to much 'live action' remakes at the moment, I don't really have a problem with the ones I've watched (except this one). I liked that Maleficent had a new perspective on the story and the Jungle Book is also a bit different. I like seeing different interpretations of the originals. But The Lion King doesn't do that at all. It's almost exactly the same as the original.The only thing that is the big difference is the animation. I actually really think the animation looks amazing, but it's not good for this movie. It just doesn't work. Because the style is so realistic especially the lions have almost no emotion on their face. It also makes some songs who were amazing in the original look very underwhelming. Especially the song 'Be prepared' is so horrible and doesn't live up to the original at all. Also the famous 'Long live the king' and Simba's reaction to Mufasa's death is so underwhelming because it lacks emotion. The scenes where I came closest to feeling emotional where scenes where the characters faces weren't visible.What is good about this movie? The things that are exactly the same as the original; like the plot. This makes the movie way better. But I can't really give this film credit for that because it's the EXACT same as in the non 'live action' version. I'm sure that if I would have never seen the original I would like this movie way more because the story is so good! But the original already did that but way better!There are two things this movie adds that I appreciate. First some extra funny moments with Timon and Pumbaa where the whole audience chuckled. And second Beyoncé's songs. I thought 'Can you feel the love tonight' was beautiful, except for emotionless lions and that it wasn't night? (Disney why?) When Beyoncé's Spirit started playing was the only time I felt a bit emotional, because the song is beautiful and I couldn't see the lions faces then.In short: I don't recommend this movie. Instead watch the original and listen to Spirit on repeat.",The Lion King

1036,iliangathot,Great visual effects but not much else,6,10 November 2020,"Normally I am a very open minded person. While most people would immediately hate a remake just because it's not the original, I like to give those movies a chance. The Lion King however was quite disappointing.First of all I want to say that the CGI in this movie is just groundbreaking. If you would have told me they had trained real lions and filmed them I would have believed you. The images in this movie are on the same level as those from BBC's Planet Earth.Now comes the negative part. This movie is almost a complete -however newly rendered- copy of the original, sometimes even frame by frame. Yes, there are a couple of scenes added but I was hoping for some more. I would have liked to see some more dept brought to the characters. Maybe even some backstory for characters like Scar, Mufasa and Rafiki. Maybe even under the form of flashbacks. That would have made this a worthy remake.So overall, this movie is more made for either people who have never seen the original movie (if those people exist) or people who want to have some nostalgia and mind-blowing visual effects.",The Lion King
1037,laurensquire-1988,Goosebumps,10,22 July 2019,"I won't lie I had been worried about seeing this remake of my favourite Disney movie for a while. The trailers looked good and clips I'd seen I wasn't sure what to feel.
I went in completely open minded.
I was so happy with end product Jon Favreau and his team has tried so hard to get right.
Visually stunning the little things that were added worked so well! The cast were great even though I was a bit unsure of Beyoncé! Donald Glover was made for the role of adult simba. Pumba and Timon were brilliant! All in all well done, there have been many mixed reviews but I really think this is amazing!
Spoilers...
The only thing missing from that was a bit gutted about was the iconic scene with Simba and Rafiki hitting him over the head with his stick.
The longer version of the lion sleeps tonight was brilliant.
The stampede scene broke me all over again.

1043,catsy29,1 star just for the visual effects team. And that's it.,1,5 August 2019,"The visual effects are stunning. Probably the best CGI I have ever seen.But the story, zzzzzz. I was so bored. Such a lack of passion, there is no essence in this movie.I am sad for the generation that will grow up with this version. I didn't even see a kid crying. Is The Lion King! I still cry!I am a 90s kid. I grew up with The Lion King. Still, I only saw the whole movie twice because I couldn't take ""that scene"". It was so devastating to me that I still feel it. I had to skip it everytime.It was such an emotional event for me. I am now 28 and, I am trying to watch it again but I get cold feet because I know it will be very painful.The Lion King is not just one of the best animated movies of the whole time. It's also one of the best movies ever made.I didn't want to watch this version. But I was with my little cousins and I said, why not?.What a huge mistake. This movie didn't make me feel a thing.The CGI is amazing but the emotions are just not there. You can't put human emotions on the face of a real lion. It looks creepy and just doesn't work. It doesn't translate well.And the changes of the original story were not too many. But still it felt very short and hollow.I was just waiting for the movie to be over.Also, if Disney was going to make a reboot. Why not update the story? Why not talk about climate change?That is something that the Ice Age has done so well.It was a missed opportunity to deliver such an important message right now. I think there is not one healthy ecosystem right now on Earth.I wish this movie were not a reboot but a ""based on"". So, they could give us something fresh.I didn't understand the whole concept of the controlled hunts. I know in the animated version made sense. But if you are going to go realistic, follow the rules of the reality you have created.At the ceremony of the introduction of the new king, why the hell the herbivores were celebrating?I was such a bizarre and unintentional funny moment.This was a very bad experience. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Not even children.Children should stick to the original. And Diseny too.We want original content. Not half-assed ""reboots"".Please. Stop.",The Lion King
1044,alexandrejouan,Lost its soul,5,17 October 2021,Ironically the amazing visuals (and they truly are amazing) hurts the overall movie and removes its soulPhotorealistic animals just don't convey emotions and humor the way cartoons do... and there really isn't a way around it...The worst is when the animals talk... it s just weird with photorealistic animals. Watch the trailer again. It is about 2 mins long but shows only 5 seconds of a character talking. The rest is narration over visuals. Because even the editing team knew it just looks weird when the characters/animals speak in this movie.,The Lion King
1045,stephhall-16505,Soulless and offensive,3,16 January 2021,"As many people have rightly pointed out, this movie was terribly miscast and lacked any originality, resulting in a boring and soulless movie we somehow survived through.What I find insulting though is at the time of the release they were touting Nala as a feminist icon and having ""a more prominent role"" in this remake, and ""HELL YEAH GIRL POWER"", purely to draw people in when in fact the only thing we see her doing that wasn't a scene for scene match to the animated original was her escape from Scar/The Pridelands. This scene was such a letdown. It was slow and boring and had no suspense. She had no speaking lines in the scene and it did nothing to contribute to her character or the story. If they bothered to do any thinking for this remake they would realise that we actually have this scene already in the Broadway BUT BETTER. Nala gets a song along with the other lionesses that not only adds dynamic to her character, but also reinforces strong messages and ideals related to the pride and sense of duty and despair for the situation they face.
And to top it off you have Beyoncé (who I am actually not much of a fan of) voicing Nala and you deprive her of a song like Shadowland?To put it simply, this movie is a disgrace.",The Lion King
1046,Box_mixman,I even enjoyed the singing!. Stunning!.,8,22 November 2019,"When I was a kid, I knew lots of peers who loved the original, the singing and everything, I didn't think too much of it then, the singing was too much.
But I have grown more fond of it, and this new one was really great!. Almost made this 33yo guy sing along and wish for more, especially once I saw Timon and Pumba, I had forgotten about those!. Hakuna Matata!.The visuals are also very stunning!, this is perhaps the most detailed work I have seen yet, in certain scenes you could think it was filmed in reality.The few things I didn't like was that it actually felt like many scenes just.. just.. needed a little more time, talking 5-30seconds. To get a little more involved with few of the characters, just to see them more, because it felt like they were passing by just to show things a few times, otherwise they were so great in conveying emotion, movement, often.With all this said, I also hope they still will do more ""real"" cartoons in the old style, the aim shouldn't be to always just make it advanced in tech, but also I don't think this movie suffers from it.
I am not a mega fan of the original who's seen that one many times, so I can't comment on what might have been left out or whats different.",The Lion King
1047,Carlos_1984,Great remake! 8 out of 10! Amazing special effects! What is wrong with the 1 star ratings????,8,17 July 2019,"I went to see The Lion King tonight and I really loved it! The music is great, the vocals are really good and the story is the one we remember as kids.So how to explain the 1 star ratings around here?
I believe is happens dor 2 reasons:1. Insanely high expectations: as it happens with all the most antecipated movies, people creat such a huge expectations that is hard to make it come true. We saw this before (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Lost and Game of Thrones series finale, etc).2. Some people just don't like remakes/reboots. I get it. I usually give the benefit of the doubt, but some cases the movies are really bad (Lion King is NOT the case). And I'm not sure what people are expecting to see when they go to the cinema watch a REMAKE? Of course the story is the same, the music is a mix of old and new sounds (wich I found amazing).To give a movie 1 star you really have to hate it with all your guts. Let's be rational: 1 star? 1??? Out of 10??
These ratings are coming from those who are stuck in childhood memories and can't accept a new version of a great story.The only reason I don't give this a 10 is because the original movie had a much greater emotional feeling, and I believe it is because you can't make, for example, a real lion cry like Simba did when Mufasa died. The emotion is there, but the 1994 version was a lot more sad and touching.
But at least my childhood memories didn't stop me from enjoying a great movie with an amazing soundtrack!Just watch it for what it is: a R-E-M-A-K-E!! So unless you have never seen the original movie, you will se the SAME STORY told in a different way.",The Lion King
1048,RebekahE99,Loved It,10,20 July 2019,"So I think I'm the target audience for this movie: I've loved the animation since I was 5, it has one of my favorite soundtracks ever, and I love spin offs including the Broadway show and Disney World's show. They would have really had to screw up for me to not like this.I had one issue with this movie: Can You Feel The Love Tonight had too much daylight. I hope they pull a George Lucas and fix this for the Bluray releae.What I loved: The animation was absolutely INCREDIBLE. The realism of the animals and environment, the little touches, just everything was mind-blowing. The lion cubs looked so cute and soft that I just wanted to pet them. The parts that were playful and fun in the original were also playful and fun in this movie without being cartoon-y. The voices were similar to the original, with the notable exception of Scar and Shenzi, but I still enjoyed those performances. Timon, Pumba, and Zazu were great and just as amusing as in the original. Most of the jokes have been updated, which keeps the movie entertaining and gives some new-ness. The music was great. I especially liked the opening song, I Just Can't Wait to Be King, Hakuna Matata, and The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Can You Feel The Love Tonight seemed a little weak, but I feel like the theater I went to also didn't have the volume up high enough.Overall, this is not movie made for critics. but for fans and kids, and I think it's great.",The Lion King

The Music is okay too, not so much different to the old movie, but okay. I like that they don't show too much emotions, these are animals, they don't show emotions as distinctly as we humans do.

1056,geekissexy-385-917812,Honest Review From The #1 Lion King Snob On The Planet,10,20 July 2019,"Let me start off saying that I have been THE Lion King girl since I was 7 years old back in 1994. I will gladly argue with anyone that says they are a larger fan than I am, and I am about the biggest snot around when it comes to ANYTHING Lion King. This is all coming from the girl so disgusted with the Hakuna Matata merchandise for using Mufasa's silhouette all the time I'm constantly sending complaint messages to Disney.This movie was everything.It was real. It was breathtaking. It was gorgeous, and it was perfect.If anyone - and I mean anyone - was going to have a problem with this movie, it would have been me. I have been having trouble sleeping the week before release worrying about if I was going to leave that theater upset and disappointed that the most important movie of my lifetime was destroyed.No. I left wanting to turn right back around and go in.Favreau did a MAGNIFICENT job of keeping the true spirit of the movie alive, while ""growing it up"" a bit. From the opening scene where ""NANTS IGONYAMA BAGITHI BABA!"" was NOT altered, to the last moment where Mufasa says ""Remember"" to Simba as he takes his place - it kept true to The Lion King.Minor differences did not bother me. Am I a bit bummed that the Be Prepared song was shortened? Absolutely. But is that worth me hating the entire movie? Absolutely not. In my opinion, it fit - and made Scar sound more evil than the animated version. Other notable differences were Rafiki not saying his well-known ""Asante Sana"" chant at any point in the movie. Again, no big deal. We also didn't have Zazu in a cage of bones singing Small World....and again that's fine. Two of the hyena's names were changed, but that is unknown unless you've seen the movie and know the others. Only Shenzi's name is spoken anyway.The realism blows my absolute mind. From the blades of grass blowing in the wind to every hair on the lions mane moving around I honestly could not tell that I wasn't just watching a real documentary where animals have ACTUALLY learned to speak. With that being said, Mufasa's death was terribly hard to watch. I was choking on tears. If you thought the animated version was hard, you just wait.Timon and Pumba were absolutely adorable. Loved the ad lib between the two. The ""Lion Sleeps Tonight"" sequence may have been my new favorite part of the film thanks to that bush baby. Fantastic casting on both parts. Be Our Guest, anyone? ;)THANK YOU Hans Zimmer for updating the soundtrack and not completely overhauling the music. It was captivating hearing those scores over this new version in the theater. My heart skipped many beats.I am so disgusted reading the articles that the critics have posted that I could cry.""It's too real."" Are you kidding me? That's a literal, actual sick joke right? IT'S SUPPOSED TO FEEL REAL. It would look absolutely stupid if REAL lions were flipping around on the backs of giraffes and rhinos and were jumping on tree vines into the water. PLEASE shut up with that comment, it makes my head hurt.""It's too much like the original and doesn't branch out enough""
Again. You're making my head hurt with this mess. I'm GLAD it didn't. We didn't need a million miles of unnecessary back-story or side-story like Beauty and The Beast did, which I thought was a complete failure. Sue me. I personally loved seeing how Nala left Pride Rock. THAT was a good piece of side story.If you don't read any other review, I beg you to please - go see this movie. Don't let people who have obviously allowed magic to leave their minds ruin a film that is breathtaking and honors the original very well.John Favreau, wherever you are, this Lion King snob salutes you.",The Lion King

From the exuberance of a child singing ""I just can't wait"" to the cunning Scar singing ""be prepared"" it was all the same dull, un-memorable performances of people who hum as opposed to people who sing their hearts out.
It was an animated movie first, Disney could easily have used most of the original cast. Really, the story was already written, the score already written, I expected much more thought to have been given to the performance of each character.",The Lion King

They made the animals look very realistic which caused them to show less emotion. It could have worked if the acting was better but between the boring performances and lack of facial expressions, some of the most emotional scenes were just empty.

What happened to original concepts, cos I can't be the only one tired of seeing the same films/franchises over and over.The only redeeming thing I can say is that the animators did a phenomenal job here; every little hair on these animals is exquisitely rendered and they deserve recognition for such impressive work.

Unfortunately the animators of the new film didn't take this into consideration and it was doomed from the start.The original cartoon's voice actors were mostly all Broadway actors (Jeremy irons, Matthew Broderick, Etc...) and knew how to slightly overact which, in The case of voicing animals, worked out amazingly well.

Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen deliver a wonderful and funny comedic relief that can only be expected from the characters they portray. I laughed and felt every emotion that the original evoked. The CGI did fall a little flat, emoting was a bit of an issue but I think in most characters the voice acting evened this short coming out.

Everything in this movie was just wrong, the voice acting, the lack of heart and emotion in the characters, the change of characters, the great scenes they left out (even though it makes to leave out some of them), and there was no point of redoing this whole movie.Disney you need to get more people to come up with more original ideas then remaking the best movies into something that's unneeded.

It doesn't deserve anywhere NEAR that. Okay, well I just felt like seeing this movie cause I like The Lion King, and while I feel they did a good job with at least two of the songs that I was familiar with from the original and also has good CGI, AND had Mufasa's same VA from the original, everything else was bad. The characters hardly showed any emotion. They all just felt emotionless. This movie wasn't horrible imo but it does NOT deserve anywhere close to a 10. And it doesn't deserve a 7.1. It's so stupid how it even managed to get up to that overall rating. While it is certainly better than Aladdin's remake, that still isn't saying much.

1100,calebdrums,"Disappointing, Insanely Disappointing",3,27 July 2019,"If I have ever left a movie auditorium with the movie I just viewed being a conduit to my total and utter disappointment, this was it. While it wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, it was so far off of everything the original had to offer that it definitely qualifies as one of the biggest letdowns I've ever viewed. While I didn't feel completely insulted by the film, as a lot of other diehard fans of the original have been, I did feel like I had been betrayed by it, in a big way.I always like to start off with the bright spots in a film, and yes, this movie did have a few. First, the technology used to create such realistic looking animals is completely mind blowing. We'll get to how that hampered the film in a bit, but just the fact that they were able to create such reality within the confines of a mainframe is rather impressive.Secondly, John Oliver's performance as Zazu is dynamite. He's probably the only actor in the movie who actually cared about what they were saying. He took the script and ran with it, and it truly shows in the character. He sounds like a classic British humorist speaking from the body of this tiny bird, and he did a lot of what Will Smith did as the Genie in Aladdin. He paid a ton of homage to Rowan Atkinson's brilliant performance from the original, but he made Zazu his own character.A third bright spot was the score. It was brilliant, but then again, it's Hans Zimmer, one of the greatest film composers of our time. Yes, a lot of it is rehashed from the first film, but when you're dealing with one of the greatest film scores of all time, you don't need to tweak it a whole lot. Adding a dash of this here or a pinch of that there is sometimes all you need, and this is a prime example of that. It's not overdone so that it's unrecognizable, but it's tweaked enough so that you're into it throughout the film.But aside from those three spots, this film left me feeling so utterly disappointed. There's a lot to cover in the negative area, so let's begin with the characters themselves. If there is one word I could use to describe all of the characters in the movie, with maybe the exception of Zazu and Pumbaa, it would be dead. Completely and utterly dead. You want to have a funeral for these characters, that's how incredibly lifeless they are. They move realistically and they have incredibly detailed features, but emotionally, they're just nonexistent.Now, I went into this movie knowing that they wouldn't have the same amount of emotion as in the original. After all, these are supposed to be real animals and real animals don't smile or frown or do anything like humans do. In the original, they could play with emotions because they were dealing with hand drawn animation. Here, it was impossible because of the sheer amount of realism. So, for me, complaining about the lack of emotion in a movie like this is a bit unfair, but when you witness the complete lack of effort put in by the majority of the cast, you realize why everyone is upset about it.But the biggest disappointment for me when it comes to character was Scar. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives no effort to be threatening or menacing or anything even remotely regarding the level of villainy that Jeremy Irons was able to put forth in the original film. The original Scar was so universally despised as a character, that it made his comeuppance that much more satisfying when it did happen. This Scar just feels very lackluster in comparison to the brilliance of the original.I said earlier that the score to the movie was fantastic, and it was. Most of the songs were very serviceable as well. But there were two that were slaughtered in an attempt to recreate them. One was ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and the other was ""Be Prepared."" The original version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight was beautifully composed and gorgeously animated. Simba and Nala's love, while a quick one, pours off the screen and you're able to, quite literally, feel the love tonight. In this one, not only was it shot at the wrong time of day, but Beyonce, as she so often does with anything she's in, completely ruins it by taking the female vocals and turning it into something you'd hear on Top 40 Radio. This isn't hit radio in New York, this is The Lion King! Make an effort! Do something!Be Prepared suffered from a complete lack of singing. It almost felt like Scar was giving a political speech as opposed to singing his threats. Again, Ejiofor's complete lack of investment in his performance completely hurts the song, and the decision to take one of the greatest Disney villain songs of all time and transform it into something so quiet and powerless is mind boggling. This is one of the spots where the movie borders on insulting fans of the original. It's really, really degrading, which is sad because Be Prepared is such a landmark of The Lion King.But the biggest slap in the face to the original fans was the part where Simba shakes his mane and one random tuft of fur, which could've come from any of the huge number of lions that call Africa home, somehow finds its way to Rafiki (who, by the way, has been turned from a guiding light kind of character into a stupid babbling nonsense spewing idiot), and the monkey somehow gets the memo that Simba is alive because of it. What's worse, part of it was of the tuft being rolled around in a bunch of giraffe poop by a dung beetle. I'm going to repeat that, because it bears repeating: they put giraffe poop in the remake of The Lion King! I'm gonna end the review there before I get any more disappointed and disgusted with this film.So it is with a heavy heart that I give this such a low rating. I expected so much out of a remake of one of the greatest animated films ever created, and what I got was emotionless performances, bland characters, Beyonce being terrible (so, in other words, being herself), and giraffe poop. Thanks, Disney. I won't be seeing this again.",The Lion King

The movie would have been perfect if they brought back Jeremy Irons as Scar as the new voice actor just couldn't do anything remarkable. Scar became dark and boring 😴. The very esscene of the humorous sarcastic Scar was lost. Beyonce's spirit song was completely unnecessary and did not at all fit with the mood of the movie. Rafiki was not as eccentric anymore. Other than that the movie was great. Of course the visuals were just out of the world! Mufasa's death scene, the pivotal point of the movie was extremely well executed.

1104,ildudeentertainment,If you liked the Original,7,9 November 2020,"Over the past few years, Disney has begun remaking a number of their animated classics in hopes of reintroducing them to a whole new generation of viewers...or you know, to make more money off them. Probably the most anticipated of these was Jon Favreau's ""The Lion King"" (2019) which is finally in theaters. The movie has certainly generated a lot of buzz regarding photorealistic animation causing mass controversy online as to whether or not it's live-action, as well as whether or not that style should even be used. Regardless of how you feel about the animation, it's hard to not be impressed by it.
Another one of the big controversies surrounding the film is whether or not we needed it. The movie is basically a shot for shot remake of the original movie, with a few small changes to fit the new photorealistic aesthetic that the people at Disney worked so hard to create, so it's kind of hard to not enjoy the movie if you enjoyed the original seeing as it's more of a remaster than a full-blown remake. One of the biggest changes from the original movie and this might be considered a minor spoiler so spoiler warning ahead, is the addition of a subplot involving Scars motives. In this one, it seems Scar once had a desire to claim Sarabi as his queen, and envy's Mufasa for winning her over. It adds to his character, and I think helps understand him a little more. What makes this addition even more interesting is that it was supposed to be in the original but removed. While I like the idea of it, I felt that it was placed in the movie at the wrong time. The most prominent scene regarding Scar confronting Sarabi about being his queen comes after we see a fully grown Simba for the first time. While Scar and Sarabi may have discussed this before, the dialogue makes it seem as if this was the first time they had talked about it. Everything about the scene just feels off, and like it should have taken place a few weeks after Mufasa's death rather than what I can only imagine was at least two to three years. It's a small thing, but I don't understand how one of the few big changes from the original made such a trivial mistake. Outside of that though I did find the movie's plot to be just as entertaining as the originals.
When it comes to the new cast, I gotta say I think Disney did a great job of finding it's cast. Donald Glover is a pretty good choice for Simba, as he puts a lot of his heart into the role whether it's voice acting or singing one of the originals many classic songs. Beyonce as Nala is another great addition to the cast and possibly one of the very few improvements over the original, the only actual complaint I can come up with is that she easily overshadows Donald Glover during their duets but that's far from her fault. I was also pretty impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's take on Scar, as he managed to capture the chillingness that Jeremy Irons added to the character all while adding his own charm. I could go on about all of the new cast members because again I think Disney did a great job there, but perhaps my favorite cast wasn't a recast at all. When it comes to Mufasa there was no Replacing James Earl Jones, and I'm happy Disney realized it. The chemistry between the cast was honestly the movie's strongest point for me.
All things said and done, the new ""Lion King"" is nothing exceptionally new. Sure the photorealistic animation is impressive, but ""Avatar"" did it back in 2009, and even Jon Favreau's own ""Jungle Book"" in 2016. Not to mention, I felt that the photo-realism did take some of the heart out of the movie. I understand what they were going for, and it helps differentiate from the original, but truth be told I feel they should have met somewhere in the middle. I don't think it would have hurt the movie at all to make the lions look real, but keep the color schemes of the characters seen in the original. I feel this would have been particularly interesting to see in the final fight between Scar and Simba because you would know who is who. Again, it's a minor complaint against the movie and didn't overly affect my enjoyment of it, but it's worth noting. This is a very fun remaster of the original, and I more than enjoyed seeing it in theaters. I know a lot of people don't like the idea of it being a shot for shot remake, but I don't see an issue with it. If Broadway can bring back the same shows every now and then with a new cast and the latest advancements in theatre I see no reason films can't either, they're both performance-based art and it's interesting to see in my opinion. I just hope that it doesn't become an industry-standard rather a cool treat every now and then. Due to the fact though that it's nothing new, I don't think you need to see it in theaters. But it's worth seeing at some point if you liked the original. I'd give it a 7.5/10 as they took the Worry-Free Philosophy a little too far.",The Lion King

1106,lewisgilber,Beautifully Unimaginative,2,9 August 2019,"Disney's live action remakes have been a continuous success at the box office, but are often criticised for being unnecessary, and often not adding anything to the legacies of the animated classics. This is sadly the case with Jon Favreau's The Lion KingAnyone expecting a fresh take will be sourly disappointed by the beat for beat retelling with very few alterations in the dialogue. The minor changes are limited to lines and scenes being altered or flat out removed, but ultimately, if you hold the original close to your heart, I would stick with it, as structurally, this remake is unimaginative.What will be of interest to some will be the film's visual construct. The photo realistic designs of our beloved characters was well detailed and had been well rendered. The biggest achievements are the stampede scene and climatic battle between Simba (Donald Glover) and Scar(Chiwetel Ejiofor) Sadly, the production values don't hold up upon reflection. The biggest downfall to these photo realistic designs was the lack of emotions on display on the characters. Because the designers wanted them to be realistic, they couldn't show human emotion like in the original, which is a big problem as the audience can't read a character's emotion through it's facial expression as there isn't any to see. There are also moments that feel lacklustre, most noticeable in the musical numbers that don't feel as grand nor epic as they did in animation, despite many shots being the same as they were in the original. Most noticeably in the opening number.The vocal work by the cast was for the most part very lacklustre, and didn't feel like the actors were always giving their A game, if at all. Glover and Beyoncé did a decent job of portraying Simba and Nala as adults, and really sell the vocals in their romantic duet, despite the romance still being underdeveloped. Ejiofor and John Oliver do an equally brilliant job as Scar and Zazu, without treading on the toes of Jeremy Irons and Roman Atkinson. With the return of James Earl Jones, you would expect Mufasa to be as booming and attention grabbing as he had been originally. Sadly, Jones' performance here reminds me of his reprisal as Darth Vader in 2016's Rogue One. A performance which sounds right, but doesn't have the same passion and energy behind it. As for the younger cast, the unenthusiastic and unemotional singing voice from JD McCrary as young Simba didn't sound very enthusiastic during the songs, which became more apparent when Glover took over half way through Hakuna Matata.Upon reflection, this film upsets me for how little passion there seemed to be from all involved. With the likes of Jon Faverau, Donald Glover, Beyonce and James Earl Jones on board, I expected more passion and creativity, and ended up with an empty, soul-less mess. Now, having seen this film with family and friends, I will happily admit that this latest remake is very entertaining if the audience are willing to forget about the original for two hours and let the visuals draw you in. But for many purists, this will be the same old story, with a less than passable visual style. People continue to question why Disney has gone down this path of remaking animated classics, but ultimately, whether we like it or not, if it isn't broke but makes money, why fix it?...

1107,Shift_AC_Was_Here,Feast your eyes ! not your brain ...,7,14 October 2019,"14/10/2019 (6) Lion King (2019) 7.1/10Non-Spoiler-Ish ReviewSo the movie is beautiful. But the compassion ... not so muchThe main flaw of the movie was the songs executions and the color design throughout the movie.Don't get me wrong, some songs are good and just simply iconic. Some however, just do not land for me like the ""Can you feel the love tonight"" song. It's more like afternoon love and not night :))).To be precise, some songs felt cringy as the animation sequences and the songs seemed injected and forced.Story-wise, it's the same as the 1994 animation version. No difference.I would say that everything looks absolutely amazing! I cannot deny it. The technology to make this movie is stunning. I enjoy the feast on my eyes but not so much in my brain cause the 1994 version actually felt more authentic :).I am so wierd. The Jungle Book is actually better for me. Maybe because iit has a human affection within the movie and Lion King does not.Somewhat the same vibe with the modern Jungle Book movie. Same director after all",The Lion King
1108,kenobio-68005,The Lion King,5,4 November 2019,"The Lion King (1994) was a near-perfect emotional and humorous movie. Though its live-action remake doesn't go near its predecessor.The elements that made the movie so special are lacking in this one. Let's take the ""Be prepared"" scene. In the 1994 version, Scar explains to the hyenas his dark plan that is to bring down the king and kill him to take its place. The exaggeration of the visuals, the music, the voice of Jeremy Irons suits the scene perfectly, making it frightening and evil. In the 2019 version, the scene is highly weakened. Chiwetel Ejiofor barely sings, however you can still distinguish a sort of song, making the scene uncomfortable. Moreover, we don't see the reaction of the hyenas very well in comparison to the original, who interact with Scar during the scene. Generally, the incredible music, making the scenes more emotional and heartbreaking in the original, are very weak and not even noticeable in the new version. Finally, the characters feel emotionless. They still express them though their voice, but with the realistically look it's really difficult to distinguish their feelings, unlike the original when the faces were drown.The voices are highly important in The Lion King, and this was something I was afraid of when I heard of this remake. James Earl Jones retrieves his role as the great king Mufasa, and does the job amazingly. Donald Glover and Beyoncé portray the older versions of Simba and Nala respectively, offering a new side of the characters than in the original. Chiwetel Ejiofor, as much as he tries to be convincing, is quite disappointing but still manages to sound helpless and evil at some times.However, the movie still offers touches of originality. You wondered how Nala managed to espace from Pride Rock? A new scene shows how she manages to get away from Scar's claws. Timon and Pumbaa's new friends appear when they are in the jungle, however they don't disturb the plot. Going back on Timon and Pumbaa, their infamous distraction scene in front of the hyenas when Timon dances the hula is replaced with a Lady and the Beast reference.The movie follows the same plot as the 1994 one, but isn't a copy-paste as I feared, as new elements are added. This is the first Disney live-action remake I watch, so I hope the others take the same idea however changing some elements. Disney still has to realize that transforming a classic animated movie into live-action doesn't make it any better.",The Lion King
1109,samhandymusic,"A few enhancements, but at a cost of some defining moments",6,14 March 2020,"The Lion King was the film for me as a kid back in the 90s. It inspired me to be a musician and songwriter, to get through the bullying I received at school, and to move on from the death of a loved one on my father's side of the family. It had it all for me as a kid, and I'd watch it every week.There were many new scenes that enhanced the flow of the story that I thought ""this would've been great in the original"" but some started to feel like 'deleted scenes' and for a reason.The music felt hollow, some of the sound track did stand out, but there were parts of the score that felt missing, or forced. You can hear it straight away during the opening scene. You also have Beyoncé going WAY over the top in one song, and that ruined it for me. Glover's voice acting was cringe-worthy most of the time, and James Earl Jones sounded like he was in a rush to get out of the studio.You had a few scenes removed, or completely messed with. I'm being biased here, but Simba's conversation with Rafiki is the most important part of the film. Everything from ""Asante Sana Squash Banana..."" to hitting Simba with the stick. And giving one of the greatest lines in cinema history ""...the past can hurt"". All of this is cut.Let's not forget Beyoncé yelling ""Lions, attack!"" ...jeez Favreu, really? They also cut Ed the Hyena, and replaced him with this unimportant 2-dimensional flap of a secondary antagonist, why?Overall I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't go back to watch it again. If I need a Lion King boost, it'll be the original for sure.",The Lion King
1110,ghetjip,This movie would've tanked if it wasn't for the success of the original,1,15 July 2020,"It's the exact same movie as the original, but with bad voice acting, a poor musical score, and the only reason anyone even wanted to see this movie is for nostalgic reasons, and because Beyonce is in it. I don't particularly love the original movie, but I do admire everything it did, and frankly I can see why it is such a masterpiece. Every change that was made for this movie however seems to be for the worse.
They tried to make this movie look realistic in an attempt to make it look like a documentary, however in doing so they sacrificed facial expression and body language. I cry everytime I see mufasa die in the original, but I busted out into laughter when it happened in this movie. Why would they focus so hard on making the film look like a documentary anyways, it's a film about talking, singing animals. If anything it hurts the film cause they pride themselves on making it look so realistic that whenever something looks bad or unrealistic it stands out so much more.
The voice acting is not at all good, and the saddest part is that the two worse voice actors to me were Seth Rogen and Beyonce. Aka the two actors they brought in purely for name recognition. It's a real shame because the original had such amazing voice acting in it, and wonderful singing. They switched voice actors in the song ""be prepared"" and I can't at all tell. That's how amazing the voice acting is in the original. In this movie however it seems like every ten minutes I'm cringing due to a bad take.
This movie doesn't have to exist, and it shouldn't. It's the exact same thing as the original but so much worse. Everytime I watch this movie I discover something new about the film that makes it worse. That to me is the true mark of a terrible film. Don't watch this movie just stick to the original. If you do want a different experience of the lion king however, watch the on stage play. I promise you the play has a lot more effort and is a much better experience than this. This movie sucks",The Lion King

At least I found Aladdin enjoyable, and what I liked the most is that they knew there were things that work for cartoons and not for live action, and vice-versa.
Lion King is all the same: same songs, same story fluency, same dialog, even same f** jokes. Great CGI wasted for a soulless money thirst production.
If it has to bee funny, if it has to be tense, you can't feel that because they didn't do what Aladdin at least tried: adapt some scenes for the big screen.Oh, and if this is too much, this is the first movie that made me feel sleepy for the first time in my whole life and approach with cinema.
I gave it too much score because the only thing great about it, is it's CGI. Astonishing!",The Lion King

1114,The CyberHippie,What's with the haters?,8,1 November 2019,"After reading some of the top listed reviews here I was almost reluctant to watch the movie. I don't understand the criticism. Of course you're not going to get the same expressiveness in a photo-realistic animal character that you would from a cartoon, nor should one expect that. But this movie has much of the charm of the original in the story telling combined with CG artistry that is absolutely stunning.
This movie should be accepted at face value and not compared to the cartoon from which it was based. It has it's own magic. The incredible effort put into the graphics was not lost on me, the animators didn't get a hair or blade of grass out of place. The music score was better in the original, but that was a high bar to clear, but overall this movie should not be missed.",The Lion King

1116,grimlock6666,Success does not equal a good film.,5,4 July 2021,"I went into this film with an open mind and I tried to give it a chance. Unfortunately, it felt like I was watching something where there was some good in there, but it was overwhelmed by a large supply of mediocrity.On the positive side, I like how Shenzi in particular was portrayed, going from just one part of a three character comedy act to being not only the head of the pack, but also being genuinely intimidating. I also felt that the background music managed to capture the emotions their scenes were meant to convey, just like the original film.Unfortunately, this is where my positives end. I thought most of the voice acting lacked any real energy and that the actors were either going through the motions or just seemed really tired. This problem shines most brightly during the songs, in particular ""Be Prepared"" which felt like it had all of its' power and terror striped away in favor of a lifeless reading of the lyrics. The animation also lacked any real expressions or personality on any of the lion's faces, as if I were watching a National Geographic documentary and someone decided to dub their voice over the lion's mouth movements.If anyone else liked this movie or their kids liked this movie, fine, I'm not going to crush another person's enjoyment of a film, but for me, this just wasn't as good as it could have been and it feels like a lot of wasted potential.",The Lion King

So beautiful and real with just as much heart and soul as the original. I don't think I have seen something more visually spectacular on the screen since Avatar. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show and brought so many laughs (again) to what can be a sad and very real reality that we can all relate to as life.

1123,L_Gabriel,"If this version is your first time watching The Lion King, you will not understand the ones who love the first Lion King from 94.",2,9 September 2019,"This was a great opportunity for the movie makers to capture the magic from the original Lion King from 94 in CGI quality and better overall screen technology. Instead, they had a need to make so many unnecessary changes which completely destroyed this version. Why so many changes? Because they wanted to make something new? Because they wanted to create something original? What a waste. Nothing compares to the original, nothing new was needed!
Many times I got disappointed, when I thought a scene would be exactly as I remember from the original. They took out the best parts. There is only 20% of Rafiki's personality left in this movie. Rafiki is supposed to be a naughty, funny monkey who slaps Simba on the head with a stick when he is teaching Simba a lesson. Even the part where Mufasa is talking to Simba from the clouds, they have taken out the most important sentences he said in the original. Scar's singing is laughable, overacting trying to be the villain. And for Zazu....only Rowan Atkinson can do Zazu!
And why Beyonce? This definitely had to be someone else. Beyonce's well known voice is completely changing the vibe over this movie. The best role and voice go to Mufasa, yes from the original, they got 1 thing right.",The Lion King

1126,brenicole16,Not as good as the animated version but still worth watching,8,11 August 2019,"The visuals of this movie were stunning. The beginning nearly exact as the animated version. It was done beautifully and I felt most of the actors did a great job. Timon and Pumba were very funny in this one, same with the hyenas. Donald Glover had a nice voice for Simba. James Earl Jones as of course good. Chiwetel Ejiofor did excellent as Scar and I feel like Scar is even scarier in this version. A lot of people I noticed on here seem to hate Beyoncé and are saying the movie was all about her and calling it The Lion Queen.... I honestly don't know what movie these people were watching there was only a couple of extra scenes of Nala that weren't in the original and honestly don't last that long. The other scenes she's with Simba just like in the original. They added a snippet of Beyonce's song ""Spirit"" in one scene but it's not like it's played through out the whole movie. And of course Beyoncé and Donald Glover sing ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" and I will say, for me, it was nothing extraordinary but both are obviously talented singers so it wasn't bad. I'm not a Beyoncé fan at all and maybe someone better could have been casted BUT I feel like some of these people in the reviews are weirdly obsessed with Beyoncé and are wrongly bashing the entire film simply cause they don't like her. It's honestly not that bad! One thing I do agree on is there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of emotion in some of the actors voices and that is unfortunate but overall this movie is done well and if you're truly a fan of the original you should give this version a try.",The Lion King

Exceptional achievement and if I could rate the movie on this alone is would get 10 out of 10 but the rest of the movie has to be taking into consideration. Which was awful. Beyoncé was cast because of her popularity not for her credibility as an actor especially a voice actor.So pleased that James Earl Jones was back, his voice is amazing and fits his role perfectly. Other than him the actors seemed to lack emotion or any sense of pride in what they were doing.This is remake of one of the most beloved movies of all time, so you'd think they would have wanted to reach the mark the previous film reached if not better it.Everyone involved seemed to think the cgi alone would make this film amazing.

1131,danishputhiyeth,A remake that is truthful to the original.,9,23 July 2019,"I rarely review on imdb. But seeing all the negative reviews here, I felt like I should review this movie. First of all I'm a huge fan of the original animation movie. I watched it after being an adult. So I don't have any childhood nostalgia attached with it. Still its one of the best movies I ever watched. I love all the songs and listen to the soundtrack often. So I was waiting for this remake ever since it has been announced. The early mixed response from critics made me a little scared, but I saw it on the first day itself. It was a mindblowing experience. The visualization of many of my favorite songs in live action (CGI) was amazing. Such a beautiful movie. I liked it so much. Its true that this is not a perfect movie. The animals lacks expression as in animation. It is totally acceptable since the filmmakers want the movie to be as realistic as possible. This lack of expression lost movie's soul in some scenes like Mufasa's death scene which was the best scene of the original animation. But I still think this movie doesn't deserve all the hate it is getting. It was a good movie as its own when original is not considered. One think I can say, it stayed truthful to the original. The cast including James Earl, Donald Glover, Beyonce, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, etc did an incredible job. Jon Faveruo's direction was good too. Overall an amazing film.",The Lion King

1133,jarleatjelland,People are beeing dramatic.,7,25 October 2020,"I love the original and still feel it's superior in most ways. But people giving this movie less than 4/10 are mostly beeing dramatic.I give it 6.5 maybe 7 out of 10.First the cons:
the dramatic moments wich were so impactfull in the original feels rushed at times, like the father/son moments and mufasas death felt going by a tad too fast and didn't hit home in the same way.as many say, the animals are just too real, robbing them of human emotions wich are so important in a story like this. They should have found a middleyway wich still had some cartoon elements and facial expressions.they didn't make the song as epic because of the realism holding them back. Scars song really suffer.why couldn't they make scars mane black like the original?Positives:
+ the work put into making this movie is impressive, fantastic workmanship.
+ some scenes really shines when it looks ""real"", like the intro and when simba is introduced to timon/pumbas home.
+ the story and scenery are epic.
+ some of the songs are still really good.
+ great and intense final battle.
+ some new humor thats keeps it fresh.

Don't get me wrong, it looks amazing. The cgi is superb and it's a beautiful film. I'm 100% okay with them changing up some dialogue and adding more stuff, I didn't want just a reskin. Where this movie bombs is either the choice of voice actors or their performances. Zazu was annoying in the extreme and what should have been the most emotional parts of the story were bland at best. There was no feeling in the voices and they sounded very monotone. Completely ruined what could've been a great film.",The Lion King
1135,popadopalous,Good - Basically the Original With New Graphics and Mild Variation,8,20 July 2019,"Overall, a good movie. It follows the original very closely, at times almost scene-for-scene and line-for-line with little variation. So at times, especially in the first half, you feel like you're basically watching the original Lion King with just different graphics. (So don't expect big differences.) The graphics are very good, probably the best CGI ever produced. However, the characters can't express emotion strongly (as they are realistic animals) so it often feels quite dry. Partially due to this, most original characters have a little stronger of personalities. Most new characters are very similar to their original counterparts, but the hyenas are very different. I like most of the original characters more personally, although I favor the new Scar. The song scenes are undoubtedly much better in the original. Overall, it really doesn't add new value to the original, but even if just being different in graphics with mild variation, I still enjoyed re-experiencing a classic movie in a new way. 8/10",The Lion King

I've watched it dozens of times; it is definitely in my top 5 favorite animated movies of all time. I went in to the 2019 version with very low expectations and while this is nowhere near the original, I think I'm just surprised that disney did not completely ruin this film for me. The pros:1. The visual and CGI is perfect. No complaints there.2. Disney did not deviate from the original. If they had strayed too far from the 1994 version, they really couldn't call it The Lion King.3. Most of the songs were palatableThe cons:1. With the exception of Mufasa, Timón and pumbaa, the voice actors were incredibly subpar. There was very little emotion, almost like you could tell they were reading. Some of the lines felt rushed and empty.2. Beyoncé. I cringed every time I heard her voice. She's just not a good actress and literally the worst person they could have found to play Nala. And the songs she sang for the movie? Very forgettable. I could have possibly given the movie a higher score if she hadn't ruined it.3. Beyoncé.

It's true that it seems the characters don't seem as physically and emotionally strong and wild with their facial expressions and body language. Nevertheless, that was a cartoon. This is not. I believe this movie is not meant to be the same. Therefore, I am looking at this movie for its value and not in comparison to the original. In fact, it is meant to be a bit more reserved and lifelike. I love that the characters look more real and act more like they would if the animal could talk. Having said that, I agree my mind stepped out of the movie, as I was tripped up on the acting of one of the characters and a few other issues. And, there were a couple of scenes (as part of the story) that were pretty disturbing.
Yes, I know there is always a tragedy and a villain. Not saying there shouldn't be. Just with the more true to life artistry, they seemed more realistic. At any rate, James Earl Jones was, of course, amazing! Moreover, I lost myself in the spectacular scenery and authenticity of the animals. To me, a sign of a good movie is when you feel like you are there. ... I felt like I was there!",The Lion King

My main concern was that the animals showed no emotion at ALL. I know Disney could've spent time on it, but in the end it's a obvious cash grab. If the animals showed true emotions, and if even the voice actors tried a bit more. This movie would've been a 10/10 for me.",The Lion King
1149,christopherpenn,Good Movie,8,28 July 2019,I cried the first time I watch The Lion King. It was an amazing animation movie in 1994. This remake was good. But I like the animation more. I think it's hard not to be disappointed in the movie some when you have exceptions from the first film. I wasn't happy with the fact that some parts were left out from the original and some parts were altered. I'm not sure why. I feel like most of the deep emotions from the original were not found in this movie. Good job though. Wish the cast was all the same. Music lacked depth too.,The Lion King

It's such a pitty that the voice acting is below average for most of the characters. It sounded like people reading a story book to children instead of actual actors.

And having to listen to Beyoncé kill one of my favourite songs (can you feel the love tonight) was really quite disheartening. It's strange how one can 'feel' more towards a cartoon than one can feel for an (undeniably cute) CGI lion cub. I still cry watching the original even after seeing it dozens of times since childhood. In this, I couldn't wait to get out of the cinema.",The Lion King
1155,nintendo-60208,"Nice Visuals, Lazy Writting.",6,2 August 2019,"First off, I want to say that the original Lion King was an absolute masterpiece. Some of the most interesting animated films Disney has ever made. Even up to this day, this film is still considered to be a classic, which begs the question, why does this reboot exist?The Lion King reboot is nothing but a tired, lazy film that totally misses everything that made the original so enjoyable. Let me start by saying that the visuals in this film are really good. The Cgi was so good that all the animals looked like they were actually there. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.While the cgi does look great, none of the characters express any emotion. They all just have that blank stare on their faces. A perfect example would be Mufasa's death. No emotion what so ever. Most of the songs in this film is like the original, but what disappointed me was the ""Be Prepared"" song. I don't know why they shorten it.Now the acting. I'm glad James Earl Jones reprised his role as Mufasa, but he just sound tired with the script. Donald Glover as Adult Simba wasn't too bad. Timon and Pumba are the highlight of this movie. Whenever they were on screen, the put a smile on my face. Now Nala. Oh boy. Beyonce was a poor casting choice for Nala. I just didn't find her convincing like the original.As for the dialogue, most of it is just word for word from the original, which makes the film lackluster. It doesn't try to make anything new. At least the Aladdin reboot tried to follow the story while offering something new.Overall, the movie is visually good, but the script was lazy, the characters are unexpressive, and the voice acting is mostly tired. So my final score for this is a six out of ten. It's best to just stick with the original instead.",The Lion King

1157,daniellepwilks,I REALLY did keep an open mind...,5,19 July 2019,"This is by far and away one of my top movies of all time and definitely a movie that I can say the lines pretty much the whole way through.After thinking about ""what I was disappointed with"", I would say the following:1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you ""don't know that you're missing till it's gone"". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the ""less projecting voices"" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing ""broadway aspect"" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie ""a whole package"" was just not there.Did not feel the same about Aladdin remake - another movie that was with huge shoes to fill (duh, robin williams) and the Aladdin remake was absolutely fantastic.",The Lion King
1158,BosuHayabusa,Fun Trip Down Mempry Lane,4,28 November 2019,"It was a great looking film but the emotion is gone, the music lacks any of the charm of the original, and the voice work was severely lacking.

True, no emotion of the story and the character, soo flat and nothing. Even when Mufasa died. I've already preparing me to cry as we knew he's gonna die, but then I felt nothing.
And the songs..., I'm expected as good as the cartoon with the great voice, but then again i felt nothing, and I slipped out ""I miss Elton John"" through the singing scene.
And when it's ending, it's ended just like that ""LION KING"" without grand closing, and I was like ""That's it? Just like that"" We don't even realize its ended, as we waiting something after that. And i was like ""Okey, that's weird, and soooo disappointing.

1160,ytpakkys,A Decent Remake,7,23 July 2019,"It's as far as you could go with real life animals invoking animated spirits.
Had good amounts of scenes with near perfect executions especially the dark ones. The characters themselves were just fine. Everything involving Beyonce was cringe.
It just didn't seem to hit the soft spot like the original. Mufasa's death should have been profound. The original fleshed out a sigh of disbelief during the whole encounter. Plus Simba's crowning should have been more prestigious. Can't believe they wasted Hans Zimmer's soundtrack with such B grade scenes.
Really loved the Hyenas' new outlook though. Looked wonderful.
All in all, there's nothing too much to notice here. Anyone who's watched the original will not miss a thing.",The Lion King

Kept asking myself 'why' like: 'why am I still at this disaster?'.It was visually interesting (at least initially) but that wore away quickly. It just wasn't enough in the acting, dialogue, etc to keep you engaged. I guess if it was your first experience with the plot, then it would be okay. I would just buy the original.They missed the opportunity to have the animal be more natural and redo the story in way that educated about wildlife instead of misinforming.I realize this is fantasy, but I think they could have enhanced this cash cow instead of milking it dry. Definitely will not go to anymore Disney remakes.",The Lion King

Next, as a beloved musical with catchy (already written and loved) best filled scenes this version fell flat. Speak singing is not singing ya'll just like ya'll is not a legit word (ha).
So when a musical is made without the qualities you find in musical theatre and it is directed and filmed like an EPIC coming of age story geared toward an adult audience (ahem, lack of fun, and about 40minutes too long) I don't know what a studio expectsThe humor and child goofiness/charisma is not there. Timon and Pumba were the only memorable moments for me (I find both actors funny)-so full disclosure-U had a family member rant about how much they disliked those characters etc etc)
No doubt the cgi was spectacular (all those props go to the artists behind that intensive work!) and I hope they are nominated For art direction",The Lion King

1166,scrampto-24790,Unecessary Remake. Basically a Nat. Geo. Documentary.,4,1 August 2019,"The ""Live-Action"" (photo-realistic) remake of Disney's classic, The Lion King, was unnecessary. It was okay and visually stunning, but I much prefer the original animated version. There were a couple of issues I had with the live-action remake. First, 3/4's of the film sounded like the actors phoned in their lines. An exception to this is the musical number, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"" which sounds like Beyonce Knowles and Donald Glover were actually in the studio. Second, there were a surprising amount of lines, musical numbers, and jokes that were cut from the live-action remake that was in the original animated film. The previous, coupled with the lack of facial expressions from the photo-realistic animals, made the film feel hollow and dull. Lastly, I was unimpressed by the amount of energy, life, and charisma the acting cast put into the characters. Especially Chiwetel Ejiofor who played a very flat Scar (I missed the sassy, sarcastic drama-king version that Jeremy Irons portrayed). The exceptions to this are James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and Seth Rogen (Pumbaa). The skit where Timon starts singing ""Be Our Guest"" from Disney's, Beauty and The Beast, was terrific and hilarious.",The Lion King

The bad points are that the magic was lacking completely, the jokes that were reworked didn't work! Partly due to the delivery of them, the ones that were left out were badly missed, the distraction scene with Timon and Pumba was ruined and Rafiki's Bruce Lee moment wasnt even included.

1171,stormslinger,Easily one of the Top 5 WORST movies ever!,1,18 October 2019,"When the remake of Beauty and the Beast came out, I was skeptical. It was already a perfect movie, so why remake it. But, it was AMAZING.When Lion King got remade, I was optimistic because of Beauty and the Beast. After watching this movie, I feel as though they took the original and crapped all over it. Oh dear GOD! The utter disappointment was incredible.Here is what was good about this movie:
1. Visually stunning
2. Seth RogenYep. That's about it.Here is only some of what was wrong with the movie:
1. The ENTIRE cast (with the exception of Seth Rogen)
2. Politically angry Hyenas
3.The music (all of which were trimmed to about 40-60 seconds)
4. Line delivery (felt like cue card reading by amateurs)
5. The cutting/changing of the greatest dialogue from the original
6. 30 torturous minutes longer
7. Mufasa's death scene was not as emotionally gripping as the original
8. The Director chosen to film it
9. No emotion, laughter or Disney Magic
10. The amount of money spent by viewers to see thisMy wife and I pretty much HATED everything about this movie. We felt like it had taken such a classic, stripped it of all entertainment value and turned it into a National Geographic made-for-TV fictional story and forever tarnished the legacy of what Disney was good at - making us laugh, cry, sing and yearn to watch it over and over again. Disney has seemingly gotten way off track at doing that and is only concerned with taking our money. Watching this was painful, disheartening and just a waste of time. I only hope that somebody at Disney actually reads these reviews and rights the ship, but we all know they don't care, as stated by the quality of this one.",The Lion King

Major mistake.",The Lion King
1175,Herman-43221,"Lost my interest at outset, rating is far too high",3,27 July 2020,"How to summarise this movie? DULL. But to be more specific 3 negatives and 1.5 positives, simply put (if you're looking to validate your positive view, scroll down...a lot). Quite frankly it is dull, uninspiring, embarrassingly mundane. To isolate the three most significant failings, those that jar the senses:1) Without villains there is no plot device, no story, nothing to drive the narrative forward, and Scar is dull as dishwater, seemingly confusing loathing with vague disinterest. He lacks drama, energy or the lust for life that makes him an enigmatic character, and without the dry irony and peril there is nothing at all for the first 50 minutes, you end up with a feeling of not caring who lives or dies. And to cut one of the most famous songs 'be prepared' down to whatever that was, well really! Who wants a villain when you could have a mildly grumpy brother? And that was the death knell of this movie straight away, I was never drawn in to the plot.2) The run time at 2 hours...you reach an hour and a quarter thinking the plot is coming to a climax, but no! There is still 45 minutes to work through. How, you might ask, have they made the film 35% longer...simple, long extended landscape shots. I understand that they were proud of their CGI, but still...! They lose the energy of the film for no good reason3) Lets face it, the animation is brilliant. There were shots where I thought it was real life footage. But lions can't talk (duh!) and so when you remove all cartoonish element, you lose all expression, character, persona, it's about as effective as peanut butter. There should be a happy medium but unfortunately authenticity won out and with that you develop no empathy.Now, as promised, the positives. There is a reprieve...Timon and Pumbaa are great, proof that using comic actors for comic roles works wonders, they bought me back into the plot, genuinely funny with daft acting and silly little jokes, including a few homages to the original.The other 0.5 positive? Bear with me, I actually liked Beyoncé as Nala, she doesn't do a bad job. But, weirdly enough, her singing lets her down, she excels in her own genre but seems to be gasping for air through the big number. It all seems like a strain and once again my attention waned.Unfortunately it all might get better later on but tbh I gave up after 1.5 hours, it all seems like too much hard work.",The Lion King

Not only is it a remake and therefore has no creativity whatsoever but it's also from what I've heard a very bad remake indeed, you would've thought remakes would've been easier to make better than the original due to more time to come up with enhanced themes, better quotes and better settings but no this film did the seemingly impossible and made a remake about twice as bad as the original. No thanks to some of the stupid black people that have helped produced it.I was also infuriated by the setting, I'm used to living in lovely green cool forests and meadows but this film was set in the most vile of all places, the setting especially the desert looked so hot it made me sweat just looking at it! So that was no fun at all and it seemed very unrealistic for talking beasts to realistically survive in such a foul climate and land so that made the film seem like a complete joke. There's a lot of magic where I'm from and whilst I've seen many different kinds of exotic talking animals they could've made chosen more pretty and more British animals to do the talking so that was disappointing. Last but not least, I was infuriated by the severe lack of violence and gore so I couldn't get my love balls stirring at the cinema due to the lack of violence and gore which made me very unhappy indeed.",The Lion King
1178,TheGamingFalcon101,A visually stunning display lacking the charisma and charm of the original version,6,10 July 2020,"This film's major motives are to show off their incredible CGI skills and for a cash grab. If you adore the 1994 version, do not expect a loving copy of it.The film is visually amazing. The way the African landscape was filmed and how they designed the animals was next level. The characters didn't have much emotion in their faces which was quite annoying and dull. The CGI for Mufasa and Simba is so much worse than the CGI done for Aslan in the Narnia films- this baffles me as the 1st Narnia film (The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) was released in 2005 where as this was released in 2019. The music was amazing, maybe on par with the original version. I am not taking about the songs but the soundtrack done by Hans Zimmer.Whilst the soundtrack and visuals were great, the rest of the film was pretty bad. The voice acting could've been better. Young Simba was the best and closest to the original. James Earl Jones returned to iconically voice Mufasa but I felt he wasn't really into it unlike the original version. He sounded a bit tired and unmotivated. The voices of Scar, old Nala and old Simba were not as great. Jeremy Irons gave such as thrilling performance as Scar in 1994 and even though Chiwetel Ejiofor did his best, he didn't sound as thrilling as suspenseful as Irons. Beyonce and Donald Glover both felt inexperienced in their roles.I mentioned the character emotions being dull. This is because the animals literally looked the same throughout. I get they wanted to be realistic but they didn't change their expression. Mufasa didn't look scared and shocked after the ""long live the King"" line and Scar didn't look menacing whilst delivering it. Young Simba wasn't heartbroken when he cuddled his dead father. I also mentioned the songs being watered down and they were- Beyonce disappointed in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' and Ejiofor didn't really sing in 'Be Prepared' The other songs were okay but I didn't feel the enjoyment as I do when watching the original.In conclusion, if you have seen the original, know the story and remember the good memories- only watch this to appreciate the visuals and Zimmer's soundtrack. Do not expect to feel the same feelings you experienced in the original and don't expect to be singing to the songs.",The Lion King

They're going to remake one of the best Disney Films but just realistic! Can't wait!! "" . However, when I watched it....where do I start:Story: In the original ""The Lion King"" the story in there was a good story. The realistic one (just going to call that for The Lion King 2019) they've just ruined the story...
Editing: I know I'm going to get a lot of hate but, the editing is good and they had some pretty cool effects. In the original, it was way better.
Animation: Same as editing. But there's something I got to complain: No emotion. In the original, animation showed emotion and love.
Voice Acting: Welp, ladies and gentlemen here we are.... the voice acting is something different. I mean seriosly they got BEYONCE FOR NALA! I wasn't expecting that! It's just bad... also same as the animation : NO EMOTION! Like seriosly Beyonce ruined this movie! Don't get me wrong I like Beyonce's songs, but I just feel like that she shouldn't be in this movie.
Dialouge: Okay so the dialouge is just robotic. There were some jokes in the movie that I laughed on, but most of them I didn't because how the dialouge was just robotic!I give this 5/10 because the effects and the animation was good and okay but that just does not help the voice acting, story and dialouge!

It closely follows the original with some small deviations that were necessary and propels it from just a kiddie movie to something incredible. No it doesn't have the cartoon comedy or the cuteness of the original but it honors the heart of the original classic with a modern take using amazing technology. Yes it is still funny, has the same story and music. This remake was simply beautiful from start to finish.

There were some lines that I found a bit forced and cheesy at times but remember, this is a CHILDREN'S film. It is a new take, on an old classic. I'm 30 years old and I was so excited to see the new take on the movie even if that meant the same story, same scenes, just done in a different format. That's exactly what they did. Some scenes differ the slightest bit from my childhood favorite, but almost every single scene is the same. Same dialogue, same everything. If you give this movie negative reviews, you don't like the original. IT'S THE SAME MOVIE. Growing up, The Lion King was a favorite. This movie has so much nostalgia, and it's done in a beautiful way. If you can remember being a child, and crying,laughing,and just straight up enjoying the original, do yourself a favor and see this movie. Ignore the negative reviews. I read them all before viewing it, and I strongly disagree with everyone. People are way to critical nowadays. Like I said and I'll leave it with this.

The movie still made money, and so the circle of lethargy continues.I just got around to watching it, and I tried to keep an open mind: it's the least I can do, but it's near impossible not to make comparisons to the original film especially when so much cinematography and dialogue is lifted straight out of it.The first thing you'll notice upon watching it is that it's a very impressive looking movie. Some shots looks straight out of National Geographic, while some are not as impressive those ones are few and far between. There's a variety of environments, all teeming with atmosphere, and life. Everything moved believably too. I was surprised how quickly I got used to this aesthetic.But it's been pointed out before that this leads to a lack of expressiveness. Traditional animation is typically warmer, more fluid, more inviting than CGI, but compared to other CG films this still feels lacking. It's hard to be invested in these creatures when it doesn't appear that they're invested most of the time. None of the character or charm of the original is found here.Voice acting is hard. You have to convey a lot using a very limited tool set compared to stage acting, and trust that the performance will translate to the audience. Not everyone here is a voiceover artist - through no fault of their own, it's just a different medium. I don't know if professional voiceover artists could have mitigated this issue: there are line deliveries here that are good, but still felt flat and incongruent with what we're seeing. Without expression, it does push for body language, music, lighting, and environments to convey those missing aspects of the story, and that could be an intriguing creative push. Stories inherently come from characters, though, and if we can't connect to those characters, it doesn't matter what else you throw at your audience.The other thing straight from the start is that this is a very slow movie. I was looking at my watch at some points, because it can become very apparent what's fluff, what's padding. Some of it felt like it was just showing off the technology, what it could do.When you see these amazing visuals, you hear these celebrity voices, the one thought that was in my head ad nauseum was ""This was a very expensive movie."" That really takes you out of the immersion.What's interesting to me is how they changed the characters. I liked these hyenas more than in the original film. They felt more dangerous, they just had a bigger presence that permeated throughout the film. More autonomy, I suppose. It helps make the ruin of Pride Rock feel more natural, since the hyenas had led their own homeland to ruin.I grew to be very irritated by Zazu. I like John Oliver, but Zazu wasn't as smart, or as snarky as I remember the original being - traits that also play to Oliver's strengths. Most of his dialogue felt more like a caricature, like this persnickety British worrywort we've seen in countless other movies. It doesn't fit well into this at all. It might've been to make us root more for Simba, but I don't think you should drag others down to make your lead more attractive. Rafiki doesn't have his speech here: he could have been cut from the movie entirely and it would have changed nothing.I also didn't care for Timon that much. I didn't care for the fourth wall breaks, he always had something negative to say. Pumbaa and him are excellent foils for each other, but Simba feels out of place here. Maybe that's intentional. Timon puts blame on others and refuses to acknowledge his own mistakes - something that Scar does repeatedly, but it's somehow okay for this character?They spent some time more on Timon's philosophy, where life is meaningless, so you may as well have fun. They also infer that this philosophy is wrong, that there's only one correct way of thinking and that's the circle of life, but without ever explaining why. ""It's not like we were concerned for you"" - this could have been a message like you're not just living your life for yourself, but for other people as well. If those people help you find meaning in your life, find something to fight for, it could have been a powerful arc that brings the duo to the climax in a more natural way. But they don't do that. They're just there because they were in the original.
I did like the Beauty and the Beast allusion: I wasn't expecting that, and I found it funny. For any other musical number aside from Circle of Life which was the best of the bunch, refer to the original movie, because there is a lot of oversinging and riffing to the point of being annoying.There were points in the story where I felt like this is very dated, in the sense where some of the dialogue feels especially rooted in modern colloquialism. It's just something that stood out to me. Some of the modernizations work: it's more logical that every lion would fight, I enjoyed seeing Nala leave the Pridelands. I didn't find her as repulsive as everyone else, and I didn't even mind her song Spirit.But the modern sensibilities only apply to bits and pieces, not the story as a whole. It's still ""good versus evil"", ""right versus wrong"".Scar contradicts himself. He says that he isn't very strong, but raves on about the society he'll build where the mighty get what they want. He also says he's fairly smart, but he goofs up at the end, and it undermines his entire character and everything he did up to that point. He has a big presence on the screen, he's interesting to watch and listen to, but I felt like they could have made his motivation more consistent and deeper than what's shown.The hyenas are still widely accepted as a malevolent force with no attempts made to unify the two cultures, and no justification for the segregation in the first place. The whole movie still ends in a bout of fisticuffs. Simba still gets the girl even if it doesn't feel like a fitting conclusion this time around.It felt like I was taken back in time.They didn't take risks, there were no creative liberties. Which seems... Odd. There's always backlash to these remakes, this one especially was hit hard. Why not have a legitimate reason to make these retellings: something to distinguish them besides the aesthetic?This is everything that you're expecting it to be, and nothing more.",The Lion King

This one is unique though, in the sense that it doesn't even live up to the title ""Live-Action"". Its just animated! It's just a bunch of CGI lions with one expression throughout the entire film loosely following the plot of the original lion king.

Those were the small things, the biggest one was the casting of Chiwetel Ejifor as Scar. His voice wasn't intimidating, it wasn't sinister. The ""Long live the King"" line, probably the most famous and memorable line from the original was delivered in such a subdued manor that I genuinely sighed in disappointment.But am I saying this because the original is one of my favourite childhood movies?

Thought he actually looked remarkable in the end. BUT this movie almost sticks to the same script... ALMOST. Except when it comes to the most touching, memorable scenes, they change the dialogue for the worst.When Mufasa shows Simba the pridelands, it doesn't need to be beefed out by nonsense. The original was perfectly fine, but they've made that scene too verbose.When Scar is talking Simba about the elephant graveyard, and Simba talks about becoming King.Be Prepared song is destroyedMufasa death scene dialogue from Simba, changed for the worst.I did like the addition of the Nala escape scene.Oh man, when Nala finds Simba.... She pins him, he reckognises her, and then she reckognises him! How, why, what the even??? She's been told Simba is dead... and the second a male lion says her name she knows that it is Simba? Come on.When Simba yells to his dad after he talks about the stars. 'you said you'd always be there for me!' - gone. He now doesn't say anything.Rafiki , he knows Simba is alive because he looked at a tuft of hair. That's it. He knows it is from Simba and he is alive... because he looked at it. At least in the original he used witchy poo magic to study it to find out Simba was alive.The meeting between Rafiki and Simba, far less poignant. It was lackluster. Just let Rafiki hit him over the head with a stick... Or I guess they don't want that in there because kids will be watching?? There was no point to dulling down the profound meeting between the two.I kind of liked when Simba declared he was the son of Mufasa. That was one little nice change Ididn't mind.The song playing over Simba running back. Lame. Change it.Someone please, for the love of god... tell the damn writers that the pack of lionesses ARE NOT LIONS. They're not lions. Stop calling them lions. They're lionesses. I literally face palmed. I couldn't take it. THEY'RE NOT LIONS.Scar tells Simba that he killed mufasa, how the hell did Sirabi hear what Scar said. Seriously... .how the hell did she hear what he said. Just don't add it. Keep to the original. The new version is ridiculous! Sirabi couldn't have heard.The random beef between Nala and the head hyena (can't remember her name) Where did that come from? There was nothing between those two. The hyena wanted to eat Simba once. There was nothing personal between Nala and hyena face. Interesting addition, they could have developed that rivalry more... but they didn't. So it was random.Scar pleading for his life. BORING. I faded out and stopped listening. Something about how ugly the hyenas were. Just call them enemies. Just do it. But no. The hyenas killed scar because he said they were ugly.

1199,criticwithnoname,Nothing to see here.,3,20 July 2019,"As far as remakes go. The 2019 Lion King is almost as by-the-numbers as Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho. About 80 percent of the film's shots and dialogue are lifted directly from the original. What minimal attempts they make to expand the story fall flat. In some cases, these efforts fall flat because there was insufficient time to develop them and in other cases the director forgot that less can sometimes be more.While Jon Favreau has been known to make delightfully entertaining and emotionally satisfying films, such as the original ""Iron Man"" and ""Elf,"" he is most decidedly ""off his game"" in this film. As previously mentioned, most of the shots are copied and pasted from the original with an admittedly impressive CGI gloss serving as its only saving grace. The cast performances are mostly anemic, save for Young Simba's JD McCrary and the always revered James Earl Jones.The worst offense is the squandering of the film's iconic score. Key measures of the film's most famous tracks, which were so powerful in the original because they were only used once or twice in the whole film, have been copied and pasted throughout the entire film. When the time comes for the track to play during its originally intended scene, it has lost all its impact because the audience has already heard the piece at least six times before. Additionally, the music is so out of sync with the character's movements that the animals actually ""miss their marks"" and stifle the scene's intended emotional tone. This error begs the question: who do you blame when a CGI lion misses its mark- the director or the animator?The film's undisclosed multimillion dollar budget has definitely gone towards dazzlingly superior visual effects. However, this is a Disney movie and therefore that detail is nothing to write home about.",The Lion King

They did the latter.

1207,laires-ines,Poor cast,5,7 August 2019,"I remember The Lion King as one of the most famous animation movie there was. I watched the first movie a long time ago but I remember my country's dub for The Lion King being recognized internationally, as it was appointed as one of the best.To be completely honest I thought that this new remake was crap. It had its major, strong points and I am not going to deny that but when it comes to the final result it simply couldn't reach the public, generally. The voice acting, the most problematic topic in this movie, was a disaster. I don't think the directors behind it (or whoever chose these people to act on this) were trying to select the best cast for it. I think the whole decision was somehow rushed, or worse... They simply casted the ""voice actors""/singers simply because they were mad famous.Due to the terrible voice acting I think that the emotions of the characters were poorly developed and that hit me hard when Mufasa died. There was simply no emotion present in that scene coming out from the characters. Therefore, I think that people need to understand that voice acting really matters or otherwise we, the audience, will never be truly immersed while watching a movie or a series.The music wasn't memorable, yet it doesn't mean that it's bad. It just wasn't outstanding or close to its original form. However, I thought some tracks were rather annoying and should have been put out, taking into account that some of them were sang by non-singers.At long last, in terms of the final product, it simply seemed somehow rushed (specially on the important parts). To contrast with the rushed story, though, the CGI looked very good making this film way more appraised than it should be. Anyway, if you take out the bad dub this movie isn't as bad as I'm seeing it right now. I think it simply needed a bit more work. Also, make stories matter, not CGI.",The Lion King

While I was watching the Lion King I was getting the sense that this film was only holding about 60% of the potential it could have done. I was of the opinion that Live Action could add a lot to the Lion King, Different visuals and a different style can often work for many new movies from old properties.
I was pretty optimistic that the The lion King could live up to some of that potential, If the movie could only live up to 80% of the potential of the last movie, then I'm satisfied but unfortunately this didn't happen.The Songs Be Prepared was butchered and cut down to size, the voice acting is like they are only doing it on one take, The emotion for any of these scenes is simply not there and goes into the realm of being forgettable within 1 or 2 days of watching it.The voice actors are pale imitations of the previous cast, Earl Jones did a fantastic job as always as always, Buoyance's song was out of place and should be cut from future releases as it was that off-putting.

Not as in 2D flat, but the way the story moves, pacing and all, it felt so flat emotionally. There's this gap, a disconnect between the outlandish 3D environment, the forced natural animal look, and the synchronicity of using dub/ voice casting. This in turn caused all the creative fun, emotion, and soul found in the original adaptation to lost in the wilderness.Ironically, the CG used in Scar and team Hyena looks much more convincing whereas the lions counterpart feels like they're constantly tired of being dragged and jumping all around with no purpose. Truly such a shame.

1222,juanlatove-57721,Amazingly well done film.,10,4 September 2019,"The Lion King is life. Besides what most of the critics are saying, this is a remarkably great remake from the original film, what's the function of a remake? Recreate a classic, and what are they doing here... that , but with stunning animations which make it glorious. Off course,there's nothing like the original film, but this REMAKE was amazing.",The Lion King
1223,wheeler-97697,Beautiful visuals but lacks emotion,3,7 August 2019,"How can Disney completely lose track of its ability to entertain through animation? I can still remember a time when the animators would sit in front of mirrors and perform expressions whilst drawing each detail into the characters that were going to be on screen, it brought to life animals and even inanimate objects. Well sadly this is now in the past as Disney rewrites and undoes everything that made it great in the first place.Anyway on to the movie itself....Positives: Great CGI... in fact flawless CGI. Nostalgic nods to the original movie. Great performances from Seth Rogan (Pumba) and Billy Eichner (Timon)Negatives: Awful and often painful performances. Did James Earl Jones get forced to voice Mustafa? No human emotion.Summary: great CGI but lacks heart. Movie only picks up pace when Pumba and Timone come to the rescue (literally)",The Lion King

1225,james-53665,A decent remake! definitely worth the watch to old fans and new,8,19 July 2019,"The Lion King is an all time Disney classic, it was a movie that didn't really need a remake but with all the remakes Disney is bringing out, they wouldn't forget this movie of course, but I don't think it was a bad idea to bring this to live action.
From my perspective this remake does still capture the magic of the original but not to its full potential, the cast is great! and I have no criticisms towards them.
The CGI is a major eye catcher and it is mind blowing!
Now one reason why the movie never fully captures the originals magic is mainly due to the animals not showing much expression, the amount of emotion the characters expressed in certain scenes in the original made it more emotional and effective but the fact they don't show much expression in the remake doesn't bother me because this is supposed to be real as its live action, as if they show too much expression it could come across as weird but I will admit they could have made the characters show a bit more emotion to make some scenes really stand out but thankfully the voices are perfect so that makes up for it!
In conclusion this movie doesn't really add anything new but what do you expect its a live action CGI remake its meant to be the same movie. I highly recommend you go watch this if you have the chance.",The Lion King
1226,Warneinator,Easily Disney's Most Soulless Remake. Don't Waste Your Money On It.,2,20 July 2019,"The Lion King is a classic amongst Disney's animated library, to the point where it's one of those films which absolutely, positively, DID NOT NEED a remake. But as the company has reached such a huge point of wealth, where they now own Pixar, Marvel, LucasFilm, 20th Century Fox and National Geographic, they've also been diving back into their catalogue of animated films and repackaging them in live-action knowing that people will turn up in droves based on nostalgia and brand recognition over actual quality. That's not to say they've all been bad; Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella and Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book actually improved on their source material, and I do respect Maleficent for attempting to flip the perspective of Sleeping Beauty even if it didn't work. But between Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast (which though I rated 7/10 after seeing it in cinemas has gotten worse in hindsight though I haven't watched it since), Dumbo and Aladdin, they've had more misfires than successes. But this is the point where I put my foot down and say ""STOP"", because The Lion King: HD Remaster is the most soulless of all the remakes to date, and the worst film I've seen this year so far.To start with some positives, because trust me, I am not going to be very kind in this review, the film is a technical marvel. After he managed to create an entire living, breathing jungle from computers and blue screen in The Jungle Book in 2016, Jon Favreau manages to do the same for the savannahs of Africa. The detail that's on display in the animal design is truly staggering. But this is also a big detriment, as the hyperrealism means that the characters are remarkably unemotive, and some of the most powerful moments of the original don't have anywhere close to the same impact, including notably, Mufasa's death. It honestly reminded me of talking dog films at points. Though to give another positive, the songs by Elton John and Tim Rice are absolute classics. But they've all been heard before, save for ""Spirit"" by Beyoncé, which is only really there to accompany Simba's return to Pride Rock and isn't even sung by Nala as part of the narrative. The cast are also serviceable in their roles. Notable stand-outs include Chiwetel Ejiofor as a more outwardly threatening Scar, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, who make for a great Timon and Pumbaa, and the always wonderful James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa, even though they're all mostly repeating dialogue from the original. I'm also happy to report that Donald Glover does a wonderful job singing as Simba (anyone who knows of his music career as Childish Gambino won't be surprised to hear this), and his duet with Beyoncé on Can You Feel the Love Tonight is easily the film's strongest musical highlight. But as a whole, the film's positives are very surface level, because the best things about it, including Hans Zimmer's wonderful score, have been done before and better by, you guessed it, the original. Though there are some new additions, they barely add to the film besides padding the run-time out to two hours, and when it comes to what's been changed, though it's mostly small things, they all pile up to feel very inferior to the original. Some of the best lines got cut, including ""THEY CALL ME MR. PIG!"" and ""I'm surrounded by idiots"", and the hyenas Banzai and Ed have been renamed Kamari and Azizi, and you can barely tell them apart besides one being voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and one by Eric Andre. And on the musical side of things, Be Prepared, easily one of Disney's best villain songs, got reduced to just its last verse and it sounds more like spoken word, Can You Feel the Love Tonight takes place in the daytime for some baffling reason, and the choreography for the songs, notably, I Just Can't Wait to Be King and the second half of Hakuna Matata, consist of the characters just walking in straight or slightly diagonal lines while singing, with none of the vibrancy that those sequences originally had. And it's that that sums up the biggest problem with this remake: despite the $260 million Disney's thrown at it to try and recapture the look and feel of the original, there is absolutely no soul present at any point.If you're considering seeing The Lion King: Realistic CGI Retread, let me say this loud and clear: don't waste your money on it. If I didn't have a Cineworld Unlimited membership and my job as a community radio film critic, I would have skipped it, and I have seen films in cinemas that are far worse than this. Though there's nothing technically wrong with it, everything good about it was done much better by the 1994 animated film, and this is essentially the most pointless shot-for-shot remake since Gus Van Sant's Psycho in 1998. I probably wouldn't be so angry with it if, I don't know, Jon Favreau took out all the dialogue and replaced it with narration from David Attenborough to make it more like a nature documentary, or straight-up remade Hamlet using the character names and setting of The Lion King, or did anything just the slightest bit creative. Though Disney aren't going to be stopping these live-action remakes anytime soon and this film is bound to make loads of money regardless of what I've said about it, I implore you, if you legitimately do want to see this, PLEASE wait until you can watch it for free on a streaming service unless you're part of a cinema membership programme. If we give Disney even more money than they deserve, it tells them we want more of this, and all I want at this point is projects that have just the slightest bit of heart and passion and don't feel like calculated business decisions. In the meantime, re-watch the far superior animated film, or track down something else at the cinema I've rated highly recently like Toy Story 4, Yesterday, Spider-Man: Far From Home or Midsommar. Or wait until August (in UK release scheduling) for films like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Blinded by the Light or Crawl. Sure, they're not entirely family-friendly, but you'll probably have a more stimulating cinema-going experience (and having already seen Blinded by the Light through a secret screening, I can say it's absolutely worth watching). Or find something you've never seen before to watch at home on DVD or Blu-Ray or on a streaming service. Do anything but support what's easily the most creatively bankrupt film I've seen in a long time. But at least this'll be the only bad film about singing felines I have to deal with this year. Oh wait, Cats is out in December.",The Lion King

Definitely a remake we didn't need.",The Lion King
1230,petershenry,A sad disappointment with no real Purpose,3,13 October 2019,"Positives first. Seth Rogen is nice addition to the voice cast and is actually very funny with the way he delivers his lines, especially paired with Billy Eichner's Timmone. Visually speaking a lot effort was clearly put into this film by visual effects artists that deserve a lot of credit. However, the visual effects are also to the movies detriment, which i will get into.
moving away from positives lets say that there is no soul to this film. To talk about this movie i will compare it to the original because after all it is a re-make. I see it to be completely fair to hold it to the high standard previously set by the 1994 Classic.
Most notably about this re-make is the new visuals that look great, but hinder the movie completely. Because of the life like animal effects no emotion is felt in any of the characters faces. In fact they come across as soulless for the entire run-time. So we as the audience rely heavily on the voice cast to carry emotions, which they do not do very well. Donald Glover is actually the weakest link in this movie with no feeling at all in his performance, same goes for Beyonce. Which is truly a shame as they are incredibly talented individuals, Another issue to find with this film is how dull and boring the musical numbers now look. ""Be prepared is not only shortened in length but is just Scar climbing a rock. ""I just can't wait to be king"" is just a lot of animals running through a large puddle. gone are the vibrant colours and visuals of the first movie, there was no heart in these musical sequences. The fantastical,animation from 1994 is completely lost and not replaced with anything worth while or fun. In fact there is nothing fun with this new 2019 re-make.
There is no real passion to be felt behind this film, there is no feeling that Jon Favreau (who i personally think is wonderfully talented) wanted to make Lion King movie. This film exists purely to make money, which it has so we shall be treated to more wonderfully dull Disney re-makes. If i could sum up this film i would describe it as a time vampire.
Overall if you want to watch a fun film about musical Lions watch Lion King 1994 or why not even Lion King 2: Simba's Pride.",The Lion King

It sounds like they're just reading their lines from a piece of paper and making no effort at all. And the actors that are actually trying just come across like cheap imitations of the original. But even if this wasn't a remake and it was an original film it still wouldn't be good.Years from now everyone will just forget this version exists.

Its phenomenal song and magical moment should be started with something more ""enchanted"" I would say. Went through the movie and then the scene when ""Rafiki had a vision about Simba, with bugs, worms and fireflies"", suddenly I realized that this particular scene should be the opening scene for the movie before the song. I believe this is the huge error and Walt Disney definitely messed-up the production, because the scene itself is not relevant to be placed after the song and doesn't add-up with the rest of story-lines.I just couldn't believe such mistake happened at the level of Walt Disney. Many people said that the movie should be spotless mirror of previous edition, and I think such perspective only goes to people with no imagination. I believe there are many ways to tell a story or we could say ""repack the product"", but to allow such mistake are just dropping the standard and excitement after all of these hypes.Sorry guys, just because all the high-techs and the hype doesn't mean we should just ignore the logic of the story-telling.

1256,proven_b_envied,Disney's Missed opportunities,2,2 August 2019,"This is my first movie review and I have very mixed emotions about this film. I understand that this is a film that several people worked tirelessly on and that it took a lot of their time, energy and passion into making this film. Expectations were already extremely high for this.Pros: The stars of this film were the animators, the folly artists, the art department, the sound department etc. The ""real life"" animation was very appealing. The animators worked hard to make every detail and movement of the animals as life like as they could and how they drew from real life animal interactions. All of the people who worked hard to create this film deserve a lot of credit for their hard work. They should have been the ones promoting this film.Cons: I have the same reactions as others here so I won't repeat what they have said but:When I was younger and would watch a Disney or any animated film, my family and I would see a movie based on its story and the characters. We didn't know famous actors as children and we didn't care if one particular actor was in an animated movie or not. I still think that this rings true for my children today. They know of actors but they do not care who's in the film. Disney and other studios are choosing actors based on who they are rather than finding a better fit. As an adult I know who the actors are in this film and because I know who the actors are it took away from my experience. You can recognize their voices and reference them to another film/tv show/ etc. While all of the actors in this film are talented I believe in giving other actors an opportunity to showcase their talents and Disney like other studios continues to help make wealthy actors even wealthier. I think I would have focused more on the storyline had it been different from the first one if the animation had more facial expressions and if the actors were completely new. Furthermore Disney could have created more speaking roles for this film to add new character development and again give other an opportunity at employment. Disney makes a lot of money and as an adult I'm tired of feeling forced to watch a film with a certain actor or group of actors because of who they are. I think the enjoyment of movies for myself and family has been taken away over the years because Hollywood continues to use the same group of actors over and over again. Like in the Lion King the Lions of the film mattered more than the humble giraffe.",The Lion King

Scar I kind of liked until he sang (although he wasn't as creepy as the original which was what made him so fantastically scary). Young Nala had a sweet, pretty voice and her voice acting was very good for a child! The lioness mothers were just fine. In fact, Sarabi was great. Florence Kasumba was no Whoopi, but I don't care. She was great, and the change in Shenzi's lines were acceptable. I get that some things just sound stupid in a more realistic world, so some lines had to change. And her voice fit a more dark version of the Shenzi character. That was all fine.I was less impressed by Zazu, adult Nala, both Simbas, and Timon. In fact, speaking of Timon, what the heck were they thinking? I feel like his character was sabotaged. And why were songs ""updated"" to crap status? Adult Nala sounds more masculine than Simba.Yeah, okay, so I only realized during the butchering of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? that it was Beyonce, but I happened to like the young, sweet voice the original adult Nala had and was hoping they chose someone with a similar tone. And for the love of kids movies, producers, stop putting singers in animated movies thinking they'll help sell them. They're not actors and it's painfully obvious when they read because everything they say is FLAT. This travesty should have never been done to The Lion King.I agree with another reviewer that this movie was like a documentary with voice overs. This tends to happen a lot with realistic CGI animals. It's because they lack the human-like expressions that cartoonists so skillfully create. They should have opted instead for cartoon CGI like Dreamworks did in The Prince of Egypt.I wasn't actually expecting new voices or changed lines. I thought the look alone was being updated.

There were a few favorite lines from the original that they cut out so I was a little disappointed. But in all honesty it is a new movie and it can't be exactly the same. And they added new scenes as well.As for voice acting, I personally couldn't see Nala as Nala. So unfortunately there was a disconnect for me. Scar, Timon and Pumbaa were actually pretty good. Mufasa was amazing of course. Everyone else ranged from okay to good.Overall, I did enjoy seeing the lion king in a different way. The visuals were amazing. I definitely saw the effort. 8/10.",The Lion King

The acting alone...whew! Great visuals, but the voices are so slow and unemotional. It's like they're trying to entertain a 2-3 yr old audience. To be fair I only made it to the 30 minute mark but from the other reviews I've seen, I apparently did myself a favor. Do yourself one too. Just don't. Go watch the cartoon one.

Also, I must say that most of the character voices were uninspired at best, like the actors knew this was a bad idea. It's visually impressive, and I enjoyed Timon and Pumbaa but that's about it.

It tugs a little more intense, or maybe a I just forgot. But this movie is also, has some great humor and comedy. Made me laugh and just feel nostalgic. A great movie overall!!

Looks like a BBC nature documentary with talking animals and don't work really well as I wish would, the lions has no expressions and just move the mouth and that is it!Just a forgettable movie!

1276,dannythomas-11847,Very good,8,21 April 2021,"Disney you've done a marvelous job! The CGI is stunning and so life-like which makes add to the entertainment factor. James Earl Jones' voice is as good as ever and dare I say better than in the original. I also liked Chiwetel Ejiofor's voice a tad more than Jeremy Irons'(still his was priceless) because Chiwetel Ejiofor voice sounds more evil and menacing which matches scar's character perfectly. But I think that's where the strengths of this movie ends. Other voice actors like Beyonce, Donald Glover just weren't it. They lacked expressions and now that I'm talking about expressions, the characters like Simba and scar simply couldn't provide enough emotion because of the lack of facial expressions which cannot be blamed on Disney though, because afterall they were going for realistic visuals and lions don't grin or smile as they do I'm the cartoon world, so I guess I can't complain there. The next issue I had was also the most annoying and heartbreaking. They ruined the characters Timon and Pumbaa! They were funny I'm the original and in the remake they amped up the jokes so much they turned out to be unfunny. The last thing where the original showed it's superiority were the songs. The songs sounded better to me I'm the original but that may be just me. So the original was better but better doesn't mean the remake is bad. This ""live-action"" lion king was pretty enjoyable and after all it is the lion king, of course it can be enjoyed.",The Lion King
1277,woutfontane,Improved music and storyline,8,25 July 2019,"My thoughts on the 2019 version of the Lion King:The music has even more depth to it and the songs really deliver in this iteration. Except for maybe the 'spirit' song and the version of Can You feel the Love Tonight (must be Beoncé).About the plot, I was really pleased with getting a little bit more background on Scar and Sarabi. Having Shenzi as an additional antagonist added a sense of tension and darkness which made the movie even more compelling.Arguably the best scene was the Lion Sleeps Tonight-beatbox-scene. Together with the giant nod to Beauty and the Beast, Rafiki's stick, and the added lines in Hakuna Matata, these really added a sense of humor that surpasses the original.And last but not least, the visuals. Breathtaking. I really liked the added nature and insect shots. These shots make me want to watch this instead of the original.The only downsides for me were the Beoncé songs and the fact that the photorealistic animals showed more subtle emotion. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a solid iteration and in some aspects even more likable than the original.",The Lion King

Finally the dubbing is pretty bad overall. It's not a bad movie but it doesn't compare to 1994's animation.",The Lion King
1279,johnlcl,A class of its own!!,10,17 July 2019,You just can't help but admire the amount of work they have put into the visuals and the cinematography. I'm truely grateful that I'm living in this era to be able to watch such an amazing remake of the cartoon. The music was phenomenal. Beyoncé really brought Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Go watch this movie with an open mind. Don't compare scene by scene to the original and you will be rewarded with a truely marvellous experience.,The Lion King
1280,Treiden,Not very good,2,10 August 2019,"I'm a big fan of the original animated Lion King movie. I deliberately tried to hear as little as possible about this remake, because I wanted to go in with a neutral viewpoint. So that's what I did. I really wish I could like this movie, but it just falls flat for me.First off: the visuals. They look stunning, overall, but they ended up bugging me more than they did amaze me. The Africa in the original truly came alive and had magic. This looked like a good photoshopper went to work. And I say photoshop (not video), because some of the animations - especially facial ones - looked... off. One shot in particular comes to mind when both Simba and Nala are singing together during ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"". Their mouths looked like they were pasted on the character models at one point.Then the portrayal of emotions, or rather, the lack thereof. Simba's happy face is the exact same as Simba's scared face, or Simba's angry face, or Simba's mournful face. There is absolutely NO emotion visible on their faces. I'm not exaggerating, it literally is the same face throughout the movie, and it is like that for every character.Then, you'd think they'd compensate for that by having the voice actors really give it their all. Yeah, no. Apart from Seth Rogen, who is basically a human version of Pumbaa, everyone did poorly on that behalf. Beyonce is just absolutely god-awful and clearly tries to overpower every scene (singing or otherwise) that she's in. Though she did get a few unintentional laughs out of me since she's the only lion who talks like she came straight ""outta da hood"". But even James Earl Jones, who actually voiced Mufasa in the original, came across as someone who knew the movie would bomb, and he just came in to say his lines and cash his check. I get he's an old man by now, but he sounded so painfully uninterested.Then the directing itself. Favreau has no respect for the original and it shows. He spends unnecessary focus on trivial things. Or did he genuinely think making us watch how a lock of Simba's hair gets eaten by a giraffe, and then crapped out so we can see be broken in half by a dung beetle, be a good idea? He also changed or altogether left out great elements of the original (I'm looking at you, Be Prepared), and the parts he left in word for word, those were so rushed it was almost painful to watch the voice actors speed through that part of the script.I so really wanted to like this movie, and trust me, I'm not a difficult guy to please with these remakes. Heck, with the exception of Dumbo, I've been able to enjoy all of the Disney remakes of the last few years, so that should tell you plenty. But this one...Basically, if you want to watch this movie, go watch the original instead. Hey, watch the straight-to-DVD sequels; even those were better.",The Lion King
1281,theblackbirdshepherd,it doesn't work,1,11 October 2020,"What worked as a cartoon here does not. The lack of expressions due to the cg has successfully managed to wipe out all the emotions brought by the old one, drama, love and jokes all come as ineffective here. Also they avoided making decisions: it begins as a proper remake with identical scenes to the original one, and then it changes. I think both ways could work but not as a mix, as it made me believe this was a copy and paste remake it made me then disappointed when I realised that some of my favourite scenes had disappeared. I have no reasons to watch this a second time instead of the old one really.",The Lion King
1282,matade-nilesh,Graphics are amazing,7,20 July 2019,"Very realistic but sometimes it feels Disney picked up footage from National Geographic and placed some dialogues on it. That gave away the expressions on animals faces making the humor slightly low key. Amazing part were the fight scenes, animation of animals, jungle and warthog character.",The Lion King
1283,Hotwriter99,I really REALLY wanted to love it,6,19 July 2019,"Ok, the animation was incredible. The casting was spot on. The music was gorgeous as always! But the reason I can't give this more than 6 stars is because it was literally the animated version FRAME FOR FRAME. I was hoping and PRAYING that Disney would do this the way they did Jungle Book where it's still jungle book but significantly different in its own way because that was a slam dunk! But this... they really fell short. There were 1 or 2 good new jokes in there and I give them credit for that, but I wish they had invested as much energy into giving this a little bit more originality like they did with Jungle Book. Like I said, I really wanted to like it but I'm disappointed :(",The Lion King
1284,js-sherlock,Derivative and unnecessary,3,7 August 2019,"Once again, Disney lacks original thought and makes the same exact movie. While the CGI is incredible, it somehow took away from the personality and feeling of the characters. I enjoyed Billy Eichner's Timon but that's the only nice thing I have to say about this.One of the hallmarks of the original film was the music. Somehow, they made it worse with Seth Rogen's uncharming off-key singing in Hakuna Matata, the what-the-hell-was-that speak-singing dumpster fire they turned Be Prepared into, and the lackluster visual choreography that accompanied I Just Can't Wait to be King. They underused Beyonce and missed out on an epic opportunity to give Nala a solo. I don't know how they whiffed on not having Beyonce sing Shadowlands from the musical.Other Disney remakes like Beauty and the Beast used the extra screen time to fill in some plotholes. The Lion King didn't do that. Why not show a flashback of young Mufasa and Scar and delve into how their relationship became so poisoned. They could've shown more of the struggle the lionesses had while Scar was in power. Also, how did Simba get so good at fighting? How did he go from not being able to pin Nala to suddenly beating Scar in a fight?Overall, a disappointing and uninspiring cash grab by Disney. Save your money and don't bother with the theater. If you're dying to see it, wait until it comes onto a streaming service.",The Lion King
1285,terjibeder,Not good but it didn't suck. Kinda booring though.,4,24 July 2019,"Everything with Mufasa felt rushed. Dialogue, scenes, everything.
Also Mufasa had poorer CGI than the other characters.Story wise it was almost exactly the same as the original but only without feelings. I am sorry to say that I felt nothing in any scene of the movie. No emotions what so ever.But it wasn't all bad. For instance, it was great hearing James Earl Jones as Mufasa again. I didn't expect that. Also, Seth Rogen as Pumbaa is really the best match ever made between an actor and a character.There were some pretty funny one-liners in the dialogue which were mainly delivered by Pumbaa. Also the chemistry between Timon and Pumbaa was great.The way I see it the movie didn't suck but it wasn't good either. This being from a perspective where I didn't expect anything.It will get 6 stars from me which I probably will change again if I ever see the movie again which is doubtful.** Saw it again. Forget those 6 stars. I don't see the point in this remake. And also Beyoncé is annoying and has the only straight out bad song in Disney history. I was thinking of rating the movie with 5 stars but meaningless adaptations are flooding the Disney productions and this has to stop. 4 stars **",The Lion King
1286,knucklez_07,Only good visuals and nothing more,6,19 July 2019,"They should have just kept the orginal voice actors, the visuals are stunning however the voice acting is poor and there are no emotion on the lions faces.I think their mistake was trying to make the lions facial expressions too realistic so it didnt show much apart from a straight face.Young simba was extremely bad and its very noticeable in the singing, mufassa was good but he sounded better in the original. Rafiki was pretty good however they missed his best scene where he hits simba with his stick and tells him its in the past.Mufassa was just a voice in the sky in the scene where he was supposed to be a figure in the sky.I enjoyed timone and pumba, however they killed hakuna matata.Zazu wasnt too bad but Rowan did a better job, adult simba was just ok, beyonce wasnt very good at all a wooden performance at best. I was suprised she even messed up her singing it was like she was in a rush and like it was just a demo.Again all the songs lost their charm the videos where just pretty visuals.Overall just an average film",The Lion King

1293,scottied-256-552263,Atrocious Voice Acting,4,19 July 2019,"There is something seriously off about this movie. The visuals are absolutely stunning but you think with all that effort they could give the faces a little more expression. There is disconnect between the script, the voice actors, and the characters expressions on almost every character.Baby Simba was by far the worst. The emotion in the voice never matched the scene. Mufasa was a decent voice but the animation was lifeless and his lines (that weren't copied) were super cheesy and didn't make me care about him. Scar and the hyenas were probably some of the best characters in the movie. Scars face could have used a bit more expression but the voice acting was terrific. I was rooting for them after watching baby simba and mufasa for the first half of the movie. Child Nala was bearable but adult Nala was actually pretty good. Adult Simba was good in parts and terrible in others. Pumbaa was probably the best character in the movie. Seth Rogan did a fantastic job and made the character similar to the original but also made it his own. Timon's voice didn't really match the expression on the character but his lines were funny. Zazu was pretty good and had good lines but it took a while to get used to the animation.I really liked the addition of some of the jungle animals and much of the jungle scenes were very fun to watch. They followed the same plot but were changed just enough to make it enjoyable. The rest of the movie is practically a carbon copy of the original but with less emotion. Some of the plot holes from the original were filled in which was nice but in an effort to make it hyper realistic, a lot of the fantastical scenes were altered.Overall, it was pretty boring as it is exactly the same movie as the original, except that the characters are lifeless and have childish scripts. Don't bother watching this unless solely for the the visual effects. Don't give Disney any benefit from their complete lack of creativity. They butchered a fantastic opportunity. By far the worst remake so far.",The Lion King

I won't forget the original because I like this one. This movie is for the young people who lived with the original, like me. I was tearing up almost all of the movie or laughing. Timon and Pumba were EXCELLENT! All of the acteurs did an amazing job, I had chills listening to Be prepared even tho it's not the orignal actor, well, it doesn't matter to me because I originale watched the French version of the movie as a kid so, and I just can't wait to see it again in French.

1297,Engermann,Just one word... WOW!!!,9,20 July 2019,"This film gave me chills all over. If anyone says this film is a one-for-one shot remake of the original they are either lying or can't remember the 1994 film. As a huge fan of the original I should know. Overall this is the same story but with scenes that have been extented and completely new ones, enough to make you satisfied.The entire cast did a wonderful job here, including Beyonce. I was afraid that her, Danny Glover and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Nala, Simba and Scar wouldn't be able to sell it but they did. James Earl Jones as Mufasa nailed it as always and Timon and Pumba actually managed to squeeze more laughs out of me than they did in the original.Visually this is simply a masterpiece in its own right and it doesn't hurt that it has a wonderful soundtrack to back it up with. The scenes are so beautifully crafted that you can't help but smile while taking it all in.When Mufasa died I didn't really think it would affect me that much since I have already seen him die once before but the way they shot this scene along with the music and JD McCrary's performance as a young Simba had me taken by surprise... I actually shed tears... and I was wearing 3D glasses watching this and really didn't want to remove them to pad my eyes.If I have to nitpick this film I would probably have wished that it was a little longer than 2 hours, especially the last half. But that half is already longer than the original so I can't really complain to much here.So if you feel like reliving your childhood memories of the original with additional content or simply want to watch a movie with great visuals, story and humor... go watch this.",The Lion King

But the movie suffers from the lack of emotion.
The death of Mofasa makes you everything but sad. I have watched the original one for thousands times and it catches me everytime, but this one could not even stop me to eat popcorn!
The magnificent piece of music for the scene was destroyed in this version. I don't understand how they could do that. The performance is awfully bad. You feel some highschool kids are playing it.
They changed the music of the song ""be prepared"" and f...ed it. Oh my God I cannot believe they did it.
The bright side of is they filled up some of the holes in original story and added some scenes that are perfect. Like the scene Nala is leaving the prid land.

And the same goes for almost all actors in this live action version who simply can't match the beat of the animated classic voices.Not sure why they just also just didn't keep the script in tact, Jon Faverau basically shoots this live action version shot for shot next to the original, so why not keep the original charming dialog instead of adding all these language modernisms.Even the updated soundtrack is just...off!Anyway I will take the animated version over this version any day.",The Lion King

After watching this & reading through many reviews, what bothers me most is reviewers saying it ""falls flat with no emotion"" or ""is like an Animal Planet documentary"", or ""comedic moments ruined with slower speech & articulation"". My response to these is...of COURSE it appears this way!! The realistic depiction of real animals is naturally going to deprive any human emotions in facial expressions that the cartoon film displayed, because real animals don't show human emotion as humans do!! Basic common sense in animal depictions being truly realistic...yes it seems to fall ""flat"" should you base upon this, any Disney film would...but to be quite honest, I found the realism quite believable when comparing to the animals depicted by behavior, character, and AGAIN, the cartoon was created showing animals with HUMAN emotion so kids could relate and understand!! Back in that era, however, the closest to live-action we as children were Pixel's Toy Story or straight live-action (remake) films like Hook (not Disney directly) that had no digital imagery whatsoever. Bottom line, yes when the digital animals are created with the voices, emotional expression is limited as they're made to be more life-like (how many lions or birds do you see at the zoo showing human expressions??), and I do agree that many comedic one-liners from the original were not included, but I honestly think this was much less ""humanized"" and more realistic...less relatable for children?? Perhaps, but stop living in nostalgia, ppl, and realize this is the age of realism, even with Disney, and embrace & appreciate the beauty of today's artwork 💖💓",The Lion King

However the songs that make the lion king so magical have been ruined, there isn't as much emotion or oomf behind the music or the lyrics. That was the amazing part of the lion king original movie.
Some songs or scenes arent included which is to be expected for a remake but characteristic musical songs like when Simba returns have been cut and replaced by an awful Beyonce song. This is disappointing.The graphics are amazing, albeit there isn't much emotion in the facial expressions...difficult with CGI.Overall, this just didn't feel like a dramatic film like the original lion king was. It's a shame.

1314,martin-852-727501,A plane ticket to Africa might have helped that movie,1,18 July 2019,"There is so much wrong with this movie. First and foremost: Animation of animals. The filming. But also: That soundtrack. And: The voices.The animals have no equivalent in real life. Maybe they got the hornbill Zazu and Timon right most times. But if you ever saw a real life hyena or lion in the wilderness, you know what I am talking about. Lions don't walk like that, hyenas have a very different body structure and don't really look like whatever they used in the film (dogs?) and Pumba ... just walks like a small poodle.Then: The filming. They should have consulted Richard Attenborough and his crew on how to film an animal. And even Disney knew how to do it in -The living desert-.In some scenes, they got it right, but then the music kicked in. Classics like -Circle of Life- in the opening scene were just dull, in other songs like -Can you feel the love tonight- the only thing you feel is Beyoncé in a sound studio, but no connection to the scene.Finally: Those voices really put me off. Maybe it was the combination with the CGI, but Scar wasn't the badass villain he used to be and even John Oliver - man, I love your show - was somehow remixed in a weird way.",The Lion King

I also wish they'd do more original work when remaking movies, but it also wasnt an experience killer. The rest of the movie is fine.

I am not a fan of remaking blockbuster movies so I can't lie and say I went in with an open mind. However, I understand it's a low hanging fruit, lazy tactic to make money and provide job opportunities.The movie is not bad per se. This version was just bland and took all of the fun out of a beloved animated movie. I am not ashamed to say that I'm a middle-aged woman that practically knows the entire script of the original movie and sings along like a 5 year old child. I had no desire to sing along or bob my head with this version w/ the exception of the Lion Sleeps Tonight. If you have children I IMPLORE you to initiate them with the original version first.My items of note:
*CGI was pretty good
*They knew better than to replace James Earl Jones!
*John Oliver was a decent recast for Zazu. *Robert Guillaume (RIP- Rafiki), Jeremy Irons (Scar), Nathan Lane (Timon), Whoopi and Cheech were highly missed. The hyena scenes were just sad and pitiful.",The Lion King

1324,dkodgis,Misses the mark and is a bit messy doing it,6,19 July 2019,"It's not as good as the original; think of your least favorite veggie, then spit it out. For some, it may take alright. The voice-overs, a few changed scenes, a few new scenes all leave something to be desired. They miss the mark; they are not as good as the old one. The queen lion starts off with a faux African accent that gets dropped later in the movie. The Be Prepared song really misses the mark. The voice-over for Scar comes close but it is not as good as the original which had more inflection and gravitas. I'm not going to lie; the live-action animation is surprisingly very good in some ways, something like black and white TV vs. hi-deft TV when comparing the former version with this version. However, the movie seemed to keep trying to lift off the screen as if I had 3-D glasses on. In fast scenes, the left and right sides of the screen went soft on the image while only the middle image stayed sharp. It seemed that foreground depth was not there. All the surfaces were consistently flat. The color scheme of some of the animals like elephants and giraffes was off but sometimes it was a grand slam with smaller creatures in the film. The animation almost got you there but then you realize it is like a video game. On its own, the film might have been better than OK but it was just OK because the former version was better. A win-win would have been to take this movie's animations and put them to the original soundtrack of the former movie. Younger kids will have a different set of expectations; they will see it and like it. It was close but the little bit of miss felt like a country mile. I am sure the folks behind the animation will see the film win awards but the movie overall was like warmed up left-over broccoli. The appearance might have been there; the taste just wasn't there. It all just simply did not come together on the execution. In fact, it was a bit of an execution of what came before.",The Lion King

Nala voice acting is really plain and just seems like reading out from the script.Also Nala ambush out of nowhere while they were singing, the music was good but the sudden cut of song kinda ruin it for me.The other thing is that Simba's fur had to flew for a damn 5 mins, I kinda got impatient about it.

I'm just here to deliver a positive opinion on this film despite the minor and major changes here and there.This movie still holds up like the original has, the direction from Jon Faverau is good, the musical score and it's updates is tremendous, Fantastic performances from Donald Glover, Béyonce, Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and of course the man, the myth, the legend himself, James Earl Jones.The photorealistic process of the film is spot-on and makes it look like I am viewing a nature documentary for a rather particular reason.One of the changes I didn't like were the changes to the two hyena's names as they were originally ""Banzai and Ed"" but Shanzai's name is still kept in the film.This incarnation of Scar isn't just as sinister, delirious, wicked and Shakespearean compared to the one and only, Jeremy Irons.The last fight scene between Simba and Scar was so epic, that it eventually put a smile on my face with excitement and happiness as it followed the original.Timon and Pumbaa are still laughable with jokes that continue to amaze audiences new and old, they even reside in the jungle with other sorts of amazing creatures which was something completely new.Oh and one more thing I forgot to point out was that the return of Elton John and Tim Rice was amazing to be suprised about for the long-time fans of the original.Still great despite a few changes.8/10",The Lion King

1341,cjessup-92910,"""Be prepared"" for a visual feast, even if the storyline is a little too familiar",8,20 July 2019,"Naaaaaants ingonnnyaaaaaama bagiiiiithi babaaaa. If you're at all familiar with The Lion King, hopefully you sang along to that opening as I did. Just like 1994's animated counterpart, Disney's 2019 remake opens with a sunrise over the African savannah. It includes the same familiar songs, iconic images, and quotable lines of dialogue as the original - a source of contention for many critics and viewers alike. Unlike the original, however, this remake was approached with a meticulous attempt at realism among the animals and landscapes. While the realism inhibits the animals from showing full emotion on their faces, the classic story in a new medium ultimately wins out with help from an all-star cast, beautifully modernized music, and of course, gorgeous visuals.You likely know the story. Lion King Mufasa and the rest of the kingdom celebrate the birth of the future king, Simba. However, Scar (Mufasa's sinister brother) has plans to become king himself. Simba struggles with his own identity as he must come to grips with his destiny and fight for the future of Pride Rock.As mentioned before, Disney's remake contains some of today's finest actors and talents. Donald Glover voices Simba, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter voices Nala, James Earl Jones reprises his role as Mufasa, Chiwetel Ejiofor voices Scar, Seth Rogen voices Pumbaa and Billy Eichner voices Timon (and that's just the tip of the iceberg). And they all (or almost all) do a stellar job in their roles. Donald Glover does a nice job portraying the complexities of Simba's internal struggles, while Beyoncé commands her performance as Nala in a slightly larger role for the character than the original. Their duet together in ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" is truly breathtaking, and while Beyoncé's new single didn't fit perfectly within the film, the song itself is a nice addition to the lineup.Chiwetel Ejiofor is menacing as Scar, but not over-the-top. I liked that his character wasn't crazy or too dramatic, but calculating and reserved. His rendition of ""Be Prepared"" (the biggest departure from the original tunes) may not be as memorable as the original, but it fit the character much better in this iteration of the film. Strangely enough, the least emotive and invested performance is that of James Earl Jones in his return as Mufasa. I'm sure it's a difficult thing to imbue life into a role you've previously performed (and much identical dialogue at that), but it very much felt separated from the rest of the cast's performance. In fact, it has been reported that Jones was the only member of the cast not to record dialogue with the rest.On the other hand, Eichner and Rogen steal the show as Timon and Pumbaa, a pure result of recording (and likely riffing) alongside each other. They brought these characters to life in a completely new light, yet in a way that is completely aligned with the spirit of Timon and Pumbaa. I found myself smiling every time they were onscreen and wishing they had more screentime. One unexpected song from the duo makes a brief appearance in the film's finale, much to the applause and laughter of my theater's audience.Now on to the real showstopper - the visuals. I can't speak highly enough of the work that Jon Favreau and his team put into this incredibly realistic portrayal of the animals and their homes. The animals look and move like real animals, the sun and rain look like real sun and rain - I could go on and on. One scene that built upon the original is 4 minutes of a tuft of hair floating through various landscapes and situations. That may sound laughable and/or boring, but it turns out to be an impressive display of the film's animation and a visual representation of the film's ""Circle of Life.""Despite the incredible visuals, the biggest flaw with this remake lies in its biggest strength - the realism. We can't see the pain in Mufasa's face as Scar betrays him, or Simba's smile as he enjoys ""Hakuna Matata"" life. A few dramatic moments were either unemotional or even laughable because of the lack of emotion. On the other hand, that wasn't the goal of this film, and they did a lot within their limits. Simba's chest heaves and ears go back when he's sad. Scar's eyes narrow when he's scheming, and Timon's head droops when he sees Simba and Nala together. This is far from the emotion of the original, but somewhat unique when seeing how ""real"" animals portray those emotions. And yes, I know that if these animals were real they wouldn't talk, but with that aside, the animators truly tried to stay within what an animal can and cannot do. I admire their effort, but ultimately this falls flat, even if there wasn't a previous version to compare it to.I would be remiss to write a review and not mention Hans Zimmer's incredible update to his original Oscar-winning score. His new arrangements fit the film's tone perfectly, and the new recordings and orchestrations of even the same cues are fuller, crisper, and feel very organic. Zimmer mentioned wanting this iteration of the score to feel like a live performance, bringing in more musicians and performers than even the last time. It's hard to explain, but I really believe he achieved this goal.I truly understand the complaint that many have had with this film's so-called ""shot-for-shot"" remaking of the story. Little-to-none has been changed about this story from the original version, and many specific shot selections (such as the opening sunrise) are nearly identical as well. However, I didn't go into the film expecting them to change much at all about what might be the most beloved animated film of all time. In 2017's Beauty and the Beast, the story beats were the same as the original, the dialogue didn't change in many places, and many shots were recreated (the same goes for Disney's 2019 Aladdin). In fact, several of Disney's attempts at drastic departures from their original animated counterparts have not been well-received (Dumbo 46% on RT, Maleficent 54%). In other words, this is far from Disney's first ""shot-for-shot"" remake, and anything other than that would have likely faced even more criticism.Some would say this dilemma means Disney shouldn't remake their old films at all, but I disagree. I loved seeing this new version, flaws and all, as I have with their previous remakes. One of my dear friends shared a touching story about a little girl that watched 2019's Lion King having never seen or heard of the original. If these remakes are introducing younger generations to classic stories, that is a noble task in and of itself. Does this entirely justify remaking all Disney's animated films? And to what extent should the films remain ""the same"" and still be praised? I don't have the answers to those questions, but I don't mind seeing these remakes as long as they're high quality - and so far I've felt the quality has been impressive.Lastly, in judging and scoring this film, I have to evaluate its competitors in the family film categories. At the end of the day, I would want to sit down with my family and watch this remake of The Lion King before I would rewatch The Secret Life of Pets 2, UglyDolls, or The Lego Movie 2. If that's the 2019 competition for a family film, then I could never rank The Lion King the same or worse than those - flaws and all. I'm subtracting a point for originality - because it is, in fact, a very, very close remake of the original, and subtracting a point for the lack of emotional range from the characters. The updated music, voice cast, and incredible visuals all make this film worth a watch, even if the story is a little familiar. Score: 8/10.",The Lion King
1342,scottrouse-93403,Realism falls flat for a story with heart,4,3 August 2019,"The original film was brilliant, with animation showing humanized emotions to carry what is a story that has a lot of themes running through it.Having also seen the musical, it too carries these themes and draws the audience in through amazing sets and the additional music.While visually stunning, this version of The Lion King loses the charm of the original film. The main vocal characters do not have the delivery to breathe life into their characters, and even if they did, it wouldn't be possible to make the highly realistic images on the screen match the tone.This should be a lesson for Disney that while remaking their classic films for modern times with modern techniques is possible, the journey of the characters and the emotions they are aiming to invoke in their audience are the most important elements within the story, not the fact that a CGI lion looks almost exactly like a lion.

I felt uncomfortable for the little ones watching prolonged violence on screen. I, too, agree with other reviewers' criticisms: animals' mouths didn't consistently move - so voiceovers were insane so much of the time. No eyebrow movement, thus little emotion was conveyed facially. I know this is true for many in the animal kingdom, but this movie was all CGI, they could have given the characters facial expressions. All the lionesses had the same face - nonsensical. The movie is all about the CGI, which they are proud of; however, the adults in the room must have been working so hard to make a great visual image that they forgot they were remaking a musical.

This animals are all blank, nothing more....And the voices... It's like am watching the news - just telling the facts of the story, nothing more..

1350,evpmail,Enchanting!,10,5 August 2019,"Anyone who has lived with felines or other non-human creatures learns quickly how to interpret emotions through facial expressions, position of ears and tail and especially the appearance of the eyes. They don't need silly artificial grins or scowls. All the creatures in ""The Lion King"" expressed their emotions in the natural manner. The criticism about the characters lacking emotion is not valid.Characters were more fully developed in this live-action version, much more than they were in the animated version. The female lions (who do most of the work in lion prides) played a significant role in the opposition to Scar's assumption of the title of King.I'm not sure how much CGI was responsible for the action scenes, but they were executed to perfection. Han Zimmer's enthralling music swirled around the action loud and clear, and he was given recognition during the closing credits in large font displayed on a screen dedicated to him.All the actors breathed life into their characters through evocative voice work. Only Beyoncé was a little off, sounding more American than African.I'm glad I ignored the reviews and went to see the movie. If you haven't seen it, I hope you'll give it a chance...better hurry while it's still showing. I'm giving it a 10 to balance out the undeserved 1's and 2's.",The Lion King
1351,mornept,"Better than expected, however bad writing and acting",4,5 August 2019,"I wasn't exactly looking forward to this movie. I just didn't see any point in it considering they've taken an animated movie and made it into..... an animated movie, except this time it looks real. I firmly believe that the CGI epidemic going through Hollywood right now is merely a monetary scheme. The Lion King (2019) is no exception, however, I enjoyed this movie a lot.The cinematography was beautiful. Powerful establishing shots of the African landscape and its creatures deemed Disney once again as prominent in its colour and design. The camerawork didn't feel sloppy or too fast, and as a spectator I was able to concentrate on what was happening in the frame before it cut away - a huge redemption compared to the editing in Aladdin (2019). However I feel like some of the close-ups of Mufasa, Scar and Simba could have been held longer as this would have made them so much more powerful.However, I feel like the performance of the voice actors was incredibly weak. While in the original the characters had power in their words, these actors merely feel like they're reading from a script without much deliberation on how to convey each words. I also feel like the dubbing of Young Simba's voice was careless, as it sounded more like a narration than the character actually speaking, which is a big problem for animated movie.The writing of the film seemed lazy to me. It seemed like they merely took the original script, and then only changed some of the ""comedic"" lines, which was off-putting, as I felt they should have either copied the entire script (the original ad-libs too) or changed the script entirely. Because they only changed some of the lines, the writing seemed unbalanced and awkward.I also have mixed feelings about 'Spirit', the new song by Beyoncé. While I think it's a good song, it doesn't fit with any of the other soundtrack and score pieces, and seems like yet another ploy to get into the charts and be nominated for an Oscar. I'm just glad that it was played over the characters actions, and not sang by the characters themselves. I did greatly dislike the new composition of 'Be Prepared'. It had none of its power or maliciousness, nor any of its strong wartime reflections, and felt lazy and bland.In summary, I'm in love with the realism of this film (something I was initially wary of) and the cinematography, however the acting, writing and a couple of the songs were reckless, lazy and unrevised.",The Lion King

I had never seen the original but he had.Most importantly: the ""1"" ratings here are political statement. Most of us have known for a long while Hollywood is pretty short on new story lines/ideas.Yet, the technically brilliance demonstrated here is breathtaking.The story line is pretty simple...the triumph of good over evil... but one must ask: who is the target audience? My grandson made comments along the way how the story tracked closely with the one he already knew. But he loved the movie. That is the only test that matters.Before seeing the movie, I had read comments about emotionless faces of the characters, but i saw enough emotion to carry the story.""Perfect is the enemy of good.""

1354,amethystars,It was okay but felt very empty,4,23 July 2019,"I'll say this right away the Timon and Pumbaa parts were my favorite of the movie. Everything else just felt empty, cut and paste and the voice acting was just not there for me. For the most part all the animal looked real, but I felt they really messed the Hyena's up making them look worse than reality. It all felt off, they moved like real animals but not completely making it weird. Real lions in the wild show more expression than the one's in this movie.I much prefer the animated version where everything is more vibrant and fun. Here it was just lots of boring walking with the classic songs that made the original movie great. It was really the only thing that got any reaction out of me though I do prefer the old singer and voices of the original.Of course everyone should make there own opinion seeing as the person I went with felt it was a 10/10 and loved every moment of it.

Unfortunately, the enjoyment stopped there.The script, score and songs are close the original yet when they deviated from the original script it was awful writing. By far the worst thing for me was how detached the voice overs are from the visual. It's literally like one team did the visuals, and then some people put some voice over the top - it was not connected or engaged at all. Some of the sfx (or lack of) just added to the detached feeling.The voice actors were average, including the usually. Great JEJ, who despite reusing most of his original lines, just seemed flat.Seth Rogen however, was a stand out being both well cast, but also a good, natural voice actor.Visually great, but otherwise poor. So disappointing!!",The Lion King

1360,menzoderks,No soul.,1,21 July 2019,"The original Lion King is one of my favorite movies of all time and if you feel the same I'd recommend you to never watch this remake. Now let me explain how this movie is completely ruined.1. Characters have no facial expressions - So in the original if you just turned off the sound you'd still be able to understand what's going on as the body language and facial expressions were a big part of what brought these characters to life. In the new film simba looks like a real lion and similar to a real lion he has zero facial emotion. This is true for all the characters.2. The voice acting is horrible - everyone talks incredibly unemotional and SLOW. These actors have likely been told in production to do so as otherwise it would have looked weird for these animals to move their mouths so fast. Even Mufasa's voice is far slower and less emotional while it's still the same voice actor. They really talk half the speed and have odd pauses in their dialogue. Emotion is gone entirely.3. Clever jokes and small exchanges are not in this movie - Because characters talk so slowly they can't say as much. Therefore all small jokes and clever exchanges are left out. A few are kept in, but fall flat as the timing is off now. For instance when in the original Simba and Nala go to the elephant graveyard the hyena have all these fun exchanges and they are left out in this movie, Instead we get 2 hyenas that are particularly unfunny...4. The songs are ruined - In the original movie, songs bend real physics and reality to give an expressive montage that was visually stunning. Here they just walk or jog a bit.Then a few other animals might appear, but that's about it. Songs are also played at a slower tempo which in itself ruined all the momentum out of the song.5. Simba is unlikable - Before simba flees away from pride rock you feel his character is a bit reckless and a bit cocky, but he is also brave and has the characteristics of a leader as he protects others. In the elephant graveyard he stands up for Zazu (while he does not even like zazu) saying the hyena's should pick on somebody their own size. When he and nala then have to run for their lives nala is falling behind. Simba then runs back and saves her by scratching Shenzi. These 2 things do not happen in the remake, which make simba a cocky guy only caring about the power he will get as a king. In the second half you'll start to wonder if he really should be king.6. Filler scenes - There are a few additonal scenes or things that are dragged out that give zero character development and do not bring new information at all. You'll notice these scenes in the film, but to give 1 example I'll tell the one that's the least spoilery. Remember that mouse that scar grabs under his hand in the beginning? You see him run up to the camera, wash his nose and BAMN. Scar has him under his paws. In the remake we see this mouse crawl for a whole minute. Why?!? Later in this movie there is something that took the original 5 seconds too, but here takes 2 minutes! They're are really struggling to make the movie 1 hour and 50 minutes, whereas I do not think it's necessary at all and they could have just made a movie of 1 hour and 25 minutes as the original was.This movie has no soul and leaves a bad taste towards the original.Disney has lost all it's credibility and respect it still had left by making this atrocious movie.",The Lion King
1361,michaelowczarek,Don't let the 1 stars put you off!!,9,7 August 2019,"I think with this movie, people expect the cartoon style animated voices. For a live action style movie this simply wouldn't fit. It is a lot darker and and less cartoony. I read the reviews before I went to see the new Lion King and was seriously surprised how much I enjoyed it. My wife also cried at all the same parts so it did not lack in emotion. The CGI is amazing it must be said. The new film has some nice new additional moments, but if I had to grumble they missed out the part where Rafiki hits Simba in the head and mentions the past.

Is it Zazu not being caged while singing about his lovely coconuts? I don't know how they made this movie 30 minutes longer but I feel robbed.

1369,mitchellbardwell,"Good the first time, GREAT the second",9,20 July 2019,"Firstly I was extremely nervous about the Lion King being remade right from its announcement. This film was one of my favourites as a kid and favourite right through our family, it has huge meaning to us so of course I was worried it wouldn't live up to the animated version.The first time I watched it I was potentially over critical. I felt that it was missing something up until Timon and Pumba enter. My main criticism was that the lions do not have much facial expression. I get it's to be realistic but they needed a little more. The animated also always make me cry so I was expecting to ball at this...nope, I choked but no tears. Overall I thought it was good and worth a watch.Going into it the second time I appreciated much more how amazing the graphics are, this ""live"" action that's completely cgi is breathtaking! I can only imagine that's how people felt when Walt Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Amazing achievement. This time I also connected much better, I wasn't comparing it I was just there to enjoy it. This time I cried, three times! I love the modern language in it and Timon and Pumba are undoubtedly the stars.James Earl Jones was fantastic as Mufasa again, of course he was always going to be. All of the casting was spot on apart from Scar, I do feel Jeremy Irons will always be Scar as JEJ is Mufasa but then that's nostalgia for you. I do still feel the lions need more facial expressions but I didn't notice it so much the second time.We as a family loved it and will certainly be watching it again, and again and again.Long live the king!",The Lion King

It hasn't aged, it's soundtrack and characters are still amazing. And it had something this newer version forgot, a soul.Now this new take on the animated classic looks visually stunning. Not a single animal, rock or tree exist outside of its digital world, but to look at it you wouldn't know and that in itself should be applauded. But in being so lifelike, the emotion isn't there. The villain can't raise a sly eyebrow, and in loss there isn't a pained look of grief to be seen.The film follows in the footsteps of what came before, not daring to venture far off the path in case it resulted in them being the people who ruined The Lion King. It's the same film, with a new coat of very shiny paint. And it lacks what made the original special in terms of character. The songs are here and they are still amazing, though i found the new addition instantly forgettable.But in saying all this, this is The Lion King. It's in my opinion a sub par version but for some just being The Lion King is enough. There is enjoyment here for some people and people will find it. If your looking for something new, Well this film is an elephant graveyard in that department.",The Lion King
1381,dheevena,"I cried out of nostalgia, not because of the movie.",7,31 July 2019,"So let me start off by saying that the 1994 Lion King is my favorite movie of all time. I walked into this movie with high expectations but also the understanding that it probably would not live up to them and the greatness of the original. Now to the review...I can imagine that trying to bring a full animal animation cast to life is no easy feat especially for a movie that every millennial could probably recite by heart. Visually, The Lion King was stunning. The team simply outdid themselves with the effects. It was truly bringing the classic story to life scene-for-scene. The characters who looked different were clearly more accurate to their real-life counterparts, which hopefully brings our youth closer to appreciating the animal kingdom's natural beauty, even if it doesn't have the flashing lights and colors of typical animation.Speaking of characters, here's where my gripes begin. While the casting for Simba, Mufasa, Pumba, and many other characters was very well selected, there were some notable exceptions. Zazu and Rafiki, while technically supporting roles, had no soul. Whether that was bad casting, not being able to grasp emotion through the CGI animation, or poor writing, these very colorful personalities were black and white here. While it pains me to say it, the movie might have been improved by removing them altogether.While Beyonce's voice is husky enough to represent Nala's speaking role, she doesn't bring the youth factor. It was apparent that her voice was too mature for a young adult role, especially when she's across from Donald Glover's perfectly cast role of Simba. Ok, ok, but she's a music personality. How was her singing? Meh. I felt that Can You Feel the Love Tonight started off beautifully, then progressed into THE BEYONCE SHOW! Honestly, I could hardly hear the instrumentals or Donald Glover, and just had Beyonce powerhouse riffing her way to the climax of the song. Oh, and Spirit would have been a better credits song. While casting Beyonce probably helped bring more Bey-hive supporters to the theater, it was a bad choice for filling the shoes of the OG Nala.The movie took out a lot of witty banter from Scar with the hyenas and even Rafiki with Simba that I felt spoiled the characters and the end product. There is no quirkiness, joking, or sarcasm, but rather a forced dialogue to get to the end. While I was impressed with the rolling thunder of Mufasa's arrival, it left something lacking as we simply didn't feel the powerful connection between father and son. Honestly, just keeping with the original script of Mufasa's advice here would have done wonders for this moment. I wouldn't have minded them going for a less life-like animation to get the goosebump inducing end result that came from the original ""Remember"" scene.Bringing Hans Zimmer and Lebo onto the music again was by far the best decision they made (besides the irreplaceable James Earl Jones, of course.) While they had the same instrumental songs, they also added numbers like ""Rafiki's Fireflies"" that just meshed beautifully with the rest of the soundtrack. You would have thought they were part of the original.Overall, while there were deep feelings of nostalgia, I didn't get chills as often as I expected to. In fact, I went home and rewatched the original version to bring back the good vibes. Oh well, hakuna matata!",The Lion King

Breathtaking.I get if it didn't give you the emotional buzz you got when you went with mommy, aged 3, but 1 star out of 10? 1? Really? Come on!They say it's because the animal's faces don't show emotion. The animators deliberately worked within what was physically possible for real animals. The emotion is definitely there, but like a talented actor it's subtle and believable, blending realism within the fantasy of the story.If you want your anthropomorphism to be higher up the human dial, go and watch Cats!

1390,chrismp-35741,"Yes I'm going to be ""THAT"" guy (with reasons)",5,15 October 2019,"Firstly I would like to say that this film was visually stunning...however....it fell flat in terms of emotional impact and intensity. For example I give you a simple scene from the original ""Zazoo, take Nala home, I need to teach my son a lesson"". This scene follows the run in with the hyaenas at the elephant graveyard.We are all familiar with this. This scene was intense and had feeling to it in the original. Little Simba knew he had made a mistake at this point and was upset by the fact his Father (a person he looks up to and respects) disapproved of his actions and it shows. This led to a special moment where ""all is forgiven"" after the lecture and father and son bond. In the remake this FELL FLAT. Young Simba just doesn't appear to take it on board or show any remorse for his actions but instead appears to be a little brat that is prepared to just accept 'what is'.Moving on, the instrumental musical score (which remains the same as the original), appeared to carry the voice actors through the emotional scenes. The popular songs with lyrics were performed well (if not a little overdone at times with yodelling).I was not a fan of unnecessary changes to the script in certain scenes especially at the expense of removing humour. I mean let's be real, we are talking about an almost shot for shot live action remake but with changes to script???? Ok. One scene in particular from the original ""Hey who's the pig?"" ""Are you talking to me?"" ""Uh-oh they called him a pig"" still makes me laugh to this day. Instead we have this thing about Pumba feeling bullied....if your going to remake something, REMAKE it.Off topic: Rafiki's name wasn't even mentioned in the movie, again from changes to script. No ""you follow old Rafiki he knows the way"". Rafiki's lively personality was not in the remake. Simba never got hit with the stick. I was unable to relate to the character in the remake as it FELL FLAT (overuse of an overly saturated description of a remake). Instead Rafiki was a quiet and wise which was alright to a degree but not at the expense of removing character development.Timone and Pumba - I did enjoy these guys and laughed at times.Conclusion - I gave this movie a 5 for it's visuals.",The Lion King
1391,tomhiggins-82642,Almost Greatness,8,20 December 2019,"This review is made assuming the original has been seen
This movie is almost a copy of the beloved 1994 'The Lion King' animation as wanted/expected.
The visuals are outstanding from the smallest details of a grain of dirt, to the wide open shots of Pride Rock.
The new actors were all great to hear and played there characters sometimes very similarly to the original, and other times very differently in their own unique way which was great.
I only had two problems with this movie
making a 'realistic' version of The Lion King, means taking away key features such as huge facial expressions to falling eye brows, which would normally show a characters feelings/emotions, yet as it needed to be as real as possible they had to remove these features which at time made it harder to understand how a character feels.Also as a result to this having to seem realistic, some smaller things such as scenes from the original where harder to re-create e.g. Scars 'Be Prepared' song was shortened quite noticeably because they couldn't have Scar jumping about doing such unusual things for a lion to do. Another example of something having to change is when the hyenas are chasing Simba away, Kamari (hyena named Banzai in the original) instead of being pushed into the thorny bushes by Shanzi and Ed (other main hyenas) stops with the other two at the top, realising how dangerous it would be to go down there. This is just another way of being realistic which is fair.These 'Problems' did in no way make this a bad movie and I recommend you watching it... unless you have not seen the original",The Lion King

Beyoncé as Nala was a terrible casting choice, and Billy ruined Timon. Seems like both were hired because of their singing talent and not for their acting capability, because they nailed the songs but overall ruined the characters. And why did Rafiki say like five words and show no emotion by two-thirds of the way through the movie?!! So disappointing.",The Lion King
1394,juliano_k,Replicated from animation,4,5 November 2019,"Adult Simba's voice, played by Donald Glover, didn't create a powerful presence like it does in the animation. Pretty mich all of the film was a replication of the animation so the whole strory and character dialogue was predictable. For that reason I found a lot of thw scenes boring to watch.

The new Lion King also made me cry, but for entirely different reasons. It is, no joke, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I give it 2 stars, because at least a lot of animators put a ton of work in it. Too bad the direction was completely misguided though, and everything else, the acting, the music, the pacing and editing, piles up to result in a completely farcical mess.",The Lion King

All the humor was removed it makes it feel dull and bland. I've always loved the original one because of the humor and emotions and this movie lacks all of it.

1402,ramzyb,Zero Emotional Impact - Nice CGI Though,2,20 April 2020,"Disney were too predisposed with trying to make a movie with the most lifelike and realistic CGI, that they never stopped to ask themselves if it would actually be of any benefit. To their credit, the CGi is absolutely fantastic and has almost surpassed the uncanny valley, however as stated already, it does nothing to enrich the movie or improve the experience.I won't comment on the story, since there is none -- this is a direct ripoff of the original 1994 classic.The biggest issue is the fact that Disney opted for ultra realistic CGI and anatomically correct animals, which results in all of the characters exhibiting the same, dull, emotionless gaze in every single scene. Some may argue that this is to be expected with CGI, however if Pixar have taught us anything, Disney could've gone with a more stylised approach with character facial expressions to help sell each scene.It's difficult to overstate just how dull, boring, and emotionless every scene is as a result of the deadpan facial expressions and it boggles my mind that a company like Disney, filled with so many talented and gifted artists, managed to make such a lifeless and uninteresting movie.",The Lion King

I didn't see the remakes of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin because I am afraid they will ruin my fond memories of the original animated movies. But I knew Disney had something special in mind with the remake of The Lion King and boy, I was right for the movie is absolutely breathtaking from the first till the last minute! It's truly a visual masterpiece. Visually as good as Avatar and the 3D effects really work perfectly in combination with Laser IMAX. If you combine this with the great story, the funny and strong characters and the beautiful music/songs, it only makes for a perfect Disney movie in my opinion. I also loved the Beauty and the Beast wink in the movie, eventhough not everyone might get that one. So yeah, so far my favorite movie of 2019 and only Joker will be able to dethrone this awesome movie for best movie of 2019.

Yes, there are nuances that were changed that I disliked due to my love of the original, but I still enjoyed this movie and can enjoy it as a separate entity from the original.

It was fun seeing the characters reborn and they took some liberties with the storyline to deviate just enough to keep things interesting. The music was awful. The covers of the original soundtrack were done well but the new songs written for this movie are pretty bad.

But when you literally change every voice actor except one who sounds old and tired {quite alright, given his age.) very little is different except they don't command the same presence.I do not speak ill of any of the voice actors here. As a matter of fact a few were about the same. Sarabi came across as a bit more developed and the voice is hardly any different. John Oliver is great as Zazu. I speak mainly of Rafiki, Scar, and the Hyenas. Hell one just grunted and cackled in the original and even he seemed to fit the original better.In conclusion, it is not terrible. It was a good use of 2 hours. But all the while I kept saying in my head 'I can't wait to watch the original' while watching every scene play out. Hell, even the songs had more spirit.

The graphics look amazing, they were more true to the animal movements and interactions. The biggest complaint I have heard is the lack of emotions. Yes, it's not a cartoon, but just watch the body movements and the emotions are there. To me it is similar to saying your dog or cat has no emotions, just look at the body language.

In addition the song 'can't wait to be king' failed to be as magical and the less said about the butchering of 'be prepared' the better. 5/10Happily from the gorge scene onwards the films picks up, becoming a lot more fun and entertaining, Timon and Pumbaa are fantastic with a lot of what seem like improvised lines as well as additional scenes that help to flesh out the movie, the second song from Timon & Pumbaa is also a particular highlight. 9/10As the film moves into its finale there are a lot of echoes of the original movie however though enjoyable it doesn't quite hit its predecessors grandeur, regardless of this it was still highly enjoyable. 8/10Overall I did enjoy watching this movie and would certainly recommend watching it to anyone who isn't sure, just be aware that it is not quite as good as the original masterpiece.Overall score 7.3/10 rounded down to 7/10 for IMDb",The Lion King

1439,sholdstock,"Not the original, but highly enjoyable",8,19 July 2019,"The Lion King (1994) is by far my favourite film of all time. It holds sentimental value that I can't even begin to explain. So naturally the live-action remake is something I have been dreading/anticipating.But I concluded that this is another telling of the story before I saw the film. It's never going to beat the original, but I thought I'd give it a chance. And I'm glad I did.The cgi is outstanding. But, as many other reviews have mentioned, the animals can be slightly less expressive with their emotions. However, upon reflection, I think it was a trade-off between realistic and cartoon. And since there's already a perfect cartoon version of the film - this was always intended to be realistic.And realistic animals would extremely hard to animate emotion into. But as soon as you accept this, the film is as beautiful as it is heart-warming.The voice casting was spot-on for all the characters, somehow still capturing the original characters' personality well.Very true to the original in plot and character structure. Highly enjoyable once you accept it will never be the original. Lovely film and a pleasure to watch the Lion King on the big screen.I went home and re-watched the original afterwards. The original is still the best, but it was nice to have a few new gags for Timon and Pumbaa and a lot more fluffy lion cubs to coo over. Since the remake was inevitable for Disney's sudden obsession with live-action, I'm just glad the Lion King was treated with the respect it deserved (and not butchered like Burton did with Dumbo).

1443,Jake_Mansur,Beautiful but Empty,6,19 July 2019,"Although the new visual effects were outstanding and set new limits for future productions, The Lion King remake is just a shell of the former film in its creativity, adding little original material to make it compelling.The majority of the script is taken straight out of the animated film (excluding some new genius dialogue for Timon and Pumbaa) and is replicated dryly on screen. The realistic effects took away from a lot of the color and expression that made the original so great, and although the new actors did a fantastic job, it would be just as effective to play the sound from the original with the new footage.This movie is purely riding the coattails of the original, and proves that by needing to bring back actors such as James Earl Jones to get attention. I don't believe it was entirely useless due to the fact that there were some unique scenes (New material? Imagine that) but overall it nowhere near offered the brilliance that the 1994 film had.For those arguing that ""Walt Disney put in his will to remake his movies every 10 years"" where are the 10 year remakes of Pinocchio?

No one can deny that the animation is A M A Z I N G in this film. It's the little details that really left an impression.
In terms of the casting, I felt that the characters were played convincingly and HOW PERFECT is Seth Rogan as Pumba?

1448,diana-steau,"Disney, WHAT. HAVE. YOU. DONE",1,31 July 2019,"Just to be clear, this is my all time favorite movie. I can't stress this enough. I love The Lion King (1994), but what I saw today was horror for me. The CGI was good, but everything else wasn't. I would recommend you to watch this movie only so you can appreciate the original at its true value.
They RUINED (and again, can't stress this enough) the songs (especially Be prepared). The actors were awful, plain, flat (except James Earl Jones, Seth Rogen and John Oliver).
Beyonce????? Really? ANYONE else could've done a better job, and I mean anyone.
Had NO EMOTION what so ever. None.Missed important scenes from the first movie like:
1. Rafiki hitting Simba with the stick saying ""it's in the past"";
2. Smart-funny conversation between hyenas and Simba/Nala/Zazu.
... and many more.I wanted to cry when Mufasa died, but I couldn't because it all happens in 20 seconds and it is FLAT.Also I wanted to cry at the end of the movie because it was horrible.",The Lion King

1451,tobymacdonnell,Heartless and Cringe Worthy,2,22 July 2019,"I'll admit, nothing will ever live up to the original! That's something everyone can agree on. This film had a mountain to climb, even in the best case scenario. What it did however, was brake it's ankle on the first pebble and get flown to hospital, only to die enroute.The script teetered between identical, and leaving the best bits out. Whilst adding nonsense that had no additional story telling merit. Either change the story ark and script entirely, or leave alone. Don't destroy what was best about one of our favourite Disney films.The voice acting was bland, lacking any real emotional engagement. The animals (however stunning the CGI was) also lacked any real emotion. And yes it is meant to be photorealistic, and real animals can't move their features as we can. BUT, it's a fantasy kids film about talking anthropomorphised animals! Make them show human emotion, otherwise you lose the audience, and leave them feeling empty and disappointed.Timon and Pumbaa were ok at best, but again lost all their best moments. Where was the Luau?? Where was ""THEY CALL ME MR PIG?""It made me cringe, it made me uncomfortable, it made me miss the original. It reminded me of a second rate Disney knockoff, that people buy by mistake instead of the genuine article.It gets 1 star for the incredible CGI work, and another for not being 3 hours long like most films these days.Such a shame.",The Lion King

1454,whitlockitup,For My Favorite (non-Pixar) Disney Cartoon...,2,24 July 2019,"...It was wildly disappointing. As a kid who grew up in the 90s, Lion King is my most watched movie of all time, if not top 3. I can quote the entire movie line by line. Because of this, I knew exactly which lines were the same, which were changed, how they were delivered differently, and what they took out. It was painful to watch to say the least. Honestly, almost cringeworthy. MANY of my favorite lines and most quoted lines were not even in the remake. However, almost the whole movie was line for line the same. And the delivery of some of the lines that did remain, were just not done as well. Voice acting was weak in comparison. If you are going to basically do a line for line remake, why take away some of the best ones?! The Hyenas were completely nerfed and changed even though they were some of the funniest characters in the original. So literally all of their hilarious scenes from the OG were gone. 'Be Prepared' was butchered. Rafiki/Simba scene when he rediscovered himself was one of the lamest things ever in comparison and Rafiki was made to be lifeless cgi baboon instead of a crazy monkey full of character and jokes. Honestly there's too many to name - SO MANY MISSING LINES/JOKES. I have liked all the other live action remakes a lot, but this one missed the mark for me completely. Maybe it was too close to the heart to appreciate... all of my friends seemed to really like it. But if you were a lion king die hard like myself, you will hate this movie. Solid 3/10 only because it looked impressive. Honestly anyone who liked it, just didn't remember the original well enough. Because if you did it was a tragedy and a disservice. Never watching it again and not showing my future kids this version either. Booooooooo",The Lion King

Simba just seemed like a prick and I didn't get why he bothered to go back to the pride lands.Here are a few reasons why this movie is bad:
Terrible voice acting (literally looks like a voice over)

If you would like to show emotion on these animals, you would loose its lifelikeness. But in a way, i think that is the very thing that we missed. We missed seeing the emotions, i think that is why for thise of us who watch the original preffered it. We felt so much more seeing Mufasa died in thw original and laugh so much mire when we see Pumba upset. But all of those are lacking here because the production team need to sacrifice it ro make everything looked real. Favreau Jungle Book is better because there is a human actor in the middle of the story, here its all CGI. But it is a damn good CGI Animation indeed, at times i tot am seeing a live documentary, but again with these kinds of movie we know it is not real and we want to be swept away with story and emotion.

1467,iamshiva19,"Lion King 2019 with soul of 1994 Lion King, Nothing New Here",4,7 August 2019,"Lion King 2019 adaptation of original 1994 Lion King.the visuals of this movie are mindblowing kudos to creators of the movie they've done an amazing job, everything thing looks too realistic Grass, Sky, Animals, Insects, WOW!! everything looks amazing.
the voice cast of this movie is amazing too James Earl Jones as Mufasa nailed it, Seth Rogen, as Pumbaa is amazing other great things in this movie is just like 1994 Lion King.The story is amazing just like 1994 Lion King, characters awesome as in 1994 Lion King, Timon & Pumbaa funny as always like they were in 1994.This movie is a Copy paste of 1994 Lion King. This movie has no soul of its own.There are very few things that are new in the movie, the new things are either removed or shortened from the movie 1994 Lion King. Like the song ""Can you feel the love tonight"" takes place in full noon, so the new title of the song ""Can you feel the love this afternoon"" LOL.
For me, the most disappointing thing in the movie is that is exactly same as the 1994 classic animated movie. the movie is the same but with a realistic look.This movie should not have been done. the original movie was perfect. if someone takes this story and altered it we'll be like ""OMG!! You killed the classic lion king"".Another issue I have with this movie is that it is live-action. in live-action these characters(Animals) are unable to show any emotions like their animated predecessor. Same issue I had with Aladdin.
The fight scene between Simba and scar looks like two lions fighting each other, there are no emotions of the face of Simba shouts NO!! when he sees his dad(Mufasa) falling off the cliff, it looks like a club opening his mouth.
Talking about characters, a lot is taken away especially with Rafiki, watch both 1994 lion king and this movie you'll get it. they have removed so much of his humour. if you people are going for a cut to cut remake why remove that. I know you wanted to do something new but now I'm complaining.
This movie should never have been made.",The Lion King
1468,KalStradling,All that's missing is David Attenborough.,8,24 July 2019,"Now I never felt the need for a remake of the classic Lion King, I've understood Disney's desire to recreate the classic films for a new generation and allow them to feel the magic many people felt as children, and to a degree this was successful. When I went to see it, the cinema was filled with children and their parents. This is wonderful and all, however I feel the only real improvement upon the original is the animation...And how amazing it was. The animation team at Disney managed to keep up with the expectations and surpass the quality I felt a fully animated film could ever be, it felt almost real. Every part of the camera work, from the animation to the cinematography to the editing. Simply impeccable.Furthermore with the technical elements of the film, the sound design was simply fantastic. But what else could you expect from Hans Zimmer and Elton John? Both of whom retain their roles from the original Lion King. Not only was the score amazing, but the sound editing and mixing captivated me, making it feel like I was there on the plains of Africa. The voice recording from the characters felt open, I didn't feel like they was simply in a recording studio reading from a script, this allowed for even more immersion into the African wilderness and away from a dark cinema. It would not shock or anger me if this was to be nominated for an academy award for the sound editing and mixing, mark these words.Now if I can sell you The Lion King with anything, it'd have to be the silky smooth voices of James Earl Jones as Mufasa and John Kani as Rafiki. The South African creole Kani uses voicing Rafiki really brings the character alive on the screen. The whole cast provided an above average performance, however certain characters fell short on me such as Keegan-Michael Key as Kamari and Eric Andre as Azizi. With the nature of these characters, the film makers must make a decision, 1- make them overly funny and less scary and kept the same actors (I'd prefer this as I believe Key and Andre are brilliant actors), or 2- Kept the same darker tone and hired less comedic actors to take their role. Other than this small complaint I believe everyone from Beyonce to Seth Rogen gave a captivating performance.Overall, the Lion King allowed for a captivating , emotional and glorious experience in the cinema. It felt consistently like an episode of Blue Planet. All that was missing was David Attenborough.8/10",The Lion King

1475,ryanerhart,"Entertaining, but won't watch again",4,21 July 2019,"This remake was OK. Understandably so, the CGI artists were limited by what they could do with animals and their faces. Since there was no easy way to convey emotion through facial expression, it had to fall of the vocal tonage of the actors, but sadly many of the scenes just felt emotionless and the voice acting didn't feel or look right at parts. It's just not a movie that works well with hyper-realism.The first half of the movie is pretty cringey as the voice actor for Simba did not do a good job of conveying emotion. He often stressed the wrong words which made for awkward transitions and made Simba seem like an entitled brat.The second half was completely saved by Seth Rogan. Thankfully. But even then, Beyoncé needed to CHILL with the riffing in the songs. The constant riffing felt like she was trying too hard and changing the songs to make them worse, not better. I get that that's her thing and she may feel creative freedom, but the songs were not composed to be sung with that style.",The Lion King

No color, just DULL. I'm upset that they took away the essence of the characters and added these unnecessary ones. The most important lines and scenes were horrific. The scene where Simba and Nala reunite, what absolute crap. The voice over was average. However, I did enjoy the new humor, the animation and additional scenes were pretty good too, I enjoyed the importance given to Nala. They did stick to the story so I'm happy with that too, I just see a lot of areas that could have been improved and improvised. I hope they redo it again because I'm just mostly disappointed.

1483,stargateguy1,An Amazing Remake of A Classic Original,9,21 July 2019,"Sorry for the long review, but I believe in an honest review analyzing lots of details and points.It seems too many people keep thinking this movie was to be more of a carbon copy of the original. It's not. A remake omits and adds certain details to set it apart from an original work. While the General story and plot is supposed to follow the same path, it is how you get from start to finish that really makes a movie what it is. This movie is a remake of the original. With this in mind, I have a few complaints, and lots of praise.Let's start with the praises.My main love for this movie was the opening. The opening scene with the songs Nans' Ingonyama and The Circle of Life is a really powerful scene. It is done just like the opening of the original. It is that similarity that I like so much. It keeps the emotion and feeling of a new dawn of a new era, and the celebration of a new heir to the throne. All the animals coming together from far and wide to celebrate the birth of their king-to-be is a stunningly beautiful scene.
Another thing I liked was how this movie expanded on several scenes throughout the movie. One in particular was the time Nala ran away from the Pride Lands to find help. The original never actually shows her leaving, nor the progression of death and destruction under Scar's rule. Favreau takes some time to show Nala had to sneak past Scar and the hyenas in order to escape. In addition, he shows Sarabi was repeatedly given the opportunity to be Scar's queen.
Another praise I have for this movie is the way Rafiki finds out how Simba is still alive. Everyone knows the wind carries all kinds of things. But in addition to the wind, animals and creatures also move things around. I like how Favreau used the wind, dung beetle, and ants to get the ball of mane hair to Rafiki. It is a great example of a few steps in the circle of life.
A third praise has to do with Timon and Pumbaa. Those two characters had a great relationship in the original feature film. In my opinion, I think their relationship, in particular theirs with the other animals, was even better in this movie. We see how they are good friends with the other creatures of the forest where they live. There were a couple differences between the Timon and Pumbaa of this movie compared to the original. One was the more detailed back story on Pumbaa as a young warthog. The scene was cute, and honestly had some good humor.
One of my biggest likes for this movie was the reprisal of James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa. His voice, as described by Jon Favraeu in an interview, was one that ""...sounds like a king who has ruled for a long time."" My favourite scene of his is when Simba is reflecting on remembering who he is with Rafiki. Jones's voice in that scene really grabs at you and makes you listen.
Another thing I liked was the nod to Beauty and the Beast and Frozen. With this movie being released right before Frozen II, it didn't surprise me that there was a reference to it. After Simba tells Timon that the giant boring rock is his home, Timon says, ""Well it's a bit of a fixer-upper."" The Beauty and the Beast reference comes when Timone and Pumbaa distract the hyenas so Simba and Nala can join the other lionesses. Instead of doing the hula like the original film, Timone uses the opening lines of Be Our Guest for his line.
I also loved how Timon finally got his backup to The Lion Sleeps Tonight. The song in the original was loved by fans, but was often said to be fairly short. However, this time the song endured several minutes and includes some humor with Simba at the end. In addition, other animals came out and joined in to give Timon his backup. I loved it so much, I found myself singing along!There were just a few complaints I have about this movie when compared to the original. While many of the complaints are small and relatively no big deal, a couple I feel are important to point out.
The biggest grudge I have is that Rafiki's stick makes it's appearance very near the end of the movie. In the original, his stick played an important part in getting Simba to learn from his past and move on. In the original, Rafiki whacks Simba over the head with the stick to demonstrate the past hurts. Simba doges the second attempt a moment later. In this remake, it is solely Mufasa's appearance that changes Simba.
Another thing I didn't like was the lack of emotion in the eyes of the lions. While their faces changed based on emotion and feelings, their eyes never really matched. They just looked like glass balls in sockets. The pupils never really changed size either to match the change in lighting.
A few minor complaints I have are based on comparing this movie with the original. The omission of a couple funny lines and small details is all. One is from the original where Scar keeps Zazu in a cage of bones and makes him sing some tunes. In the remake, Zazu never gets captured, and like Nala leaves the area.
There were a few other complaints I have, but I don't want to concentrate on complaining about an overall amazing movie. The cinematography is amazing and the attention to detail is very precise. The actors fulfilled their roles perfectly, and some even recorded their lines together to give a more real feeling to the conversation.",The Lion King
1484,Weatheronthe8,"A great showing of hyper realistic animation, but other than that not my favorite movie.",4,30 July 2019,"Well, I will admit, I have never been a very big fan of the original. I haven't really seen it enough to judge compared to this though. It is not one of my favorite movies at all though. There are very few pre-1995 Disney movies I like. That is weird considering I am a sucker for animated movies. But I will just say this was okay. But that doesn't mean it wasn't nothing but a cash grab from Disney. The same goes with pretty much all their ""live action"" remakes. I prefer the original more personally because I like to see 2D movies, the visuals are kinda distracting from the story, the characters don't have much emotion, and it just seems more original. This just felt like nothing but a cash grab from Disney. I only saw this because my little brother decided last minute he wanted to see this over Spider Man and I kinda wanted to see how silly everything looked. I don't like giving money to Disney for this stuff but I still do sometimes. I did see Toy Story 4 but at least that was a good movie I was fully satisfied with. Plus the story is at least original for the most part. I have missed most of the live action remakes though. Their originals don't interest me so I don't have a desire. As I said, I am not a big fan of old Disney stuff. Nor do I support the monopoly they're trying to make. 3 of the stars I gave come from the technically impressive animation and the other comes from the joke it was to see this movie so realistic. I was laughing just looking at the realistic characters interacting more like in a cartoon. The animation, while very good, is kinda distracting and doesn't really fit the style of this movie. The story judging half blind is okay. I thought the first half was very boring but the second half was decent.",The Lion King

Anyone watching this before the original would probably not understand why the original lion king is so lauded. It just doesn't have the same emotional impact and it's so uninspired. It seems like it was made by the most unimaginative people who for some reason thought the movie about talking lions needed more logic. They should probably teach this just to show that realism doesn't make movies better.

The movie is decent, but I understand why the initial reviews were heavily toward the negative side. I liked the overall direction Jon Favreau went with the movie. He mostly kept the story faithful to the original. However, the movie just didn't have the heart. I think this is just a one and done deal. Watch it for the visuals because the CGI is amazing. People are saying it's a shot for shot remake, but that's fake news. The scenes are basically the same with some different camera angles and animated movement (with a few new additional scenes here and there.)*SPOILER*The main reason why I'm giving this a 6 star rating is because some of the voice actors did not work. Donald Glover is just sitting there reading lines like it's just another paycheck. Beyonce completely butchered ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" by over-complicating the song with runs and pitch changing. Every line went like, ""can you feel the love toniyiyiyiyight."" The song is supposed to be simple and the duet partner should be able to harmonize throughout, but that never happened. It has been confirmed that both Beyonce and Donald Glover were in separate booths at different times/area when they recorded the song. So, it just sounds like Beyonce is trying to one-up him, which completely ruins the atmosphere. I didn't feel anything... Sorry, that's just the truth. What worked well, however, was Scar. Chiewetel Ejiofor did an outstanding job playing the voice for Scar in this rendition.Pros: James Earl Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Hans Zimmer, Elton John, Lebo.

Yes it is difficult to get the emotions of the film, when animating ultra realistic animals, but this is the trade off. The film looks absolutely stunning! It's almost photorealistic and is such a technical achievement that I'm willing to look past the fact that the characters can't emote in the same way that a cartoon style animation offers. The voice acting is absolutely superb. Timone and Pumba I would argue are even better in this film, and all around the voice acting is incredible. Even Beyoncé does a great job in her role as Nala. The music is on par with the original and the score is as goosebump inducing as the original as are the songs. The new Beyoncé song which is added is also incredible and fits in the overall movie and story, and adds more to the character of Nala. Overall this is an excellent retelling of the original, maybe it's a cash grab, but this is Disney we're talking about, and I definitely preferred it to the other recent remakes, with the exception of Jungle Book perhaps. An absolutely enjoyable remake of the film that touched the world, with stunning visuals, in a new awe inspiring way to tell this beloved story.",The Lion King
1507,cece-44700,"Not Destroying The Classic, Not Doing It Justice Either",3,19 July 2019,"I will start by saying there will be spoilers, but I will try to keep them to a minimum.Heavily disappointed in what I saw last night, but that's partly on me because I usually have mild expectations when I go to see a movie because I know I'm paying and if it sucks nobody is giving me my money back.It did not ruin the classic (thank God for that) but it did not do it justice either. An argument can be made that this is The Lion King we are talking about (A legendary franchise, one of the best animated movies of all time) and not some random Disney movie you just happened to stumble upon, yet it does not entirely make up for the movie.Starting on a positive note, the visuals were absolutely spectacular. Marvelous. And I can really say that wearing my 3D glasses I felt I was in the jungle. But that's just about it.The acting, the emotional lines (by that I mean lines where they show happiness, excitement, sadness etc...) were crashing against the stoic faces of the characters. It felt like the actors were behind the screen reading them as the movie went on and I was watching a realistical puppet show.Heavily disappointed on Beyonce's part (although I'm crazy about her). Nala and Simba were basically childhood sweethearts and while I'm aware of her lack of acting skills, I thought she would be fantastic in her role being so relatable for her on the romantic part (she's been with Jay Z her entire life and loves him as much as Nala loves Simba). From her, I expected more. Although, her singing is amazing as usual.Now, I see why singers shouldn't be actors and vice versa. But if you want a singer acting in a movie I recommend you A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga, she absolutely slayed it. Bradley is just the cherry on top.Mufasa's death was a joke. A terrible joke. I asked myself 'Are you kidding me?' Once I saw it. Then there is the Simba vs Scar epic battle. Epic? Blink and you missed it. All the hype for nothing.There are 3 things I liked about this movie and a huge lover of the originals, which is why I'm so kind giving it 3 stars. 1. The visuals. 2. James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa. 3. Beyonce's singing and how they didn't ruin Circle of Life.If you really want a good, realistical, humorous, musical Disney remake.

We all saw the lion king at some point of our lives and were touched by Simba's story. My kid, who never saw the old version, loved the story.
Animals without any facial expressions are cool. Because of they look so real and they behave real. It is like watching some National Geographic documentary but with a story implemented.

Why they messed with the songs is beyond me.The humour which underpinned the original is missing, and when they do attempt it, they miss. Badly. The dialogue was so wooden. Even though it was virtually the same lines we heard 25 years ago, they were delivered so badly.Most importantly, it felt like a cynical and greasy ploy to make money, and because it knew the title was enough to make says money, it didn't bother trying.It makes me so sad that a generation will grow up thinking this is the lion king.",The Lion King

1521,bigbear-53110,"Rather than a Lion King, this is a Copy-Cat King",1,12 July 2019,"With most of the live action remake films, Disney has justified them by saying that they ""need"" to be updated for modern audiences. Now none of these remakes needed to be made, BUT so far there has been nothing wrong in and of itself with the idea of remaking them (although Disney has most definitely exaggerated how many updates have been made, the importance of them, or how they've ""enhanced"" these stories). But now we're REALLY getting into the cream of the crop of Disney classics. To this point, the closest to classics that Disney has remade were Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, both of which, while certainly beloved, were both old, old films and also drawn from fairy tales themselves, hence there is plenty of room for retelling. Today, however, Disney's walking on thinner ice with some of these, namely in the proposition to remake their landmark titles from the Disney Renaissance which are barely over 20 years old.These movies, upon release, were hailed as instant classics: ""The Little Mermaid"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King."" They're Disney at its finest doing what it does best, and people young and old hold them dearly today. But if they're so great (which Disney has no trouble proclaiming), then one has to ask, why remake them in the first place? If a movie's timeless, it's presumably perfectly fine as it is, with no need to change it. Thus, Disney can't simultaneously proclaim a movie a timeless classic while also going forward with remaking it; either the movie's not a timeless classic and thus in need of a remake, OR Disney is just lying to us in order to poorly justify remaking a movie that doesn't need a remake. The phrase ""nothing is sacred"" gets thrown around a bit too liberally sometime, but here it actually seems apt to use it; Disney is sacrificing the creative integrity of its studios (which are doing plenty fine as is with no need of these remakes) for the sake of making a few more dollars. Hardly surprising, but from a creative standpoint, deeply disappointing.Another element that has been key in Disney justifying these remakes is the idea of having live action, human characters thrown into these classic settings from animated movies. Even ""The Jungle Book"" was able to do this with Mowgli, even if the rest of that movie was all CGI. Again, this is a weak justification, but it at least somewhat justifies the new medium, to a certain extent. In the case of ""The Lion King,"" however, the justification completely falls apart and we see how weak it really is for any of these remakes. Simply put, there are no human characters in ""The Lion King."" It's a very human story (heck, it's based off of Hamlet), BUT the setting is inhabited entirely by animals. Why did such a story work so well as an animated film in the first place? For very much the same reason ""Bambi"" works as a film as well; in both instances, the filmmakers utilized the strengths of their medium to their advantage. Animation allowed them to make the animal characters look very realistic while also giving them just enough human features to come across as characters with human mannerisms and emotions recognizable to human audiences. The animals make facial expressions that their real life counterparts cannot, and display an emotional spectrum that only humans possess. In animation, this is acceptable because it's a part of how one tells a story in that medium; people don't expect animation to perfectly reflect real life, but rather depict it's own set of characters in its own particular setting in its own particular way. This is also why in animation, you can have such a wide range of characters in film or television and still tell a story that audiences can latch onto; whether it's something as outrageous off the walls as Ren and Stimpy, as cheap looking as South Park, as massive as anime like Gurren Lagann, as small-scale as a show like Rugrats, or, yes, as seemingly naturalistic looking as Bambi or The Lion King, in all of these humans are able to accept the characters presented to them as characters somewhat like them because they understand that they inhabit an animated medium, where liberties can be taken with appearances and the laws of physics.The animated medium also allows for musical numbers to be seamlessly blended into the storytelling in a way that even the best live musicals/musical films can't do. One minute Simba and Nala can be talking to each other about ditching Zazu, the next minute they can be bursting into song with dozens of other animals that have really no reason to be singing with them, and we as an audience accept it because we know it's an animated setting, where something like that can just happen and then never be brought up ever again. In ""The Lion King,"" the liberties afforded to the animated medium are on display in ways that many animated features do not capture. The anthropomorphism of the animals in that film is a very strange balance of naturalism with fantasy; they look for the most part like their real life counterparts, and they even exist in an ecology which reflects a real life savanna ecology, but at the same time, they display emotions, mannerisms, and facial expressions that only humans can, some look more cartoonish than others (like Timon and Pumbaa, Zazu, and the Hyenas), break out into song on occasion, and even have things happen like a lion cub getting raised by a warthog and a meerkat and growing up to live beside them. All of these elements were critical in telling the story that the makers of ""The Lion King"" had unfold in their film.You just can't do any of this in a CGI/live action medium which is supposed to depict the animals as realistically as possible. Now, as far as CGI goes, this film looks gorgeous, no doubt. HOWEVER, if one is comparing it as a remake of an animated film populated by anthropomorphic animal characters, then it fails UTTERLY. How so? The expressions. ALL of the emotion conveyed by any of the animal characters here hinges ENTIRELY on the voice acting (who is not that great either; the actors sounds so annoyed). There are a FEW things they can do with the mouths and the eyes, but not much; in making the animals look so much like their real life counterparts, they've sacrificed a major storytelling feature of the animated medium. It doesn't help that the original character designs like Scar's weren't possible; Scar is clearly very exaggerated and cartoonish in his appearance, which helps convey his status as villain. The live-action one by comparison looks far more dull and generic. I had troubles distinguish between Mufasa and adult Simba as well. They both looks so generic that it's hard to tell.The songs are another great problem. Beginning from the fact that they just... starts out of nowhere. The bad singing doesn't help, but more than anything they just comes across as completely awkward because you have no idea WHY they're even singing in the first place! This again shows a damning limitation of the CGI/live action medium, particularly when it comes to remaking films largely if not entirely populated (like in this case) by animals. Transitions to singing in live action are tricky things to handle no matter who the characters are; in musicals, the audience is just supposed to accept that it's a thing that happens, but even then they need to be led into because the characters themselves are the ones always breaking out into song. Animation, however, affords some flexibility, and ""The Lion King"" is a perfect example of this.In conclusion, let me just put it this way... this is a bad movie. ""The Lion King"" is my all-time favorite Disney movie and holds a VERY special place in my heart. But these questions I raised don't just apply to ""The Lion King""; many of them, I believe, are going to increasingly apply to more and more of these planned Disney remakes. Is every Disney remake a bad idea? Of course not! But some of them seem at best completely unnecessary, and in ""The Lion King's"" case we find a project which failed as a remake to a movie that quite frankly didn't need it. Sometimes, timeless is just that, and doesn't need to be touched one bit. If you want to watch a movie about humanized animals with a great story, great characters and great music just watch the original. And if you want to watch realistic looking african animals in a realistic looking african enviroment just watch a Sir David Attenbourgh's documentary. There is absolutely no need for this movie to exist. It's utterly pointless.",The Lion King

1531,actrainingsolutions,Ruined my childhood!,1,15 November 2019,What a bunch of rubbish! I loved the original animated movie! It still holds a special place in my heart to this day. But this remake was appalling! Jeremy Irons gave so much fear in his performance and his replacement was terrible! Nathan Lane was hilarious as Timon. The replacement was shocking! Rafiki was comical. The new guy wasnt! Whoopi Goldberg's replacement was not at all convincing. Where was Ed??? Where were the original jokes! There was no humour! No emotion (even with Hans Zimmers excellent scores from the original) Im not a big fan of Matthew Broderick in the original and I thought Donald Glover would pull it off in this...you should be ashamed Donald! You can do so much better...Lando in Star Wars - Solo for example. I should have stopped watching this movie as it was boiling my blood when comparing it the the 1994 masterpiece! Disney please stop doing remakes of masterpieces like this and Aladdin! They will ruin the magic for future generations!,The Lion King
1532,osilveira,Very good copy,7,17 July 2019,"If it is a copy cat on the original then it's very good ? So why would you rate this 1/10 ?I truly misses Rafiki's funny moments. The akwardness of the mouth movements and the fan service is why I rate this as 7/10. I like they added that Nahla's escape scene. Scar was physically a good vilain. His song and his voice (at least in French) fitted the character nicely. That's why I disliked Aladdin so much, Jaffar could not be taken seriously as ""a bad guy"".However as Disney put on an exact copy it should not be worthy of any award nom. Dollars is the reason why they made this movie and dollars should not be the motive of any movies and can not be rewarded.The original will always stay better than this one.",The Lion King
1533,aimeedingman-44075,Beautiful but empty.,4,10 August 2019,"All the emotional resonance felt while watching this film is a direct result of remembering the first film, which isn't hard because this is a roughly shot-for-shot remake. It's a dangerous gambit to adhere so closely to the traditionally animated version, as it invites unfavorable comparison. The former's medium allowed for the expression of human emotion, wildly imaginative musical sequences, and gorgeously exaggerated color palettes that served the characters and the story. This one is so slavishly devoted to realism that the talking animals barely do anything beyond talk--stiffly--and an underwhelming performance from a talented cast can't make up for the mask-like muzzle the style fits them with. James Earl Jones turns in the best performance, perhaps because his iconic voice is larger than life (and can easily live behind such masks). Again, the movie looks good and there's nothing exactly wrong with (mostly) anyone's performance, it just can't live up to the original because the choices made by the filmmakers seem to make success impossible.Most of the humor has been cut. Most of the delightful villainy that made Scar so menacing and entertaining in the original is gone (and ""Be Prepared"" went from my favorite villain song to an embarrassment). Original music retooled for this version fails to grab me, and the new original song is intensely forgettable. Beyoncé is a powerhouse performer--but she's not an actor. Her voice acting (a skill not even seasoned actors always possess) again falls flat, as it did in Epic.The film presents absolutely no good surprises. The only deviation from the original is in seeing how much this new film lacks.It's not unwatchable, but since you'll just be thinking of the other movie the entire time, I would just watch that one instead.",The Lion King

A Remake/Reboot is Never negative, and i encourage more to be made~Would a Game Remake be inherently bad?
Would a Song Cover?
Would a Redraw?
Would a ""Re-Animated"" Project?That's how i see the non-problem of these Disney Reboots/Remakes,
People say that they feel no Soul in it, unlike the Original, but i see effort and pride in the work,
Sure the figureheads and shareholders are Greedy muckers that only think of profit, BUT,
It's not all of the mind of the crew involved in the project, and i know that.I know hatin' on 'Reboots/Remakes is popular, but some people really like 'em!

1536,jounzey,A good attempt,6,22 July 2019,"I'm just gonna go ahead and say it immediately. The Lion King has always been my favorite Disney movie. Thus, it may have an impact on my judgement and opinion.If you're looking for a realistic retelling of The Lion King, to show your children instead of the original animated movie, then your kids are guaranteed to love this, given they haven't seen the original. If you're looking for a CGI version of your childhood movie, then you'll likely end up disappointed. Still, The Lion King remake does a great job when it does things right, and mostly sticks the landing when it deviates.Now, first of all I'll be giving some good amounts of praise to the fantastic animation quality in the visuals. Thinking back at how we used to do hair and fur back in the day, in many cases being simple textures, it's incredible to see these majestic beasts move around with every single one of their many dozen thousand strands of hair swaying in the wind. Everything is absolutely beautiful, and the movie is a sight to behold.The movie largely does a great job at telling the same story as the original. It's still largely the same, with a few (mostly welcome) deviations from time to time. It does suffer in places from the same issue I've had with the other remakes, with the story being quite different from the original in places, not always aiding the plot, which sometimes feel like a stain on the original, as anyone having not seen the originals won't know any different.One thing which made all the difference to me, was how giving realistic lions exaggerated facial expressions, like gasping, curiosity or laughing, all requires a lion's face to do something which is physically impossible without it looking unrealistic and probably creepy. The movie makes a bold move and does its best. Still, overall the characters end up looking very much flat and boring compared to the original. It takes away from a large amount of the vibes and feelings the characters express, and many moments seem to fall on their backside as a result of this.
With that said, great kudos to the voice actors for an amazing job. A different experience in most areas doesn't necessarily mean a bad one.So, as I said: this is an excellent and maybe even amazing movie for anyone who has never seen the original, but if you're there to rewatch the movie from your youth, you may end up quite disappointed.",The Lion King

1539,BiancsVi,A first time watcher of The Lion King,6,6 August 2019,"Based on the title, yes I haven't watched the animated version of The Lion King and--honest to God, I had absolutely no idea about the plot before watching it.The very much realistic adaptation of the movie gave me a weird vibe with a mixture of awe at first. Some shots felt like I was watching a clip from National Geographic so props to the editting team for making the movie look as ""live"" as possible.Storywise, if it weren't for the fact that Beyonce and other famous actor voiced the characters I honestly wouldn't be that engaged. A few scenes felt too quickly executed (but then, again, I haven't watched the original one) and may have needed a bit of emphasis. The ending really didn't surprise me that much.If you're looking for a 'feel-good' movie that contains pretty solid life lessons, I definitely recommend watching this. One thing I picked up is you can't change the past, but you can control the future. HAKUNA MATATA",The Lion King

I don't know why they have to take movies that are already so great and remake them. I think that Disney should start doing new things instead. I grew up obsessively watching the lion king and I didn't get a very emotional feel to it like I did with the cartoon version and that's the problem when you recreate animals into live action. I did enjoy the circle of life, I think that they did that exactly to the T which brought me goosebumps but the rest of the film, not so much. Which was a shame because they could've done so much but didn't. I thought I was going to see more colors and dramatic angles just to give some more emotion to the movie. The music didn't have a fun feel to it like the original does. It was a good...I can watch the original 100 times over but this movie I wouldn't watch again. I also didn't think it was worth the money to see it in theatres.Also tiny thing that I wanted to add, did we really have to see that beetle rolling the giraffe?

But this movie was still amazing, it was basically the same movie, but that doesn't make it bad. It is a ""live action"" remake, they were not supposed to change the movie. This was the perfect way to remake the movie. Maybe remake is the wrong word, I don't know. But I cried, I laughed and I felt deep deep nostalgia with the singing. I am just lost for words really. It is VERY good. The things they could've done better was some cast choices. This movie deserves way better than these 1's and 5's that people are giving out.

1550,danbubford,The Next M Night Smalayan,9,24 July 2019,"Like the great Hollywood films of old, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsnese, and Luc Besson, The Lion King is a triumph to triumph all of the movies before. Directed by Disney, this live action remake retells the classical tale of Simba, a lion, who sings with all the other lions. The stunt work on display here is incredible. Just to get the lion not to eat the bird but also to move it's mouth to talk is an incredible feat alone. Also the movie is very scary. I did not expect to be so afraid of the baboon, but he is. This film will go down on history as a film that was very good. If only Disney would make the Lion King 1 1/2 in this way, the world I think, would be perfect. This film also has a twist at the end like M Night Smalayan. Just after the final battle, just as the credits start to roll, it is revealed that Simba was Danny Glover the entire time.

I liked how some minor characters were fleshed out a little more, eg Sarabi and Shenzi.Beyoncé voiced Nala and god was it distracting. The star studded cast didn't really distract me as all of them were voice actors but Beyoncé was just Beyoncé. She wasn't trying to be Nala. I wish they had got a smaller African actress to play her part as I feel like that would've been so much more authentic.

1557,schmidever,"Excellent visuals, but lacking the heart and energy of the original.",6,4 August 2019,"This movie was neither great or bad. This was basically a book by book movie of the original. The animation was stunning and certainly the highlight of the movie. The cubs looked awesome, the animals great and the scenery was just breathtaking. However, I believe that is what greatly deterred this film as well. The photo realism sucks the life out of the film---the characters are lacking the facial expressions and the audience is not able to emotionally connect with them and the scenes which they are in. Compare the scene of the wildebeest and Mufasa's death---there is a glaring difference between the animated and 2019 film and that is just one of many. The voice acting, while not terrible, seems to take a noticeable drop from the original. I recognized many instances where the phrases were slightly altered or the voices did not say the the lines with as much feeling or enthusiasm. In fact, even the original voice actor who played Mufasa did not put as much feeling and emphasis like he originally did(my dad felt exactly the same way after watching it at drive-in theator). The song ""Be Prepared"" was also heavily butchered; so disappointing. In addition, they also butchered the character Rafieki a bit---taking out several of his memorable lines and hilarious charm. I also did not care for that song written by Beyonce towards the end. The original tune fit it much better. All that being said, this is still a solid movie on its own and the photo realism makes it at least worth a watch, especially for animation aficianodos. Besides that, this film is a clear drop-off in almost every single way from the original---voice acting, pacing, character expression, music, etc. A solid movie on its own, but very lackluster if compared to the original.",The Lion King

1573,TitoCinephile,"Original is a masterpiece, this one doable, came at the right time for me personally",4,29 February 2020,"""The world for once in perfect harmony"" This resonated with me more than I thought it would. I thought that was just a nice thing to hear. What I realize now is that it's divine order playing out in the story. Simba was raised by his father who was constantly attracting or inviting conflict: his brother Scar, the Hyenas, Simba himself in defiance. He even said that he's in more fear than Simba would ever know. His father lived in a harsh, warrior environment which put him constantly on guard. Simba was raised in a more chill environment, found the grown up version of the love of his life, and then became the King he needed to be, not the King his father was. His father was almost always on edge and Simba was raised to be in a relaxed environment after he left. Ironically Scar helped him by scarring him from a life of constant threat and into a more peaceful lifestyle. Then when he was ready to be the King he needed to be. The best of both worlds. Peaceful when he can be, competent when he needed to be. When the call came in, he heeded it and had the life he needed to live in perfect harmony. When they made love, everything for them was in sync from being mature enough to be in love to being able to have kids to and they didn't have to worry about being distracted or some other threat. The relationship they had when they were kids got to evolve. Simba became fully grown and Nala became committed to a better life with her survival and friendship to Simba being her agency. Her dedication to finding Simba and being able to have a more adult discussion with him along with him wanting to have a partner resulted in their ability to have the ideal conditions for their love. Nothing else could have let that happen. It wouldn't have worked if he had stayed at his home and it wouldn't have worked if Nala didn't have the motivation to leave hers. Timon and Pumba help to craft Simba's personally to be more naturally easy going than his father who was indirectly training him to be risky and prideful in the ways that don't help. Those lessons worked for Mufasa, but didn't work for Simba. There was even a scene where Simba got in trouble with Hyenas trying to act as ""brave"" as his father in trying to establish his dominance. This also resulted in arrogance when he told his uncle how weird it would be when he rules over him. Simba went through the journey he needed to, not the journey everyone in his Kingdom wanted him to have. When he returned to his original home, he had the agency to confront Scar of his own merit showing that he was still not seasoned enough to be King, but with the revelation of Scar being his father's murderer had the King summoned out of him and even used Scars own logic against him I their final battle where he chose to defend himself, but didn't actively want Scar to suffer. scar ended himself and only with Simba's childhood of being more free in his expression could he unveil Scar's true motivations and nature which Mufasa either ignore d or tolerated were brought out fully under Simba's reign. Simba exposed everyone's true nature by being honest and free and had the right character traits to come into his own at the end and all deception and incompetence was revealed and unmade at the end. Perfect divine order starting with his birth. The circle of life. Mufasa confronted one conflict at a time. Simba's nature created a series of events in which he became the best king they needed and all conflicts were ended at the same time. If anything Simba's new challenge will be to simply maintain peace and new harmony rather than spending a solid portion of his rule putting out fires. The perfect king for their era. I never saw this as a kid, but I'm glad I've seen it now - yes should have probably started with the original, but this works for me.

Let's be honest, every time it's a remake of any movie or tv show there's so bitter hatred. So those bad reviews are likely these ppl who are very closed minded to anything new and different. Here's my review. So I liked the movie. It wasn't great but it was a good. I think my 4 year old self would have liked the movie. I liked the CGI, it looked very realistic. So realistic my dumb bf thought it was real animals (don't judge me). I think Beyoncé was okay as Nala but because of her strong accent all you can hear is her voice which takes away from the character. Everything else was just okay. Nothing spectacular, nothing great, but it went horrible. It's a remake, you can't expect it to be just like the original abc that's why so many ppl are disappointed. You can't be disappointed when you're expectations aren't high just saying.",The Lion King
1577,dctestuser,Some classics should not be remade,6,22 July 2020,It took the fun out of the original lion King movie. Now I don't enjoy either this one or the original one.,The Lion King
1578,CodyRaptorOwens,A beautiful groundbreaking cinematic experience that was missing so much emotion.,4,26 July 2019,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is GORGEOUS! The animation is breathtaking, but sadly there were a few things missing that made The Lion King, well, THE LION KING.I'm just going to do a quick rundown of what was lacking in my opinion.The emotionless faces most of the characters had, the only time emotion was shown is when someone was angry and they were able to make them growl.
I get it they might have wanted to make
it very realistic, but i mean, the animals are talking and singing.
It just made it hard for me to connect with them emotionally since i couldn't see any emotion. Maybe this had something to do with the voice acting because I thought the voices were great, but as i said before it was just lacking the emotion.The fact this was almost EXACTLY frame for frame the 1994 version. I was hoping for something a bit different and original but obviously still keeping the heart of the animated version. This was such a bummer, the only redeeming quality was ""Be Prepared"" which was different to the point of being intriguing and yet still had the same feel as the original.
There were only a few moments like this in the movie and I was just hoping for more.Overall, I'd recommend this movie to anyone because of how beautiful it is, yet don't get your hopes up too high of you are into feeling emotional with the other characters.Honestly, I feel like this movie would have been better with no voices, no singing, just a bunch of animals living life. I seriously feel like it could have been beautiful with just a nice soundtrack and the gorgeous animation.THE END.",The Lion King

1580,smoppetstuff,Ok CGI Can Do Hyper-realism Woo,4,16 March 2021,"I don't hate hyper-realism. It's a valid form of art like any other and I enjoy looking at it. The 3D modelers and animators deserve praise as they did an excellent job here. The expressions on the animals were very bad, but animators must take orders from their superiors so I'm not going to jump in and immediately blame the artists.The color palette for this movie was bad. All they took away from the original was the sunrise. Everything else was boring to look at.They tried to explain some things that had been left to mystery in the original, for example, the hyenas are ostracized because they don't show respect for life. I didn't really mind, but didn't care either.The humor was copypasted from the original, but fell flat. In the Timon/Pumbaa diversion scene, they pretend to sing a Beauty and the Beast song, which made me cringe. Ed and Bonzai have been removed from the hyena trio. Instead there's not really a ""trio"" at all. There's one who likes to complain about personal space, and Eric Andre's best efforts can't make his hyena amusing. Shenzi has lost any humor and is instead a bland villain. She doesn't show any preference for replacement-Ed and replacement-Bonzai (whose names are apparently Azizi and Kamari).The whole time I really just wished I was watching the original. This is another cash-grab, and it was obviously just trying to entice fans by waving impressive CGI modeling around.",The Lion King
1581,gellarbing2005,Could have been better,6,3 August 2019,"As a lover of the original movie i was dubious about watching this one. I eventually gave in and watched it at our local independant cinema.
As soon as the first 'Naaaaa' started i felt chills as it sounded very much like the original, the whole circle of life opening scene was actually spectacular and mesmerising to watch and i thought ""wow this is gonna be fantastic"", but then the movie properly started............
We see a longer than neccesary scene of a mouse making his way towards scar before he captures it, again visual effects was superb but as soon as the talking started i cringed, it was spoken with no real emotion and no expression, it seemed all one tone.
Mufasas death scene was over quicker than it started. In the original there's more build up to simba realising he's dead and in all honesty i cry like a baby every single time, but in the new one nothing! They could have at least given simba some tears or lowered his ears or something but nope.
The hyenas didn't have much humour and are much darker in this than the original, they don't have the same connection with scar.
Admittedly once timon and pumbaa came on the scene i started to enjoy it, their humour is spot on and i laughed every time they were on screen. Though i was disappointed they didn't do the hula song.
The fight scene at the end was amazing to watch, it went on a lot longer than the original but it was good it showed more of a fight rather being over in a flash.
I enjoyed the songs in the movie although i did think beyonce way over sung in can you feel the love tonight, it started off lovely but there are some songs you shouldn't wail.
All in all it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. Would i watch it again? Not on purpose no, but maybe if it came on tv and there was nothing else on. I'll stick to the original.",The Lion King
1582,more_space_mail,Visually stunning. But that's sadly it.,3,14 August 2019,"Everything that made the original so beautiful and memorable, this live-action remake lacks. I don't know if it's because I've watched the original so many times that I can not only recite the movie by heart but do so with the proper inflection, enunciation and weight behind the specific lines but the voice acting in the live-action was just flat, flat, flat. Flat and very robotic sounding with the majority of the characters speaking much slower than is natural in my opinion.I think they tried too hard to match the original instead of going for some originality and well, you can't beat the original. So while visually stunning - I mean, the CGI is truly masterful in this movie - the overall voice acting failed to carry the emotions and story that is so near and dear to my heart.",The Lion King

1584,gontromantic,It's Literally The Lion King (1994) But Realistic And Slightly Worse,6,23 December 2020,"If you want to re-watch the original movie, but realistic, you will like this film. If you want more from it, you will dislike it.No matter what your opinion of this film is, you must agree the realism is astounding. It is the most realistic film I have ever watched, and the crew that worked on the CGI should get a pat on the back. But if you were to look beyond the visual masterpiece, the re-make is like the original, but slightly worse.Although I congratulated the CGI team, they (and probably Jon Favreau too) made the animals look emotionless. It made the film seem soulless. The animals from the original film are as expressive as humans. If you were to pause a scene to stare at an animal, you'd know what it is feeling by looking at its facial expression. It's the opposite in the re-make, and it made the film worse. Someone might argue that real animals don't show the same emotions as humans. I don't care. The director focused on realism instead of focusing on making a good film.There is more I should write about, but this review is too long, so I'll recommend that you watch clips from both films side by side, and notice the subtle differences that make one film better than the other. Thank you for reading.",The Lion King
1585,Aditya_Prakash,The Lion King: A Brilliant realistic movie.,9,9 April 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. This was such a good remake of the original version . The cast and the music of the movie was incredible. The Lion King movie brings back memories galore, refreshes what you were once a huge fan of. All the characters from the prequel get painted once again, this time more realistically, a feat that could have been achieved only with the aid of technology. The film is pretty much exactly the same as the original with new amazing graphics. The story of movie seems very realistic and emotional. It is refreshing to note that the creatures are not so humanlike as to seem any less animalistic. With priceless facial expressions, the lions move and sit with a grace common to all cats. For a film aimed straight at the very young, it is remarkably adult of the filmmakers to include scenes that reflect global social concerns. The imagery of the movie was beautiful and nothing like anything I've seen before. Disney gives us a beautifully animated remake of their already perfected original 'The Lion King'. The animation just revamps the original even more on its own, but the incredible and diverse cast take the extra step that is needed. The soundtrack is nostalgic and brings back all of the excitement of the original. The visual effects were WOW! Really wonderful work and the interaction between the animals. I feel this movie benefits from its live action. This movie applies from the cartoon version, represent through live-action. Scar looks more menacing, and you do get emotional and a heart warming sensation when watching because you see how an animal would actually look like when happy or sad. Also the sound and voices was awesome. As a result, the animals of this Lion King are more animal than human, which creates an emotional distance that must be bridged by other aspects of the film, and which largely falls on the shoulders of the voice actors. Every character of this movie was full of emotions .It was fantastic hats off to all who worked on this movie.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.Reviewed By-Aditya Prakash.",The Lion King

Voice Acting terrible,4,27 July 2019,I have to say I went in with an open mind even though I adore the original.Basically it's the exact same film except with stunning CGI. But that's it the choice of voice actors was terrible. The voices did not suit the film at all.I'm not sure if it was just the showcase cinema I saw it at or if it's actually intended to be so quite.

After seeing The Lion King unfortunately the answer is yes.
It is incredible to look at but because the animals are so well rendered their faces lacked the humanistic qualities needed to convey the emotions behind the dialogue.
It was like watching a David Attenborough show with Hollywood voices over dubbing.
Stunningly made but lacking the emotion of the original.

1602,natalie-paige_09,Brilliant.,9,20 July 2019,"People giving bad reviews because it's either ""too different"" or ""too similar"" to the original film are too stuck in the past to appreciate the beauty of the remake. It had all the nostalgia, beautiful learning moments and heartbreak from the original, but took a darker, more somber tone than the cartoon. The hyenas took on the role of actual villains rather than Scar's funny sidekicks, which made his partnership with them all the more sinister. However, this was balanced by the addition of some updated humourous moments from our favourites Pumba and Timone as well as Zazu. The CGI itself was visually stunning, and the artists behind it did a beautiful job capturing the natural movements of the featured african wildlife while also making the dialogue and facial movements from the creatures look as natural as possible. The casting was PERFECT, with seth rogen stealing the spotlight as Pumba and john oliver filling in very well as Zazu. Donald Glover really manages to capture Simbas angst, and Beyoncé as Nala sounds so close to the original it's uncanny! Despite less than stellar critic reviews and outrageously skewed reviews from ""purists"" who will always dislike remakes, my opinion is if you grew up in the golden age of Disney you will LOVE this film.

But this time I am happily surprised, it's a very good one !!
Visually wonderful, the characters are great, the music is so intense, I felt much more emotionally moved by this movie.But I have a BIG deception, one of my favorite moment in the 1995 novie was when Simba run alone to go back to the Lion Kingdom.
I truly love this scene, visually, with the slow motion on Simba and his paws and especially the beautiful music!
But here they made something very different and I really hated it. First Simba run with Nala almost the whole time, visually much less interesting, they didn't make the same music and they even create a new song which I also hate :( I really don't understand why they killed this beautiful scene :'(Another little deception, the romantic s ene berween Simba and Nala. I loved the night part in the 1995 movie but here it's all daylight which is much less roantic to me.

1615,carl-w-leatherman-jr,Timon and Pumbaa once again make the show,6,29 July 2019,"First the good: The cinematography is nothing short of awe inspiring. Seth Rogan (whom i must admit i don't usually care for) is charmingly funny and brings a more rounded performance as Pumbaa. The dynamic between Billy Eichner and Rogan is, as in the original, he highlight of the show. Donald Glover is spit on as the adult Simba, and an idea addition to the cast. I actually preferred him to Matthew Broderick's in the original.The bad: While Beyonce's Nala is more palatable than Scar, the songs felt overdone and overly showy (which is saying quite a bit as this film is supposed to be showy. I found the runs and riffs unnecessary and distracting at best. The addition of ""Spirit"" is shameless promotion at its most basic. Added absolutley nothing to the masterful score by Elton and Tim Rice.And then there's Scar. Perhaps one of the most iconic villains in Disney cannon, Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance is beyond disappointing. Where Jeremy Irons' original performance was intriguing in a Tony Hopkins as Hannibal Lechter sort of way Ejiofor is flat (both figuratively and literally. Be Prepared is a lamentable mess. I understand that Ejiofor struggled with the piece (which is not a difficult one to sing by any stretch), to half speak abridged lines without the emotion and rage bubbling just below the surface left me stunned (and not in a good way). Ejiofor's casting was a huge mistake. The original casting of a caucasian man with a british accent, imho, added to the story by subtly personifying and providing commentary on the colonialist political history of Africa. Scar was a mess and that's not even touching on the lackluster visualization. Yes, Scar is the ultimate outcast, but the visual appearance of the CGI version is more disturbing than anything else and just doesn't fit with the arrogance and overblown confidence the character calls for.Im equally disappointed by the stripping of the many jokes and quips among the hyenas and the removal of the hilariously off beat and over the top hula bit.All im all, it's a visual masterclass (save Scar) and a well rounded cast (save Eijofor). Simply bringing back Irons in the role of Scar would have brought my review from a 6 to an 8 star. If you cannot sing a simple song then you should not be cast. Favreau fails. miserably in that regard.I do miss Nathan Lane's flamboyance as well, but Eichner is an acceptable substitute.
Anyway, worth the view but I would probably advise skipping the theater and waiting for the streaming/blu ray release.",The Lion King

1620,kwnstantinak_96,"Enjoyable, but the bar is just too high",7,7 January 2020,"Let's start off by saying how great of a movie the original film is, deservedly deemed as one of the greatest Disney films ever and a classic that everyone should at least watch once in their life.
That being said, I watched this remake film trying not to have really high expectations and a mood to nit-pick every little detail. As is natural, when you try to remake a movie that is already well-established and barely-flawed, your task is very difficult, if not impossible, and the balance between a good and a disastrous outcome very fragile.
With this in mind, I think the director did a fairly good job, producing a movie that is overall enjoyable and definitely taking advantage of the nostalgia factor (very cleverly so). It was nice to watch a different version of the well-loved story. The brilliantly-executed CGI provides a realistic perspective, which is in my opinion the selling point of this film. Also, the experienced cast manages to give life and character to the story's protagonists. The iconic music of the original film is pristinely featured, with a few additions as a breath of fresh air.
The main problem with this film, however, is that the realistic approach to the cinematography unavoidably strips the characters of their emotions, which is one of the reasons why the original film was so loved, and that naturally seems very foreign and unwelcome. That also adds to the fact that, in my opinion, this remake film strayed away from being a kids' movie. With the realistic CGI and the noticeable lack of humour, a lot of scenes end up being too graphic and violent for the young audience, which should have been the target group for the film to be more successful. What I also noticed is that the music mixing had a few problems blending in with certain scenes and that kind of takes away some of its magic. Some scenes (e.g. the iconic opening scene and the Simba and Nala reunion) felt a bit rushed, too.
Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the film, but I think that it goes without saying that, when you think of ""The Lion King"", what comes to mind is the original film, and this new remake, no matter how well-executed it was, will probably not stick around as a classic.",The Lion King

1622,james-oswick,Voices were awful,5,22 February 2020,"I grew up as a massive fan of the original. The songs and voice acting in the 1994 film were exceptional. They really brought the personalities of the characters to life. In this film the voice acting for every part were not just average, they were very poor. For the first 30 minutes I felt like I was watching a pirate version of the film. I wasn't.
Not only did the voice acting lack any kind of flair or personality, I was left scratching my head at the pacing most of all. It felt like I was watching the film on half speed. Why was everything so flow and laboured. Did the makers worry the animals faces would look weird with speech at a normal pace? I don't know. What I do know is the voice acting ruined the film. JEJ came back to voice Amiga's a again, and I'm sure he gave it his all, but it didn't work because he must have been too old to deliver the same quality of performance. They should have just used his original voice work and paced the CGI to the voice recording.
The quality of the music was also quite poor. I couldn't quite put my finger on why to specific why, I just felt like the music lacked energy or excitement. The singing for Simba, both young simba and adult simba were really poor. Again, I can only assume they were under instruction to sing slowly because the songs really didn't work.
Other than some exceptional visual effects the film really fell flat. I have given 5 out of 10 because the storyline is copied so is obviously still good. But a film this poorly made cannot get more for me.
I will only ever watch this film once whereas I'm sure I will watch the 1994 film many more times with my two boys.",The Lion King

1624,luna493,Just a a soulless copy...but it's pretty,6,24 July 2019,"Pro: The CGI was amazing and super photorealistic and...that's it
Cons: film was soulless. Acting was subpar. Voices on the animals seemed off, and more than half of the scenes seemed extremely forced. Nothing flowed or made sense. None of the characters showed any emotion and all I saw during these 2 hrs were flash back of the original. You would have thought that after Aladdin they would have learned that scene by scene copies don't work! You need originality cause otherwise you try to beat a masterpiece, and that's damn hard! No wonder Mulan chose to cut the songs and mushu, they want to create something that can stand on its own. Overall I was heavily Disappointed. So I recommend you wait for Redbox on this, or if you don't want to wait, put on the National Geographic lions and play the original lion king in the background cause it's basically what your gonna get. Or better yet, make some popcorn, get some pillows, and watch the original masterpiece at home.",The Lion King

Visually it's absolutely incredible, the art/vfx team did a fantastic job. But the script and direction was terrible. They butchered the first two big musical numbers and the extra dialogue gave unnecessary exposition.There are some parts of the dialogue that don't even make sense with how it's been shot now, like scars opening lines. And scars delivery overall changed the whole personality of the characters for the worse, same goes for rafiki.There are so many classic lines from the original that even to this day I recite with friends for a laugh, but these have all been destroyed and replace with very forgettable dialogue delivery.Overall, there were about 4 moments that I thought they did a great job with, but was frustrated and even bored throughout the rest of the film. I'm not even worried that it was almost a shot for shot replica, I actually wish that they kept it closer because everything new, had a negative effect on the story.",The Lion King

This film fell very short in using the latest access to technology and production essence to create a new, engaging experience with The Lion King story line. Without spoiling the film, I wish that there were more thought in adding new songs, new tones or beats, and jazzing up elements of the production. This movie came across as less than a best foot forward by Disney! I was more than disappointed with the singing quality of many of the characters and the scenes were not that imaginative.

I loved the animals and the landscape. I also loved loved loved, Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Zazu, Timo & Pumba, Rafiki and Shenzi.There are only two things that I did not like. The characters did not have enough emotion in their faces. The voices sound dramatic at times but you couldn't tell from the animals.But even more disturbing for me was Beyoncé. I truly respect her for what she does but she did ruin this movie for me. Her voice was taking over all songs in a Beyoncé way. And than the song Spirit, I'm sorry it didn't fit the movie at all.

In the name of Lord Lucifer of hell, they changed the hula song Timon and Pumbaa does as a distraction. That hurt.
One last thing: Beyonce I like you but this was really not your time to shine. The director should have focussed more on finding the right voice for Nala instead of just going by her being a famous black female singer.

There's no real heart or passion in this movie because they're telling the exact same story without anything different.

The movie is stunning and picturesque, but the CG approach also makes the characters stiff and expressionless which takes away from the drama of some otherwise eloquent scenes. Additionally, while many have regarded Timon and Pumba's banter to be a highlight of the movie, I personally thought it was comparatively forced and unfunny - not to mention how Timon's character was utterly ruined. On a more positive note, the instrumental sections of the soundtrack deserve special mention for their excellent remastery by Hans Zimmer.At the end of the day, this take on The Lion King carries the core message of destiny, duty, and responsibility, but it's a message better conveyed by its 2-dimensional predecessor.

I was very pleasantly surprised when Circle of Life came on and it was frame-by-frame the love action representation of the cartoon version. (I know the animated version by heart, also hence why I had no expectations). I think the movie was a tad grittier and not as comical as its cartoon version, but several of the changes they made gave it a more logical and linear plot.All that being said, I really -hated- what they did with Be Prepared. No actual song? No hyenas marching? Just Scar, slightly musicalizing his war plan is NOT the way to go.All-in-all , this movie is better than I expected, but still not as good as the original. 8/10",The Lion King
1666,chaztoronto,The Lion King Comes To Life in 2019!,10,30 October 2019,"Some eight years ago, watching the beloved 1994 Lion King movie, I remarked to my 15-year old niece that it would be amazing if Disney would remake the Lion King with real life characters, as today's CGI tech can permit.
And now, here it is, the 2019 adaptation of The Lion King comes to life!
But heed this: the main comparison between the original and this hyper-real remake is that this time around the movie is not for the kiddies!Under grey African skies, the storyline (which is pretty much identical to the original animated classic) unfolds with some subtle differences. Which makes it even more enjoyable since no one really wants a word by word remake.
But the fact that the animals are so realistic makes this version a little terrifying because of certain scenes which are darker and even scary at times. Even the broad comedy of the original hyenas has been stripped away to reveal them as more sinister and menacing. The fangs of hyenas and animal growls can alone give a kid the nightmares.
And yet for all its realism, it tends to be even more touching.
For example, the part where little Simba loses his dad makes you wanna cry, because the expressions on his face is so vividly sad, thanks to the well done CGI technological advancements. (Please note this is not really a spoiler since this is a review of the remake version. As an added note, this new little Simba is so adorable makes you want to buy the plushie!)This 2019 release, to put it quite simply, is Amazing to behold.
No doubt this is a historic moment in cinema, a landmark film being restored to its full glory!
Both the Director Jon Favreau and the Cinematography by Caleb Deschanel are to commended, with special mentions to Chiwetel Ejiofor who lends his voice to a convincing Scar, Seth Rogen who plays Pumbaa and of course the legendary James Earl Jones for Mufasa.
I also enjoyed the soundtrack which utilizes a lot of drums and musicians like Beyonce and Pharrell Williams, making it more authentic to the music of Africa.For this reinvention of The Lion King (as well as the recent Jungle Book remake) I must admit that Disney has gained my full respect. The fact that Disney has very much evolved is quite evident with many roles being played by African American descent actors and musicians this time. Even the hyenas were given African names for this version. After all, is this not a story out of Africa?All this talk of the movie makes me want to watch it again and so I leave you with 'hakuna matata', because no doubt there will be a sequel released in the near future...",The Lion King

Usually I wouldn't rate this with a 10 (probably would give it a 8 or a 9), but I'm just trying to even out the ratings.Second ""wow"" is the good one, it is for the movie itself. I loved the production, loved the music, loved the voices of the caracters, loved that it made me cry again when mufasa died, loved that it brought my childhood back.So screw what critics say, they watch it from a different point of view, but me, as a regular person, not an expert, all I can say I enjoyed it and I think it's a good remake (trust me, I watched the original every morning for more than a year when I was a child).",The Lion King

But when it comes to the story, very little was added that made it better than the original, and quite a lot was taken away that would have made it spectacular. Music? Gorgeous, of course, but I missed the deep and bassy beat of ecstacy, of rawness, of drama gripping you right in the stomach. I left the cinema feeling a little flat.

We evolve. Your emotions at 40 are hardly what they were when you were 5. Keep an open mind, try not to project your past experiences on the new version, and I beg you- stop expecting kids noawadays to be like you. They aren't.

The original Lion King was like top tier Disney and one of my favorite movies. But the new one here, it has no soul, it has no energy.
I was constantly bored during the movie, as it was a shot-for-shot remake of the original, and it just seemed to me that they were trying to rush all the classic lines out. Some might argue that, classic as the original is, it might be unwise to make changes to the remake. Well, here's a simple and clear solution to that: SIMPLY DON'T MAKE REMAKES.The graphics are amazing, and the world the animators created truly feels real with insane detail. However there is no soul in anything, and as the Lions all have realistic faces, they show little to no emotions! So you could actually hear the actors trying their best to give an effective performance, but the dullness on the lions' faces just contrasted it so much it became weird, cringey even.They took out some of the humor in the original, and tried to make this movie overly serious and epic and big, but in reality nothing works and everything is worse! At the end of the day it is just a boring, dull, sleepy movie. Even the kids in my theater got so bored they started chatting and were paying no attention to the movie.I shall not watch anymore of these life-action remake, they have no purpose and they are always worse than those dreamy, beautiful original cartoons.

So much was fit into the original and feels like half of those details were added into the live action. I just don't get it.",The Lion King
1675,1flymom,Awesome,8,25 July 2019,"I really did enjoy this movie. It had me and my family truly enjoying the different highs and lows. I love the strong voice Beyonce brought to the character for a lioness. I am personally tired of the soft, more weaker voices typically portrayed with females in power. A fresh of breath air. The imagery in the movie was awesome. I felt as if I was actually there with them. The hint of girl power displayed by the pack of female lions you never truly obtained that vibe from the previous movie. I really loved that. As a female I truly embraced the similarities but enjoyed the newer direction. A must see and will buy this also to add to my collection.
I would've perferred the love scene between big Simba and Nala to be more romantic, only because the song Can You Feel the Loves remake is simply beautiful. I think that scence could've been better. I give this movie 8 out of 10..Go see it a good movie anyone in the family can see together.",The Lion King

1677,terry-46096,"Looks so good, has no heart.",3,20 July 2019,"The movie is adequate, that's not good enough for this live action though. Lion King is a masterpiece story that has been celebrated for years for its emotional and timeless value. This version falls really short. The voice acting is flat the tone is wrong and there is little to no emotion felt during a very slow boring few hours.The only highlight in my opinion is Seth Rohan and Billy Eisner. Past that? A very forgettable and hollow version of the story.Oh and Beyoncé over sings everything.",The Lion King

1680,Laurana_Kanan,"A Pale, Lifeless, & Unnecessary Remake",5,31 July 2019,"I don't know if it's because my fondness for the original Disney animated movies colors my perception of the live action remakes, but I've been severely disappointed with every one of them except for Cinderella. The animals looked absolutely fantastic - if this were a nature show. But, as far as emoting and engaging the audience in the story, it just fails completely. I think it's just a limitation of transitioning from an animated medium to a live action one where anthropomorphizing the animals to express emotions would probably just look weird.Many of the voice actors I also felt were flat. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, & Beyoncé's performances were just lifeless. Not to mention I could barely hear/make out the majority of John Oliver's dialogue. James Earl Jones was perfect and spot on as usual. The songs were good, not as good as the original imo, but still they weren't too bad. I missed the original ""Be Prepared"" and that Beyoncé song seemed so out of place. I would have liked to of had ""He Lives In You"" by Lebo M. actually in the movie instead of relegated to the credits, it's a great song.",The Lion King

1682,romik-17725,Why was this made?,1,12 July 2019,"Ask yourself honestly - Why does this exist? Was there some artistic vision that was not expressed in the original that warranted a remake? Is the animation of the original sub-par and outdated? Was Jeremy Irons underwhelming as the voice of Scar? How does this new adaptation build and/or improve upon the original?
What made the original so timeless and magical was not the story, it was the one thing they changed - the animation. This ""Live Action"" (which is not in fact live action since it's 100% CG) does make the animals look realistic, which essentially means they look bored, emotionless, and overall bland, while supposedly going through very human range emotions that real animals just can't convey. And the cherry on top is that while the original animation is timeless, this new CGI will look about as dated in 10 years as the Star Wars prequels look now.
This is a tasteless, visionless cash grab. Nothing more.",The Lion King

My biggest critique will be choosing Beyoncé to play Nala, her voice over was forced and too mature for a young Nala but SETH FRICKING ROGEN made this film. He brought comic relief once you started having doubts and saved this film from being just okay. Timon compliments him perfectly and the hyenas were pretty funny as well...long live the king!",The Lion King

How could this fact be so utterly missed when so much time was spent on the CGI in this movie? How can there be literally no emotion shown on any of the pride? It's such a massive oversight, I'm bewildered.Put it this way, it tries to be realistic, but fails because cats are expressive creatures except in this movie where their eyes, eyebrows and jaws are suddenly static. All the time. It feels like an early release.And Scar was RUINED. Where is his wit? His sarcasm? Gone are the very traits that defined him.

1687,MattDias2049,Best Disney Remake so far!,10,3 August 2019,"Feel free to disagree with me, it's your opinion and I totally respect it, but I loved this Remake of ""The Lion King"" and I'm not ashamed to say my opinion. I've seen it three times on the biggest movie screen possible and the experience was absolutely fantastic in all of them. Jon Favreau did a wonderful job recreating this story in a more realistic tone and style that really feels different than the original animated movie in a visual way, and that's exactly what he was going for here and I don't see a problem with him not wanting to change the story, after all if ain't broke don't fix it. Remakes and Reinterpretations will never stop and I don't mind them I'd there good, and this movie is great.The voice cast is excellent with terrific performances, especially by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen who are both hilarious as Timon and Pumba, and Donal Glover as Simba who delivers a much better job than Matthew Bodrick in the original. The songs still just as amazing as they were before, especially ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" sung by Beyoncé and Glover and the new version of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"". The visuals are remarkable and just absolutely gorgeous to see in IMAX 3D, it can be game changer to Visual Effects in Hollywood in all honesty. And the additional 30 minutes of runtime are barely even noticed personally. Again, feel free to disagree with me, but I really loved this movie. Is it better than the original? No, but it's not trying to, it's just trying to be a new interpretation of a beloved story like the Broadway show, and in that way the movie definitely delivers. See it and judge for yourself.",The Lion King

Disney isn't what it used to be! Beyonce wasn't good enough! They should get a another director! I'm leaving the theater! I'm not happy...waaah!!""Ya'll are just too DAMN picky!! Do you EVEN have the slightest idea to how much work and time goes into animation, lighting, music, filming, editing, or directing?? What the hell am I even saying...that's probably NOT even good enough for you and it NEVER will be. HELLO! They brought back Hans Zimmer for this film!! Or do you not even like Hans Zimmer either? FYI: He's a film composer (he makes music for movies and he did the music for the original Lion King...just saying)Of course live-action is ALWAYS going to be different, that's the whole point of a REMAKE duh!! This movie brought BACK my childhood memories to the next level. The animation was stunning and always my favorite Simba. The film was phenomenal from start to finish. Jon Favoru took the original and made it something more. You can't go wrong with James Earl Jones as the original Mufasa and as the NEW Mufasa, c'mon! Rafiki, Scar, Timon and Pumbaa brought it to a different and unique level than I could possibly imagine.Critics...the film industry has changed, Disney has changed. Directors come and go. Did you know that this was what Walt Disney wanted before he died? Look it up, it's a true story or Google: Walt Disney (he founded Disney) Work on a movie set some day when you grow up from a child to an adult and I guarantee that you'll appreciate the work behind the magic of what REALLY goes into making a film.",The Lion King
1691,squelchyno,Awful movie,1,1 November 2019,"I really wish Disney would stop making remakes of my most beloved Disney classics. This was underwhelming, flat and the soundtrack was ruined by lack lustre reworkings of wonderful songs. I am so disappointed. The animal lack any emotion, and aside from James earl Jones who delivers his lines in the same fantastic way the other actors are far too unknown to carry the weight of these great characters. the original still makes me cry everytime I see it, every time I have seen the stage show. This didn't even stir any emotion in me at all because you can't see the emotion on the faces of the animals. It feels like one of those bad 70s Disney animal documentaries that was on TV when I was a child. In a choice between the original and this one I will watch the original every time.",The Lion King

1694,joshuastavers,Pretty good if you're not a hard core fan,7,25 July 2019,"I like movies, but I dont live my life by movies and I dont waste time watching ""a classic"" a thousand times over and remembering it word for word. I've seen the original maybe twice when I was younger, of course I thought it was good but then I continued to live my life, and also watched OTHER movies. So, I actually thought this was pretty damn good, but I didnt compare it to the original, which I only kind of remember. But I dont think its fair that it's getting slammed the way it is, while it falls a little flat here and there its certainly not as bad as the hardcore fans are saying. The cinema I was in had heaps of laughs, I thought Rogen and Eisner were great as Timon and Pumba, Donald and Queen Bey were pretty decent, scar was a menacing villain, overall I actually really enjoyed it. And the CGI was scary good, I forgot the landscape and animals with no talking parts were fake for a lot of the movie.

1695,trentkano,GHASTLY SHOT FOR SHOT REMAKE,1,19 July 2019,"Seriously what was Disney thinking when they looked at the first reels of this film? How could such a talented director mess up so bad? Why were all the kids in my audience restless, bored and falling asleep? I loved The Lion King and it's one of my favorite movies. This however was a train wreck of epic proportions. From the bizarre and off putting of the animals talking to the very bland and boring shot for shot action, there was nothing magical here to see.Instantly forgettable. I knew the bad reviews coming in, and lowered my expectations dramatically yet I could not believe how much they butchered such a masterpiece classic.SO SO BAD!!! SHAME ON DISNEY!!",The Lion King
1696,jeremygroves,Badly Cast w/ No Emotion,2,30 January 2020,"The worst critique I heard before seeing this was that the animals show no emotion in their faces. I was willing to look past this as I thought a good cast could make up for the lack of emotive expression. I may have been right, but we'll never know because despite a good cast in of the actors themselves, only two actors fit their characters (James Earl Jones and Seth Rogan). I was so disappointed with Donald Glover (who really doesn't even talk that much, and when he does he's pretty unbearably boring and plain... kind of like Matthew Broderick...) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (whom I like less and less with each movie I view him in). My main complaint was it sounded like a bunch of people just having normal conversation rather than any cinematic, dramatic dialogue. The delivery of some lines was *painful*, especially with some key original lines. The script felt rushed and completely undramatic. It's a Disney movie... give us some drama, please.Also, I don't know why Disney feels super fine re-creating some aspects/scenes of the Disney classics with perfect reflection (certain camera angles, character movements/expression, or lines being identical to the original), and then approach other classic scenes differently but with a cringy subtlety. Just do it the exact same way or leave it out. There's some serious cringe here, and in every other Disney remake.I'm also super tired of this weird ""original film self-awareness"" thing that is present in all the remakes (Timon not interrupting Pumbaa in Hakuna Matata, or Genie dragging out the end of Prince Ali way more than in the original). It's just weird and awkward and not funny, especially when it's a classic moment and people get the thrill of knowing what's coming and look forward to experiencing it for the first time again, just in a new setting. You're sweeping the rug out from under your fans.Anyways. That's my rant. Timon and Pumbaa (primarily Pumbaa, but Timon had some funny lines too) made me laugh quite a bit. The opening scene and they are the reasons I gave a 2 to this. Two points for two good components. The CGI was fine, but what CGI isn't impressive these days? It's not a factor worth mentioning in the review of a Disney classic remake because it's not what any of us cared about.",The Lion King

1699,chrisaustin-61871,Biggest Flop,3,18 February 2020,"This must be one of the biggest flops of the last few years, I can't even begin to think how much time and money went into this. The animation is undoubtedly high quality, but it's basically just a strive towards realism, no consideration given to the audience at all. The sound quality is generally poorly done; I think half the voices are pretty rubbish and it doesn't seem to sync up well with the animation. It looks almost like someone has taken a film and done voices over it in their bedroom.. it looks as if nobody communicated with each other.. There was no guidance.. The whole thing is a near-perfect representation of the original cartoon, but just in 'real' animated style, but the whole thing feels lifeless as many have pointed out, and you just wonder.. what was the point !The only thing to be said for it, is as a stand alone film, if Lion King had never existed, and it was made by some independent film company that nobody had ever heard of then it would surely score highly as a 7 or more. But the facts are it isn't an original story.. so given this.. the whole things is a massive flop. It feels like it was made by a bunch of young tech nerds who have very little concept of the bigger picture.",The Lion King

1709,zoebloom,Remember the Original,3,1 December 2020,"As far as Disney's remakes go, I feel this movie is one of the worst.Unfortunately the only thing it has going for it was the stellar animation, and the quality of the graphics is undeniably incredible. But that seemed to be the directors main focus... and that is where the film has all its flaws.In my opinion, the Shot-by-shot remake has bland script, bland acting with no soul and no emotion in general. Despite the incredible animation, the characters have little to no facial expression with the excuse of realism and ""I want it to look like a real wildlife documentary"". But what the director seems to forget is the incredible passion and symbolism that the original had.If the original didn't exist, this would be a bad stand alone movie. As I watched it for the first time, I was only ever thinking of the original for every shot and thinking about HOW GOOD THE ORIGINAL WAS. and keep in mind I entered the theatre excited for this movie and left really disappointed. So this isn't a good movie, purely because were relying on the original. I feel as though a remake should always have something new to add and the ability to hold on its own, this had nothing.Allegedly, when the original actor for Mufasa asked the director, ""How do you want me to act this scene"" his only advice was ""Do it like the original"",or ""Do it just as you did before"". This only proves my previous point further.It feels like the director didnt care. There was nothing creative about this film. and it was nothing compared to the original. So watch the original. Thats all I have to say.",The Lion King
1710,noah-02502,Better than I expected,8,20 August 2019,"Look, here's the thing, I absolutely love the original Lion King. From the og animations to the great songs and so on, and I really thought that this movie would be a poor representation of the original. Especially from all of its backlash.But... then I watched the movie and was positively surprised. I mean the animation was fantastic and looking at the process behind it and some of the real life easter eggs like an extinct type of rhino appearing in the movie as a tiny little tribute really showed that not only John Favreaux but the entire team behind the movie handled this movie with respect.While talking about Favreaux and respect its clear to me and possibly others that Disney didn't want to give this movie to any director hence giving it to a director that has created movies like the first two Iron Man movies, The Jungle Book remake as well as Chef. I mean they knew that this movie is a beloved classic and they wanted someone to handle this movie like that.And I mean sure this movie had some flaws but every movie does. If they would have remade any form of classic, then there is of course going to be haters or people who won't look at the new movie in the same type of way like the original. But thats likely because they grew up with the originals. I believe that Disney is making a bold choice with re creating classics, yet they probably apart from wanting some extra cash, are doing this to make younger viewers look at these classics while at the same time trying to compete withother more action packed superhero movies.But hey maybe I'm just a bit odd for thinking that this movie was good, but in that case fine. I just thought that people are being to harsh on a company that has to handle a load of sub companies at the same time while having to respect their own craft as well as make money.Well Hakuna Matata I guess...",The Lion King

I felt a lot of emotion throughout and realistic graphics did not spoil it rather enhanced it. Voiceover was excellent as well. In fact, the writers and director have meticulously added micro plots to better explain the flow of story such as how Simba's hair carries to Rafiki, how Nala escapes Scar's curfew, how the hyenas have settled into the 'shadows' in agreement with Mufasa etc. Scar looked truly sinister and Simba looked like an heir to the throne, unlike too boyish in the original.

1716,jinclema,Phenomenal animation!,8,20 July 2019,"I was stunned when I saw how realistic the animation is in this film, it's undoubtedly the first of its kind. There were times when I could swear that some of the animals were real. They really went all out with studying the animals and their movements and mannerisms. This film is truly a work of art. Some are complaining about lack of emotion or facial expressions, but I like that they took a more realistic route in this recreation. It pays an amazing tribute to the natural beauty of Africa and its wildlife as opposed to dumbing it down with cartoonish details.That being said, the best scenes were 1) The opening scene, 2) the stampede, and 3) the lion and hyena battle. I almost immediately noticed that they recreated the opening scene from the original film exactly, frame by frame. This was a genius move that I hope everyone noticed, as it paid homage to the most iconic scene in the original, and the result was stunning. Both the stampede and the final battle were intense and kept you on the edge of your seat. The camera angles, the sound effects, and of course the animation were all superb. It's something that you just have to see for yourself. It can't accurately be described.As for the negatives, there are few. Some seem to be upset about cutting ""Be Prepared"" from the film, but they had their reasons. For one, it was the least memorable song from the original. Obviously since Scar is the villain that was the whole point, but in this day and age when everyone is offended by everything, can't blame them for their decision. The voice actor for scar reportedly also didn't have the vocal ability to recreate the song, which brings up another point. Sometimes the dialogue fell a little flat in some scenes. Partly due to the script, but also due to inexperienced voice actors. In certain scenes such as Scar warning Mufasa about the stampede, or Simba and Nala meeting again as adults, I thought there could have been a lot more emotion.All in all, it was a great film. I recommend it to everyone!",The Lion King

There are scenes I'd go to court and say were real, not CGI, but that's about all that's truly impressive. In fact, they took the realism way too far: the animals have zero emotion on their faces. It literally looks like watching Planet Earth except the animals talk. Fear, sadness, joy, it's almost non-existent on the faces of all the animals, which is too accurate for a movie with talking animals. Aslan may look dated compared to these lions, but he had bucketloads more emotion in a movie that's over ten years older than this one, and still managed to look insanely realistic.It messed with me the whole movie. It was two hours of the uncanny valley and I just couldn't enjoy it completely. It was so hard to hear dialogue with emotion and see hyper realistic unemotional faces on the animals. We have the technologies, but I guess they thought making everything as real as possible would make it better, but it didn't.

The animals never express any emotions, the voice actors didn't even try to do a good performance ( they also can't sing as well ), the pacing somehow makes it feel like it's going by fast and really slow at the exact same time, and while the animation can look neat that doesn't save it from everything else that I just listed. If you like Disney ( and/or care about the art of film ) than do yourself a favor and don't see it. I give this 1/10 stars.",The Lion King
1724,nawalaman-59701,Way to ruin it,1,25 July 2019,No emotion.. The whole movie visual vise was amazing.. But this movie was good because of the emotion and this remake got none.. Its so pathetic I can't believe it,The Lion King
1725,gs-53802,Into the lions den,2,20 July 2019,"So after this being a staple of my.daughters childhood we were both excited to go see this', however we left deflated and empty.
The lack lustre character voices left this a limp and unsatisfying.
Rafiki was almost a non entity. What happened to his over excited witch doctor persona-he became a faded almost not there baboon without presence.
Zazu...not one comment landed with humour and was flat. The morning report was read out not sang.
The 3 Hyenas. They had absolutely nothing sinister or calculating in them at all, they did not deliver the shivers.
Scar. Well yes.visually he looked defeated but his delivery of speech and terror was far from evil and nasty . It really missed the point of his persona he was weak and pitiful for all the wrong reasons. The lack of effort in the rendition of be prepared was shocking and underwhelming.
Simba and nala were weak voiced and why was Beyonce allowed to over sing her part. It's isn't meant to be warbled. You could almost visualise her reading the script it was so uncomfortable.
Timon and pumba again lost their presence.
It was mostly awkward.
Mustafa was a delight as the voice continued to carry his persona and relieved James Earl Jones did something to keep it feeling in line with the story .
Surabi had the most presence and passion.The visuals at times didn't match the message.Utterly utterly disappointed.How a cartoon and stage show can deliver tgis effortlessly and seamlessly time after time yet millions of pounds, millions of hours of cgi and skill managed to make it a poor relation to the story we all know and love.",The Lion King
1726,annaprivate,"Visually beautiful, but the CGI characters have little to no expression compared to the cartoon version",7,27 July 2019,"Of course the storyline is the same and I think everybody loved it, but the lack of emotions that those hyper-realistic CGI characters have, really takes away from the core of the movie. I feel like the voice actors actually did good, but when your character displays no expressions it's impossible to deliver the emotions that you expect. It was visually amazing, maybe so much that it kinda distracts you from the story. Overall I've enjoyed it just it doesn't keep up with the cartoon that for me is a full 10 out of 10.",The Lion King
1727,giovannibeaumont,"Recreated the original, but it's different in its own way",7,17 July 2019,"Although the movie is almost an exact recreation of the original, having almost the same soundtrack and one of the original actors (James Earl Jones,) there are many new and different things to experience.The new live action animation makes it way more realistic and very visually entertaining.
The new voices make it unique compared to the original because they sound different.
Some of the new voice actors are singers which makes the soundtrack very aurally different.In conclusion the movie is very much a recreation of the original but is different in its own way.",The Lion King
1728,canaanarichardson,"Decent, But...",7,30 July 2019,"Now, let me just start off with a quick reminder that this is a remake, not a reimagining, so you shouldn't expect anything brand spanking new in this movie. Got that out of the way? Great.This movie has great CGI, casting and musical numbers. Donald Glover was great as Simba, but Beyoncé was noticeably bad as Nala. JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright-Joseph did great as Young Nala and Simba, while Zazu was kind of just lacking the flair he had from the original we all loved so much. Chiwetel Ejifor in my opinion did great as Scar, even if his song was cut short. Speaking of cut short, that's what happened to the hyena's comical relief, instead replaced with Azizi and Kamari, who have some funny moments scattered throughout the movie. There's a long-standing gag about Azizi getting in Kamari's space, and it's pretty funny. Azizi is basically Ed but a tad bit smarter, and Keegan Michael-Key and Eric Andre were perfect for the roles.One thing to remember is that this is a shot-for-shot remake, which means there is nothing new, and nothing that gives it it's own unique flair except for all the new good stuff, like the casting. Another thing that really lowers this whole movie is the whole idea of photorealism. It being in this movie makes it creepy how people can create animals out of a keyboard and a screen. Photorealism means that there are no facial expressions. So that means no tears, frowns, smiles, or aggravation in the faces of the Lions/ literally any animal.In the end, this movie is pretty good, but it's quite the obvious cash grab, but that shouldn't stop you or anyone from seeing this movie!",The Lion King
1729,briankruisinga,A disrespecting cash grab,3,14 July 2019,"Modern Disney is unable to deliver the magic like they used to, so they 'reimagine' every classic for nostalgia's sake but without the charm of the original. Ultra realistic CGI animals trying to express human emotions are a joke. You need exaggerated facial animations for that, like in a cartoon. Pumba is just ugly as hell in this movie.",The Lion King

1733,tpcobra,Original was great but this is really good too.,7,29 October 2019,This movie was really good. The only drawback was some of the voices. It was awesome that James Earl Jones but most of the others...not so much. I'm sorry but Beyoncé was the worst. Probably needed a voice coach or something. Still good to watch but I wish they could have gotten voices closer to the original movie.,The Lion King
1734,mortenhamburger,"Still an amazing movie, however with a major flaw in Beyonce voice acting",7,14 August 2019,"First off, as many have mentioned before me, the CGI is amazing! I think the plot was very well done - still the same story with a few tweaks and while some may argue the tweaks were for better or worse I don't think it changed the movie which is still amazing.
The thing keeping me from giving this is a 9 or 10 is honestly Beyonce - I think her voice acting was so misplaced in this movie. It was horrific to the point where I couldn't stop thinking about it whenever Nala opened her mouth.
Another detail I personally would have enjoyed is if the characters kept some of the ""Disney"" tune to them - for instance scar keeping his bordeaux/black color and the other lions a more ""unrealistic"" color to keep some of the Disney factor in there. However, I realize this might just a personal opinion and has not affected this review.",The Lion King
1735,morris_moussa,Visual Stunning and emotionally flat,6,1 February 2020,"The Lion King is my all time favorite movie and left the biggest mark on me as a child. It's a classic movie that has stood the test of time and still remembered for its story, characters and music. The adults today who were young when it came out in 1994 can enjoy the nostalgia and watch it with their own children, and now it's being introduced to the new generation who can have the pleasure of watching the first if they haven't.Few things I enjoyed:
The visuals were stunning and made it feel like a real life documentary where the characters and their world actually exist. Really shows how advanced technology has become since the 80s/90s. This movie showcased what the future of filmmaking may go and the possibilities of how stories could be told.New story arcs were refreshing and interesting additions. They expanded the story and the role of certain characters such as Nala and her lifelong rivalry with Shenzi and Scars attempts to make Sarabi his queen. Learning she chose Mufasa over him and a battle took place between Scar and Mufasa for control of the pride, which is how he got the scar on his eye, gave more depth to the history of the characters.The negatives:
Hyper realism at the expense of emotional expression. Real animals have small eyes with no eyebrows and their faces are fixed unless they growl or snarl. The lions in the original had big eyes and eyebrows to convey a range of emotions and it gives the voice actors a lot more freedom in their performance. Most of it felt slow, deadpan and unemotional and i think the restrained style of animation hindered the voice actors. They must have been told to follow a certain style.This took out any heart and soul the original had. We know what the original was so we can't help but compare the two. It was rich and vibrant and funny and sad and exciting and heartbreaking and beautiful all at once because the art form of traditional animation allows you to use character designs and colors that convey visually all these moods and emotions and you can give voice actors free range to deliver the best performance possible, to match the visuals.Overall, the nostalgia saved the day and this is what the studio banked on. The people who loved it back in the day were buying movie tickets and the newer generation was joining them. Our opinions come after we've paid to watch it. It was a groundbreaking feat in filmmaking but lacked the soul and heart and warmth of the original.",The Lion King
1736,hellaragnarok,A Youtube fan-made video.,1,19 July 2019,"What can I say: it lacked the emotion, charisma, depth and FACIAL expressions. The movie felt rushed and dry. The only thing that held this movie in one piece was its classic soundtrack. This movie is nothing more than a money grab from Disney. The CGI looked like something coming out of a Youtube video, combined with National Geographic documentary. An amateur could've done a better job than this crap.",The Lion King
1737,meekemule,Nostalgic,7,21 July 2019,"If treated like it's own film, it is easily a great movie. However, it is nearly impossible to separate two. Entertaining nonetheless. I don't think you'll miss much by waiting for this one to become available on-demand versus going to see it in theaters.",The Lion King
1738,sergeantburker,A Remake Well Made,9,22 July 2019,"What more can I say on this remake? Sure it can't beat the original, but it does do well that it hits itself out of the ballpark. It's a visual experience if I must add; very good CGI. Story is all good like the original, has some new things you may like which I won't spoil, and the characters, man are they good. You'll like Scar especially; he's more deadlier than the original. Plus the music is just as amazing as the original, with Hans Zimmer back at the helm of composing.So I give The Lion King (2019) 9/10.",The Lion King

1740,davemorland-22132,Just two things spoilt it,8,21 July 2019,I still prefer the original and so does my 5 year old but it was worth a watch the 2 things that let it down1. I'm glad they still had James Earl Jones but I really don't know why they did not have Jeremy irons he made scar just as much as James made mufasa and it was hard to connect with him and the guy who played scar didn't have the same deep voice as Jeremy.2. They made rafiki more serious and not as fun as he was in cartoon which was a let down. Don't get me wrong it was good it just wasn't brilliant,The Lion King

1742,missskalin,"Enjoyable, does not deserve all the hate",9,26 July 2019,"Beautiful to watch, great cgi, cute animals, several funny moments and good voice acting. What more can you ask for?
I even think most of the re-written scenes works better than they did in the original 1994 version, especially Scar's villain song. The hyenas are also scarier, but Ted is still a weirdo, so the main hyenas has really kept a lot of their personalities from the original movie. Wich is nice.Favourite part has always been, and still is, the part og the movie where Simba is together with Timon and Pumbaa in that ""bachelor jungle"". This was AMAZING in the new movie, I even got surprized when Nala appeared, even though I knew she would show up at some point.I can kinda see what people mean when they complain about emotions and facial ecpressions, but I do really think that if you are a person that is compassionate about animals you'll still see a lot of emotions in this movie even though the animals doesen't have human eyebrows and such. I felt kinda weird about it for the first few minutes, but when I got used to how their faces and bodylanguage worked I really didn't think much about it.An enjoyable film. It really is worth a watch, or maybe three.",The Lion King

I couldn't believe how it was so different from their natural behaviors. It is a Disney movie but when you want your child see very vivid figures and animations, you damage the real image of the reality. We are at the time of animals extinction and yet still try to show kids and people that animals are living with human emotions, rage, hate, dishonesty and grudge! Why don't you make a movie about how they really are. The story was played for so many times previously, I simply can't understand why they had to do it again.",The Lion King
1746,admgamze,Very bad,1,12 October 2019,"That was a waste of time. Pictures and animations are very very good but the story, writing is very cheap, very usual. I can't seem to understand all these 8,9,10 pointed reviews, then I have filtered them by points and as presumable it is rated suspiciously. In this movie a thousand people must have worked ?? So why do you give a high point like 10 for this ? It is a discouraging for really successful movies.
If I could vote for 0 for the story and sound, creativity, I would definitely do that!!",The Lion King

1749,duanezidaj,As expected,9,23 July 2019,"LionKing was a childhood favorite of all the Disney films. It had sentimental value and i was happy when it was almost exactly the same- instead placed in modern / real life context.
The only thing that lacked for me was the facial emotion that we see in the original animation. It is a difficult thing to capture when real life looking animals don't actually talk though. Perhaps a remake of the animation in a Pixar collaboration may have been a better approach?? I did love all the impact of the drama that the music gave. I'm also a fan of Jon Favreau- I'd say it was pretty good. Thankyou 👍👍",The Lion King
1750,eva-21304,Not worth the effort,1,17 July 2019,"Look, you've already seen the best there is to get with the original animated movie.
The characters look realistic and the atmosphere is convincing, sure, but they lack their personality. They can't mimic or interact as charming as the originals, you feel so distant from these renderings and the ""funny voices"" clash with the realistic style.Watch the animation or a nature documentary but not this.",The Lion King
1751,jineen-92002,It felt flat with no emotion,4,10 August 2019,"Unlike the original this one was flat, you can't engage with what is going on, even the moments were something sad happens it doesn't feel quite sad (like mufasa's death for example).
And the voice is NOT suitable for the character (like nala which in my opinion was the worst performance ever!!! Beyonce should stick to singing) young simba was fine but the older version sucked very badlyyy.
The characters were so weak and they have no complex, take simba's mother for example from the start to the end she didn't complete 3 sentences and it goes on for the rest of the characters.
You can't deny the fact that the cinematography and music were on point and that's why I gave it a 4/10.",The Lion King

I really loved what Jon Favreau did to this movie, especially when it looks even more realistic than the 1994 classic. The cast of this blockbuster hit did a really good job on their acting roles, even for James Earl Jones who came back (by surprise) for the voice of Mufasa. I would want to watch this again if I REALLY have to. If I have met Jon Favreau in person, I would give him a HUMONGOUS thank you for directing this film, because it has been one of my favorite Disney movies since the 90s... Never to mention that it put all of my worries behind (in temporary measures)!

1758,laurbuch,The emotion of animals,7,29 July 2019,"First of all, this film is stunning. There's no denying that. While people hate remakes, I fully appreciate the efforts to utilize technology that did not exist at the originals release. The detail is really something to marvel at.I see a lot of complaints about ""lack of emotion"" and I completely disagree. There are no exaggerated emotions, or human emotions. But there are subtleties and inflections and I think it's important for children and people in general to understand animals emotions range high and low and many take it for granted because they cannot express it in ways we always understand. An animal does not need to cry for us to know it's suffering, nor smile to know it feels joy. There was enough for me to feel the emotions there, and I loved that they were not overly animated (I realize this sounds too deep for a movie with a singing pig, but still.)That being said, it was a beautiful take on the original. I loved the original to death. The changes I saw were small but pretty enjoyable. It wasn't overly animated. Scar and the hyenas felt more menacing, and the action felt very intense. Eichner and Rogen's improv cracked me up. I actually felt giddy over the cubs and little Timon cause they were just so darn cute (the meerkat behaviors were spot on). Beyoncé sung with Glover beautifully, but her single that came out of nowhere ruined the pacing. It felt jammed in there, totally unnecessary; sorry Bey.",The Lion King

I really liked it, but there are some things I would change. For example, I think that they did not put much effort in giving this movie the dramatic effect as they did in the classic. There were not facial expresses which are from huge importance for that strong and dramatic effect which we saw in the original. I know that they wanted this movie to be realistic as much as it could be, so lions and other animals could not have such expresses.

1773,patleonita,"Enjoyable, but less magic.",5,25 July 2019,"The Lion King ('94) is one of my favorite movies and I practically memorized all the dialogues by now.So my first complain is; the missing important lines and/or scenes. I realize they cut some of the scenes (songs included, like 'Be Prepared') short, and while I don't mind that I wish they put better substitute in the screen time. It almost seems they rushing like they are running out of time or something. And there are some lines, some very critical lines in character's development that just gone. Where's Mufasa's ""Simba, you have forgotten who you are, so you have forgotten me.""? Sure they put some substitute lines but the initial value seems lessened, why bother changing it?Second, the expressions. Yes, the whole movie is beautiful. Stunning. The Circle of Life scene is breathtaking, I almost teared up. But as soon as the characters start conversing, the life is just gone. Initially, I didn't mind the whole real-life-lion faces, but during the stampede (which is easily one of my favorite part of the original movie, thus anticipated) I realized that the lack of expression DO take away the magic, the tragicness, the hand-clenching fear of it. And also, in addition to their limitation in expressing facial emotions-Third, the voice acting. I couldn't really put it in words, but some of the voice acting just didn't do it at all for me. Surprisingly, I love Scar in here. It's different than Jeremy Irons's Scar and I really appreciate it. He's much more realistic this way. 'Be Prepared', albeit shorter, is well done and fitting. Props to Chiwetel Ejiofor. James Earl Jones is still THE Mufasa. John Oliver's Zazu is good. And I love Timon and Pumbaa here, their dynamic is fresh. So where's the complain? Unfortunately, it lies in the main characters.Cub Simba could do much better than that. Donald Glover is likeable when Simba's happy and all, but when it got serious or emotional, his voice just didn't fit... Or his acting just didn't do it for me. Beyonce's too. Her voice acting is a bit flat in my opinion. And I simply dislike their take on 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'.And to conclude this, I'm actually confused. What approach did Disney originally want with this remake? Did they want to make a carbon copy remake? Or did they want to create a fresh new take on the original cartoon? Because as beautiful as this movie is, story wise there are no improvements. But as a carbon copy remake, it also fell flat. I wish they could pick a clearer path for this. Because while I appreciate the scene-by-scene recreation (the opening scene made me sigh happily with burst of nostalgia) with the same flow and all, there are lot of new scenes, or same scenes with different take that are placed awkwardly.But hey, Hans Zimmer is still freaking amazing and Lebo M is back. Thank God for that.All in all, I enjoyed it. But I really, really wish it could be better and more consistent in its approach.",The Lion King
1774,ahmedelamings,The best Disney remake Ever!!!,10,12 August 2019,"I think the biggest mistake the critics have made is to compare the original movie with the new movie , so there is no comparison between them. We know that the original movie is the best because the cartoon images are able to show their emotions. But the new movie amazing in itself, even though real images are less emotional because real animals don't have emotions.
The director and the cast did great job since they keep the soundtrack and some funny and best scenes from the original movie and even make them better.",The Lion King

Now I'm watching it again with them who is now and adult.
Those folks that gave this movie version a 1 or 2 stars are dead wrong. Stop worrying...Sit back and relax...enjoy the movie. Hakuma Matata...:)",The Lion King
1776,mhyrysmm,Very disappointed,1,29 July 2019,"The voice actress did terrible!!! The original Lion King had so many emotions, the live Lion King I felt absolutely nothing! It's not worth seeing in theater.
Such a disappointment.",The Lion King
1777,cavanwright,"It's ok, not fantastic.",4,2 August 2019,"This was always going to be a hard film to remake. The original was just so amazing. I felt like they missed the mark on what made the original so good; it wasn't the story, it was the colour, the sound, the fun, music, joy and sadness all at the same time.What really did it for me was the scene for ""Just Can't wait to be King"". It was so vibrant and fun and silly in the first movie, yet here it felt so lacklustre and I just kept feeling disappointed.Also terribly disappointing was the ""Be Prepared"" scene. It was truly epic in the original and it came across as a mix between an awkward poem and a bad rap, in a cave.It did look very realistic, don't get me wrong. But Disney doesn't need to be realistic. Disney movies need to feel fun. Can we hand it over to the team that did Aladdin and let them have a go please.",The Lion King
1778,triculous,Unnecessary piece of hot garbage,1,5 August 2019,"Absolutely unnecessary. I have no issue with the fact that the script is almost identical to the beginning. But the only good thing I can lend to this movie is how incredible the technical achievement is. That's where the praises end. Whomever decided upon the vocalists for the music must've also been in charge of booking Russell Crowe for Les Miserables, because the choices in singers were beyond terrible.",The Lion King

1780,lisapickstock,Disappointing,3,11 August 2019,"CGI looked beautiful but film fell totally flat.
None of the emotion of the original and some of the voice actors were not very good.
Have to agree with other reviewers, it was unnecessarily heavy on the Beyonce element.
James Earl Jones was wonderful as always and I did like Timon and Pumba.
Can't help but feel it was a bit of a waste of time really. What is the point of remaking a classic if you're not going to improve it?",The Lion King
1781,Twin2019,The original was better - not worth the money to see!!!,1,10 August 2019,"This movie was not great like the original. If it had came out first- it still wouldn't be great. I don't think this remake whole to all the characters in the original movie.
It didn't keep my kids attention either. It was a waste of money!",The Lion King
1782,mmcsec,"Movie was gret, but some voice actors could have been better.",8,19 July 2019,"Timon was to odd and not cynical enough. Scar was not really frightening. Some funny phrases were left out such as when the hyenas mock Scar. Among others, etc.",The Lion King
1783,sarahbauman,Awful.,1,31 October 2020,"I'd give it -7 stars except Billy Eichner deserves 8, so it gets 1. He's great. But I can't finish it. Key moments from the original are gone (aka every moment that made you laugh) and just enough of the writing/dialogue has been changed to ruin it. ""And I'd get downhearted, every time that I -"" pulled a John Ralphio ""Big Ben clock."" The whole point is to make kids giggle because you know what he's going to say but then DOESN'T - THAT IS THE JOKE. I can't finish this.

1784,comydow,It's Amazing!,10,19 July 2019,"Absolutely LOVED this new version of The Lion King! It's epic, emotional, and visually stellar! Before this movie was ever released, it was expected for it to simply be a beautiful live-action (photorealistic cgi) version of the same story, same songs, etc. Not sure why people were expecting something different than that. The point is to literally see the movie as a photorealistic visual piece with an amazing new cast (except for James Earl Jones of course). Again, I really loved this movie! Definitely recommended!",The Lion King
1785,ds-84251,estranged,1,6 December 2019,"I was ready to be blown away. I am sure it took a lot of work to make this film look like it does but I was very dissappointed.
They took the charisma out of Scar and the rambuctiousness out of Rafiki and replaced them with nothing. The songs didn't have any groove and this new dynamic between Nala and Simba is annoying. Nala was presented as a strong girl in the original and there was no need to overcomplicate that in this remake.
I also expected more from the visuals as the original looked BEAUTIFUL.",The Lion King
1786,skrubosaurus,6/10,6,12 October 2019,"Pros -
1. The cgi is incredible, it looks gorgeous.
2. Kept to the storyline and didn't really change it much other than a few little scenes and voice lines
3. For those saying it didn't keep to the emotional level.. yeah, agreed but it's still a heart ripping scene when simba lies under his dads chin! (Gonna be a con too)
4. I was shocked that it was better than I thought it was gonna be.. lion king is my favourite Disney film and didn't agree that this film should be touched but they didn't do a half bad job!
5. Kept to the original songs (this is gonna be a con too though!)Cons -
1. They got James to re-play mufasa! Awesome!! But why not get Jeremy Irons back to play scar?!! No one has that sly sinister voice quite like Mr Irons has!
2. Beyoncé.. now I like Beyoncé but she killed her part.. her voice didn't suit nala at all! Her voice in the songs were to over powering like she was trying to ""stand in the spot light""
3. Aaaand here's the con for the emotional one... I found the voice lines wasn't as passionate as they were in the original and I found Mufasa's voice had more umf/power in the original like it was deeper and a lot more king/dominant lion like.
4. I loved scar having his black Maine in the original.. it made him look the part.. yet they didn't give it him in the re-make? Wtaf..
5. Aaaand here's the con about keeping to the same songs... they got different people to re-do them and they killed them compared to the original, yeah I get that they're gonna change things up but man, the songs just wasn't no where near as good as they were.In all, it was better than I thought.. so ima give it a 5.5/10 (had to put 6/10 to round it) but the original is a solid 100/10. The best Disney film ever made.",The Lion King
1787,dmatrix-33779,Disney what have you done?!,1,16 October 2019,"Sometimes its good for these companies not to just remake movies for the sake of remaking them. This was totally not done well in my opinion. I do not recommend anyone to watch this remake. Its far much better to go rewatch the 1994 version. This one had terrible people doing the voices.
The star casting of Beyonce, Danny Glover, Seth Rogen, John Kani, and others may have got audiences excited when it was announced, I feel they failed to live up to the billing.
Animators could not give their creation any soul. It was so dry. It wasn't even funny. Jokes were dry, the musical performances were not as good",The Lion King

Music was better than I anticipated considering the soundtrack that came out prior to the movie's release (mehhh).Echoing others: no soul. It was apparent in the opening scene. an ICONIC scene in Disney animation was just- flattened. I would have rather had a totally different shot list with the same music. Why try to recreate something we already know? There's no magic in that.And I have to agree with everyone else. I love Bey...this wasn't her greatest moment.",The Lion King

1792,hpfanalex,"Loads of potential, not quite there.",8,6 December 2019,"I really liked this movie. As a remake is does it's job, telling the same story in ""live action"". However, some parts don't quite hit the mark. One prime example is Mufasa's death. While I think JD McCrary did a decent job as young Simba, he couldn't give the scene the same emotion as the original and I felt that scene was quite rushed. I also think Beyonce as Nala was not the greatest choice. She does an okay job, but that's about it. There were also quite a few good parts to this. Timon and Pumbaa were played brilliantly, and added the right comedic touch that was needed. The CGI and visuals were both absolutely stunning. Overall, I liked The Lion King, but I would have loved to see a bit more emotion in the performances of the actors.",The Lion King

I would expect people to be more objective.Honestly I'd give it 9 out of 10, because something did feel a bit off, I'm not sure what, but seeing as it got so much hate for seriously no reason, I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10 to balance the scales a bit.Don't rate the movie before you watch it and think about it, because that is just hating and it is unfair to the people who made this amazing movie happen.To the movie makers: Keep up a good job guys and I'm waiting for The Lion King 2 from the same amazing team!

1795,grendelnightmares,A disappointingly bad remake of an un-remake-able classic,4,31 January 2020,"The good:
-Hans Zimmer's score. That was a given. The score is about on par with his score from the original, though I do prefer the original ""...To Die For"" instead of the new ""Stampede."" Otherwise, it felt like a really nice remaster of the original score.
-They actually sing The Lion Sleeps Tonight to completion!
-Some scenes (that are almost exactly like the scenes from the original, mind you) are genuinely magnificent to look at and experience.
-Seth Rogen actually makes a pretty good Pumbaa.
-Beyoncé is great, surprisingly.
-For the most part, the visuals are truly remarkable in terms of realism.
-The kid who plays Young Simba plays him eerily similarly to the original child who played Young Simba. It's uncanny.
-Most of the supporting performances are fine.The Bad:
-Whose idea was it to give Eddie actual lines? I mean, I love Eric Andre, but still!
-The opening scene looks like it's from a video game cutscene (a recent video game, mind you, but still, it has some of the weaker effects in the film, disappointingly).
-Donald Glover as Simba is...eh? I mean, Simba in general is weirdly uninteresting in this movie.
-The cover of Circle of Life is...not great.The Ugly:
-Wow. The animals have literally no emotion whatsoever. Their faces are just there. They look like animals. Especially Zazu, he by far had the least emotion in the film, and watching his beak simply go up and down when he talks was weird.
-The animations are sometimes not great, which ruins the realism of the visual effects.
-WHO DECIDED TO CHANGE BE PREPARED?! This version of Be Prepared was absolutely awful. The original was better by several orders of magnitude. It's barely even a song, it's mostly just a rhyming speech with music playing in the background. It started to actually get good after a little while, I was finally starting to dig where it was going...AND THEN IT ENDED! It was so bafflingly short. It was embarrassing.
-Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar was pretty abysmal. I don't blame Ejiofor, but he is absolutely not intimating at all. I do blame him for his delivery of certain lines, though. Where Jeremy Irons delivered them with genuine malice and swagger, Ejiofor just sounds like a whiny child.
-The film completely lacks the soul and the goofiness of the original film. It feels bland and lacking. The slapstick comedy is gone, the animals' emotions are gone, the very likeable villain is gone...it's just empty. Favreau seems to have just taken the visuals and the writing from the original movie and just made it photorealistic, but he forgot to make the rest of the movie, if that makes sense.Overall, this remake is exactly why Disney needs to stop remaking classic films. Art is timeless. No one goes around painting new versions of the Mona Lisa or Starry Night, or writing new versions of The Lord of the Rings. The same should be the case for films.",The Lion King

1797,haykarra,trash,2,29 January 2020,"I hear a lot of people state that it's a pointless rehash, but I think think this movie is much worse than a rehash. there is no substance to the movie whatsoever. all the lions look the same, I didn't like any of the characters, the colours were dull, everything was just lifeless.the dialogue was also genuinely painful to listen to, it's like the entire script what ad libbed because it's just so unnatural and awkward. this made the jokes especially unfunny, even if they used the same jokes as the original it was still unfunny because every line in this movie was delivered horrendously.I want a special paragraph to talk about the be prepared scene- oh my lord. like why even include it if you're butchering it that's much. it's not really a song, it's more scar yelling the lyrics with some generic stock movie music in the background. i'm not kidding when I say he's yelling, he yells a lot of the lyrics which makes the song a lot less menacing.it seems no one wants to be there, the voice acting is just so dull and everything about this movie is dull. god, i really dislike this movie. perhaps i'm just butthurt because I really liked the original but I just can't stand this movie.I gave it 2 starts though because the animation was gorgeous! it was not meant for this movie in particular but I can still appreciate the undeniable effort put in by the animation team, a lot of the scenes are so beautiful and you cannot tell them apart from reality.anyway, I don't recommend this movie at all. sorry for the negativity in this review, i just really wanted to point out things I noticed.",The Lion King

Everything that made the original so epic is missing here! The delivery of the lines was incredibly bland (like absolutely no emotion) the songs were flat, the way they sung the songs was way too extra and the some of the best dialogue from the original is missing.

1800,stacierjet,Couldn't finish it,3,24 February 2020,"I am very late to the party, but decided to wait until this movie was released to Disney+ to check it out. Hearing mixed reviews, I wanted to give it a chance myself.I can understand the frustration of those who grew up on 80s and 90s Disney, like myself. While remakes are not intended to be carbon copies of their originals, the story should not drastically change from one version to the other.Many of the scenes were changed to the point of annoyance. The elephant graveyard scene, undoubtedly a classic and one of Disney's best (with the mix of dialogue, camera work and visuals) was completely changed. Additional characters are added for...? It's not entirely clear. Shenzi, Banzai and Ed make this scene. While CGI lions will not showcase the emotion we see on Simba and Nala's face, the dialogue can easily supplement that. Instead, we are presented with what is almost a complete change in character in Simba. Zazu's role in the scene is drastically reduced, cutting out some of his best work. Shenzi is instead presented as some evil mastermind, speaking in hyperboles and metaphors.Each scene felt like it was rushed to get to the next, only to rush that, too. The opening scene is one that many 90s Disney's kids can relate to. I still get chills during the opening. The sunrise over the Savanna, mixed with the opening line is some of Disney's best work to date. Again, instead, we are given lackluster vocals and a scene that relies heavily on its visual representation instead of the formula that was proven both successful and alluring.The dialogue loses its richness with the voice acting, which is lackluster at best.The camera work moves quickly. There is a lot of beauty to be found in this film, if one slows down the scene to a half-speed. One benefit that a live-action film has in this setting is capturing the environment in which we see the characters. We are given flashes of the scenery, followed by dialogue that does not supplement, followed by a quickened plot.The film falls incredibly short overall. I am disappointed.",The Lion King

Sigh, as to the rest...The ONLY reason I chose to see this in theaters rather than wait for dvd release was James Earl Jones. I thought the casting seemed weak for the shoes they had to fill. I thought Seth Rogan did well though with the script he was given.The fact that they left SO many crucial lines out though. IE; Follow old Rafiki, he knows de way, the entire in the past scene, OMG the soft it is time line at the end!!!!! I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts fiddly dee, I know I'm missing a bunch, but u get my point.

1826,Disneyfan16672,"""Remember Who You Are""",10,19 July 2019,"It was 25 years ago that I witnessed what would become one of the most important films I would ever watch. ""The Lion King"" to me was more than just a movie, it was an experience. The breathtaking animation, the catchy songs, the memorable and lovable characters, the beautiful underscore, and an epic story that took reference from Biblical and Shakespearian sources (the tales of Joseph, Moses, and especially Hamlet in particular). My love of all things Disney can trace itself back to this film and the animated classic continues to bring me joy, laughter, and tears every time I sit down to watch it. When I heard that the film would be getting a new photorealistic CGI remake, I was excited but also nervous. How do you go about perfecting what to many is already a perfect story? The short answer is: you don't. Director Jon Favreau holds the original classic in high regard as this new adaption is quite beholden to it. If you are afraid of any major changes or grand twists to the story such as those found in the recent adaptations of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""Maleficent"", you needn't worry. This is a faithful reimagining much like the recent remakes of ""Aladdin"", ""The Jungle Book"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" complete with all the songs you know and love and an A-List cast of actors to portray our favorite characters. Watching the film unfold is akin to experiencing the wildlife, environments, and majesty of the African savannah play out before your very eyes. The visuals are stunning, and it is an absolute wonder to behold how far computer-generated imagery has come. The actors chosen to inhabit their roles fit their characters perfectly. The standouts for me in particular were J.D. McCrary as Young Simba (channeling the same youthful exuberance, impetuousness, and emotion of Johnathan Taylor Thomas before him), Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as the comedic duo Timon and Pumbaa (who while taking cues from the animated classic still manage to make the roles their own to hilarious results) and returning cast member James Earl Jones as the mighty Mufasa who brings the same gravitas, warmth, and presence he brought to the original story a quarter century prior. While this film does beg the question of its existence if it isn't going to bring anything new to the table, the eye-pleasing visuals, epic untouched story, and memorable characters are still worth the price of admission alone. ""The Lion King"" is a story in the tradition of classic epics that will continue to be retold and reimagined in many different formats far beyond our lives, and will continue to entertain for generations to come.",The Lion King

The songs were so much better than the original because all of the lyrics were clearly enunciated, so we were able to hear every word the characters were saying during the songs.

How people are saying it has no heart/soul is beyond me, I was in tears! The emotion in the animals faces is astounding.

1832,Chako_Official,An average version of a much better cartoon,6,1 December 2019,"My question is simple: if none of us ever saw the original cartoon, would this be a good movie?
I personally don't think so. I think it's just a realistic version of the original motion picture, but that's definitely not enough!!!
Obviously I love the story, and I usually like the way Disney is approaching to these remakes. But this time I guess they just missed something.Maybe it's the missing of expressions on too-much-realistic animals, maybe it's just that adapting a cartoon to a movie without actually adapting the story and the rhythm is just not possible, I don't know...While the jungle book left me with a positive vibe, this one left me just asking myself: was it worth it?",The Lion King
1833,hotguy1328,The best Disney real life adaptation yet,10,24 July 2019,"I saw The Lion King last night and was amazed how everything looked- from the African savanna to the animals. I thought the casting was great, I especially liked Chiwetel Ejiofor in his performance as Scar. A lot people are complaining because the animals didn't show emotions, but they conveyed it in others ways like there voice. Examples of this were the anger conveyed by Scar, the happiness of Simba and Nala at play, or the sadness Simba displayed over the death of his father. The CGI was so real at times that I thought I was watching Animal Planet. The bottom line is the critics are wrong about this movie. It was excellent. This is by far the best real life adaptation of an animated movie thus far. Do not listen to what any of the haters are saying, see this movie for yourself and you will not be disappointed.

1836,stefan_gw,"Beautifully made, but...",6,17 July 2019,"First of all, there are so many reviews that say ""bad voice acting"". I disagree.
It was great, albeit different from the original (which is not a bad thing).
What did bother me, was that there is no risk taken whatsoever. For this I removed a star.
Unlike the previous remakes (Dumbo, Aladdin) where there are new or changed scenes.
Now those scenes did not necessarily improve the film but they tried to make it somewhat different.The Lion King (2019) is an exact copy of the animation film. With amazing looking visuals that is. If they did not butchered the amazing ""be prepared"" song it would also be an extra star.
The difference in all the songs is that these feel, by a lack of better words, very ""Album/studio recorded"", they miss a kind of playfulness that was in the originals. Also Beyonce's
vibrato-voice does not do the song ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" much good.To sum things up:
Not a bad film.
Amazing visuals.
""Be Prepared"" is butchered.
Other songs miss playfulness of the original.",The Lion King

Me and my son went to see it today and we both enjoyed it. It was not meant as a replacement to the original that you all enjoyed. It is not taking anything away from that. You can still watch the original if you prefer. If you don't like the new movie, don't watch it. It wasnt made for you.",The Lion King
1838,ecabrales88,Simply amazing,10,20 July 2019,Disney out does itself again. You have to keep an open mind and don't try to compare it to the original. It is a CGI masterpiece and the comedy between Timon and Pumba is amazing.,The Lion King
1839,Nsrule,Some can't get passed their own nostalgia...,6,27 July 2019,"Like so many have said, Timon and Pumba were the standout performances for me. The film sprung into much more life when they entered the film (wasn't a fan of the fart jokes though, never am).I wasn't particularly impressed with the opening sequence with Circle of Life. The shot for shot CGI remake was fine and you could just See how much effort had gone in to the realism of the animals, but the song just did not carry the same weight as the original. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was the volume. Maybe it's my own nostalgia. But something seemed flat and off and it just didn't deliver the magic for me.I'm on the opposite side to some with Scars' ""Be Prepared"". I didn't think it was necessary in song at all. I think it should have been delivered as a speech turned up a notch to keep him menacing and cruel. His appearance didn't offend as much as I thought, but he came off more as a pantomime villain.The entire closing act when Simba returns to Pride Rock is stunning. Full of intensity and drama.The film in a while was a good watch, entertaining with some good voice acting in parts, and fantastic CGI. Emotional moments hit in certain parts, but in a while I agree with a lot of people that the ""magic"" just didn't seem to be there. And again, Beyoncé just did not need to be in this.",The Lion King
1840,lasse-gabrielsen,"Darker, more serious, but still very emotional",9,16 August 2019,"I get emotional from this the same way I feel bad for leaving my cat or dog at home when going somewhere. Just because they don't raise their eyebrows doesn't mean they don't feel anything, and if you're not willing to actively read emotions into their eyes yourself, then I guess it's not for you. But like I mentioned, it wasn't a problem for me, and it came naturally.This remake also made the movie better in many ways. The humour, although subjective, was better and more suited for me now that I'm 25 years older. I also enjoyed the way Scar interacts with the hyenas in the remake. We now have a scene where he approaches them, convincing them to join him, instead of already being their ""leader"". This adds depth to both the story and his character.For the Beyonce critique I can't really relate because I've barely listened anything to her, and wouldn't really recognise her voice if I wasn't told beforehand it was her, so I can't really say she's stealing the show either. Maybe it's an advantage that comes from being from Norwegian opposed to American.When I got home I had to watch the original Lion King straight away. And even though the script is basically the same, they're two very different films. While the original one is mostly light-hearted, this is dark and very serious. Which I think also justifies toning down Scar a bit in the remake. During Be Prepared in the remake I drew parallels to Hitler, which was absolutely terrifying, and makes Scar an even greater villain, and it also makes the final battle incredibly powerful.I really don't understand the criticising bandwagon. I get it's a touchy topic as the film has meant so much for so many (me included - my first memory from going to the cinema was with my dad to the Lion King. He passed away a few years ago, my Mufasa is gone too), but it definitely delivered.",The Lion King
1841,wimperd,Rushed,4,20 July 2019,"This review might contain spoilers on the plot line, but hey... if you don't know the plot line you probably don't live on earth.Let me start by saying, I absolutely love the original Lion King film, and the musical. That's also why I was highly anticipated to see this. And I must say, it's visually stunning, and it took me back to the old days. But unfortunately, they did something terrible to the script.The film lacks character depth in pretty much every character, this is mainly caused by the fact that all dialogues are rushed. It's like they cut half an hour of dialogue from the original, and also took away all the pauses. This has the effect that you just don't ""feel"" the story anymore. You don't feel the paternal bond between Simba and Mufasa, you don't feel the internal struggle that Scar goes through and you can't feel any love tonight between Nala and Simba.(pun intended)There are many parts that illustrate this, but one that particularly sums it up well: The moment that Nala and Simba see each other again, after being separated for years. It starts with Nala chasing Pumba in a scene that could have been taken straight from the ""earth"" series. It looks absolutely amazing and takes quite some time. Then Simba comes into play, he and Nala fight a bit, they recognize each other, share a ""where have you been for all this time"" and a ""you need to come back"" and the scene ends. I haven't measured, but I'd say this scene is about 4 minutes chase, and about 30 seconds of dialogue, while it should have been the other way around. It just completely doesn't cover the emotional charge that it should have had. To me this scene pretty much sums up the movie.So is it all bad? No, again, it looks awesome! And it takes you back to the old days! So I would still advise you to go see it, but make sure you do it in imax or Dolby digital, to really get the best out of it.Oh and one last thing, I absolutely loved the casting. Especially Jon Oliver as Zazu. But they really swung and missed on Beyonce. Her voice just doesn't match the character. If they would have cast her for Sarabi (Simba's mom) I would have thought it would have been spot on, but I think the problem is we all know that Beyonce is in her late 30's and Nala's supposed to be a young adult.",The Lion King
1842,rtatham13,Dull with a dark undertone,4,28 July 2019,"First of all, I am a HUGE Disney fan and absolutely loved the original animation.However, Favrea's remake was really disappointing and to be honest, quite pointless.I feel that he tried so hard to perfect the CGI in this version that adding a voice to each of the animals just looked unrealistic (almost like watching a David Attenborough doc but with talking animals...). Also the choice of casting wasn't great apart from Donald Glover and Seth Rogan.There were a few moments that tried to be funny as well through characters bickering with each other but they just weren't and the whole audience in the cinema remained quiet during every one of these moments. Even the songs were heavily auto tuned and lacked energy and 'oomph'.Everything was just really disappointing, and instead of being warm, heartfelt and emotional like the original, this remake had a darker undertone and was dull the whole way through.Maybe I'm just biased but I'm pretty sure 99.9% of people agree that this film was a big let down.Not worth going to see unless you want to feel disappointed.",The Lion King
1843,GalFisk,DON'T see it in 3D,4,21 July 2019,"This movie is not in 3D. The characters and the foregrounds are, but the backgrounds are completely flat. It was like seeing actors in front of a pained backdrop. Really took me out of the experience.The photorealism is gorgeous, but it really takes away the emotional impact the characters are supposed to have. The lack of human facial expressions could have been compensated for with more expressive body language, but it wasn't.The motion is almost perfect. Animators sometimes forget about the mass and inertia of large characters (horse in Brave, I'm looking at you), but it was wonderfully depicted here. The stampede lacked a certain sense of urgency though, it seems that the reference material was of animals running to get somewhere, not fleeing in panic.",The Lion King

But this Film is like sitting in an elevator. I sat in this Movie focusing Kids as an audience and those kids in my cinema laughed only when Pumba farted during the stars scene. 3 Stars: 1 for German Scar Sychro, 1 for the very impressive visuals, 1 for ""the lion sleeps tonight"".

This is a ""live action"" style remake, I don't want to see true to life looking animals showing emotions they aren't capable of doing. I enjoyed the realism. I think they did well.Only major complaint was I wasn't feeling nala's adult voice actor. Scar, Simba, Timon, pumba, all did a great job. Everyone's just being extra harsh because they hyped it too hard and let childhood memories skew their opinion. There is no way this should ever deserve any 1 star reviews.

I'm comparing it to the live action remake of Aladdin and Lady and the Tramp in particular. I've seen Beauty and the Beast's remake, but I don't remember it. Suffice it to say that in each instance, the original animated film was simply better. Better timing, better flow, better humor, better drama, better heros, heroines, and better villains. Better dialogue. The remake of The Lion King comes close to the original. Maybe it's unfair to compare the ""live action"" remakes to the originals - but, if that's the case, they shouldn't have made the remakes so very similar to the originals.

The one I was most nervous about was Seth Rogen as Pumba but I loved the chemistry between him and Billy and all the new dialogue was hilarious.

I did go into it with an open mind and trying not to compare with the original, but as it is a direct remake of the original how can one NOT compare??First thing that bugged me was the audio mixing.. it seemed really off and hollow. Instrumentals were REALLY out of place and ruined the pacing.. when Mufasa is warned early on that hyenas are on pride land the music just stays boring and slightly cheery.. no sense of danger or even worry. That same tone (or lack of) was the same throughout the rest.Next was the casting.. mainly Scar and Rafiki. These are critical characters and I think just horribly miscast and scripted.. Rafiki is supposed to be quirky and the soul of the story but instead just falls completely flat and emotionless. I felt nothing towards the character other than indifference. John Oliver as Zazu was a miss.. he normally is great but they needed to let him off the chain. It sounded like he was reading off a script with a gun to his head. Timon and Pumba were okay.. but just so much was missing. Donald Glover and James Earl Jones were glimmers of light.The hyenas were so horribly disappointing.. all humor was removed except for 2 individuals who just came across as awkward. The rest if the hyenas were essentially faceless 'monsters'.Overall it definitely missed some key critical points and all the voice actors (yes, all) sound completely hollow and bored.. it is almost a perfect storm of missed opportunities that culminated in a snore fest that will haunt my dreams for years to come.",The Lion King

The movie was a visual masterpiece to say the least.Having said that couple of scenes that comes to my mind that was a let down for me were when Nala and Simba reunite and when Mufasa speaks to Simba through the clouds. In the former I felt the surprise element that was there in the earlier movie upon seeing each other after years, was very short in this one. And in the other scene, which I feel was one the most important scene/conversation of the movie didn't live up to the mark.

This can't and won't touch that. But as a film this still has legs ( or paws ) and brings its own charm.
The cinematography is stunning and effects mind blowing. Most of the characters fit well and there are subtle changes to the storyline.
I don't think this is meant to replace the original, but instead compliment it. I enjoyed both and actually there are some scenes that are better in the live adaption. The lion sleeps tonight scene is certainly one that comes to mind.
Yes there are also lots of scenes that don't quite match the original.
But you can enjoy both and fans of the original could certainly appreciate both for what they are.
If there was no original Lion King and people were watching this movie fresh, the critics would give this a much higher score.

1869,samvonlehe,What a disappointment,5,20 July 2019,Not sure how some people are actually saying the acting and singing was good in this movie. The acting was completely lifeless. I can't begin to describe how bad of a cast scar was. His song be prepared was by far the worst song in the whole movie. Seth rogan was a great pumbaa aside from the fact he can't sing for anything. This timon was ok but nothing compared to the original. Hakuna matata was just plain bad here. Beyonce was the best singer and i didn't think she was even good. Rafiki was ok but didn't compare to the original. The cgi was amazing but that was basically all that was good about this movie. Really really disappointed in this movie. All the disney remakes are just completely missing the magic,The Lion King

For me, the common viewer, this was perfection! It was sending me back to my childhood, to those times when I couldn't understand any english word but still watching this cartoon over and over again on our VCR.
I enjoyed every single moment of it.
It was, it is and it will be my favorite movies of all times!",The Lion King

1874,lmonahan91,Not horrible,6,29 August 2020,"The graphics are beautiful but I agree with the other reviews, it's lacking. The music was very very disappointing. I did like Simba/Danny Glover and Pumba/Seth Rogan was good. Timon was not good, singing not on key? I wonder why they didn't use as many original voices as they could. It's worth watching for the graphics but then watch the original immediately following to erase the disappointment.",The Lion King

1878,mohammed_1910,Stunning CGI with nothing new to add,6,17 July 2019,"No one can deny the beauty of the artistic work that the CGI team has created, but it seriously added nothing new to the movie. Some additional scenes that serves nothing but extra time.
Scar's song, Be Prepared had good voice acting but nothing visually interesting. The animals super realistic which means they showed no emotions in their faces.
Timon and Pumbaa stole the show for me, but still there was something missing. Timon was not always in control like in the original.If you want to watch it to see the new CGI skin on an old beloved movie, with some of the songs shortened, then go ahead, you'll have a great time.",The Lion King
1879,jade_charlene,"High expectation, but it was very flat and mediocre",3,4 November 2019,"I had high expectations for this movie, not only because I loved the movie when I was growing up but also because the trailer for this movie was very beautiful in my opinion. Well, the trailer had all the few pretty moments of the movie in it so that makes sense.During the entire movie I was missing something, I can't really describe it because it was more a feeling. When I watch the original movie I still cry and sob. Well, this movie doesn't even come close to let me feel emotions. It was just so disappointing in everything, the face expressions, the voices, overall movements of the characters. It was so flat. The animation overall was very beautiful, but only that. This movie lacked every detail to even come close to the original. It was boring and indescribable flat. Where Aladdin was in every aspect a complement to the original Aladdin, was this a poorly done imitation. 5 out of 10 for the potential and the overall graphics.",The Lion King

For the rest, I felt like I was watching an Animal Planet documentary instead of a Lion King movie.The animals in this movie are so overly realistic that it ultimately took away the expressiveness of the animals, especially Simba, the protagonist of the movie. Apart from the lack of expressiveness of the animals, the movie is nothing new, it's pretty much the same thing I've seen in the animated movie that is far superior to this photorealistic movie.",The Lion King

However - unlike the Beauty and The Beast remake, and the Mary Poppins sequel - this left me feeling rather flat. There's something missing: I didn't FEEL the emotion from the characters. The songs are sung well but lacked the spark of the original.
Definitely worth a watch. But I wasn't blown away.",The Lion King

The movie score for lion king 2019 was flat, like they bended/stretched notes where it ruined the flow of the music, in my opinion. Also with the music they sang ""can you feel the love tonight"" when it wasn't even in the evening so the scene and the music didn't add up. My favourite characters are timon & pumba and their voice actors so I was let down by this new cast.For this movie all I wanted was the complete copy of the original but upgraded visuals.

The CGI and it makes you appreciate the original even more. The most powerful scenes that were in the animated movie leave NO IMPACT in the so-called ""live-action"" remake. Mufasa's death is laughable here, ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL SCENES IN MOVIE HISTORY IS LAUGHABLE IN THIS VERSION. Scenes are rushed, voice acting weak...What was the purpose of this movie? The Jungle Book at least TRIED. It expanded on the original cartoon, although it was still a forgetable movie. Timon & Pumba are good because they stand out from the other ""voice actors"" in their performance, timing and delivery.In the end I felt empty. I went to see the original right after this and I loved it even more after seeing this, so I guess it has that going for it.A movie trying to bank on your nostalgia.

If you want to make a play by play remake at least try to recapture some of the emotion of the original! I mean what the heck was be prepared?! Mufasa is still great but the whole movie was so forced, it was painful.

Then, for some reason, someone thought to re-do this Disney Classic. How can you compare the voice acting of Alan Rickman as Skar, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, Nathan Lane as Timon or Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, (a hyena)? I would venture to say that even James Earl Jones, reprising his role as Mufasa, cannot save this movie from its pretentiousness. I would strongly recommend parents buy the original 1994 The Lion King. Don't waste your money on Beyoncé's Nala, (and the lion king), hyped up version.",The Lion King

They looked so empty... Emotionless... The fight with Scar looked so weak ... The death of Mufasa wasn't so touching. Summarized the original it's superior by far.,The Lion King
1899,kiracharneca,Awesome,10,9 August 2019,"Just for FYI original Lion King is my favorite movie of all times, since I first saw it in cinema at the age of 9. That being said... People who loved the original's story will always love this version also. I've seen so many reviews claiming that you can't get the emotion out of this realistic animals... But maybe those people just can't figure out emotions at all. It was mesmerizing. I lived every single bit of it, I sang all the songs out loud. In fact, the only thing I was not so happy about was that there were some little differences in the the way the songs were sung. But other than that... Beautifull. Some of the time I even wondered if that was really an animation of an actual video. Loved it!",The Lion King
1900,smjoshkim,Negative reviewers can't see past the original...,10,3 August 2019,"I enjoyed this film very much while appreciating the technology and the amount of work that went into this film to tell a timeless story. They wanted to push the envelope in what's possible and they did it very well.I challenge anyone to point out a single scene that we did not feel we were seeing the real thing. For those of you who thought it sucked, then it's because you were comparing it to the original that was an animation to make it more expressive as a human.In fact, EVERY SINGLE negative reviews are because they are comparing it to the animation... seriously, you were hoping they'd be able to make it more emotive and energetic based on REAL LIFE ANIMAL models?If Lion King first came out as a motion picture with real animals, this is how they would have done it. THAT WAS THE POINT. Those who are criticizing it because they were ""dull"" and lacking ""emotions"" well congratulations you just acknowledged animals can't appear as expressive as humans because we probably didn't get to see any real animals in such situations to begin with.So why such negativity? Why can't we appreciate the art form that have potentially changed people can do films like Avatar did a decade ago?What Avatar did ten years ago, I felt the same sense of awe with this movie and maybe even more so because it felt like I was actually witnessing the actual event after having spent the past quarter century being shown a sketch or a written account of that event.It honored the original and told the story as if they had to do it for real. I feel sorry for those who gave poor reviews because they missed the point.",The Lion King
1901,Daniel_225,Lukewarm in every sense of the word,2,27 July 2019,"This had to be the most disappointing theater experience ever. Like everyone else I desperately wanted to love this film but I couldn't trick myself into liking it. Everything was just so lackluster and I was embarrassed I took my family to see it. This movie was so lame, it was like the Avatar movie to the TV show or a Transformer movie: all style and political correctness, no substance. I'm not good at writing reviews but I know this film was not crafted well at all, so I'll just list points as I think of them in no particular order:*Disney biggest problem in general is they know how to create atmosphere but not the actual product. You can see the same even at their parks, like on the Finding Nemo ride, the queue is more exciting than the actual ride
*The music just falls flat. The lady they got to sing the Circle of Life was not a strong singer like the original. Just Can't Wait to Be King was boring. I learned Donald Glover can't sing through Hakuna Matata. Spirit was a nice song but seemed forced. They cut out the Can you Feel the love instrumental prelude from the betrothel scene and the Hula Song. The final duel scene score was changed.
*They wanted to give the hyenas and Nala extra dignity but it just made them boring
*Pacing was dragged out to make the movie longer instead of short and sweet, like a large and colorful but flavorless strawberry
*Nobody projected, everyone's voices sounded so ""thin"" with no emphasis or tensionThere's more but that's all I can think of for now",The Lion King

1904,nazarovcod4,Boring and unnecessary,1,20 July 2019,"The film is basically recreation of the original cartoon, but with cgi cartoon animals instead of 2D art. Because of realism there is no acting what so ever happening for the animals, you can not see if they are upset or happy, their face look exactly the same. The only way i could tell a difference between Sarabi and Nala is by voice. the original cartoon made them look different, but here all lions look the same. Singing my animals look unnatural, it's there is an evil spirit in them that make them talk.There are couple of decent jokes and maybe 1 new song, but is is just worst recreation of original with a lot of shots of African peisage, which you can get from any documentary about african nature.",The Lion King
1905,NiekieGee,Seen it in 4Dx and just really enjoyed it,8,31 July 2019,"I have never seen the former animated The Lion King, so no history there or need for comparison. We noticed during the movie that a lot of other people were singing along or even predicted out loud what would happen next. And no we didn't attent a matinee, so there were no children present, they were all grown ups. But that shows how much people loved the earlier animated version (as a part of their childhood) and perhaps that explains the bad reviews. I've read a lot of them and there are people that complain that this version is the exact same and others complain that it leaves out too many details. It seems that it could never live up to the expectation no matter what. We really enjoyed it, I get that the animated older version gives the animals more expression. But choosing to do it in real life form, is choosing for less expression. Because in real life a lion does not have human expressions. The CGI was breathtaking, and for us it was a combination of a great National Geographic documentary combined with a nice story (not too complicated). The 4Dx experience was also really great, and added just a little extra. So if you still haven't seen it, and you love the original just know that it is not the same and not just newer, but a completely different approach. Then you'll be fine and you can decide if this is something you want to see or not.",The Lion King

There was no excitement, Timon and Pumba was exiting, funny in the animation, in this one, they change their lines, their funny was less then entertaining. It's like they try to fix something that wasn't broken. Even the baboon was more lifting in the animation. I don't get how this movie has gotten such high reviews. I still watch the animation one and still get entertain, involve, enjoyment in the animation movie. This new version, i don't get it. You would of thought that all the adults that played in this movie, would have see animation one first to get the feel on how uplifting, funny, and the song where way better sang in the animation one then this one, they decided to change the song words.

1914,lovelyfish1,Emotionless,2,24 July 2019,"Honestly I kept up high ups up until the end, but seeing it was a huge disappointment. It followed the original fairly well, which I liked. Moving too far away from source material with a classic like this would have been a mistake, people would probably be upset by the changes made to the plot. The reason why I give it a 2 is because while the plot is still great and all, the overall movie is emotionless. It was more like watching a narrated animal documentary than anything else. The faces of the lions showed held no emotion. The voices almost seemed like they were oddly synced up to the animals, and lacked charisma.As a result this movie evokes little to no emotional reaction, which is sad.

It literally seemed like she was actually the same character as she was in dream girls, HERSELF. Very distracting. The spirit song in the movie was random and oddly edited. Why not just do a whole new sound track if that's the case. Also be prepared was my favorite song, why was he just speaking the words!? Certain scenes were exact and others they took out.

Personally, with Beauty and the beast, Aladin, Jungle Book, Dumbo, etc there were always a few diversions from the original storyline, in example Aladin, Genie now has a love story, and female characters have been made stronger. Dumbo has added human factor and animals no longer talk etc. So there were times in while watching that I was thinking, OK it has been long time since I watched the cartoon, is this how it happened?Lion King however seems like it has been copied frame by frame, with exactly same music, lyrics, same fantastic landscape etc. (It may have been a few changes, but not noticeable) I feel like this film was made, just to make the film into live action. I don't know why they didn't just use the final sound production from the original animation and just worked on the visual part this time, there was no need to hire new voice actors, singers etc.There are many reviews targeting Disney's greed and ways to make money, agree, but it's the users who fall for it, no one is forcing kids to exclusively watch Disney movies.I enjoyed the film in cinema with my kids, I was probably their age when I watched the original, the original made life-time memories, the live action however, not for me...",The Lion King
1928,hsmtour,Three changes should have been included:,8,20 July 2019,"The remake of the lion was without a doubt incredible. From the angles to the CGI- it was spectacular. However, there were three main flaws that could have really put this movie to be a 10/10 and captivated more of an audience.
1) Scar's solo of ""Be prepared"" was a total let down. Lasted a whole thirty seconds with a couple verses and nothing much of a chorus. This song had the ability to really set the tone for the antagonist (Scar) and his teaming up with the hyenas, but this song turned to be a let down and more of a ""Hey, I'll help you get more food if you help me kill Mufasa.""
2) Mufasa's death was SO underplayed. The scene was not near dramatized enough and the moment between Scar and Mufasa before him being pushed off the cliff lasted a whopping 2.4 seconds. Don't get me wrong- still super emotionally and heartbreaking but the moment definitely could have been more intentional and empathetic.
3) The reconciliation between Simba and Nala was way too quick. In a matter of two minutes Nala reunites with Simba and they immediately fall in love and never once really play the fact that they've been separated for years and both haven't seen each other since they were cubs. It was all way too rushed and Disney should have spent a little more time reconnecting their relationship when meeting in the jungle than just instantly making them fall in love and then ""departing"" after two minutes.
Overall, as you can tell by my rating, I thought it was phenomenal except for these three instances. The music (for the most part) was incredible, the realistic animation of the animals was remarkable, and the ability to keep the originality of the cartoon film with a new sense of humor was astounding. For instance the scene when Pumba and Timon distract the hyenas was perfect. They did not try to ""one - up"" the hilarious, original scene, but instead made their own clever yet still comical scene that made the audience roar with laughter. The movie should have been made longer, because it felt like it was kinda rushed at some parts (see numbers 1-3). However, this is my favorite Disney remake to this day, and I will definitely be returning to theatres to see this movie again.",The Lion King
1929,shinobiiabv,Nice Remake and stunning visual effects,8,18 July 2019,"It was a pleasure to watch a reamke of one of my childhood favourite movies. The story wasn't changed and the visual effecta was stunning. It was really interesting to see animation movie going real. Watched on IMAX and I think it is a must , the sound was amazing.",The Lion King
1930,fctfuentes,A Visual Feast,6,2 August 2019,"Disney's 2019 photorealistic remake of this 1994 animated classic was a full-on visual spectacle! It is the same old story you loved, the same old songs you sang to, and the same old characters you knew when you were a child. This might be the most straight up, shot for shot, beat by beat adaptation of a Disney classic. What it lacked in creativity story-wise, it compensated with a stunning exhibition of the great power of modern CGI. The way the characters talked, sang, and acted didn't bother me despite the negative comments made on the animals' lack of emotions because of the authenticity the creative team wanted the characters to display. The Lion King (2019) is best seen on the biggest screen possible.",The Lion King
1931,ZaidAhmedJawad,stop compare,9,26 July 2019,If you don't compare the original version with this version you will enjoy it very much,The Lion King
1932,naberjawad,Disappointing.,2,27 July 2019,"It feels like this movie was rushed and made in a hurry. Many parts from the original movie were massively shortened. The entire movie felt like a trailer for the actual movie. So I still feel like there needs to be a remake for the 1994 version, and that this was a test sample for it. Plus, there was no soul in it.",The Lion King
1933,attilian10,A glorified re-release,1,19 July 2019,"We first saw a full cast photo and expected so much. With them bringing back James Earl Jones we expected there to be a great story, that pays homage to the original. We were hoping for something new, something that the original lion king did. Bring new elements that we weren't expecting. They might as well have re-released the movie as an HD remaster. BARELY any differences other than the beautiful CG, which is great but that it. Nothing more, but CG as we know from Star Wars doesn't age well. From the start to finish we have barely any differences. Same lines from Jones, same script read out without Jeremy Iron's charm.",The Lion King

1935,kendric_dartis,Breathtaking,10,18 July 2019,Truly an amazing cast and cinematography! This is a showcase of the diaspora and all that it has to offer. Disney got it right and it truly is an amazing fable and displayed in amazing fashion.,The Lion King
1936,diallobanks,Bad,2,28 July 2019,"It was bland and soulless. It brought nothing to the table. At least with The Jungle Book (2016) it had some character to it and some charm. But this Lion King remake tries way to hard to literally recreate every scene and line in a way thats just painful and hard to watch. But, Donald Glover (Simba), Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) and Billy Eichner (Timon) save the show.",The Lion King
1937,Idos3333,Gets hate for stupid reasons,10,18 July 2019,The movie is almost the same as the original and people say it's a bad thing for no reason. The movie is probably the prettiest movie I've seen the music is top notch and the story didn't get worse it stayed the same which means it's still amazing. The expressions of the characters are a bit lacking because of the realistic look but it doesn't take up much of the experience.,The Lion King
1938,goughy_91,Great Movie,9,21 July 2019,"Look to be honest it's the same as the original.
But that's the point. It's a Digital remake why are you complaining??
Of course logging can match the original one but in this Stone Age when it's not a Sequel it's can come down to the small parts. The voice overs. The animations, and the accuracy of them, I enjoyed it throughout the film,You have to step back and realise it's a good movie: and you gotta base it of it's own merits.
It's not trying to compete with the original.
It's just remade a live action Version .
Simply put it's a great Movie and for anyone that likes animals a Must see.",The Lion King
1939,apollosneed,Well played,7,22 July 2019,"Loved how they stayed true to the original and the cgi was great. Only thing I didn't like was a couple of the voices, mainly young Simba and the grown up simba.",The Lion King
1940,pussy_cat_69,How dare you??,1,12 October 2019,"They removed the most important scene in the whole movie!
""What do you want me to do, dress in Drag and do the Hula?"". So that's where I left. Was planing on giving it a 5 for good picture, and I could have forgiven them butchering Hakuna Matata, but this? Nope!",The Lion King
1941,maximusau,Soulless and the music was ruined.,3,2 October 2020,"I watched it as the lion king is my favourite cartoon of all time. Even though this was terrible, I still have the original to love and watch.The songs were butchered, the voice acting felt flat, and no effort was put into it. No ""lovely bunch of coconuts"" !!! They changed they call me Mr Pig to an anti bully post.... COMEON!!! Seth Rogan, was the best voice actor in it, too bad some of material was terrible.EVERYONE knows Lion king for its music, the music in this was terrible, they ruined songs that didn't need to be touched.The extra hyena ""boss"" what's that all about?If you like the original, then this will really let you down. I gave it a three as it looked good, but too good, so you could not feel the emotion in the movie. This is the first cartoon that made me cry and even though I have watched it many times it still does, (we can guess where I lose it) but in this version, nothing... Disney, thank you for the lion king, but this should not have been made. :(",The Lion King

also disappointed with the voices, songs and how they practically did a shot by shot remake of the original.",The Lion King
1944,bavern21,Really Good!!,7,22 July 2019,Is the original a masterpiece? Yes. Is this one still really good?! Absolutely,The Lion King
1945,leeisnotmyname,The critics are crazy!!! Best live-action Disney remake yet!!,10,21 July 2019,"Let's get one thing out of the way: the original animated Lion King is a masterpiece in every way. Nothing will ever ""top"" it. Nothing. Ever. Having said that, that is not the purpose of this live-action remake. The intention is simply to retell the beloved story in a way we've never seen it before: with ""real"" animals, or as remarkably close to it as modern technology allows. If you go into this movie with that purpose in mind, you will love it!Some viewers may be weirded out by seeing nature-documentary-realistic animals talking and singing. Suspension of disbelief aside, I personally was blown away by how true-to-life it all looked, and I feel privileged to live in an era that this level of technological achievement is even possible.Some complain about a lack of emotion in the characters. First of all, I didn't experience that at all. I laughed AND cried (in the appropriate moments), thought the music was flawless, and thought the voice actors did marvelous work conveying the emotions of their characters. Secondly, since these are meant to look like REAL animals, they *obviously* won't have the complex facial muscles that humans use to express emotions, or the flexibility of cartoon drawings. Despite these reasonable limitations, I thought the film did a superb job making me feel all the things it intended to.Bottom line: if you go into this film understanding and appreciating what it is setting out to do, then you will love it. I thought it told the beloved Lion King story with live-action perfection! No, it doesn't top the original, but it doesn't need to. It's a masterpiece of its own, and I have nothing but praise for it! Go see it for yourself!",The Lion King
1946,iristostrams,Loved it,10,22 July 2019,"It was such a beautiful movie, just the right amount of nostalgia, but also not to much like the original.
The graphics were great, and the voice acting was really well cast.I loved the original, and if they wanted to remake this movie just for me personally, they did it perfectly.",The Lion King
1947,ellispaintball,So disappointed!,3,24 July 2019,"You come into these remakes with an open mind, but dang, just didn't have a good feel throughout. I just dont understand why Disney is messing up masterpieces.",The Lion King
1948,krausejt,Felt forced,2,27 July 2019,"It's an uninspired, unoriginal, shot for shot remake of the original except with less talented, wooden voice actors who sound like they're reading lines from a page and are trying too hard to add some artificial flare to the songs. +2 stars for the CGI I guess.",The Lion King
1949,mahanj-17221,Disney owes me a refund,1,13 October 2019,"The CGI is stunning but where is the story? All the excitement and wonderment of the original is nowhere to be seen in this version. Disney what happened? The musical numbers were changed and sung without emotion or any feeling. The voice acting sounded like audition reading, flat, monotone as if this was a first reading . My six year old grand daughter fell asleep watching this, certainly not a movie I will be recommending to anyone.",The Lion King
1950,leamodig,"Nothing wrong with the remake, the error is to make a remake",6,18 July 2019,"This movie is far from bad. The animation is fantastic, the voice actors is great (but the original ones are better) and the songs are still catchy. If you loved the original one you will like this one too! But, the big error is that the remake will never be as good as the original one. Disney clearly made this to make money and give some nostalgia to twenty year olds. But the movie is still entertaining and definitely worth to see.",The Lion King
1951,nikilatham,Such a shame.....so dull,4,8 May 2020,"It just has no life, the script was dull and they seemed to remove any part that was endearing or made you smile. I felt more emotion watching the animated version.",The Lion King
1952,NEERAJS-1,Ignore the ditractors ...,10,29 July 2019,"Watched this yesterday, and the director really nailed it with this version. The sound effects, animation have really set a benchmark. So ignore all the haters out there and Marvel hasbeens and see this one. We all know the story but the way this is put on screen is to see it to believe it. When my 8 year old starts clicking his fingers and dancing in his seat for "" Hakuna Matata"" I know we got a surefire
winner here. Hats off to the entire team that was responsible for this. Being a South African I was truly proud to see the beauty of my country and music in this.",The Lion King
1953,rachiewhite,Modernised to an outstanding level,7,23 July 2019,"When people go to see a remake of a classic film, if the story and plot line is all changed and different everyone hates it, they all want what they loved- only modernised and IN with the times. With this film, it was!!!!All the iconic scenes we know in lion king we're there. It was our childhood cartoon favourite characters brought to life in the REAL world. I've never seen such incredible CGI, every hair, every flicker of the eye in the lions, the attention to detail of the rain droplets on simbas mane, they caught, and for that I have such deep respect for this movie.
Muffasa looked so majestic in real form!So ten out of ten for CGI and modern technology to create this movie!As for how they kept so close to the original was also noble of Disney. It would have been wrong to adapt this all time classic movie.My only problem with this movie was the song Can you feel the love tonight. What happened there!? Not at night and the singers went overboard with the pitches and voices. The old version was perfect in every way. They're lions not opera singers!No the old song was much better, sadly they ruined it which was a shame because that song was my favourite in the whole movie.But all in all. Amazing and worth watching!",The Lion King
1954,BentleyMedia-90069,Pretty to look at,5,8 February 2020,Visually excellent but had absolutely no heart whatsoever!! I definitely agree with a lot of the people who said Beyonce was horrible casting but that wasn't the only misstep. The flow of the film was like watching paint dry. I had to stop watching three times to get through the film. Thank God I didn't go see it at the movie theater. Just stop ruining classic animated films already!!,The Lion King
1955,billybaxter-25217,Excellent,8,13 October 2019,"I thought this was a good remake but i feel slightly let down by the voice actors taking away the iconic voices of the original cast except Mufasa. Didnt like the hyena names changed or the zazu bird type. Rowan atkinson should have kept the role for the voice, also some of zazus funny moments with scar changed. But mostly all the good parts are the same but some bettered scenes hope they redo simbas pride.",The Lion King
1956,charan-83173,Nostalgia !!!!!!!!!!,10,12 July 2019,"First of all if u have seen Jungle book, GFX as extremely good as Jungle Book. I would say you need to watch the movie In IMAX for the best experience. Although its same story as the Original legendary 1994 movie, we never felt bored the amazing story line with the live characters and a great GFX from Disney lead the Original to next level. Must Watch!! And my all time favorite Timon and Pumbaa stole the show :) What else to say #Hakunamatata!! Get ur bording pass to Africa- PrideRock now to watch Simba the cutest cub in the world!!",The Lion King

1958,btmakusha,Felt like watching animals talk,2,27 July 2019,The Lion King from 1995 was the greatest and well thought out movie with its hilarious and dramatic moments I'll never forget. This remake is well beyond what I expected. It actually felt like I was watching National Geographic with talkative animals. I'm not sure what possessed Disney to stray so far from the script and disrespect this cast as much as they did. So much should have been done better and it just shows that you should never mess with a classic.,The Lion King

1960,lilnanda,On point,10,19 July 2019,It was stunning and more! I felt like a little kid again singing along to the songs. Timon and pumba were hilarious. Many laughs in the theater tonight. The animated version literally came to life. I liked the added scene on how Nala got away from scar. Overall great family movie.,The Lion King
1961,anaughtylittlepuppy,Don't waste your time and money,1,19 July 2019,I kept an open mind to see the childhood classic. But I was utterly disappointed. It didn't give me any emotion or chills I got watching the older version. Unnecessary remake to make nor money from Disney clearly.It's hot here. So I had a good nap for sometime in the air conditioned cinema. Good sleep I must say.I am watching the clasic version to get over the new version. Wish I can give 0 stars.,The Lion King
1962,richhbarber,Screw these rip offs,5,17 July 2019,I'm not normally negative about movies at all. Most have something new to show and give. But these tens of millions remakes with some of the best talent in the world so they can all pat themselves on the back and congratulate themselves on a great rip off of a perfectly timeless movie again and again. If they wanted to remake a couple because they had new ideas and technology to show off this would be tolerable maybe even enjoyable; but the fact they are doing every single movie and every time failing to capture the original magic. Wasting so much time and money sickens me and we need to all unite to refuse to see in cinemas so they use their money to fund original material and give us new heroes and stories to admire.,The Lion King
1963,signma,I kept an open mind,10,21 July 2019,"And I was very surprised. It was so beautiful, the nature and the animals. Of course the first movie is the best one, but this one is good on many other ways than the the first movie",The Lion King

1965,egrana,It was perfect.,8,26 July 2019,"So many people trying to come off as deeply knowledgeable critics.... For Pete's sake, it is a live action remake of the Lion King, what were you expecting. It was nearly a shot for shot remake with a new, (beyond my initial instinct) outstanding cast. It was masterfully made and made me feel all warm and happy in the end, just like the first one. If you want to see amore visually stunning lion King, go see this and enjoy it. If you want to see something new, exciting, with a plot twist, etc... Go see something else, you know? Kudos to everyone involved in this. Great film.",The Lion King
1966,matt-39320,Simply Stunning,10,30 July 2019,I really can't understand the negativity being shown on here towards this film. I'm a kid of the 80's and 90's and hold the original Lion King on a pretty high pedestal so I was fairly nervous taking my children to watch it. The nerves had vanished after a truly spectacular opening scene and was then able to enjoy the most visually impressive film I have ever seen. The attention to detail is staggering and really should be observed on a big screen for full effect. Bravo to all involved.,The Lion King

1968,tanishx,"Amazing graphics, loved every detailed second of it",9,20 September 2019,"I don't think I'm gonna IMDB reviews seriously anymore. I loved it. The graphics are beyond amazing. I loved how the story sticks to its origine. Loved the little details, like the mouse, to litteraly get into the atmosphere and story. I love the not typical US overacting and emotion, but trying to show the animals features as real as graphicly possible. It brought me into a dreammix of Africa and the cartoon. Not getting all the haters at all. It was not ment to be new and original storywise, it was not ment to ruin your childhood (think that usually takes a lot more, showing how exaggerated some opinions are, how typical). For me it was a feast of the eyes, and I think I speak for more than just me, seeing how much it did in the boxoffice. I'm very happy I do not share your hatetaste and appriciate the art that was brought to the screen.",The Lion King
1969,boarderfalife-36625,Maybe I saw it in wrong theatre,1,21 July 2019,"The grandness was missing. The songs in the original were huge. The sound and visuals in the theatre I was in seemed off. Not sure if this was the same in all theatres. The voice acting for young Simba was awful. Unfortunately Donald Glover want much better. They need to remaster the sound. If you can, see it in a large theatre with great sound, it may be better. It also feels rushed; the original felt longer than it really was and was told fantastically, this felt very quick. For a movie that originally hit you like a grand orchestra, this lacked completely in audio.",The Lion King
1970,madanielaa,"No feelings, no Rafiki's wisdom",6,10 April 2020,"Movie effects are awesome,but they missed an esencial part of this story. The emotions.
One of the marketable scenes in the old movie was when Simba met Rafiki to find himself.... well... it is not here. No emotions to drive a hard stimulation that Simba was facing.
They could do it better.",The Lion King
1971,javvvors,Long live the king,6,26 July 2019,"Why does people watch another James Bond movie even if it's the same story we've heard for years. Why the box office sharks are mostly superhero movies where the good guys (almost always) win. Why should I spend money and time for something I've seen god knows so many times? All those questions bring us to the new ""Lion King"" (2019) film.
It's basically unchanged version of the original from 1994. The same characters, the same plot, the same places, the same dialogues. Yet it breaks the box office records and could raise more money than the animation from '90s. But why is that so? Is it because we are used to some patterns and we're afraid that something new might disappoint us? Maybe because it reminds us of the childhood times, when everything was easier, carefree and airy? Or because the live action movie is really as good as original? Well... nah. It isn't. Sadly, it might not be even half as good. The animation style made it look nearly emotionless. The biggest advantage of the old Disney masterpiece were the expressions, dances, choreography. Here in 2019 it is all lost. Don't get me wrong, it really looks astonishing. All those details are wonderful! The way they move, run or fight is so natural and pleasing for the eye. Some scenes felt like taken away from a Discovery Channel documentary and that's why I'm not buying it. That realism made it more boring and dull, but I'm not gonna lie I had so much fun watching this movie. I laughed so hard at some old and new jokes, I felt heartbroken when Mufasa died and I had some chills at the opening sequence. The script still kicks in after all those years and it makes you care about some digital animals. After all those years we still can relate to them and understand them and it shows how important a good story can be.
We love seeing the struggle of characters, we love seeing their loss and we cheer for them when they overcome their obstacles to finally succeed. And we'll love it no matter if we see it for the first time or the fifty-first time. Superhero films, James Bond, Disney films, Harry Potter, Matrix, the Bible, the Lion King. Same story that have been told for centuries and we don't care that we know it all out. We still adore it.

1974,standage-61765,Impressive viewing,8,5 August 2019,"As a die-hard Lion King fan of the original movie and musical I was looking forward to the new film. The trailer and new songs excited me but I was a little anxious about being disappointed.I thought the film was beautiful. The cinematography, direction and attention to detail made me feel like I was on safari with the animals. The addition to the landscape shots and focus on all creatures great and small was breathtaking to watch and remind us about how precious our planet is.The extra lines in the script and new songs were needed to freshen up the plot and performance.Only small negatives for me were: the pace slowed in places and some performances of the actors lacked a little punch.",The Lion King

I am not a big Disney fan in general (i.e. I liked Disney movies when I was a kid). I saw the Lion King in theaters when I was in third grade. It was one of my first CDs I purchased, the soundtrack. I loved it! Our school performed a brief version of it in a cute group performance. I really loved this movie. Moving on to years ahead....i was a little bit over the top excited when I watched the trailer. All of my expectations crumbled the moment the characters, MY favorite characters, opened their augmented mouths. The convo between Mufasa and Scar and Zazu was awkward. That's basically how I describe the whole movie. Whoever was designated as writer should never write again. The dialogue was so incredibly awkward from the moment Scar opened his mouth. If I could redo the entire movie, I feel, in my heartest of hearts, I could salvage it. But it's too late. This was the biggest disappointment I've ever watched. Wait. The Lady and the Tramp was worse. I stopped watching after about 20 minutes of that one. But given this was my favorite movie as a kid, it was the biggest disappointment.",The Lion King
1976,sorgansf,A high school version of a broadway classic,2,13 October 2019,"I'll add to the chorus of people who found this production of a classic animated film to be terribly disappointing. It reminded me of when I'd go see a high school production of a classic broadway play or musical. Yes, they did all the numbers and cast the production as best as they could--but it had NONE of the charm of the original. Even the great James Earl Jones couldn't match his original performance.The problem is that when they went all-in to do a photo-realistic film, that they forgot the charm (and brilliance) of the original was due to the exaggeration of the characters. With photo-realism NONE of Simba's sadness, fear, doubt--basically, any sense of an emotion--could not be delivered. And the performances of ALL of the actor's didn't help either; flat, unemotional, vapid performances.Uuuughhhh. Such a waste. Jon Favreau, who I really admire, blew this one BIG TIME.",The Lion King
1977,ukshakedown,Soulless and zero emotion,1,21 July 2019,Going to watch this movie was more like going to watch something like Planet Earth. Yes the CGI was amazing but this movie had zero soul or emotion. It was boring and dull and had none of the Disney magic from the original. Beyonce's voiceover was terrible. She should have been left to do just the music. The only positive part of the movie was the chemistry between Timone and Pumba (Seth and Billy).,The Lion King
1978,mikkellex,Stop the hate,8,18 July 2019,"Stop the hate please. Dis you seriously expect Disney to change the plot when the original is one of the best plots in film history? I watched the original animation 100 times as a kid, and all the nostalgia came up in me during this movie!
This movie is a technical master piece, giving new life to the best animation film in history.
If you had seen the trailer before, you would have known the story was different. The Dumbo remake had some changes to the original plot, and I think that film was mediocre. The Lion King deserves a watch, unbelievable realistic with the same amazing songs and great dynamics between Timon and Pumba",The Lion King
1979,zoldyckhunter,A great nostalgic film,9,23 July 2019,"The Lion King (the original film) has always been a part of my childhood so I was most certainly looking forward to the new film. I went to see it at the cinema with my friend.
From the beginning to the end I enjoyed the entire film as it felt nostalgic to me. The new film was almost the same as the original from scene to scene apart from being CG realistic and a few extra scenes and plots being added.
The soundtrack sounded great and I liked the new versions and the new song sung by Beyonce.Example- Scar was more menacing and evil in the new film when the 1994 Scar was more of a whinger and a crybaby.I recommend other people to watch it.",The Lion King
1980,xenia-davidoff,"Good cast, very close to the original and astonishing animation",10,1 September 2019,"The best movie I have seen in the last years. I was very concerned if I will like the movie as I loved the original Disney animation. But it was really good.
First of all, the cast was great, loved the voices and acting (John Oliver as Zazu, Timon, Pumba, Simba, Nala, Scar, Mufasa - all great!).
It was very close to the original, which for me is important. The only improvement I see is the song of scar. It was too short.
Then, I felt all the emotions - which has been criticized a lot. From minute 10 I had tears in my eyes. Of course, it was also due to nostalgia but it was not the only reason. Here I disagree with a lot of people apparently. Besides being very sad the movie was also very funny due to the good acting of Timon and Pumba. So a lot of crying and laughing ;)
Song performance was much better than expected.
Finally, the animation was horrific. Wow! I am impressed and looking forward to more movies like this.So as a big Disney originals lover I have to say I loved the movie!",The Lion King
1981,spookmot,Brings Africa to the Big Screen.,10,3 August 2019,This was truly a lovely movie. I'm from Africa and The Lion King really brought the heart and feel of Africa to the Big screen. The attention to detail was wonderful.The movie is probably set Kenyan / Tanzania because of the Reticulated Giraffe and other antelope species that are only found in that area.Even the attention to the African bush is great and authentic. This is great: seeing a lot of movies about Africa gets species and areas they are found in totally wrong.To say this movie is better or worse than the first one would be wrong. This is basically a different movie. They're both great!If you want to experience Africa go see it!,The Lion King

It is very faithful to the original. The songs were better than I remember them. The updated production in sound is amazing. I actually think this is better than the animation. My wife gave it 8.5/10. My 9yo gave it 9/10 and my 5yo gave it 20/10. I need to speak with her teachers!",The Lion King
1984,jennyshell,Not Walt approved,1,11 May 2020,"Walt Disney would never include the word ""fart"" in any of his movies. He was never one for cheap humor. The CGI is well done, but by doing this it lost all heart and soul. Even though it was voice acting, it sucked. Sounds like they're reading right off the paper instead of acting. I forced myself to finish the movie (on Disney+ - I refused to see it in theaters). Don't waste your time!",The Lion King

1987,beccafernandes,"Good CGI effort to keep it real, poor emotions",6,27 July 2019,"As far as the CGI and real life theme was concerned, Disney's efforts are commendable. However, the characters lacked depth and emotions. The voiceovers were a good cast but they could have been more energetic and inflective. The cadence of the film ended on an ""okay-ish"" note that made me wanna go home to relive the original in all its entirety - without having to crib about why the exaggeration and simplicity was omitted from the remake.

It would be even better if they offer an alternative voice actor for Nala for the Blu-ray. One can hope anyway...snore!",The Lion King

1990,jgnordland,A happy surprise,7,20 July 2019,"I was very sceptic going in, but the movie manages to preserve much of what was good about the original. I still get choked up at the same points in the story, and the animation is done superbly well. The lack of facial expressiveness didn't bother me by far as much as I thought it would either. The main drawback is the pacing of the story. It simply moves to fast between certain important sequences. The original will still always be my favourite, but this retelling will not at all hurt your memory of it.",The Lion King
1991,marjolein_van_beusekom,Authentic remake,10,19 July 2019,"Didn't expect it to be great...but it turned out to be an authentic remake of the original animation.

Storyline and songs are just enhanced and the level of detail is phenomenal! (But, i guess you either hate it or love it).",The Lion King
1992,ciaranneill-bills,Animation is good but that's about it,3,15 March 2020,"Very disappointed with this remake.1. Songs are butchered
2. No soul or emotion
3. Voice acting is horrible, they try and sound like the old actors and it's cringe AF (why not just bring in the old actor voices like they did with James e Jones?
4. Not so cleaver jokes
5. Timon and pumba are unlikable
6. THEY CUT OUT ""MR PIG""
7. The voice actor who does scar butchered the character.
8. overall - very disappointing performance compared to the animation",The Lion King
1993,esteller-93555,It was watchable,6,17 July 2019,"This remake will never be better than the original and i think not one remake from all these disney movies will be better than the originals.
But they did make it. The CGI was amazing, that's for sure. There were some jokes that were not in the original which were very enjoyable. But they changed some things that i'm not sure about. For example, they included a new song, what just like, ruined that part of the movie if you asked me.

I literally kept thinking I was looking at real animals. So prepare to go wow! As to the music , loved it but felt the song , can you feel the love tonight had a different spin on it which I preferred the original one!

1999,shahsuraj-63442,Poor representation of an epic Disney film,3,31 July 2019,"For what is meant to be the most epic opening of a movie scene it was just poor. The movie lacked any wow factor. Then it was just voice overs and CGI, the music was okay, the only good scene was Timon and pumba's. Beyoncé and Donald Glover did a decent job as well.

Where I thought it fell short were some other parts however. Both Glover and Beyonce as Simba and Nala just didn't work for me, as well as a lot of the covers. I found myself not enjoying the songs as much as the original versions. Not a bad movie by any means, but the remake of Beauty and the Beast still leads the pack for now.",The Lion King

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I did the other releases. I recommend viewing in IMAX REALD 3D for the best experience.
This story brings to life many African proverbs of love, fear, trickery, courage, lessons relived, power.💯
I'm glad Disney is investing more in actors and actresses of color.👍🏽 They have come a long way from the days of the all white cast of the Mickey Mouse Club.👏🏾

But I feel like the team wanted to make the characters as close to the animals in the real world as possible, hence compromised a lot of facial expressions of the characters.

2005,justinjohnhughes,Beyonce's The Lion King,6,23 July 2019,"This movie is completely unnecessary, they pretty much replicated the original by copying shots and dialouge.

2007,ryujiin-13437,Good remake!,7,20 July 2019,"So the best way to review this is by its pros and cons.Cons:The voice acting changes on most of the characters was unnecessary. They missed a great opportunity to have a goose bump effect on ALOT of the lines, jokes, and songs. I see what they tried to do with an all African American cast, but come on, this is about nostalgia for a major portion of the audience, not being PC. SMH...A couple of songs were cut short or just done terribly, specifically Hakuna matata and be prepared. Also, a lot of the jokes and lines were cut or changed, which is hit or miss.The songs as in most of these Disney remakes seems to be recorded at a lower volume; they should be the main focus of these musicals.. Amp it up Disney!Pros:Despite the cons, the cinematic nostalgia is still there. A lot of people complaining about the animals emotions, but come one people, its supposed to look real...The effects are amazing! For the first 45 mins of the movie I was in aw at the CGI. Absolutely gorgeous!A lot of the voice acting was really good! however I definitely think Scar, the Hyenas and Timon and Pumba should have been original actors if it was at all possible.They actually followed the main storyline to a tee, no addition political crap or anything!The kids loved it, and gave it 10/10! and that's what its really about.That pretty much list my thoughts on the movie. I think it's important to note (as a millennial) that there are a lot of remakes of movies from our parents generation that we like, that our parents think suck. I chose to go into this movie with a fresh take as best I could, but I can't help my bias for the cartoon. All 3 of my boys ages 8, 7 and 4-1/2 all said ""We like it better than the cartoon"", and that's what matters; Passing something I cherished when I was a boy, to my little guys.",The Lion King
2008,vinhloc30796,Beautiful rendition that adds to the classic,9,26 July 2019,"I came to the theater not expecting much more than a bland, two-hour version of the nostalgic classic - only to find a solid movie that pulls on my heart strings with great voice acting, thoughtful music composition, and magnificent graphics.In many scenes, the voice acting delivers so well that I can sense the weight of every words. One would think that blending the human voice with the roars and growls of lions would detract from the immersion, but it felt quite the opposite for me - where each complements the others to make a whole that's more than the sum of its parts.The music is as to be expected from Hans Zimmer - you get both the familiarity of your favorite musical but also the modernity through improved sound quality and creative (re)arrangement. I couldn't help but sing along to the notes of ""Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Hakuna Matata"", nor could I help being impressed and engrossed in the chant of ""Be Prepared"".I only could enjoy the 2D version of the movie, the graphics are nonetheless stunning. In their recent movies, Disney really pushed the boundaries on what animations could do - cementing their position as one of the industry leaders.It's very much worth a watch if you enjoy seeing what two decades of technology could do for your childhood memory.",The Lion King
2009,bgaladjian,Where do i begin...,1,5 August 2019,"Where do i begin for this one.
First off, lets just start with casting. I'm not sure who was in charge of casting but wow you did an HORRIBLE job. Not only do the voice actors not know how to express emotion and make us FEEL something, the dialogue is all robotic! Seth Rogen (Pumba) was the only decent individual that matched his role and thats just because it's the easiest role to fill!Secondly, changing certain plot points didn't flow as smoothly, in other words, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The hyenas were all of a sudden not comic relief or goofy, but instead more on political and serious. Timo and Pumba have a whole new group of friends in there jungle paradise, which isn't a big deal, but it makes it seem less like a special place that the three share.Thirdly, most of the movie is a visual flex, they focus less on story and more on trying to show you what their capable of with live action. There are scenes that will unnecessarily take longer than it should, just to be visually appealing.Finally, this movie did something so wrong, unlike the other Lion King. Instead of showing us emotion, they would consistently try to express it with dialogue. SHOW MORE, SAY LESS. You can say its because the other Lion King was animated and its easier to pull off, but i don't think so.Basically, been preaching this for a long time, PLEASE Disney, stop doing these remakes, you guys are ruining classics for the future generations. I know its more for the MONEY that these films are made, but at least put a little effort. Big Fat Thumbs Down!",The Lion King

2012,diverse-16525,WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS?!,9,17 July 2019,"Ok. First of all I am just gonna make this clear: I FRICKIN LOVE THE LION KING. The original is one of my all time favorite movies so I was very excited, but also a bit worried about the new one.
Luckily, the movie is amazing!
Is it the same movie? Well, yes and no.
The characters and the plot is off course the same. But the super realistic looking animation makes for a very different experience. There are very little changes to the actual plot. But there are some small changes, and they actually make the movie better. They have taken the stuff that worked in the original, and then put out the stuff that didn't work as much or that could be done in a different way. They have also changed some stuff so it could work in a realistic looking environment.
Is it better than the original? No, but it doesn't have to be. As long as it honors the name of The Lion King, and it certainly does that.
The animation is great, the voice-acting is great, the songs are great, and the story is the one we all know and love.
If you like the original I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I will also recommend it. I watched it with a couple of people that haven't seen the original, and they both loved it.

Voice acting was atrocious.

2020,nillaville,Totally sucked,1,1 December 2019,I understand that no matter what they do they can't top the original one especially that it's a cartoon but the fact that they didn't even try to get even close to the original characters voices make it so much worse! If they were aiming to do their own things they should've changed the plot and called it something else but they were trying to basically remake the original so therefore they should have had 1 better actors because you can tell the way the voices were they had no real emotion in their voice even it sounded like they were just talking when they were supposed to have a certain emotion towards what was going on. That was one major issue. + 2 the characters voices were so much different than the original it was quite annoying! Like I understand it's very hard to top the original cast voices because all of them were very unique but they could have at least got something close and they didn't even try the only people they tried with was Timon and Pumbaa and I really really hated Timon voice he sounded like very nasally and just had a very annoying voice! They did pretty good on Pumba though I think he was literally the only character they did decent. And of course they did great by having the original voice for Mufasa! In the store I'll see a stuffed animal with the new Lion King and press the button on it and it will have their new Simba voice and I'm sorry it just sounds like some random kid recorded his voice on there it really sucks that they butchered this movie it was my ultimate all-time favorite Disney movie and still is and they could have flew away with this movie and made it amazing but instead they butchered it and fed it to the hounds! Disney just wanted to make a quick Buck obviously and don't get me started on Aladdin the same thing basically! Also lady in the Tramp was so so stupid! They didn't even make the dog look like Tramp at all and made his voice sound very odd and the animation was just very weird.,The Lion King
2021,nillaville,Butchered!!!,1,1 December 2019,I already wrote a review but I wanted to add a few more things. The voices were so damn terrible I could hear the whole time the original voices in my head. I watched this movie Non-Stop as a kid growing up and I know word for word through the whole movie! I can literally put the movie on pause and say the whole movie through. They left out such an important part to the movie and added other BS into it I just don't understand why! They should have tried to get some of the original cast back! Obviously they couldn't get Jonathan Taylor Thomas again for Simba because he was a kid and he would sound awful weird but they could have made him play the voice of Simba when he is older! They should have tried to get some little kid that sounded very similar as Simba from the original. There's nothing worse than going in a store and seeing a Lion King toy and saying all that's so cute that's awesome I'll get it for my child then you squeeze it and hear some random kids voice on it like if some kid walked by in the store and recorded his own voice on it! LOL sorry they just should have tried to come close in some way to the original I think they were trying to make it a point to get all African Americans on the cast due to it being originated in Africa. I don't know I just feel like that's what they were trying to do. I noticed more and more they're trying to put more colored people in Disney which I don't have a problem with at all but they're not going to get the same sound voices as the original cast with this particular movie. Every 90s kid growing up watching the original movie here's the songs and the voices of the original in their heads so when you watch this you hear it at the same time as it's being said or music is being played and it's completely different so it just makes you cringe want to turn it off and watch the original. I wonder if there was a way they could have just made the movie with CGI and all of that and just took the voice from the original and copy paste on the new one I'm sure there is a way they could have done that that would have been awesome! But even so they just messed up with the voice I think all together the actors themselves I feel are good actor at times but they're not voice actors it takes certain people special still be able to do that and the only person that did a good job with the person who played Pumbaa Seth Rogen. And he is a voice actor so he knew what the hell he was doing. I feel like he sounded very similar to Pumba and had the same spark flame in Attitude. I feel like they should go back and remake it again honestly just because they owe it to us 90s babies to do it justice and not just leave this horrible piece of crap out there I don't care if it takes money Disney has a  ton so they can go back and remake it and wipe out the whole cast and redo! Except for keeping Seth Rogen other than that replace everyone else oh yeah and of course keep Mufasa but even him sounded emotionless he sounded like he was just reading from a script like everyone else. Someone else pointed that out and I totally agree! You can tell he's getting old though you can hear it in his voice but he still is awesome as Mufasa. So I think they should go back and remake it honestly or if they make the second Lion King with Kiara they need to replace whoever's voice was on the 2019 Lion King all new cast like I just mentioned but honestly I just wish they would vote for go back in and just remake the 2019 one! Hit thumbs up if you totally agree with me! And whoever liked this any part of this 2019 remake of Lion King you are not a true Lion King 90 baby fan! You obviously did not appreciate the detail the love the fun and the sadness of the original!,The Lion King

2030,hgavin-05081,Mesmerising,10,29 July 2019,"We went as a family to see this at the BFI Imax on Saturday and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Well done Jon Favreau, you didn't spoil a classic.",The Lion King
2031,thegoodinfam,3 points for CGI,3,21 March 2020,"Stunning CGI but that's it. This version was just emotionless. No flare, passion, no depth of feeling from the actors. In my opinion, the original Lion King is by far one of the greatest movies of all time. The acting, the singing, the passion! I saw it as a kid in the movie theater and cried the whole way through. I still cry! This one fell so flat. Very disappointed",The Lion King
2032,nattmcd-82303,Butchered,1,21 November 2019,"Wow ... Can animated characters be bad actors? Yes, yes they can. Bad writing, bad bad writing, bad acting, bad singing. It butchers some good songs, omits one of my favorite songs (that awsome score they play while Simba is running across the desert) and trys too hard to be funny (fail) ... did I mention bad writing? Wow, there were so many cheesey lines.The only thing I can say was pretty awsome was their rendition of The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Otherwise ... CRINGE",The Lion King

2035,dm-87949,Great visual affects,6,19 July 2019,"The computer visual affects are mind-blowing, if you didn't know any better you just might believe those animals were real on screen, the only downside for myself was that I was five years old when the original animated movie came out, for the amount of money I spent on tickets and popcorn for me and my wife to see this movie in my opinion it's not worth it when you're pretty much literally going to see the same movie with slight differences throughout almost the same as some of the voice actors from the original, but if you're into visual effects and that's what you enjoy amazing visual effects then don't miss the chance to see The Lion King on the big screen for comes out on DVD. But yeah good movie similar to the original decide slight differences",The Lion King
2036,kyriakostsn,First Review,10,18 July 2019,"I'm not a typical review but I like reading writings in here. They really help me choose a good movie and have an idea about what I'm gonna watch! So as my first review I want to forgive me for my bad English but I'll try my best.First of all, it's a remake of The Lion King so why do everyone expects to watch the same old movie? I mean yeah we move in the same path but in my opinion remakes are here to offer something more, something new to the audience with new songs, new scenes etc.Secondly, I think Disney has done an AMAZING work with a visuals and you don't even realize that they are fake or CGI is like a documentary in which you can hear animals talking lool. I thought that they will fail in some way in a scene with the visuals but hell NO!!Thirdly, I love the fact that Disney kept some scenes exactly the same as the animation!! It was like you are watching the animation Lion King come to life! The first clip and some others in the movie are so damn similar with the old one scenes and that gave me goosebumps (I was always having goosebumps while watching it)Let me close with a thought I made in the first scenes and the last ones..this not a spoil..a mouse appears in the beginning in order to watch Scar and in the endings scenes there is the same/another mouse...I was thinking that Disney wanted to tell us that a Ratatouille remake is close (I haven't searched about it so forgive me if there is already something in the tables)So this is my review I hope it is helpful! Enjoy the remakes of Disney guys!!",The Lion King
2037,kyirahartley,Same as the original but worse,3,16 April 2021,"There's nothing new here. It's the original movie but made with less care and attention to emotional scenes.

Just watch the original...",The Lion King

2040,justinleephotos,"CG Masterpiece, with nothing on the original",3,20 July 2019,"From a visual perspective, the movie is fantastic! Timon and Pumbaa are outstanding, but that's about as far as it goes. The movie lacks feeling and this is likely due to the lack of expression and emotion in the characters' faces.Personally, I'd have rather paid to watch an IMAX re-release of the animated one.",The Lion King

the music is also good.",The Lion King
2048,mushkak,It's all about the Benjamins,4,12 October 2019,"Having seen how much money this movie is grossing, it's a typical Disney move to keep the money train chugging along and clever that the children that watched the first movie in 1994 have children of their own to share this story. Hmm.It's impossible to consider this film as a stand-alone. It needs comparing to the original, ostensibly because the script is 99% identical to the original, the songs are the same as are the characters.As other reviews say, the imagery is unparalleled, however the key problem with creating lifelike animals with a relatable story means that they simply cannot convey human emotions through this media - animals simply do not express emotions similar to humans. Therein lies the problem - it lacks soul.Pity the songs are also no improvement or development of the original.That was two hours I won't get back, but if I had seen this 25 years ago, I would have been awestruck - visually, but emotionally it is sadly disconnected.",The Lion King
2049,frans_xavier,Disasters in the Air,4,28 July 2019,"I saw this 2019 version last monday, for me, this is one of the worst Disney's live action (though Aladdin's little bit better than this). Visually good, but i thought the voice casting are not good enough compare 1994 version. Can you feel the love tonight's scene is totally worst, Beyonce's voice ruined the simple downhearted original version, it was like ""Hey I'm Beyonce, I sing this song"" plus Timon and Pumba 2019's version both cannot reach the high notes as 1994 version, Scar's in Be Prepared was also awful and painful to watch, no evil energy at all, Young simba's voice ? It's like hearing a boy reading from a book. Luckily the CGI is good, but overall this is disaster in the air and money maker movie with no soul.",The Lion King

Very realistic, even so realistic it's become difficult to convey emotion between characters. The voice action lacked passion, compared to the classic it's sloppy.I grew up with both the Dutch and English classic. In the Dutch version, the dubbing is really amazing and full of passion.

2056,ktearle,Honestly?..... It was perfect!,10,19 July 2019,"From the first, ""AHHHHHHH ZABENYAAAAA"" this movie was everything you could have wanted in a live action movie! Some negative Nancy's are giving this movie hate because it was not ""unique enough"" like I'm sorry, was this not the live action REMAKE!!!!!!!! Some of my favorite parts were the shot for shot recreations! You could have removed every line and song and the visual effects would have kept me captivated! Luckily, the score and script were also perfection! Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner were exactly what you would want in a Timon and Pumbaa! Having read some of the lines were improved made them even better! John Oliver was GOLD, and Donald Glover and Beyoncé tied everything together with a pretty little bow! 10/10, 5 stars, two thumbs up, 1st prize, gold star, Mr. Jon Favreau, you get all the awards!

The best we can get now.,8,19 July 2019,"With this movie Disney has finally showed us they're totally prepared to live-action all kind of animated movie come across their way. Graphically talking; this movie was stunning, with a state-of-the-art technology, there were just some scenes (especially the sky's ones) that look more recorded and edited than computationally created [aka, too real]. As expected live-action movies is the closest we can get to ""real life"", so you may expect some characters behavior changes and, eventually, some scenes with it, Like the iconic ""Mufasa Mufasa Mufasa"" scene from the original movie, few characters stop being 'jokers' and just get a bit real.

Scar is determined for Sarabi to be his queen and also the Hyeneas work with Scar rather than for. This is why Be Prepared is a shorter song.There are different spins and scenes and worth it!!!Absolutely blown away!!!People saying the film lacks emotion. This is realism!!!

2061,fdacosta-05524,Felt nostalgic,8,21 July 2019,"Honestly, people that are giving 1/3 stars, claiming they felt nothing, probably are people that came with the ideia that this was not the original lion king. I watched the movie when I was 5 years old. Cried a lot when Mufasa died. I'm not saying that today I cried the way I did back there, but it definitely played with my emotions. I get that for some people this will never replace the original lion king. And I agree. But that doesn't make this a bad movie.",The Lion King

I would understand if the actors passed away to put the new actor for the voice but no! :( Jeremy Irons, Rowan Atkinson, Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg... ??? Come on these are such legendary voices!

2066,sebcagninacci,"This remake is incredible, felt tons of emotions, from joy to crying.",10,29 July 2019,"I don't understand the critics, saw it in 4Dx, we were fully immerged in the movie, we could get the rain, the water from the jungle, the fumes when you are in the hyenas' field. When Simba started to run with Nala, the seats were moving, I think it helped a lot to get fully involved in the movie, you really felt like you were behind the main characters. I found nice that they decided to animalize the most possible the characters, some peoples may find that they lack of emotion because of that, but I felt even more emotion when Simba saw his father dying, or especially the night where he sees him in the clouds. Also, I saw Scar as a bigger and vicious vilain in this movie. The scene at the end where Simba nearly falls like his father when Simba tries to push him from the rock felt way more stressful than in the animation movie. To conclude, I'd say the first one is unique, but this one was also exceptionnal.",The Lion King

Seth as pumpa can't go wrong and of course it didnt ! I love seth rogen he did an amazing job here as well and billy as timon did a very good job as well. I didn't like beyonce tho, yes she can sing but she shouldn't be doing a voice over im sorry, it felt like she was just reading right of the script if you know what im saying, it was very poor...Everything was beautiful done, the music was amazing, but the scene when mustafa died was so criiiiiiiiiinge, They should've made it different with the voice when he is screaming it looked super weird and ye just felt really cringe. But that was the only bad/cringe scene, everything else was really great a good remake and i would actually love for them to remake Lion king 2 as well.Go see it yourself, make your own mind dont listen to the negative comments saying oh it is just like the original well news drop, IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE AND IT WAS VERY WELL DONE.9/10 from me :)",The Lion King

2070,scotty-27964,A truly wonderful film if you have given up on any joy in life.,1,31 March 2020,"If you thaught the origional had to much emotion, to many jokes and disliked the magic, never fear for this movie is for you!
For two hours prepare for a treat for the eyes that's got such good CGI the animals are genuinely emotionless! And what's more, as a special treat, the dialogue has been read so flatly and quickly it won't convey any emotion either! Character quirks, witty one liners, fun catchy (well sang) songs, bah, who needs them, it's all been chucked in the bin! This is the version of the film that's cut out all the kids stuff and (even though you know the story) crowbars in some terribly clunky exposition! And if your worried that the amazing cast ensemble will somehow rescue this, delightful to look at, but dreary re-telling, never fear, I can promise you that you won't even realise you are listening to professionals!
I'm summary, are you are the kind of person who's favourite part of going to the beach is getting sand in their crack? Or perhaps you enjoy a nice hot tub whilst wearing jeans and a bomber jacket? Playing football in sandals? If you can take something truly enjoyable and make it an uncomfortable mess....................

2072,stephenwalker-29616,"Not good, especially compared to the original.",3,22 July 2019,"Pros: The movie had astonishing CGI. The 3D was good, though not as good as other movies.Cons: The voice acting was sub-par, especially for a Disney movie. They chose some big names, and some people will assume that means they will do good work, but these voices were not good matches for the characters. They were terrible choices for character voices, nearly all-around. In addition to that, the lack of facial expressiveness made a huge negative impact on the entire movie.Summary: The movie is a lifeless shell of the original, dressed up in a fancy new CGI package. This may give you some level of nostalgia fix, and the CGI is a shiny distraction, but that's all it will do for you.",The Lion King

Whoever made any decisions on this movie must be as lifeless as the acting was.I'm only giving it two stares because the visuals are truly stunning, and that deserves some sort of recognition. The rest is just... wrong.This movie would maybe work for someone who's never seen the original, but even then I don't understand why they made the characters so... unlikable. No facial expressions, the voice acting sounds... poorly read, and the singing... just no.Have Disney really run out of ideas for new movies? No one wants remakes of old classics that still holds up great today.After giving this movie half an hour I just had enough, couldn't finish it.",The Lion King

The cinematography is outstanding and i really did feel like i relived the story. Yes, it does have it flaws and at some points the dialogue feels rushed and somewhat unatural.Set aside these imperfections the story is thrilling, sad and joyful just like the orignal. The soundtrack will move you and add to the experience. I got numerous chills throughout, and frankly i do not remember a film where i got as many chills, which for me says a lot.All the original parts persists, redone of course, but a lot of new details and even a couple of new scenes are a part of this remake. This makes for a couple suprises - pleasant suprises. It gives the movie a bit of new life, but without butching the original style. Humour is also apparent, maybe not in the same way as in the original, but you are in for a couple laughs here and there.Overall a beautiful and moving remake of an amazing story.

The ""fourth wall"" is broken a few times in attempts to make cheesy jokes, absolutely ruining the story.
This film, had so much potential, but I'm sad to say it can not even compare to the original.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Buy a copy of the original movie and show that to your kids and family. Not this garbage they're calling a remake.Don't get me wrong, the CGI (or whatever it is) is breathtakingly beautiful. Everything looks extremely real! But, the magic just isn't there.Don't think I'm someone who is against remakes/live actions of classics! I love the idea, but it's only good when executed properly!
Take for example: ""Beauty And The Beast"". The original was amazing and so was the remake/live action.I'm not against bringing older films into the modern age, but please do it with respect to the originals!-Kameron R., 19",The Lion King
2089,jainvinni,Amazing,10,3 August 2019,"Definitely don't understand the hate. This movie was exceptionally made, and all the animals were insanely realistic. The hyenas, their movements, their laughter, their sneering, all done so well with beautiful sound editing. Scar's gait was so cunning, and the lions themselves were beautiful and majestic to say the least. Their cat-like way of moving, sitting, and playing was amazing. The movie bought tears to my eyes multiple times. Timon was adorable, and I love the meerkat behaviours incorporated into his character, like walking on all fours then standing on two feet. I also felt the movie had a great balance of seriousness and humour. Overall absolutely loved this movie and can't wait to watch it again.",The Lion King

This movie was a huge flop! There was such a disconnect between the voice acting and the visuals.

I'm surprised by their imgination and their hearts put into it. The animals are so real, and most importantly, their emotions are sooo real and touching. They didn't change the story line and added more detail and logic into the lines. They're well well written. Many people gave 1 star and I felt unfair, you gave this level work 1 star really?!! Have you seen what a 1 star film look like??? It's heart- touching and more detailed than old film. The best Disney film ever I'd say. I'm considering watching it for a 2nd time.

2097,sindre_fottis,"Dull, excluding the visuals",3,17 July 2019,"Having been a fan of Disney and especially the Lion King since early childhood, I have to admit I was quite excited when I learned about this rendition. Going into it, I wanted to resist (as much as possible) to compare it to the original, but that´s simply impossible, seeing that all that made the original great was missing in this version.The characters felt much stripped of their personalities, possibly due to the lack of facial expressions and body language. Take the hyenas for example; In the original they all had very different personalities, and especially Ed, who was portrayed as a bit dull-witted, yet lively and mischievous. In the new version, however, they all felt indistinguishable from one another, and they were all just one of many. The same can be said for Rafiki, who in the original was a quite eccentric, whimsical and joking character. Compared to these characteristics, he now sadly feels like a ghost of himself, static and boring. Heck, even Timon and Pumbaa feels underwhelming.To sum it up, they have failed to capture the ""feel"" of the original movie, and it just feels emotionless and rushed. I feel like I have to give credit where credit is due though, as some of the scenography is pretty spectacular. But it´s unfortunately not enough to save the entire film. In conclusion, if you want to watch The Lion King, watch the original from 1994, and not this version.",The Lion King

2110,jamilasuekerr,My 7yo likes both same,6,20 July 2019,"Of course CGI amazing other than not animating emotions. They went to real there. I liked seeing how they handled some of the more unrealistic things from cartoon like how the cubs distract Zazu.Having some of the voice actors from original and then some new and so much of the original dialogue made it a little odd when you would hear the new actors. I think the young Simba needed more emotion in his voice throughout, but did amazing on his musical number. Beyonce's voice was kind of distracting and the new song not really needed except to extend time and to let her get her own song? I dont know if it was written by Elton John or anything like originals were. That's probably more of a personal thing since before movie I was unsure of Beyonce casting. Her voice is too recognizable and strong and it's like ""Oh its Queen B... not Nala.""I really liked the Hyenas and how more sinister they were and how they showed a more strenuous relationship with Scar. I liked how they tried to add some original bits, but it needed more so it didn't just seem like a straight remake.That being said, this movie had to have been hard to make into a remake without leaving some big things out. Pretty much all the beginning with talks between Mufasa and Simba about circle of life were very important.If I could give a 6.5 i would, but i can't give a 7, so it is.Also my son loved it and that's all that mattered.",The Lion King

My main critic would be that in the scene where Simba can talk to his father, the dialogue had changed slightly from the original and was not as moving, the imagary was also poor during this and it was too quick.
Also, Rafikis character was slightly lacking the strength he had in the original, he was no longer his cheeky self with his stick telling off Simba, he was more of just a mystical psychic.

2119,sanadabbaghbox,Hard work is appreciated! 👍🏻,9,30 July 2019,"The lion king is one of my favorite childhood movies, and it's still my favorite!
If you're saying that the characters had no emotional expressions, you have to think about that. Before watching the movie I knew the characters won't have the expressions as the cartoon movie because they're remaking it as a ""real animals"" and animals in real life cannot have any face expressions, lions can describe their feelings by moving their tail, roaring, etc. And the movie did that PERFECTLY!
We all have to appreciate this hard work and enjoy it. This movie is not only for those who watched the movie in their childhood, it's also for those who are children now!
My little brother (7 years old) told me after the movie that he enjoyed it much more that the cartoon one.(I understand that Disney in not only for children anymore). I give the movie 9/10 for some things that weren't accurate, such as singing about the night while it's afternoon .
But please if you were thinking that the remake would be better than the original you have to change your opinion, every generation has his own things and children nowadays prefer watching this movie than watching the cartoon one.

Some scenes felt like he lacked the energy he had in 1994: but still a good job. This is better than the beauty and the beast live action film. But it will never be better than 1994""s animated Lion King. Which is ok. Cool adaption of a classic film that is relevant even to this day.

My worries were quickly forgotten. Even though I've watched the original countless times, the presentation of this live-action movie immersed me in a world and a story where I forgot I knew it all - not that I ever forgot what would happen next per se, but it never interfered with the story unfolding.There were enough tweaks and twists coupled with beautiful homages to the original in scenes where realism restricted animal behaviour to keep everything new and fresh while staying true to the original.I worried that realism would detract from the experience - the funny expressions, the over-the-to scenography and unrealistic settings are without a doubt essential to the original story. Yet, somehow they've managed to recreate the story through almost documentary-like scenes of animals being animals, lifelike characters and the same humour delivered through new jokes. I'm surprised to see others complaining about the lack of life, when I saw nothing but life. It was stunning and believable. They somehow struck the perfect balance between realism and story-telling.",The Lion King

Spoiler:
For me the biggest issue is the missing turning point, the greatest moment in the original when Simba realizes he has to get over the past and face his true destiny.
In the original the dialogue with Rafiki is so iconic and the wise ape teaches Simba a lesson by hitting him with the stick and showing that the past can hurt but be overcome. It is then that Simba gains the knowledge and awareness to face his true nature and return to Pride Rock.Overall the new movie was awesome to watch and made me cray all over again.",The Lion King

I don't have the same emotional attachement to The Lion King, which makes it easier to accept that in fact it is not the original.I loved the original, don't get me wrong, but I can see a lot of merrit in this version as well. It's beautifully made. You simply want to pick Simba up and cuddle him whenever he feels down. Scar is scarry because he's not an over the top villain, but an actual character with a different world view. Even Timon and Pumbaa are funnier because it's not overdone.The realism of the CGI was added to the story, which makes it confrontational. Nala is much more portrayed as the powerhouse she is; she's no longer the sidekick, but get's credit for her heroism. Simba really has his coming of age moments and grows to be the king he was supposed to be.Of course there are always little thing that could have/should have/might have, but they were very true to the core of the story.Full disclosure: I cried my eyes out!",The Lion King

That's when the movie passed from a 9 out of 10 up to that point to a 7 out of 10 from then on. The new Beyonce song is not great and does not fit with the others, and she doesn't do a good voice over job. From that chapter on everything seemed a bit rushed and that beautiful moral of the story distorted or not emphasized enough.In the end it could have been better and it's a notch below the original but kudos to the team.

2144,amberab-21665,"Decent, but had much room for improvement",6,14 July 2019,"First off, I have seen the movie (it was released in China last Friday). I wont say it was bad. But it wasnt terrific either.The only three things I did not agree with were the casting of Beyonce as Nala, the insert of her random song about Spirit, and the way they changed up Scar.I cannot continue this review with allowing for spoilers, so instead of getting all upset about spoilers, if you dont like them, kindly pass over this review.My first disagreement was the casting of Beyonce. I thought she wasnt right for the role. You could really tell that she enjoyed the role, which I loved that. But she gave an extra human quality and personality to Nala that didnt match up with the CGI lion. Don't know if that is necessarily her fault as much as the CGI artists, but I felt she delivered too much attitude in the lines.The second thing was the insert of Beyonces random song, Spirit. It was randomly placed, no doubt just because she is Beyonce. The song was nice, but the tune of it didnt have the same feel as the other songs in the soundtrack. I think it would have made a great ending credit song, but it doesnt fit well in the movie itself.The last of my woes surrounds Scar. I can accept that they made Scar into this mangly, decimated version of the cartoon character. Due to canon and what we know about him, he was cast out from the main pride. Which would mean he would not have the same hunting privilidges. However, they did not do justice to the villainy and cunning that Scar showed in the original. Seemingly with the song 'Be Prepared'. They shortened it to 8 speaking lines, and a full minute of the words ""be prepared"" being repeated over and over. The actor himself seemed like he could have pulled the full song off. He is no Jeremy Irons, but he did well. It was just a shame they didnt showcase that.I appreciate the job that they did. I would have much rather seen more of Scars song than Beyonces. The ladscapes were beautiful and all the other characters were portrayed well, even with the limited emotions on the animals. What a treat it was to see James Earl Jones reprise Mufusa.I just wished they were more careful with these three things.",The Lion King

Which is a shame because I will give the remake this it looks gorgeous. But the voice acting in the remake is pretty bad some of the lines were delivered terribly and sometimes the delivery was downright funny. Some of the original movies most powerful scenes felt extremely dull in the remake like mufasa's death in the remake was extremely butchered. Though some additional scenes were not bad but also not good like how nala escaped to find simba.

In this case, the cgi just doesn't quite do what the animation does, the characters lack of expresions and movement just to keep an unnecesary realism that nobody asked for. And don't get me wrong, I love the animated movie, but maintaining the same story nowadays is just boring and doesn't make you feel anything besides some nostalgia. I really think Disney needs to try new ideas and stop making remakes that end up just being dissapointing and mediocre at best.",The Lion King

It's true to the original, with a little bit extra just to fill out the story. I cried, laughed and honestly had goosebumps throughout. It's also visually breathtaking! The songs are nostalgic. Can you feel the love tonight is beautiful!I don't understand the negative comments saying it's the same as the original? Isn't that what everyone wants? Any I've seen that have strayed from the original have received criticism and now a film true to the original is, so I'm confused?By far, the best Disney remake! Love, love, loved it!

2150,houdanasertour,question,5,17 July 2019,"The first question we need to ask is ""are they necessary?"" This could be said about any film, but in the transition from an animated media to a live action one, several things happen. Within animation anything can happen. You're not limited by real world physics. Yet, the suspension of belief when watching cinema isn't altered. You're still whisked away into a new world and captivated, regardless of it not looking real. Without today's technology, animation was the tool to anthropomorphic characters. We could share the emotions of a deer or fox or even a bear. Mice became your best friends and could sing. The limited became limitless within animation.",The Lion King

And come back and rate it as it deserve.",The Lion King
2161,kostaberic,"Underwhelming, with bits of nostalgia.",4,18 July 2019,"Let me start by saying that I've grown up watching the original Lion King. I think it's a movie I've watched at least 50 times, and also, my all-time favorite movie.
Unlike many of the reviewers, I didn't mind a 1:1 remake. I wanted to see how it would look with amazing new tech we have available, and I wasn't disappointed. The visuals where phenomenal!Music - Iconic and epic. Like it was supposed to be. ""Reflections of Mufasa"" (the previous soundtrack had it named as ""This Land"") sounds even more powerful and emotional.Timon and Pumba - Brilliant. A highlight character-wise. Think all of them spot on nailed it, Seth Rogen especially. Zazu was awesome as well.
Now, let me cycle back to the negative stuff, that all in all contributed to the fact I ended up being ""meh"" instead of a full-on crybaby.
1. Scar - Underwhelming, flat, and confusing. I don't like the fact he looks like a hobo with serious drug addiction. I also didn't like the ""Be Prepared"" rendition.
2. General acting & lack of animal emotions - Flat, literally no emotions... Feels like a narrated documentary. I know that Jon Favreau wanted a photorealistic setup, but it fell short in conveying the emotions Lion King is known for. You can't have a scene where Mufasa dies, little Simba screaming, and a rendered lion that stares blank into nothing.3. Simba & Nala reunion - Instead of initial confusion by Nala (like it was shown in the Original) we now have a scene that's like ""Nala?; Simba is that you?; Yeah! ; Cool!""... I don't know, it felt like they haven't seen each other in like two weeks, and weren't close, to begin with. Kinda like me seeing my elementary school bud I never really hang up with. ""Hey man, u good? Yeah man, u? Good. Good! cya.""4. Can You Feel The Love Tonight - why, god why in broad daylight? It made no sense.5. Rafiki discovering Simba is alive - This one pissed me off. In the original, he had to think hard trying to remember what the smell reminds him of. Now, he literally picked up the piece of mane, look at it and immediately said ""Simba.""...6. Simba's roar on the finale - Music was awfully timed. In the original, we had a music build-up, Mufasa's ""remember"", music exploding - roar. Now it was music, roar, remember, roar, music... Really underwhelming.7. Mufasa's Ghost - I've left the worst for the end... Because this scene really, and I mean really, pissed me off. What once was the most beautiful scene, most emotional and gorgeous piece of art, completely and utterly ruined. There was no emotion in Simba, no original and iconic quotes like ""You have forgotten who you are and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the Circle of Life."" ""How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be."" ""Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true King. Remember who you are."". Seriously? The most iconic conversation in all of the Disney history, tarnished like this? I can go over a fact that there was no Mufasa in clouds, there was no lion shape or anything, just a few flashes of lightning reminiscing the shape of Mufasa's eyes... But to kill the quote and emotions this father-son reunion brought us? No.. Just... No!",The Lion King

2163,ptitfilouiojzakld,Nice CGI. That's it.,2,18 July 2019,"This movie is wrong on many levels. You cannot get into it, it just feels like a documentary with kids voice on top of it. Most important scenes have been shortened, and useless scenes (cheaper ones my guess) have been lengthen (the mouse in the intro ? seriously ?). Yes, the goal is to put realism, but we could not tell the difference between lions (Sarabi and Nala in paritcular). Everything the original Lion King brought to us (essentially emotions, mostly from the animated faces) has been ripped off, event the few jokes by Timon and Pumbaa did not succeed to pass.Last but not least, the music seems off too. Some good scores are here, but at the end it just seems to be put above everything like ""eyh we need to put music"" ""ok just put it anywhere you want, dont forget suggestions to the previous score for nostalgia but dont care about if it fits"".This movie is an insult to an entire generation.",The Lion King

This movie is exactly as advertised and is worth the watch, a film that is appropriate and entertaining for people of all ages and backgrounds.",The Lion King
2169,viraiynraj,"The good, The Bad and The Ugly",3,18 July 2019,"I'm a massive fan of the original so this maybe biased.The good:
1. Visually stunning
2. A few dark moments are made darker
3. James Earl Jones !
4. Seth Rogen as Pumba
5. A different take on the hyenasThe bad:
1. It wants to copy the original without actually being the original. - this is where the movies gets butchered.
2. Not recasting Jeromy Irons as scar but using his lines. Scar was so meh. (seriously wtf ? This just pissed me off from the start. If youre gonna get James, why not get Jeremy? Its the exact some thing !)
3. Most of the voices are pretty bad if I'm being honest. There's just no soul in the characters. You could argue that because of the realism, the characters lacked depth but in all honesty, the voice actors were just so poor. You could tell that they just showed up, said some lines and went home. Some probably in a day.
4. Queen Bee - Beyonce as Nala was a real let down. There's an unnecessary song, something about spirit, totally forgettable, stupid and it doesn't even match what's happening on screen. It honestly felt that they just had to put a song of her singing to attract her fans. You could tell that they really tried to make her shine, but unfortunately, soulless.
5. Similar as scar, as much as Billy Eichner tried to put in some effort at least compared to most of them, he just falls flat in comparison to Rowan Atkinson. (Why not just recast him ? If you honestly want to this right, how can you not recast Rowan Atkinson as Zazu
? Did they honestly think someone else can best Rowan Atkinson let alone match him ?)The Ugly:
1. This movie quite simply should not have been made but they did and it's quite clear that its basically the easiest cash grab you could ever see.
2. They destroyed Rafiki's character and reduced him into just another animal. (He was one of my favourite characters in the original, but in this, he has almost zero of his iconic moments)
3. As stunning as it visually is, this movie has no heart or soul in comparison to the original. I was actually prepared to cry at that one iconic moment but it felt nothing like the original. Simba looked expressionless as Scar tells him to run away. This was the moment i realised the movie is doomed. (Theres a moment where they zoomed into his face and I was hoping for a second that i would see a tear or something that expressed his raw emotions at that time but NOTHING !)
4. Can you feel the love tonight - this whole song was sang and shot during the day (i could not comprehend the stupidity behind everyone working on this song. None of them realised that the setting of the song is in the title itself. I just don't understand why ?)
5. If you can't get the most of the main cast back who are actually around, why even make a remake ?I could go on all day complaining about how they've absolutely butchered a classic for money. If this came out today without the original 2 decades ago, it would be absolutely forgettable.My honest advice: if you loved the original and watched it a million times as a kid where you could recite each character's line and sing each song word for word, please do not waste your time on this. Watch the original over and over and be happy with a masterpiece.If you watched the original once or twice or if you somehow have managed to make it till 2019 without watching the original, you may enjoy this one i guess. I don't know. I hope you do so you wouldn't feel how disappointed i am after waiting anxiously since they announced a remake of this classic only to realise that they just wanted to make a movie for money rather than making it a masterpiece.If they really wanted to do this right: you either copy it 100% or make a different version of it. Making a continuation of it would have been good to the original as not many watched the second one and that could have been made into a good remake.Great to know that after 20 years, the original is still one of the best ever made.Long Live the King.",The Lion King

It's not necessarily a shot-for-shot remake, but it is very close. There isn't really anything in this movie that sets it apart from the original animated movie and a lot of people are going to be totally fine with that. As for someone who never was super connected to this movie as a kid, I needed this remake to add in some new stuff... something to give it its own identity. I didn't really get that with this movie like I did with the Aladdin, Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast remakes. Of course, the VFX are amazing and game-changing. The voice acting is great. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner and John Oliver are total standouts.I like this movie... 7/10.",The Lion King

I love the original and I was curious how they will deliver the same athmosphere and emotional scenes with realistic animals. Well they don't.Every scene feels a bit rushed, I cried when I saw the original animated ""remember who you are"" scene and I was waiting for it to be even more powerful. It was lame. Simba seemed to be like ""meh.. shut up dad"" and then the scene was over. The potential was there, before mufasa's death scene I was like ""oh boy im gonna cry"" but same thing happened, it fell flat.The movie would probably be good for someone who has never seen the original, but as a remake this is just disappointing.

It was a great CGI based movie that really entailed everything the first movie had to offer. I thought they did a great job of the singing and the comedy of the movie.Do I think it could of been better? Most defiantly. I thought the CGI was very lazy at times, and almost rushed. I would of easily rated this a 9 if it wasn't for that. At times you will notice the different animals have little to no mouth movement while they are talking. One scene in particular where they talked for about 30 seconds and I didn't see the mouths move once. Just a little odd from such a high budget film... but like I said it shouldn't be docking the movie 5+ points simply because of that.The movie portrayed everything the first version had to offer... and they did it incredibly well. You will find yourself laughing a good bit at times by numerous scenes, tearing up from particular memories from you childhood, and overall just a overall pleasant experience.This movie was beautiful, and it deserves a decent rating. Not a bunch of 1 star reviews out of hate. I am not going to sit here and say it deserves a 8,9, or above. But defiantly in the high 7's. At times it felt rushed (as mentioned above) and lack-luster. The emotions didn't portray fully as the first movie. But that is VERY difficult to do from CGI... but with the budget they had, it should of been better in that aspect.All positive / negativity aside. A truly beautiful movie that you should DEFIANTLY see. Especially if you have kids, and even if you don't... ha!",The Lion King

The only problem for me is de song of Beyonce. Not because it is a bad song, but all the other music in the movie adds to the storie. They have African percussion, flutes and is based on original Afican music. Spirits does not have that and because of that it really knocks you out of the storieline.Personaly I think it is a good thing that the animals do not show magnified human emotions. It would look very fake now the CGI made the animals so realistic.",The Lion King

Still got tears when the king died, though it wasn't as meaningful due to lack of enthusiasm or emphasis. The king fell off cliff and no sense of remorse. Tears came from knowing the original version. This one was a Very Bland and Dull version! :( Lack of Music length. Nothing uplifting...just plain sounding.

2183,jaahunt,"Yes, the animals do emote.",9,19 July 2019,"First off- I will address that most of the negative user reviews pre-date the American release. All these all users from countries that released first or are they like other movies where negative reviews are made without seeing the film?
I gave this film a 9/10 because it was not perfect. It was excellent however. When you review a movie, you need to rid yourself of any prejudice. This is hard to do with a remake, but it is possible. The only reason I gave it 9 instead of 10 were a couple moments that took my mind away from the world they created. One was a visual and the other was a singing. I will not get specific as I don't want to give the reader any prejudice.This film opens with an updated version of the powerful opening from the original animated movie and moves on from there. Many of the scenes are similar but updated to be more representative of how it would actually look in reality. The ""I just can't wait to be King"" is one of the most notable indications of this.The animals do emote. They show emotions in the same way our domestic animals or animals in a documentary film would. Do characters not have cartoon waterfall tears? No, but they do indicate sadness the way real animals would. Their eyes do show expressions of love, anger, sadness, fear, hatred, etc, and so does their body language. It's just more subtle as it would be in reality.The musical numbers are very well done with some changes along the way. They are not shot for shot or even lyric for lyric remakes. But, they do add to the emotions of the movie. Those that say they come out of nowhere need to rewatch Enchanted where ""live action"" musical numbers vs animated musical numbers is joked about. They do not distract, so they are woven into the film accurately.The voice talent does a great job. There is humor among the hyenas with some really funny stuff and the adlibs they kept for Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious. They do steal the show in their scenes, but that's what good comic relief always does. Scar oozes off the screen in a different kind of sinister way. He is vile in this retelling. All the voice talent did a great job and I will add that they cast voices with similar tones to the original voices and that even aided in not being distracted by new voices.The creative team did an amazing job of putting together a realistic retelling of an amazing story that works in all mediums. The changes are mostly for realism and that was the point. One standout scene of this is how Rafiki discovers what truly happened to Simba.Bottom line: watch this movie for entertainment and you will not be disappointed. If you watch it to only compare or wonder if it was necessary, you may have already made up your mind.",The Lion King

2185,alexsavon,Is this what art has come to?,1,19 July 2019,"It is truly saddening to see how much heart, soul, and love can be sacrificed in search of a quick cash grab. Every time I see something from this movie it utterly depresses me, because there is absolutely no emotion in it whatsoever, with regards to the CG itself, color grading, and emotion shown in the characters. Real lions show emotion, why couldn't they do that with this, at the very least? Utterly depressing",The Lion King
2186,mimikkillian,Exceeded Expectations,8,19 July 2019,"Having read some of the reviews, I went into this expecting to be disappointed. Happily, I was anything but. It is a fresh but familiar take on the beloved original my children grew up with. That this is an incredibly gorgeous movie goes without saying. While it is true that the characters don't have the ""human"" range of emotional display that they do in the original, I really didn't find that to be much of a distraction or a deterrant, nor, apparently, did the many people in the theater sobbing, laughing, cheering, and humming along with the music. It's a very engaging movie.
If you're 100% committed to the original, and are looking for this to match up to it, yes, you will be somewhat dissappointed. If you are up for a funny, fresh and stunning take, you are in for a treat. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan as Timon and Pumbaa are worth price of admission alone!",The Lion King

I know all the likes by heart, and being able to see the same story I know and love reenacted with such amazing visuals was really emotional for me. I cried during the whole movie. For me, the animals portrayed real emotions in a way that cartoons just can't.

That being said, the acting, the lack of emotion in the animation and the total lack of emotion in the music itself all make the movie completely flat and boring. It seemed the voice actors were more interested in adding unnecessary vocal melisma than they were in relaying an emotional undertone. I appreciate that they stayed true to the original script and didn't add the social commentary du jour, like Disney has done with every other live action remake, but this one was just dull.",The Lion King
2190,thatsmetlw,Find the Kid in You,9,19 July 2019,"I've read some critic and audience reviews and I can't help but chuckle at the overly serious people not realizing they're watching a Disney movie. Sure, the movie was a lot less colorful and fun than it's predecessor, but it's the same movie with some amazing visual effects. Mind blowing, if you will.I've openly admitted that I don't think music was a good choice for this movie, I think an updated score of the songs we know and love would've worked well in place of the original songs. As weird as it is to see realistic animals speak, it's just as weird if not more to see them sing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the nostalgia of some of my favorite songs used.I keep seeing people complain about a ""lack of emotion"", but I have to assume none of these people have pets. Dogs don't speak, but their body language and eyes speak volumes and these animals did the same. There was plenty of emotion, please don't believe the hype. Not to mention, the director did a phenomenal job at assuring that the way the camera moved also added to the emotion of the scene. I think people just wanted to see the 1994 movie, so much so that they were unwilling to embrace the new version.Speaking to embracing the new version, I think some of the line deliveries could've been better, but I'm torn because I don't know if I didn't like the delivery or if I'm used to hearing it differently. 1994 was 25 years ago, we've had 25 years to embrace, love and appreciate The Lion King for what it was. Give the new edition a real chance, I'm sure it'll grow on us all.Just for giggles, I plan to interview my cousins and upload their reactions to the web because I think while the movie was made for us, it's their generation that'll have it for the next 25 years and they deserve to appreciate it as we did the original. I remember this kid in the theater during the hyena chase scene shout, ""Run, Simba!"" it was the cutest thing! He felt the grief and stress of the scene as we all did and I think if children continue to react like this kid did, it'll implant this movie for the next 2.5 decades. I really hope it does.

2192,agharp,"Visually Stunning, Lack Luster Vocal Cast",4,19 July 2019,"Let me preface this review by saying that my complaint is not with the film's ability (or lack thereof) to get ""realistic looking"", digitally crafted lions to emit a variety of emotions through facial expressions. I don't think any of us put too much stock in that aspect. What most people are referring to is the film's lack of verbal emotion. While Donald Glover and Beyoncé command the stage for their own styles of music, their performances in the movie's songs fell very flat. Neither of them were able to convince me of the emotion we take for granted in the original. The voices they provide for the characters didn't quite match up to who we remember as Simba and Nala. I'm afraid I have to agree with most of the reviews that the movie fell very flat creatively and emotionally. I felt like the voice cast didn't quite match what most of us were probably anticipating, considering how great they are on their own. The scenes with Mufasa definitely lacked the majesty (no pun intended) that he brought to the 1994 film. It was still tear-jerking listening to his voice. That was one casting they did right. Jeremy Irons needed to be scar. The performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor wasn't by any means lacking - on the contray, his Scar was still very menacing. Jeremy Iron's ""Be Prepared"" (Jim Cummings sang most of the song) was unfortunately changed to the point that it was almost laughable. Chiwetel wasn't able to bring the same ""Villainy"" to Scar as Jeremy. Iron's voice was definitely needed to bring more credibility to their claim of honoring the original. Rafiki's voicing was also underwhelming. Robert Guillaume was missed dearly in the 2019 remake. His iconic portrayal of the beloved character would've been one of this remake's saving graces. John Kani brought his own interpretation, which tended to be a much more solemn and ""peaceful watcher"" Rafiki compared to the vivacious and witty Rafiki from the 1994 version. However, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan have great chemistry and I felt they paid homage to Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. Hans Zimmer's original score was almost the same in the remake and it definitely held the film together. The graphics and detail in a majority of the film are breathtaking. The fight scene between Simba and Scar is so intense and incredibly shot. So, if you're looking for a film that has beautiful landscapes, is visually stunning, and brings you to a special place, then see the movie. But be warned that the overall experience may be lack-luster.Regarding people who are praising this movie and saying those who gave it negative reviews don't understand or love Disney, I've seen this on Broadway more than I wish to admit and I've gone through 2 VHS of this film growing up. I love Disney. We're DVC members. My appreciation for Disney isn't lacking, however this film didn't inspire or evoke deep emotions like the original. Please trust the professional critics on this one. For once I will agree they got it right.",The Lion King
2193,NameyName,Worthy of the original but doesn't take the throne,8,19 July 2019,"I am impressed. Lion King 2019 is very similar to the original in terms of storyline, scenes, soundtrack, and script but as I'd hoped, they've added more to it.First of all, I love the visual appearance and voices of all of the characters. I thought it would feel weird to hear them with a different cast (other than Mufasa - I'm so glad they kept James Earl Jones at least!) but they actually suit their voices really well. When I first heard Scar's voice in the trailer, I have to admit that I was immediately disappointed - I thought that his new actor Chiwetel Ejiofor sounded very weak, especially in comparison to Jeremy Irons' steely voice. However, he proves otherwise in the movie, and the new Scar also really suits this adaption. There's an ominous chill about him and just something a little extra sinister. Having said that, I love both Scars - the 1994 Scar for his smooth charisma and the 2019 Scar for his outright menace.The movie stays true to the original and adds just a little bit extra. I love the additional scenes of Nala and Zazu - I especially love how the animators really focused on cub Nala's fear and unease when the hyenas were introduced to Pride Rock, and how Zazu later helped her escape. The latter is a nice contrast to the elephant graveyard scene when he was determined to keep the cubs under control. I also want to do a shoutout to Rafiki. He's a little less nuts but he's just as cool.I also like Timon and Pumba more in this adaption. I've always found them overly loud and dim in the first one. Their over the top personalities are a little toned down here and they are ultimately funnier and more charming. I especially love a particular Disney reference they made.I do have some nitpicks and they are the new version of Can You Feel The Love Tonight and the addition of the new song Spirit. Beyonce is a good singer but she flaunts her notes and as a result, her singing sounds bumpy and overall just distracts and detracts from the Simba and Nala scene. I think that the addition of the new song Spirit is misplaced - it sounds too happy considering Simba is about to return to his homeland and possibly die. The original soundtrack for his decision and return had much more emotional impact. Other than those two snags, I liked everything else about the soundtrack. It is very similar to the original, only even grander.Assuming they remake the second Lion King film, an addition I would have liked to see would have been some sort of reference to the Outsiders. Their appearance in the original Simba's Pride felt random because there was no previous mention or hint of them - it was clear that they were introduced just to make a plot for the second movie. Introducing or mentioning them in this film would have made the transition to the next plot smoother, although again that's provided that they do plan on reanimating the second one.Lastly, I absolutely adore the photorealistic animation but like others have said, it restricts how much emotion the characters can convey. The empty-eyed look works well for Scar and the hyenas but less so when it comes to emotional scenes between the other characters. However, I appreciate that the animators did what they could.Overall, it's a very decent effort, but the lack of emotion that conveyed among the characters keeps it from topping the original.",The Lion King
2194,notnotable,Better effects don't mean better movie,1,19 July 2019,"People loved the original lion king because of the colorful animation and the characters with different personalities, this movie isn't colorful and everything is emotionless and ugly looking, kids and people in general won't fall in love with this movie, it's not fun to watch, it's not original, it's like watching lions in the zoo, Disney went full phantom menace and thought good effects will make people forget that the narrative and the plot is garbage",The Lion King
2195,cahyopurrr,GOOD BUT NOT MAKE ME WOW,8,19 July 2019,The story or the drama in the movie was too short for me so I cant feel it. Hopefully there's a remake again for this lion king with full emotion like other disney movies before making lion king II lol. But yeah still good to watch. Lovely young mala and simba still always in my head.,The Lion King
2196,glencunningham,The Beyoncé show,1,19 July 2019,The movie is good but it's hard to watch listening to all Elton Johns songs being sung bad by Beyoncé. Also when she speaks as Nala she is all you can here. Very disappointing!,The Lion King
2197,glexie,Why are you so negative people? The MOVIE IS AMAZING for its genre and style,10,19 July 2019,"I don't understand why people are so negative. The movie is amazing. It is a movie, NOT an animated movie! Yes, real animals CAN'T express emotions the same as in the animated movie, so stop complaining about the lack of emotions, giving 1 stars for such an amazing hi-tech remake. I think directors of the movie did an amazing breathtaking MOVIE remake! It is not easy to redo such a masterpiece, and to make it with real animals, but they did an awesome job. People don't listen to other people who are all sucked into the negativity and leaving 1 star reviews for a story that never can be 1 star, just go to this movie with open mind and enjoy it.",The Lion King
2198,nataliemcneil-10320,Amazing remake of a classic,10,19 July 2019,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. The CGI was amazing, casting was fantastic and I felt that this remake did the original justice. I wanted to sing along to the whole film, laughed and cried. Took me right back to my youth.",The Lion King
2199,TheEgyptianCritic,I wanted to like this...,5,20 July 2019,"I can honestly say I have never missed a Disney film. And when it comes to the classics ""The Lion King"", ""Aladdin"", ""Hercules"", ""Mulan""...etc, I have those films memorized word for word, just like hundreds of thousands of 80s/90s kids around the world. Everything that comes out of Disney is mesmerizing to me. So you can imagine how excited I was about these remakes, especially after watching the Aladdin remake, which I thought was outstanding in keeping me entertained to the last second, regardless of knowing the plot beforehand. Aladdin had its own voice and character and took risks in riffing off of the original that paid off.This version of the Lion King completely missed what made the lion king the best animation of all time in the first place: the characters, the comedy, the emotion in the voices of the actors and actresses, the subtle nuances, and the character development. The movie focused on the visuals, which are amazing, but so are the visuals on my screensaver. It was never the visuals that made the original movie great. The original was a 2D cartoon. The characters lack so much in emotion and soul, which I know is no fault of the actors/actresses playing the parts because we know how great they are. But it was because they were told to tone it down so their level of emotion could match the lack of emotional expressiveness in the animals being displayed on screen, which is naturally what would happens when you go for making the lions look as real as possible.The movie is predictable to the point of boredom. Sure, you're going into this movie knowing the plot, but I also knew the plot to Aladdin and that was neither predictable nor boring. It pains me most to say this, but this is a cash grab. If you remember a few years ago, the movie Titanic was re-released, but in 3D. This is very comparable to that.",The Lion King
2200,nataliewoods-43477,We wanted The Lion King and we got The Lion King,8,20 July 2019,"Let me preface this review by saying that The Lion King (1994) has been my favourite movie my entire life - I even have a Simba tattoo - so let me tell you I have been eagerly awaiting this reboot more than your average Disney fan.As the movie began I was surprised, quite pleasantly, that they had chosen to follow the Circle of Life sequence scene-by-scene. Knowing what was coming was somewhat comforting, and intriguing to see how they would bring each animal to life.I'll admit though, I wasn't expecting the rest of the movie to also be scene-by-scene, but I can't say that I'm disappointed as we wanted a remake of the original; change too much and people will complain, change too little...apparently people will still complain?The Graphics: As a little girl I would imagine every lion in every nature documentary to be Simba, Nala, Mufasa, Scar, etc. This movie simply makes that a reality. You cannot fault the CGI, it is stunning and every animal's movement has been perfected - but of course this means we lose the anthropomorphic expressions that made the original more relatable, particularly during Mufasa's death scene. While little Simba's voice sounds like he's crying, the cubs face remains pretty neutral. Again, as they were aiming for realistic looking animals, it seems silly to complain that we didn't see any tears, but there is only so much emotion a voice can convey and it does take from the scene somewhat.The soundtrack: the instrumental pieces throughout the movie were as magical as ever, I'm glad they didn't tweak them too much and lose the Lion King-ness of them.As for the songs, they were mostly well done, but I was disappointed with Can You Feel The Love Tonight and Be Prepared.I felt that Can You Feel The Love Tonight had been overly ""beyonce-d""; way too many extra notes thrown in there, seemingly just to prove that her voice has such a range. We already know that. The song doesn't NEED anything fancy because it's already a beautiful, simple song. In my opinion it made the whole sequence less enjoyable.When Scar started speaking (not really singing) some new lyrics to the tune of Be Prepared I started to get into it, but then it kind of just...fizzled out. Instead of using the run-time to do the whole song he starts to just repeat ""Be Prepared"" while jumping higher up some rocks, and it just seemed a little...odd. Be Prepared in the original was one of the best songs because it was dark but catchy. This version was neither, it was just rather boring.The Voices: when I heard the cast line-up I was sad to hear that Jeremy Irons would not be reprising his role as Scar, and that Whoopi Goldberg would not be voicing Shenzi. I was thrilled that James-Earl Jones would be Mufasa once again, although I couldn't help but think that they could have really just used all of the old audio from the original, as pretty much all of his lines were the same. Beyonce wouldn't have been my first choice for Nala, her voice just doesn't sound quite right for me, but I think she was probably cast mostly for her singing voice (all those extra notes won't sing themselves, you know!) For me though the most disappointing voices were those of the hyenas - I liked the voice of Shenzi, but the two ""comical"" hyenas sounded overly american to me. The humour sounded forced and unnatural in their voices and made me cringe. Adult Simba and Young Simba sounded fantastic though, and as the main character I suppose that's all that matters.All in all I was pleased with this movie. The original is engraved on my heart (and my skin) forever. This remake was the closest I will ever get to watching The Lion King for the first time again, and for that I am thankful that they stayed faithful to the original. Hakuna Matata.",The Lion King
2201,jlodjdude,Best Disney remake ever in all live action films,10,20 July 2019,The story has more details and meaning that was never mentioned in the original like when Nala went to get help. Remove things that was making people uncomfortable to today's generation. More funnier than the original with Seth Rogan as pumbaa. Love that one line change one hakana matata. And they're we're things mentioned about mufusas past when mufasa had to rescue Simba and Nala and zazu remembered how he was. And he had a big role to help his pride loyalty from scar instead being a cage like the original. So on.,The Lion King
2202,melissanhill-54461,I was pretty disappointed.,5,20 July 2019,"I came into the theatre super excited to see this movie. So far I thought Disney has been doing an amazing job on all their remakes. The only one I haven't seen yet is Dumbo.First I'll start with the positives:
The animation is beautiful. It really does make you feel like you're actually watching the animals.
There's new characters. No one wants to see an exact copy of the original, so this was a fun and neat move.
Most of the music sounded great.
John Earl Jones, such an iconic voice for Mufasa.For the negatives:
The characters show very little emotion. There were certain things in the cartoon version that made you feel what the characters felt, the movement of the ears, facial expressions, etc.
I feel they took out the best parts of the original. Grafiki never hits Simba on the head with his stick. A lot of Timone and Pumba's parts were altered or missing making the duo just seem awkward instead of the hilarious duo they were in the original. All the hyena jokes were missing with a very few mediocre new jokes about personal space. There were other thing they could have changed up and kept the parts listed in to make their movie differences.
I'll probably receive hate for this but Beyoncé as Nala. I just felt her voice sounded too mature for a young Lioness. The deep pitch threw me off. I feel she would have been better suited for Sarabi. A voice higher pitched like Rihanna would have worked better for Nala in my opinion. Beyoncé also drug some of the word out making them longer than they should have been which made Nala sound more confused than not.Over all I give this movie 5 stars. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it.",The Lion King
2203,randycbg,Waste of time,1,20 July 2019,Worst movie and music was terrible. Dont waste your time or money.,The Lion King
2204,firestormwarning,"Suffers in a few places, but a few coats of polish and an expanded plot help even out the film.",8,20 July 2019,"The bad:
-James Earl Jones sounds tired, and his voice is off in a few places, but he still conveys the kind of warmth and power you would expect the Majestic Mufasa to portray.-A couple mis-cast characters in the first act-Beyonce's song. Sorry, she's a talented singer, but her song doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the film.-A minor nitpick, but why can't we use the Elton John version of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?""-The early story is a bit rushed in places, but overall, it doesn't affect the quality of the film as a whole.The good:
-The CGI work is amazing, and despite going a photo-realistic route, you can get a pretty good sense of who's who.-The villains are given a bit more depth. Scar is fleshed out a bit more and his motivations are given a bit more time in the spotlight, while the hyenas have gone from bumbling lackeys to genuine threats. Shenzi in particular (Love you Whoopie, but Florence Kasumba has you beat here) benefits from this change.Timon and Pumbaa are not only greatly toned down, now missing many of their fourth-wall breaks and senseless references to the human world, they're actually joined in their jungle home by a cast of other prey outcasts. Pumbaa benefits from their changes especially, even if Timon is hurt a bit by the story changes.Nala and Sarabi are given more presence on-screen, each with their own means of driving the story forward. Some of the tone is borrowed from the TLK broadway play, and this is a GOOD thing! Sadly, poor Sarafina is still relegated to a single line.So overall, what did I think? It's worth the watch, worth the ticket, and overall, I think just as enjoyable, on its own merits, as the original film. It won't replace the classic, but to say that the original is SO MUCH BETTER just... no, it isn't. I'd put them on equal footing.I may give more thoughts later, when more people have had a chance to see it. Suffice it to say, however, this is a case where, yet again, the critics are wrong. Definitely recommend if you are a fan of the original. Just do not walk in expecting a shot-for-shot remake. That's not what this is, and I don't think the John Favreau intended it to be such.",The Lion King

2212,cortex-18937,Spectacular Visuals spoiled with Poor casting/ Directing,6,2 August 2019,"Watching a remake of a classic like The Lion King you obviously watch with high expectations. I believe if you remake something you either keep the original script or change it entirely. But with this 2019 version they ended up in an awkward in between. Apart from James Earl Jones and Seth Rogan, I think the recast choices were poor. Though Beyonce may have been successful with covering the songs I did not find her the best fit for the voiceover enacting which to be fair is a difficult task and not for any actor. The transformation of Timon into a feminine gay male character did not fit in the original scenes and script. Young Simba's character is more arrogant and cowardly than the original which again didn't fit well. Rafiki lost some of his good scenes and is silenced most of the time. Over all the characters are with less emotion. And unfortunately although it is still a movie to enjoy (credit given to the original classic story and the spectacular visuals), you may leave disappointed a bit missing the original.

2213,lizreevell,Very Disappointing,4,20 July 2019,"Jon Favreau should stick to marvel films! This film had so much potential but was flat, lacked emotion, and the music was disappointing. He took everything that was great about the Lion King out of this remake and we were just left with great cgi and not much else.
And yet Guy Ritchie's Aladdin was fantastic!! Had everything a great Disney film should have, humour, great music that gives you goosebumps and makes you wan't to dance and had emotion.
I left feeling disappointed and deflated, I had such high expectations for this film. There were even people on their phones half way through due to being bored.

2214,bethsheppard-10812,Ignore reviews and go experience it for yourself,10,20 July 2019,"Jon favreau made this film to bring honour to the original. Although some argue it's unnecessary it's is a stunning tribute shown in a new light. Let's be honest the day and age is changing and cgi is the new cartoon animation. This film gives children of this day and age to experience it in a way they are now accustomed too. The way pumba and Timone hint towards how people clap when they say Hakuna matata and how timone doesn't stop pumba from saying fart is and direct reference to the original. The cgi alone deserves a 10/10. The casting couldn't be more perfect as well as the singing. The amazing team behind the film should be incredibly proud.All I would say is ignore the negative reviews because at the end of the day you don't need facial expressions to show emotion. The emotion is told through the voice, eyes and actions of the characters and I 100% felt emotion from them. Yes it isn't the original and to be honest it will never be because that's the original source material we grew up with like how before cartoons of fairytales cake put people preferred the books.

I felt the voices from the characters a little bit desynchronized with their mouths. There were a few kids screaming in the cinema room, which made me enjoy a little bit less, but it's not the movie's fault.I've seen a few times in my life such good image quality, it is just stunning. A good touch was chosen most of the animal's voices to be interpreted by African Americans, which makes a lot of sense since the movie passes in Africa.It was a good movie, but the biggest reason for it was that reminds me of the original one.

But no one else, especially Scar and Zazu, suited the characters.What was with ruining 'be prepared'. Such a fantastic song.Beyonce destroyed 'can you feel the love tonight' with all her annoying 'riffing' and nothing positive to say about her voice acting either.Alot of the great lines from the original were cut.

2220,tvgeorge-50379,Terrible remake with absolutely no emotions,1,20 July 2019,"Wasted 2 hours and popcorn in this movie. Ok, visuals ares stunning. The original movie is full of emotions. When Musafa dies, just looking at the expressions on Simbas face in the original movie, you cry. You can see lots of emotions in Mufasa face when he starts teaching a lesson to Simba (angry face), next moment he tells him that he was scared that he would lose(expression of fear) and when Simba says that hyenas were scared, you can see the happy and playful expression on Mufasa face in the original movie. In the remake, you can see realistic lion but with flat face irrespective of what's going on. Can you enjoy 2 hours of visual stuff with all the characters expression less?? Just moving the mouth is not enough.
Overall, it's a time waste. I saw this movie as a kid and watched it again and again. Now, I told my daughter how good this is and how many times I saw this in theatre. Took her to the movie and I was so disappointed.

This movie to me, was so amazing and I'm baffled as to why people are giving this a 1 like come on, that's so unfair! Anyway, I was sold! I've seen it twice back to back the night before it was officially released. Don't expect to see be prepared song, they cut it short into more of a speech. They show Nala leaving pride rock to get help, Zazu is not in a cage singing it's a small world after all, um-, Nala takes charge, Sarabi fights Scar back, Scar has more of a purpose and wants to interact with Sarabi to gain the respect for the other lions. Don't expect to see the same hyenas from the original, this time they have a fierce leader and she is Shenzi...
It was all about the Lion King so many supporters came. I can see why people are complaining about the lack of emotions, but after seeing it the second time I got the message. It's photorealism of a the actual jungle and animal Kingdom. If they made the animals emote it would've taken away the realism. This is the first movie to showcase realistic speaking animals. Yes the acting is dry, yes some of the songs were slightly weak. Timon & Pumba stole the show, Beyonce spoke well and sang great. Scar was less flamboyant too.

I find that hard to believe as half the cinema were crying.To which at the end of the film the audience clapped and gave an ovation.Go see it for yourselves and dont listen to the negative people, it's not the original but its still a fantastic enjoyable movie",The Lion King

It's a animated movie and then they can excagerate with the expressions and emotions on the animals their face...But this is a realistic image of animals. So it's very normal that they didn't or couldnt overdo the expressions/emotions on their face. Or else the judges, like some of them here, would say it's so too much that a real life lion on screen would smile or so...So anyway, it's always something if you think that way. I wen't to see it just to relax and see my alltime childhood favorite movie once again, this time more realistic and i liked the movie very much. And i DID see some emotions on their face.And REMEMBER it's a realistic movie, not a animated anymore.So just go see it, and enjoy. I did for sure!",The Lion King
2225,jgok-54508,A beat for beat recreation of the orignal movie that misses the point,3,20 July 2019,"This is by far the worst of the live action disney movies. A literal beat for beat recreation of the orignal movie that adds nothing and actaully removes a huge amount. My wife and I were tempted to leave around the half way point due to how bland this film was.Annimation: 4 / 10
To start with the cgi annimation in this looks great when still but when the characters are moving it looks really off like key frames of annimation are missing leading to a really jumpy experiance thats also moves just a little too fast. The expresions on the characters is usually very bland and doesn't really convay any emmotion.Voice Acting: 2 / 10
it really sounds like almost every single voice actor phoned it in to be honest. James earl johnes sounds like he is board for each line. scar is an extreamly generic villin voice with no charm. The only voice actor who actually sounded like they really wanted to try was zazu's voice acter but even then it comes across as really generic.Music: 3 / 10
most of the music sounds like it has been ripped stright from the orignal which is ok (if a little lazy) but they then reduced one of the major (and best IMO) songs to be a 20 second snipit of the song. The timing of the music is also very poor with one example being ""can you feel the love tonight"" being played during the day and is sandwitched between 2 arguments so it makes no sense to be played there.Jokes: 3/10
Most of the jokes are the same as the orignal but with the punch line being altered. the problem here is the new punch lines are 9 times out of 10 not funny. The only 2 characters who were able to get a laugh consistently were tomon and pumbaThe biggest problem that this film has is that it just misses the point of the orignal film completely with a lot of the sences they cut being far more important or entertaining than what was added which essentually was just extra annimation of non characters running around.",The Lion King

Lion King is one of my favorite movies, and I was really excited about it. As soon as ""Circle of Life"" ended, I was like... oh no, this is not going to be good. And it was NOT good.The CGI was great, i guess... the animals were very life like, but you are creating talking animals, so why not just give them expressions? I dodnt understand that.Every climactic in the movie just fell flat... Mufasa's death, Simba and Nala reuniting, Scar's musical number... it was all flat and almost boring.And why, for the love of everything that is holy, WHY DID THEY SING CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT, IN THE DAYTIME???? Terrible!The actors they chose were horrible, especially Nala and Simba. Horrible musical numbers! None of the musical hits even came close to competing with the originals. Beyonce's voice was so weak..The only kind of upside was that Timon and Pumba were adorable and funny at times. But they cut out so many good taglines.Anyway to sum up.. it was not. I left feeling very angry and unsatisfied. Disney really needs to just let the classics be classics and not try to redo movies that we already love. COME UP WITH NEW MATERIAL!!!",The Lion King

Also the voices of the characters are well interpretated by the actors and I also love Can You Feel The Love Tonight because of the voices of Donald and Beyoce, what s more the song Spirit is so beautiful and rightly put in the movie! Definetely i like this remake more than the original Disney 1994 movie because has many scenes that the cartoon doesnt contain and the dialogue between the characters is improved and doesnt make the scenes so short like in the cartoon!

There is no doubt about that.A lot of people are calling this movie emotionless, but I felt that even though the characters weren't necessarily smiling/frowning (I guess this is to make them look realistic), I could still tell what they were feeling. The music was nice too.Though it doesn't meet the original, I thought it was well done.",The Lion King
2236,myakomodo15,Lacking in everything but animation,6,21 July 2019,"The Lion King was easily the movie I anticipated most upon hearing it was being remade - and seeing the movie I grew up with being so starkly lackluster in comparison to the original was heart breaking.The animation was incredible - the opening scene and Circle Of Life were easily the best parts of the film. Everything had been meticulously animated, and the overall finish was gorgeous- absolutely stunning. I applaud every single person working on the animation for not only making the original into 'live action', but for altering the over the top scenes from the original into real life scenes that captured the same essence.That being said, nothing in this movie is without its flaws. The songs were lacking in emotion and strength. 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' radiated an energy of boredom, and it seemed as if everyone singing wasn't prepared to. Yes, it was entertaining but it lacked any power the original had. Of course, no one could compare to the original voice actors, however it seems like they didn't try. 'Be Prepared' was cut down so much, and was altered so much that there was hardly any point of having it in the film. 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' was easily the best song in the film.Timon and Pumba were easily the best part of the film - as they exuded the energy the original did They seemed to have chemistry and was overall enjoyable. Most of the characters in the film felt boring, perhaps that is just coming from someone who loved the original, but it seemed like they weren't committed to doing the original justice in the acting department. Even when Mufasa was killed, I didn't feel the sadness in Simba, I didn't feel the malice Scar had for him.The fight scene between Simba and Scar was the most visually appealing scene to me - and had they been more into their roles - I believe their animosity would have been more tense and enjoyable.I can appreciate the movie for what it is, and had it not have been based on the original, it would have stood out more to me.",The Lion King

They exceeded that! so i could not agree with the ""lack of emotions"" thingy.I loved how they gave us a glimpse of Scar's feelings to Sarabi..Some songs needed more colorful & dynamic scenes like ""i cant wait to be king"" & ""hakuna matata""Be prepared for the death of Mufasa guys😭 they captured it exactly as the animation *sobs*Scar's personality in this version was interesting i liked it,.Unfortunately they did not include the scene when Rafiki hits Simba with his stick however i did not get disappointed because he got the other lovely lines in this version,.You must see it for the sake of nostalgia & the AMAZING CGI!!

There was absolutely NOTHING wrong or that I would change in any way. You got all the right songs and voices and didn't miss or add a scene.

This remake didn't have the charm of the original, the lions had limited expressions and the singing parts came off flat. Scar was dull looking and not intriguing in the least.

2247,dsodenphoto,"Fantastic Remake, In Depth Interpretation with Minor Spoilers",10,22 July 2019,"I'll start of by saying that the original Lion King is my favorite Disney money of all time. I also spent 12 years of my life as conversation and wildlife educator. I love animals, but I'm a stickler for adequate interpretation of wild animals. Obviously any movie with talking animals pushes that, but I want you to have my full scope when I give my review. I am absolutely taking all aspects into consideration.The remake is beyond gorgeous in terms of visuals, and for that that alone I think it's worth seeing on the big screen. In terms of the story, sure they made some changes to keep in line with a more realistic approach, but this is the most faithful remake I have ever seen.The plot follows the original with incredible accuracy, though they have added some additional flair and backstory where needed. There are new moments of comic relief without being slapstick and hula (as much as I love the original scene, it did not belong here). While the hyenas are still the bad guys, they removed the constant insults of calling them unintelligent, as real hyenas are quite smart, and I love that they cast them as their own (matriarchal) pack before joining Scar's master plan.As for the people who are claiming there isn't enough emotion in the animals' faces... I have so much to say about that. First, and most lightheartedly, if you want to see humanoid cats, wait for the Cats remake... then I'll wait to hear back from you on how much you hate that too. But on a more serious note, as an educator and just general empathetic human on this planet, it's terrifying to me that there are so many people who don't think watching realistic animal go through this heart wrenching story is emotive enough. Real animals. A lion being trampled to death. Mixed with real animal behavior. Layered with the voice actors wonderful talent. I kindly ask that you look internally and reevaluate what it takes for you to be be touched by other living creatures an expand your reach beond eyebrows. I have cried every single time I have watched this film since I was a child, but I cried more and harder in this version as a woman in my 30s.Back to the voice actors, sure I miss some of the wonderful talent of the original film, but that doesn't take anything away from the actors who were in this version. And at least we got James Earl Jones, so let's all thank our stars for that. I'll also add that I felt Scar as a character was absolutely menacing in this remake with his internet SO much more clear, deliberate, and evil than what is conveyed in the original, and it makes the movie more believable.This movie is a visual masterpiece, true to the original content while still being updated, and is at times painfully more heartwrenching that the cartoon. If you want to watch the original, just watch the dang original, but this remake was fantastic and faithful in a new style. I loved it.",The Lion King

HOWEVER, after sleeping on it, I love it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't as good as the original, but it never would be. The original has all your childhood memories wrapped up in this. This movie kept the humor of Timon and Pumba, the emotions of the original storyline, and wrapped it up in a gorgeous CGI form. I left feeling nostalgic but also wonder at the effects.

They even gave her another song where she did it even more. Ofc ""Queen B"" couldn't step down from her throne and let the actual movie get the attention. Because of her they lost one star from me.The second star I'm taking away is because they ruined the best song from the original, Be prepared. Why? Why?!Now i'm done being hateful. The rest of the movie was really good. The animation is beautifully made! I fell in love with Timon and Pumba all over again. The lion sleeps tonight was the best part of the entire movie!

The expressions even in tone of voice for some of the lines were lacking, the remake of for example ""be prepared"" song - very poor, it lacked the emotion and magic of the original in many scenes. Where other remakes have added new songs or deviated a little from the original story to add something unique, this was a little 'too' alike the original. I feel they may have done better doing an offshoot or Lion King 2. Fantastic effort, no doubt! Just missing that magic.",The Lion King
2257,matthewwaltdisneybennett,A Visual Groundbreaking Cinematic Achievement and An Emotional Roller Coaster Ride!!!,9,23 July 2019,"DISCLAIMER: This is only my second review here and to the trolls I am not being paid to write this review this is my true and honest opinion so on to the review.Let's start from the beginning The Lion King is one of Disney's most iconic films. It's a movie that I grew up with so when I heard that they were remaking it I was very nervous. Then I heard Jon Favereau was on board and he created The Jungle Book which I enjoyed very much he created a photo realistic environment in which I could totally believe in the world that he created along with its characters. When I heard that the same technology would be applied to The Lion King I was very excited to see what could be done. Walking to the cinema I didn't quite know what to think but as soon as the Circle of Life started and we saw the sweeping shots over the African Savannah I was immediately sent to tears as I gazed on the jaw dropping beauty that Jon Favereau had created. It's a technical crowning achievement very ground breaking using VR and motion capture technology. I almost wondered is this is how the audience in 1937 felt when they saw Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs in awe of something that they never thought would be possible. The stunning photo realism is something really to behold it when comes to the realism of the animals right down to every last inch of fur or whether it's the sweeping shots of the African Savannah. Never have we seen Africa depicted in such a beautiful way on camera. This is something I salivate over films that push the boundaries of technical achievement and what we can do in the world of special effects and our ability to create new worlds. The world of The Lion King is the most perfect thing to use this technology on especially since it's mostly untested. The story is still as powerful and is potent as ever I laughed and I cried. I see criticism that there is no emotion in this film and I must disagree on many levels while they do not have human facial emotions as they do in the traditional animated film you can see the emotion in their eyes and in their body movement these animals show emotion as they do in real life anybody who has seen a nature documentary or has studied these animals would be able to read the emotions of these characters quite easily. There going for realism here. To me it makes it all more emotional to see real animals go through such traumatic experiences whether its a lion being thrown off a cliff to his violent death or a lion cub lying down next to the deceased body of this father. I cried at Mufasa death I haven't cried that hard since my friends funeral last August. The emotion conveyed in Simba's eyes, body language and voice so powerful. I never cried at the original but it was the stunning photo realism that made it all the more powerful for me. No he does not show tears but that's because real lions don't have tears but the emotion is there. This is not a cartoon this time. Let's talk about the voice cast. The cast in this film is truly remarkable first of all we have James Earl Jones returning to the role of Mufasa and he is excellent as usual. He still a wise and caring ruler. Chiwetel Ejiofor is truly remarkable as Scar it's very different from Jeremy Irons but that's a good thing I think because in this version he is more menacing and scary. In some ways I enjoyed this version of the character more because of how truly frightening I felt he was. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan steal the show as Timon and Pumba as so many other reviews have said because its true they bring so much warmth and comedy to the film an offer a lot of the inside and meta jokes that only true fans could truly appreciate. There is Beyoncé and Donald Glover who I thought were very good in there respected roles. Donald Glover played a good adult Simba and Beyoncé did fairly okay in her part as well even if she could feel a little to Beyoncé at times. There rendition of Can You Feel The Love tonight is truly powerful. Speaking of the music Hans Zimmer score is brilliant once again how the background score brings an extra layer of emotion that carries you through the story. All of the songs are so well handled such as a Hakuna Matata, I Just Can't Wait To Be King and the Circle of Life. Be Prepared is also in this movie but the song has been rewritten and shortened and it's much more darker and sinister and I really love it as I think it fits this version of the character of Scar and matches the tone of the movie which is a bit darker and more serious than the original. I also added a bit of extra layers to the story they add a bit of a back story with Scar hinting at the fact that Sarabi may have chosen Mufasa over him and he still feels a bit of resentment from that. She shows herself to be a strong queen after Mufasa's death as she rejects Scar to be his queen. The hyena's are another great example in original the hyenas were played for laughs they were depicted as stupid and unintelligent and while I really love to that in the cartoon in this photo realistic aesthetic I don't think it would have worked cause hyenas in real life are actually intelligent and the females truly are the leaders of the hyena packs. Shenzi is a strong fierce and scary and the two male hyenas have a blend of menace and comedy which is a good balance. These additions really work I think. There so much more I could talk about in this jaw dropping adaptation of The Lion King but I think I have covered all of the important points. I think it's very true to the original movie while offering up enough changes to make it feel fresh so it's definitely not a shot by shot word for word remake as some have suggested. I understand why this movie may not work for some people. I know some people feel it's too similar or two different or that this movie doesn't work being told with such photo realism but I think Jon is a really great film maker and really passionate about his movies and really wants to make his movies to be good and I can tell that he really cared about The Lion King and really wanted it to live up to the original. This was bound to get a strong reactions and divide fans because of the nature of what this movie is it's just part of the territory there's not a lot you can do about it. I do think the film was very well handled and was very good considering the nature of what it is and I think that they did the best job that they could do. This is my honest opinion I know that not everyone will agree but this is how I feel. I just try to judge the film on its own merits without comparing it to the original and to give a true honest review. This film was truly an emotional experience for me that I will never forget it really changed now I think about cinema and how we can tell stories. I think this movie really set the bar and really changed the game. I don't think movies will be made the same and I think paves the way for a different way to tell stories and to create worlds we have never seen. I give this film an outstanding 9 out of 10.",The Lion King
2258,cingrp,Incredible movie.,10,23 July 2019,"I read other people's reviews before I go to the cinema but I don't make a decision before I see the movie myself and I am really glad that I went to the cinema even when all the negative reviews dropped. I was counting with realistic animals and that's exactly what I got. People say that thanks to the realistic animations the movie lost it's ""magical"" atmosphere. But it was an exact opposite for me. Thanks to the realistic animations, the movie felt more, well, realistic and thanks to that more magical. I was often even forgetting it's not a real life movie.
So, what about the film itself? Was it actually good? Yes, it was an absolute masterpiece. The animation was incredible and same goes to music. Remade music really did sound incredible and I loved that. When you combine the incredible music with the more incredible story and even more incredible animation, you bet it will make a masterpiece.
I am not here to compare 2019's The Lion King to the original. The movies are very, very different. It mostly depends on each one's movie taste. For me, both movies are great and I'll love them for the rest of my life. So if you want to watch the new The Lion King, don't mind the negative reviews and just go and watch it so you can make your own decision.

2259,yolandamichaels,Why did they remake a perfect movie?,2,23 July 2019,"I went to see the original in summer theater in 1994. I was ten and I was stunned. It was and remains to this day my favorite animated movie. When my daughter turned one I showed it to her and for six months we watched it every day. I did the same for my son and he always wanted ""the lion"". Now they are 5 and 3,5 and I thought why not go all together to the cinema for their first movie. It will be familiar and a re-imagining of their first movie at home. It was so disappointing. At first I tried to keep an open mind but it was no use. Both my kids liked the popcorn and the family experience but not the movie. My daughter, being the eldest, was more specific. ""I liked the cinema but not the movie, I got bored"". My son said we can go to the cinema again but not to this.
My husband and I both agreed with all the other bad reviews. It had no soul, it was like watching a documentary and all the changes they made was for the worse. If you loved the original, do not go to this. Stay at home and watch the beauty of the 1994 visuals and of course, the original cast.",The Lion King

It has some funny parts and it can be entertains at times, but so was the '94 version. These lions look so weird and fake/ real, that I am distracted the whole time.

2265,truereview-28094,Terrible Voice Acting,2,24 July 2019,"This is my first ever movie review, but I genuinely believe this needs to be said. Disney really crashed and burned with the making of this film. I love the Lion King story (the original) and they absolutely butchered it. Some original movie lines (what was said) were put into this movie and the voice acting sounded so forced it was cringe-worthy. There was a bit of ""natural"" voice acting that did not copy the original movie lines, which almost made the movie bearable, but this was completely overshadowed by what I would consider sacrilege to the original - which is to say the concept of Hakuna Matata. In this movie, this seemingly carefree concept was turned into - the world doesn't matter, everything you do is meaningless. WHY would anyone want their kids to believe in this concept!? I'm sorry but hakuna matata from the original to me meant to remain stress free and to keep moving forward. Also, another component missing in this movie was the magic! I mean, you have talking animals and I know you want it to seem more ""real,"" but let's be honest, disney movies are supposed to be filled with magic and imagination to allow for children to dream and hope. The pitiful scene with mufasa in the thunder clouds did not capture the essence of the original. I for one felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters in this movie because it was too unrealistic/fake, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.",The Lion King

If someone told me I could make hundreds of millions of dollars just by releasing something that's not original, I'm definitely doing it, but that doesn't change the fact that people will be dissatisfied. This is not the kind of movie you can remake. The lions look too real, and to hear voices coming out their mouths is just weird. It doesn't evoke the same emotion as the original. This classic was best left alone.",The Lion King

I mean it's crazy! Everyone is wining about how emotionless and REAL the characters look, I mean, what did you expect? Have you watched the trailer? Have you rewatched the trailer? Disney even announced that they'll make the re-make using CGI. I think you could've *felt* and saw *some* emotion on the characters' faces.

Biggest issue I had was believing in the actors/actresses playing their roles. They all felt very bland and monotone. Almost all the songs were terrible...

I wanted to walk out instantly but managed to struggle through to see the iconic Simba and Nala scene and 'can you feel the love tonight'...... Walked out as soon as it started. I have never walked out on a film but this was just too much. All Disney had to do was put the original vocals over the new effects and we would have a truly amazing film, but no instead they decide to spend all their efforts getting the effects perfect that the casting got zero thought.I would have given this a 0 rating if could, I will definitely be trying to forget this film ever happened and remember the Lion king for how it should be and not this disgrace.",The Lion King

the animations and overall graphics were awesome. I guess this is where most of the money went.the story was displayed in a very nice and serious way, with one huge exception that I'll mention below. There were no important deviations from it and it really kept the dramatic mood throughout the movie.The bad parts:
why, for the love of God, would you make a movie with several musical bits, considering the seriousness and dramatic flair of the story? Why ruin the awesome atmosphere in such a silly way?! The story is good and was presented in a way that actually made people FEEL something. Suddenly, everyone starts singing some happy songs that are in complete contrast to what the movie is about.The final question:
who is Nala's father? Simba, just like his father, was the only male lion in the pack (except for Scar who didn't seem to be loved by any female). Apparently even in the whole world.Too bad, it could've been great.",The Lion King

Absolute delight, go watch it!!",8,27 July 2019,"I don't understand why people have absolutely hated this movie. The only reason I'm giving it an 8 is because, as a lot of people have said, it lacks the character expressions that were present in the original movie. If you're familiar with the original movie you probably remember Simba laughing and crying. That's obviously missing here, which does regress the experience a little bit. But overall, it's the same beautiful story, CGI is second to none, Timon & Pumba are an absolute delight. Bit disappointed with Nala, it just feels like Beyonce talking. I'd still recommend just about everyone to watch this movie, the Circle of Life intro is an exact recreation of the original, which is an absolute delight!! Don't bother listening to people who've given it a 1-star because they think ""the story is exactly the same as the original"" or ""the characters lack expressions like in the hand-drawn animation movie"" or because ""Disney has become a cash cow'"".

The audio was way too bad that it made the movie cringy and unwatchable. At one point I was questioning where I have ever been more bored. The Answer? Driving 4 hours to see my parents in traffic. That is what it felt like at so many points. They made 3-7 seconds of content span 30-40 seconds. Washed out with horrible audio. If you want to basically watch a cute youtube cat video for 4 hours then I recommend. Worst of all, I paid for it. Go to anything else. Honestly.",The Lion King

There were some scenes that seemed a bit rushed for me and the voice acting was awful. The only characters I was actually pleased with was Pumba and Timon. The CGI was great, one of the best i've seen. Watching the movie in 3D, it made me feel like I was actually in Africa. However, there was no life in the movie. Almost all the characters felt fake because they showed the same bland emotion in every scene. I had fun watching the movie, but it also left me with disappointments.",The Lion King
2285,blacknekochi,Missing the spirit,4,28 July 2019,"Visually, the movie was really great, the setting seemed very real and the characters were well made.
However, the movie lacked emotions. The characters' expressions didn't change much through the movie. But what was even worse, the voice acting was emotionless as well. It seemed like the actors were simply reading their parts without any emotions and with no connection. Because of that a character like Scar lost the traits that defined him, and because of that many strong scenes provoked no emotions.
In addition, they changed some crucial conversation parts. I have nothing against plot changes but they should've kept what was important to the story and character building (such as when Simba finds Mufasa).
Finally, I liked how they've kept most of the songs but why change Scar's song which is considered to be one of the best villain songs? Didn't feel the 'Be Prepared' vibe from the song and singing.
I was prepared to cry like a child while watching the movie that defined my childhood but walked out of the cinema feeling disappointment and a desire to go and watch the original one.",The Lion King

2287,hairycoconut-72205,Unfortunate (tldr at the end),5,28 July 2019,"As a kid, I had a VHS tv, on which i used to watch the original Lion King. When I heard that there was a live action remake, I was beyond thrilled. I was dissatisfied by the presentation of this remake, much to my dismay.The animals, though believable, had no emotion apart from their mouths vaguely moving in word shapes.The parts where emotion was supposed to be portrayed were only supplied by the mediocre voice acting, going back to the whole part about the animals not having expressions of any sorts. The lines were changed so much from the original its hard to tell where you are in the story. Timone, once funny and full of character, felt flat and one sided, while Pumba was just used for potty humor and as relief for Timones boring character. (Though it could be argued that he was used for that in the original as well, it was to a much less extent and Timone was more of his own thing.) Simba as a cub was barely distinguished from Nala, which made for some confusing segments when they weren't talking (like in the elephant graveyard.) In the original, Nala was much paler than Simba, making it easy to tell them apart. The singing felt rushed and not thought through, and Beyonce over sang everything, making it hard to follow. Some songs, such as Be Prepared were almost completely cut. Rafiki was good though, portraying the real spirit the original was missing. The fighting was well balanced, and it felt suspenseful with the physics not being out of whack. the animation was really believable, with realistic movement and rhythm.Tldr, Ok voice acting, flat characters, no emotion, but ok animation.",The Lion King
2288,laurenmcgrath-42581,Very Disappointing,2,28 July 2019,"Although the movies CGI looks amazing I didn't go to watch what looks like a documentary. The movie completely lacked emotion, characters where made to have completely different personalities eg. Simba in the original film was very likeable and emotional like a real child and wanted to be just like his dad but in the remake he was cocky and cheeky and more of a bully. The story between scar and the hyenas was wrong and all the lines where completely rushed through instead of taking the time like the original, scars only song was cut and butcher into an almost protest as appose to a song? Wouldn't watch again, honestly wish I didn't waste my money.",The Lion King

Every hair, fur, twitch and breath of the animals are unbelievable! The movie was even better for adults than kids, the humor was as good if not better than the cartoon. All the voices were matched to the animals perfectly and the songs were so well done. This is a movie you can see over and over. So many fantastic images. I loved every minute!!!",The Lion King
2290,mikaylasun,Disappointed in Disney,2,29 July 2019,"The Lion King is my favourite movie of all time and to say that I'm disappointed in this live remake is an understatement. I have to give credit to the CGI which is fairly good, Seth Rogan & Billy Eichner for their roles as Pumbaa & Timon which I think were great and of course, James Earl Jones who can do no wrong as Mufasa. Many things, however, were just not right.Scar: In the original movie, Scar is a sarcastic sleaze to the point where it's laughable. Many key moments with him were just missed or it just wasn't executed well enough. The line ""ah Zazu, you made me lose my lunch"" had little sarcasm or no hint of evil in his voice. Scar seemed much more depressed and sinister. And even if that was Disney's goal of how Scar should be portrayed. It meant that anything the audience liked about Scar was wiped and from the get go, we just don't like him. Hearing Scar's voice is how I knew this film wasn't going to be one I could enjoy as much as I did the Aladdin remake (which is amazing).Zazu: Trying to top Rowan Atkinson's performance as Zazu was bound to be hard and John Oliver actually did really well. My issue is that a couple lines that made Zazu seem prestige in his own way and just all around comical were left out. For example ""oh very good pouncing...POUNCING? Oh no sir you can't be serious. This is so humiliating"" or the scene at which Zazu is trapped in a cage and sings depressing songs ""nobody knows the trouble I've seen, nobody knows my sorrow"" and then he switches it up by saint the coconut song and I just live for it. It built up his character which I thought was not showcased as much in the live remake.Particular scenes or lines: Maybe I've just watched this movie one too many times and am too closely analysing it BUT too many of the lines were just not said right or scenes were missed out.Nala's ""how're we going to ditch the dodo"" was changed to much a more polite way of saying it and I craved that rawness that came with her young character. (I'd like to point out the fact that Beyoncé actually did a good job as Nala, I don't think she was that overpowering).
In the scene where Pumbaa and Timon debate keeping Simba, we didn't get to see that process of Timon dismissing what Pumbaa said and making fun out of it before he then agrees with what he says and takes the idea as his own properly.
Pumbaa's ""my buddy Timon here says, you gotta our your behind in your past"" line by which is followed by Timon saying ""no no no, amateur. Sit down before you hurt yourself"" is completely missed out and they just go straight to the real talk.
Mufasa's ""Simba, you have forgotten me"" line was taken out which really upset me because his voice is just so monumental that that line has always stuck by me and it was nowhere to be seen.
Rafiki's ""oh yes, the past can hurt but you can either run from it or learn from it"" was missed out completely and THAT is when I really gave up with the film because it's one of my favourite scenes as that's when he uses his stick to teach him that lesson. Now, it must be said that I liked how they brought in the stick during the fight as he looked at it and said ""hello my old friend"" or something like that. It was very much needed.I would also like to draw attention to the fact that, even though, I cried at Mufasa's death scene (as I expected, I'll always cry at that scene), I felt as though Simba didn't have enough emotion. I understand that to make this work, you can't have such emotion in the lions without making it look fake but I think the mark was missed.",The Lion King
2291,bleecarter,Simba's voice 👎,8,29 July 2019,"I did not like the voice choices for Simba. No offense to the actors themselves. I just feel they weren't a good fit for Simba. Little Simba's voice lacked a certain enthusiasm, while Big Simba needed a stronger voice. I appreciate that they kept most of the original scenes the same and I loved the opening scene. My only other complaint is that certain reactions from the characters seemed a little rushed. Overall, I think it was pretty good and the characters looked so realistic.",The Lion King
2292,sdcameron-26826,Amazing,10,29 July 2019,Some people are sceptical & even critical on how much they would enjoy it compared to the original. Just remember they are very different films in the way they are portrayed. However I saw The Lion King at IMAX 3D & thought it was worth every penny & would watch it 100 times over.

2295,mikeystrachan,"As the saying goes, Never meet your heroes",5,30 July 2019,"One thing I have to say is the film looks spectacular. Visually it is amazing as it is as if you are watching a documentary and it was interesting seeing a bit of realism in the animals but this is partly it's downfall as well.
The 1994 film will always be up there as one of the greatest and this just seems that it's just can't live up to that standard.With the film following so close to the original it's impossible not to compare the film's like for like and with the added realism it just ends up failing. While it was amazing seeing a cute wee live action Simba, it just can't convey the emotions that the cartoon characters can to the point it just looks like he is void of any emotion which I felt removes you from the story.
I felt they really underused the Heynas to the point they just looked like background characters that got a few more talking lines but the trouble with that is being left be action it was impossible to show any expression. Despite Seth Rogan annoying me he did a good job here but Timon was a let down which I put down to a poor casting choice as instead of come off as eccentric he just comes off as quite camp and the same with John Oliver as Zazu.
You can hear Oliver trying to replicate Rowan Atkinson but it just comes off as 2nd rate to him which gets quite grating. I think Hugh Laurie may have been a better choice here. The rest of the cast are quite limp as none have a real booming voice.
The only new stuff added are a few one liners which did add a few chuckles.
All in all it was an enjoyable watch but unfortunately, due to how close the story is to the original (word for word), it will get compared to the original meaning it's just disappoints.",The Lion King

I was extremely skeptical of going to see this movie in theaters because of all the bad reviews it was getting from the users. After seeing the movie today, I felt so perplexed that I felt like I had to leave a review explaining why I think you shouldn't pay attention to the bad reviews on here. And also, why I think I love this version just as much as the first lion king!1. This movie left me in stitches. I can't speak for other people and their sense of humor but I couldn't stop laughing after Timon and Pumba entered the movie. There were some hilarious parts in the beginning of the movie as well, it's just that there were so many one liners that were super subtle but extremely effective once Timon and Pumba were introduced. I didn't think that I would start my review for The Lion King by saying that it was hilarious.2. A lot of people say it didn't have the ""magic"" that the first movie had. Although I tend to agree because one of my favorite movies of all time is The Lion King, I don't think there is anything they could have done to capture the wonder of seeing the lion king for the first time for me, especially since I was 5 when it came out. I remember that it blew my mind. This version, it was supposed to me more dramatic and realistic. I believe that they did a phenomenal job in achieving that, even though I knew what was coming, the scenes were so intense that it had me on the edge of my seat a lot of the time. The magic is in the fact that this movie is an amazing remake of one of my all time favorite movies.3. The thing that made me really scratch my head was the fact that people were saying it was an emotionless movie. I have no idea what movie they were watching. I told my sister (as we were leaving the theater), ""it's almost like they need to have the characters physically crying in order for people to know it's supposed to bring out emotions."" When Mufasa dies, it's just as sad as the first movie and the full stampede scene is so intense, it invests you more emotionally. When Simba has the scene where he sees his father in the reflection in the water and then the clouds, it was just as powerful, if not more than the first movie.I believe that this movie is a great remake of a perfect movie. I would almost go as far to say that I like this new version more than the old version. I can't say why people have such a negative reception to the movie other than they are very nostalgic about the original movie. It's the first time I felt like the reviews were misleading. It's weird to see a review section where people are complaining about the remake being exactly the same and at the same time so different from the first.",The Lion King

2304,imydeaton,Childhood film spat on,1,6 August 2019,"Jesus christ. I watched the original film when I was a child practically every week. I loved the music, the comedy, the drama. Just saw the remake. The music had been twisted to the point it was unrecognisable, with unnecessary key changes and over-dramatic flourishes, with the iconic song 'Be Prepared' sounding like nothing more than a half hearted poetry slam artist with a sore throat. The comedy was simple - they took a joke that was in the original film and ran with it until it literally wasn't funny anymore, until it dragged the initial smile off my face itself. Fart jokes and Timon putting Pumba down. Hilarious, I'm sure. Just not for me, or anyone else in my theatre judging by the stony silence that followed. The drama too, had been ruined. The tension interrupted by silly additions, like new jungle characters that did not exist in the original and contributed little, if anything, to the story. They dumbed it down and commercialised it, the capitalism of the film industry distorting an important and touching story into something I would never watch again. It was even painful in some places, and lacked any emotional levity that was in the original. Mufasa's death scene, which had made me cry like a baby in the past with the original, now felt stale and brief. Brushed off, even. Would not recommend to any fan of the original, or any fan of decent cinema. I don't doubt the talent of the voice actors, but I'm doubting the amount of effort put into their lines. They sounded like they were just reading off the script and relying to heavily on the VFX to bring their characters to life, which it did not. There are limitations to the range of emotions that the hyperrealistic lions could display, and this directly impacted the film. I could no longer sympathise with the characters, let alone empathise. Just very disappointing.",The Lion King

2307,timchudson,Never have I heard so much misplaced Whingeing - The LIon King is a triumph from beginning to end,10,7 August 2019,"I am not one to be easily pleased, I am very particular, but generally if I really don't like something, rather than wasting more of my life discussing it.. I just won't watch/talk about it again, and I'll let others decide for themselves.However on this occasion(and this is my first review), I felt genuinely compelled to comment, because I am so confused as to where any negative feedback is coming from. I simply cannot relate on any level.This film was absolutely sensational. It's not an opinion. It's fact. If you don't like it, then you shouldn't have gone to watch a modern adaptation of the Lion Ling. It is everything anyone could have hoped for. If you think there was no emotion, then you must literally have a heart of stone. If anything it built on top of the foundations of the original, encompassing all of its achievements and so so much more.Casting - the casting was obviously superb. If you think the acting was bad, thank god you aren't a casting director who actually has to make such decisions. Superbly executed dialogue throughout. The vocals were inspiring from beginning to end. This modern adaptation catered to the contemporary, making adjustments only where necessary to cater to today. The comedic writing and delivery was genius. Eichner and Rogen were flawless in achieving as much as anyone could hope in light of their iconic characters. If you thought there was too much spotlight on Beyoncé, then you are under appreciative of her talent. Perhaps consider that whilst she had no more dialogue than needed, as the viewer she remains in your mind because she really is just that sensational. In summary she just did more with what she had that others.Cinematography - some of the finest work ever created. Powerful and emotionally charged through out.It was gritty, real, raw, passionate, emotive and cathartic in all the best ways. I believe truly that any bad review is solely down to individuals insisting on having a controversial view.Fortunately, no one cares. Well done to the production team.Thank you - and go and enjoy it viewers!",The Lion King

2311,alexgoodman-86822,Wow - 'The Circle Of Life is Complete',10,9 August 2019,"There are some films/series etc that cannot be remade because of the era they they were made in. Having said that, a remake that follows the codes and conventions set by its original telling can work to an equally powerful effect. A remake should never try to replace the original; in fact the best remake will easily stand second place to its original and recapture the magic & nostalgia that was remembered long ago.
Animation is an art form that achieves emotion in a very different sense to Live Action, VR & CGI. The Lion King 2019 beautifully references and recaptures the nostalgia and the energy of the original whilst at the same time bringing some new injected life. It achieves the effect differently but that's the point. The imagery is very reminding and iconic. Live Action can work well if handled sensibly. Han's Zimmer's iconic score and the musical numbers are reworked and recaptured and the films pacing references the original. Doing certain things differently in a remake is important providing the iconic and nostalgia based parts are untouched. Mufasa is recreated exactly by originasl actor James Earl Jones. John Kani's Rafiki lives up brilliantly against Robert Guillaume's original and the story is retold and recaptured very well. It was the hardest Disney Classic to remake but references the original to a T.",The Lion King
2312,godsellsam,Decent but hollow,7,9 August 2019,"Does this movie have to be made? No, is this film better than the original? No. But it is an enjoyable film although it has a lot of short comings the cgi is absolutely amazing but like most people have said its so realistic the animals show no emotion which is a massive problem the voice cast for the most part is good although im on the fence with chitwel ejiofor as scar mainly because the biggest line in the movie is terribly given. Donald glover and beyonce are both terrible choices to play adult simba and nala but i was most disappointed in james earl jones although most of his lines remain the same his delivery of them is rather lackluster compared to the orignal quite similar to when he reprised his role as darth vader in rogue one his voive wavers and isnt as commanding. I like certain minor tweaks to the story like the fact its implied that mufasa gave scar his namesake injury and thus thats why he scartches mufasas face sending him to his death in the gorge, the hyenas are more of a threat in there own right not just comic relief and are ar war with the lions and not just scars henchmen although this change propably why the best villain song ""be prepared"" is cut down to the bone and is more of a battle cry but i suppose scar cant go around insulting the hyenas in a song when they have just threatened to eat him although a lot of the lyrics could of been reused it just seems it was just thrown in because of the outcry when it was rumoured it wasnt in the film which tbh it may well of not been in there. Also the fact were told sarababi chose between mufasa and scar and scar doesnt just want to be king but to have sarabi as his queen but apart from these the story is practically a shot for shot remake of the original and i do feel they could of done alot with this but decided to do a cash grab of a film that plays of peoples nostalgia",The Lion King

If I hadn't been given tickets I would have demanded a refund.This is the first time I have felt it necessary to review on IMDb.

People speaking about no expresion in faces... you really don't get it. Animals don't show expressions, animals make you ""FEEL"" their emotions, and this movie simulates that in an impressive way. I think feeling emotions is more intense that seeing them.The difference from the original is just the style and type of it, that's why it feels so ""different"".This movie reaches all his goals, nothing missing, imo.",The Lion King
2319,Xaos1234,"Great remake, nothing is perfect!",9,26 August 2019,"Really looked forward to this movie because I have so many great childhood memories and I think this film really performed. If you go to this movie you really need to keep an open mind, don't expect The Lion King from 1993 because then you will be disappointed. It's photo-realistic so it loses some of it's character, but makes up for it with beautiful shots.Personally I the voice-acting was decent and I liked the voices themselves, they fitted the character very well. With Beyonce's sound the songs really came alive and found them even better than the original songs.I see a lot of 1-star reviews who say it's the exactly the same, other reviews say it's nothing like the original. I found the updated film very different from the original with some scenes longer than the original, others shorter. All in all they captured the important scenes very well.The only critic that I would have to agree on is that the death of Mufasa didn't really have much emotion in it and the zoom out with Simba felt weird.",The Lion King

I'm not sure why some people are so down on this... I think people are mad they remade a classic, but even if that's the case, it's not like it was poorly made. It makes me sad that people are so negative. This movie is seriously great and wonderfully nostalgic. It's not identical to the original, but it has some great Easter eggs for the true Disney fans. I highly recommend it and would love to see a new Simba's Pride movie. Keep the remakes coming, Disney!!!",The Lion King

2323,puchipachi,The right editing choices to do the original's spirit justice,10,7 September 2019,"Finally, a skillful remake that does the actual, true spirit of the Lion King's world justice. It has its' flaws, but that doesn't take much away from the rest. I loved how they kept the pace of the original but still added and changed only some necessary details to fit the real animation style. Many people complain about the real-looking lions, but I think NOTHING is more epic and heart-moving and beautiful for a story like this than actually real looking animals.
I can't imaging how any other animation style could have done the dark and brutal action scenes, or the scenes of Simba's desperation justice.
We don't need another bad comical lion animation with big-eyed weirdly proportioned animals out there.
I'm glad they took real-looking lions.
I loved what they made of Shenzi and how Zazoo's role was more important. Scar's performance was amazing.
The action scenes and music moved me to tears and gave me goosebumps the whole time. My god, everything was so beautiful!
The details in their mimic when the lions looked at each other!Now, to add some light critique,
The additions they made for the jungle song scene were fun, just a little too much back to the comic nature of the original at some parts.Young Simba, I must admit, didn't have much facial expression at all and I felt they forgot to involve his ears more into his mimic.Although almost all other animals looked exactly like real animals, the hyenas reminded of mutated pitbulls and I have no idea who of the two male hyenas was supposed to be Ed because they completely changed the way they acted.Overall, there were some flaws, but as an adult who was obsessed with the original as a child, I'm really happy with how the remake turned out.",The Lion King
2324,preaa,Loved the CGI version of Lion King.,10,12 September 2019,"Loved this version. Was not expecting it to be the same as the original animated version, because it was not a remake. Was not expecting the CGI lions, hyenas, and other animals to have ""emotional"" facial expressions, because that wouldn't reflect real lions, hyenas, and other animals. Though I felt emotion from the story line, and music. Beautiful imagery, loved the voice actors, (surprisingly), brava. Loved how they tried to keep it as close as the original version as possible. Would see it again. But not without realizing I was not watching the original, animated 1995 version of the lion king. But a live CGI 2019 version, of a ""non remake"" but an adaptation. Literally the same movie but with a twist, new voices, and scenery. I would say about 80% verbatim to the original.

The remake just feels gross to me at this point like on top of that the original has WAY more heart and fun in it then the remake has in it's little finger! This movie just had no heart, they forgot what made the original so good in the first place and honestly I could never see myself wanting to watch thsi version over the original.

2361,myrandakaywatson,Disney please stop ruining my childhood favorites,2,23 December 2019,"Where to start. The singing was hard to listen to. I get wanting to keep it authentic and not hiring professional singers but ouch. With the excpetion of Queen B (her acting was flat) the signing was hard to listen to. Was really bummed that the opening circle of life was not as powerfully sung as the original. ""Be prepared""was creepy ( even more so then the original) which was probably the point. The acting was so emotionless. I just wanted to hear some emotion in their voices. When Mufasa dies you couldnt even tell it was upsetting.
The only emotions that hit are at the very end fight seen. And still its like they are reading off a script vs. Learning their lines and putting emotion into it. Just a Bummer since it was a great cast.
James Earl Jones coming back as Mufasa was great and of course Timon and Pumba were funny ( signing In the Jungle was a fun part of the movie).
Visually very well done but thats about it. Not worth the 7/10 rating on here.
My husband fell asleep and i had to remind my 7 year old to stop playing and watch the movie.",The Lion King
2362,kciseq,Stunning!,10,4 January 2020,"I have to start with one upsetting thing. I can't believe what others are writing in here. Garbage or horrible... Really? Where does it come from. This movie is a masterpiece.
And i tell You that as someone who loved the 1994 version. I still now remember all the dialouges. I used to irritate everyone who was watching the movie with me by speaking with the characters on screen. I got really sentimental when i got to know about the new version. Just a trailer almost made me cry. Now as a grown up I've seen this 2019 version, and I'm wrapped. It is great. Brings a lot of emotion. The visual part is perfect. It is this Lion King that I've fallen in love as a child, only this time there is more of it, and it's more beautiful. Of course it differs. And what pepole here say has a point. Emotions are shown differently, as the rendered picture differs from a sketch. That's what has changed through 25 years. But i wont say it's worse. All the animations, facial expressions and eye movements are still there. Different then 25 years ago, but still they do the job. I didn't feel like the movie was anyway flat. I don't get what all this pepole giving so horrible notes mean. When it comes to voice actors, most pepole in here mean english version. I've seen only polish version, which for me is native, and it was great. Once again i'm pleased with voice acting and with music. I prefer polish Spirit by Zofia Nowakowska over Beyonce version. But anyway i wouldn't say that the english one is bad. Overall i got a feeling that the movie is amazing. I can't understand all the haters in here. I hope that in 25 years there would be another version, maybe better, but i'm not sure if that's possible. I'm really grateful for this movie, all the emotions and memories it brings.
Don't listen to all these haters and watch it. If you have children i think they should watch it too. And then their children, if there is gonna be another version for them. It's just such a great story, that anyone should watch it.",The Lion King

I think the casting directors got caught up with 'Beyonce' rather than really look at her lack of acting skills.
I was so uninspired by her voice when speaking - Such a disappointmentJames Earl- The only reason i'm giving this movie 2 stars! They hit the nail on the head with casting James, and he carries the movie with his incredible voice.Scar- Has to be the biggest disappointment in this movie!!! Where was the villain we loved to hate? What a let down!!
I tried to give the actor time to warm up and fall deeper into character and it never came about. Why Jeremy Irons wasn't recast-ed is beyond belief!

2371,victoria-lai,Phenomenal visuals yet emotionless,2,30 March 2020,"The thought of attempting to outdo a family classic was bold. For many, the soundtrack, emotions, and even the script has been so etched into our skins that this remake had become pointless. The realistic visuals are incredible but comes with several downfalls: the colors lack the vibrancy of the animation, settling for a 'diverse' palette of yellows and browns, and the animals are emotionless, causing the movie and its characters to feel flat. But more than anything, the script and voice acting were the biggest letdowns. Many of the key scenes were rushed and voice acting did not include the same level of details that were present in the animation. It was as if the actors were simply reading to complete the scene rather than attempt to add any necessary emotions. This is unfortunate as the film already heavily relied on the voice acting to bring forward the emotions which the expressionless, realistic animals could not. It had gotten to the point where, for the first time in 23 years, I did not cry during Mufasa's death.Shenzi and the hyena gang were a definite improvement by being less comical and more cruel. However, I could not get pass the lack of impact of this film which I really wanted to love. Not only did Disney recycled their old scripts word-for-word, but they have also reinforced the notion that live-actions of a great animation will rarely be good. The Lion King was no exception.",The Lion King

Of course not, in the animation the features, the voices, the movements, everything in general are exaggerated and that brings me to the most important question, perhaps you have ever seen a lion cry, laugh, frustrate, think, get angry ... ? Of course not and have you ever seen a lion with green eyes, yellow sclera and black hair?

2385,meghanself,Painfully awful!,1,23 July 2020,"I wasn't going to write a review until I tried giving this movie a 2nd chance on Disney plus. It made me more upset watching it the 2nd time. My favorite Disney movie of ALL time is The Lion King. When I found out they were remaking this movie, I was beyond ecstatic. I was so excited to see this in the theaters. Thus far, most of the remakes Disney has done have been pretty well and been quite enjoyable. So I didn't dare to think this movie would have been done poorly.
The opening scene, Circle of Life, was done beautifully. It was meeting and actually exceeding my expectations. The CGI in this movie is amazing. However, after the opening scene, it went rolling downhill FAST! Every. SINGLE. Character had NO life. With the exception of Timon and Pumba, so I guess don't take the SINGLE literally. I, still, didn't like some of the delivery on their lines.
They left out a lot of iconic scenes/lines. I couldn't even cry during the one scene that, still to this day, still brings tears to my eyes. A lot of the scenes in the animated movie is either overly rushed, changed poorly or doesn't exist. They changed a couple of songs. Added new ones. Which speaking of, Beyonce's role, pointless and terrible. The singing style does NOT match the style. You'll see what I mean when they sing ""can you feel the love tonight"". Of course they added a POINTLESS scene of Nala, that had no relevance to the story.
Other than the opening scene, the rest of the movie was no where close to the animated. If I watched a national geographic safari documentary with this lion king audio playing, it would be exactly the same.Terrible writing. Terrible acting. Terrible singing. Just terrible.",The Lion King

i think you can't get the same emotions from the remake as you can from the cartoon. ike the famous ""long live the king"" scene had mostly blank faces from all the characters making a sad scene look emotionless. I also had a problem with the scene with Simba's hair, I felt it took too long. The song ""can you feel the love tonight"" felt emotionless for a romantic love scene. One minor change between the original movie and the remake, that I noticed and did not like, was that in the original the clouds took shape of Mufasa, and you could see that it was him. However, in the remake he was barely visible, and I disliked that. The movie also has an amazing realistic animation, you barely understand what's animated and what's not, the background, ground, animals and bugs was very entertaining to look at. The entire last battle was very epic and looked great. I think the movie was not bad, it was entertaining, and the animation was good in its own way, but in my opinion, I would still prefer the original or I would prefer that they made it a bit more animated so it would be less emotionless.",The Lion King

Anyways this movie had great visuals and I like how simba was actually cleared of killing his father. But the actors had no soul.I know this movie word for word and there was little enthusiasm and excitement. I also didn't like how they changed scars personality or the hyenas. In the original lion king scar was mean but funny in this one he was down right miserable and even simba could tell he hated him and the hyenas weren't funny at all, they were just plain scary. I cannot call this a children's film I feel as if this was a remake for the children of the early 90's. This film was much more darker and Shakespearean and some of the actors lacked so much soul.

Whoever is responsible for wrecking the hell out of a great movie needs to be fired like Michael Bay should have from Paramount for ruining Transformers.

Feels like a glass of lemonade that's been left out all day, flat, tepid.

I just came back from seeing this movie with my parents. My father loved animals since forever and specially lions. so it was important for me to watch this master piece together. I was waiting for this movie the most from all since I heard Disney makes the real movie. Cause from all Disney movies this was always my favorite - the cartoon and the original one.
I don't know why many writes here it's disappointing version. I was crying like hell , my father whom 82, which all my life we call him by himself a lion because of his streinght and because we never saw him crying. Only from inside , even when his beloved mom passed away. He Was crying for the first time next to me with tears in his eyes in this most touching scene.
This is a master piece and I wish I was on the set to see how they did this amazing movie. I'm amazed each time from Disney and Hollywood when it comes together. RUN TO SEE IT !

The CGI truly is the most amazing I've seen to date and the nostalgia was definitely kept intact. Scar and Rafiki were excellent casts.Funny...as I was walking out I realized that the last time I saw it I was dealing with my parent's divorce about 3 years gone. This time I'm in the same place again just the divorce I'm dealing with is now mine. Hmmm....I guess it is a circle of life. It's a small world after all.

2422,vladimir_stokic,"Cheap, chewed out copy of a great original",4,18 July 2019,"Just watched Lion King reboot. Friendly advice: don't make the same mistake.
Great CGI, but that's about it. No emotions in the acting at all. Even James Earl Jones blended in the completely abysmal performance of almost all involved actors (later in the text you will see which actor earned his salary for this film).
There is exactly one scene that made me laugh wholeheartedly and that was a complete breath of fresh air (which is ironic, because it involves Pumbaa). Everything else is as if you took the original, threw it in the washing machine, ran several cycles, and then took it out with all the colors washed out. Pale, anemic, unconvincing...
To sum up, if you want a good prince, call Matthew Broderick, not Donald Glover. If you want a good Mufasa, call James Earl Jones, but not when he's 88 years old and can barely speak. If you want a good English butler, call Rowan Atkinson, although I must admit that John Oliver did make a fair effort here. And finally, if you want a perfect bad guy, do not sidestep Jeremy Irons. If he was a good enough bad guy for a Die Hard movie, he is more than qualified to be a villainous prince.",The Lion King

I got goosebumps at the opening of this movie and I've seen 2 Broadway productions. I loved them all. The opening was awesome. But Scar is all wrong; it continues throughput the movie. I was so disappointed with Scar. They took the fun out of the Hyenas. It just Didn't work for me. The CGI is amazing, but they all (the animals) had no emotion. I wouldn't have minded that. But Be Prepared is a great song, and they ruined it. The Timon and Pumba stuff is funny and tolerable. I don't think the voice actors are bad, but not given any expression. That matters in a movie. It's hard to make me miss Cheech and Whoopie. This was not enough from my POV. I started my score at 9 and a 10 would mean you had to pleasantly surprise me. But the song fails, Scar being the absolute worst, and the Hyenas not being the least bit funny killed it for me.",The Lion King

So we just need to go in, and cherish that the story and songs we have loved and grown up with have been reborn with insanely beautiful effects for the next generation. That said, all the wonderful songs and lines are still there (probably too scared to mess with the original!). I liked that the faces weren't insanely animated, it made it really seem like a jungle adventure.

2436,mobiuser,For those who have seen the original classic...,8,18 August 2019,"Having watched the original one more than 20 times, I could not help but make comparisons all along. Here is the summary of what I felt.First of all, the graphics really are breathtaking. No doubt about that.Although, the story is they same, they have made little tweaks in most of the scenes. I like most of the changes. For example, the visit to the elephant graveyard is shorter and more plausible. The 'Be prepared' segment is short and better. I like the way Timoon and Pumba distract the Hyenas near the end, and how Rafiki comes to know that Simba is alive.But, there are a few segments that I absolutely loved in the original one and these had left an impression on me for all these years and they removed them! These are many and I'm listing some off the top of my head:--> When Simba puts his paw in the paw print of Mufasa realizes that he is still a little cub. That was one of my favourites in the original.
--> The stampede scene has lost its soul and intensity. The gorge is smaller and the wilder-beasts are too few.
--> The part when Rafiki changes the mind of the adult Simba seems to be done more superficially in this one. The original one was more gripping as well as hilarious.
--> I absolutely loved the original scene of Adult Simba running back home to challenge Scar. It good that now he meets Nala on his way back but she also did not seem surprised or excited enough to see him.I can go on, but the point is that I like the little tweaks and innovations and mostly they really are positive but they are done with less soul, emotion and intensity.",The Lion King

Since my wife HAD to see this remake, that meant I got to as well....This version was better than the original on all fronts. The photography was stunning, the 'live action' CGI was flawless, and the 'speaking' aspects were very naturalistic. I don't get how people think that this version was 'heartless' or 'emotionless' - it didn't beat you over the head with cartoonish overacting, but I consider that a plus.See it.",The Lion King

2439,Cavette95,Reheated leftovers,4,15 October 2019,"Story is the same. Script is nearly word for word to the original one. I think the biggest difference between this and the original is the voice actors and CG.
I think the CG was extremely out of place. All the animals were ultra realistic but lacked the expressions needed to convey the messages they were attempting to deliver. My kids were excited to see this because of the cartoons then disappointment and confusion set in when they questioned if this was the same playful story about a lion coming of age or a National Geographic story about Africa with a couple songs.
If they gave the animals more emotion and a little cartoonish (this is a kids movie) then it would have been much better.....",The Lion King

2443,gully_moe,I don't think the Lion King brought anything new to the table.,7,21 July 2019,"It was a great film; the CGI was very realistic. Yes, people criticized it for being too real and that no one can read their emotions. As an animal lover and owner of 3 cats and a dog, I could tell how they were feeling. The way Simba would lower his ears or cower. I could see the fear in Mufasa's eyes and the anger in Scar's. I did cry. It was just as emotional as the original. When Simba mourned for his father, he curled up against his dead father's body. It was too much.But that doesn't mean it's better.Thing is, it was the same story. The lines were pretty much the same, and the scenes were all the same. There were some new lines, but they were only embellishments that didn't really add anything new. Scar said something along the lines of Mufasa interacting with the commoners (referring to himself). You'd think they would go into depth about that? Why does Scar look so sickly? Does he feel like the king and the royal family don't care about the commoners and that there is an issue of classism and hunger among the low class and that is why the Hyenas live on the low end? No, they don't. They had an opportunity to maybe give Scar a reason as to why he is the way he is, but they don't. He even had a monologue while he was hunting a mouse and said things about how he and the mouse are no different. But that's it.And you'd think they would go into depth about the drought and the eco-system. Yeah, the lionesses told Scar that he was hunting too much and that's why they were suffering, but we already KNEW that. Could they have talked a bit more about how Simba was traumatized and somewhat emotionally abused by Scar by making him believe he killed his own father all these years? No. The ending was the same. Scar was pretty much the same. It all ends the same.Don't get me wrong, I love that Disney has been remaking the classics, but at least they have been giving us something fresh. Either a twist to the story or social commentary on current issues. For example, in Aladdin 2019, instead of addressing the issue about ONE rule that could be changed, they addressed the issue of equality and asked WHY can't a woman be leader so she can change the rules how she wants? And that's why I love the Aladdin remake so much.Lion King didn't do that this time. It did stay true to the original, and that's it. That's all did. It was just a visually enhanced version. I give it 7/10 because it was still entertaining, but it really didn't bring anything exciting or new.",The Lion King

Its beautiful but its release is a easy money grab for Disney. Children watching the film in the nines have grown to be parents who would share the lore with their progeny.Life like lions with familiar celebrity voices looks beautiful and cheezy.

Not only was it stunning, but it had just enough creative new lines mixed with original songs. This is a REMAKE, so for those of you expecting a new story line, you will be severely disappointed. This movie exceeded every expectation I had and blew my mind.

2447,Rstyle_92,After seeing mufasa's ghost dialog was gone I was ready to leave the cinema.,3,28 August 2019,"The lion king was my favorite movie growing up and I still feel a lot of that nostalgia watching it now.
Alright.. I was very excited to see this new movie. The trailer looked amazing.
And... the visuals were amazing. It was like looking at real animals and nature, stunning.But that is that.. I left the cinema very sad. I felt like they butchered my favorite film and I don't understand why.
I mean, I get that the movie cant be exactly the same and I didn't expect it could live up to the expectation of the previous one.. but why would you copy some scenes frame for frame, word for word.. and cut or change others for the worse.Let me go over it chronologically (Spoilers alert obviously)The opening song was alright (not as powerful). Why leave out the stick of Rafiki? (but bring it back later and call it 'old friend?'?)
And I felt like Mufasa and Rafiki didn't share a friendship. which was very obvious in the hug in the original one, but left out here and replaced by a pat on the snout.Everything good, but then the Hyena scene at the elephant cemetery. Absolutely awesome when Mufasa came to save the day, very powerful. But they left out my favorite hyena.. freaking ed!
Alright that is ok.. but now they totally butchered song of Scar! Be prepared!..
That was such a moment in the original film and it got replaced by shouting Be prepared about 3 times.. cmon... why?So here is the trend right, if you change something there should be a reason right? Change it for something else or something better.. But not slackinly do something else,, then just do the original.The stampede in the gorge. Very good! I would say it is better than the original one, I was on the edge of my seat and even gasped when Mufasa was hit by one of the wildebeest.
But then here it comes... scar will say his line ""Long live the king..."". Dude! Wtf was that? He said it without emotion and just kind of shouted it.. Scar is cunning, evil. He should say it that way..Alright, next.. Timon and Pumba. Hilarious. It seemed they were the only two voice actors that actually got it. It was so funny. They were obviously proud to play the role and made something of it.
I liked what they did with the whole scenery and scenes there too. Overall a good adjustment.
Also when Nala arrives and finds Simba. Nothing but good things to say about that.But now comes the moment...Nala left, Simba is upset. And there is Rafiki. Going to show him Mufasa right?
OMG! I could cry how bad I was.. This was the moment I was actually ready to leave the cinema. I was seriously upset how they completely glossed over this.
There was no lesson about how the past can hurt, but teach you a lesson that way.
Why would you change mufasa's dialog? I mean not even change... completely leave out!
Where was 'You have forgotten me... you have forgotten who you are.. and that is how you forgot me. Look at yourself simba. You are more than what you have become'. At least that is what I remember.
Now it was just 'Go back to your place in the circle of life.' Serously! That was it! Go back blabla bye.
I am so upset about this.
After this I just wanted to go home and watch the original scene. Cmon guys.. again... if you change something that is fine... making the same thing is boring. But then do something with it, not just leave powerful things out and in other occasions copy things frame by frame. Then make the choices make sense...The rest of the movie was alright. Also I was sitting back feeling annoyed so I didn't see it in as much detail. The last blow that I didn't like was scars famous second line 'I killed Mufasa'. No cunning in its voice. He just said it like a random guy on the street would say it without any context.A good thing that they did was how Simba got back on the edge by biting scars face instead magically leaping back on it like in the original one. So here is the thing right.. They made this little thing better. They could have done that with other parts too.. but they didn't. Hence a lot of butthurt people me,, and the low score here on IMDB.One last note.. Zazu was a freaking loyal super hero in this movie. He saved the lions on multiple occasions big time. He hit the leader hyena when she latched out to eat young Simba. He saved Nala from being caught by Scar.. but the lions never expressed any form of gratitude whatsoever. Whenever he bowed, they just kind of looked down on him like he was a silly bird. At least kind of muffle a 'thanks Zazu'. That would make it so much better.",The Lion King
2448,amber_kandarkas,Don't hold your breath,1,20 July 2019,"Let me begin by saying I've seen the Lion King 1, 2, 1/2 over 3,000 times since it came out till two days ago so I know what I'm talking about.If you're looking for something new that isn't a lot like the original lion king then sure this movie is for you but don't expect a lot of emotion or feeling from the characters.However, if you're like me and didn't want the emotions, feelings, songs and lines to be altered in anyway, you'll hate this movie. Such as, after the elephant graveyard incident when Mufasa is lecturing Simba, there is no terror on Simba's part, no emotion, no remorse. Mufasa's Literally does not sound disappointed as he did in the original.
Similarly, when Mufasa... sleeps for a very very long time, you cannot see the grief in Simba's face, the guilt, the fear of losing a father, the shock etc. It's just not there. There's no disbelief there's nothing.Oh and you know the famous Rafiki quote that we all use as our Instagram captions, ""the past can hurt"", yeah, it's not there.There are many other things that aren't there like one of my personal favourite scenes that I really found funny in the Original was when Nala is chasing Pumba and he gets stuck and he screams SHE'S GONNA EAT ME! Oh man that's funny. That's not there either.
There are a lot of characters that weren't there in the beginning a lot of lines a song that was added too. Bottom line, if you're a sinner and want to go to hell watch the movie you'll like it.",The Lion King

Instead I was treated to fundamentally altered key scenes, down right neglect of key characters, pointlessly altered dialogues, and bland expressions.!SPOILERS!Rafiki is not even named once throughout the whole film, and the character is grossly underdeveloped in comparison to the 1994 animation. Even in the scenes where he partakes, he's bland-out. Also, he's moved to powder coating in his art style, cause liquid pigments are too mainstream in the savanna.
Scar in the scene where he kills Mufasa, instead shoving his nails deep in Mufasa's paws, grabbing them, and throwing him off the cliff in a visceral manner, as it is in the 1994 animation, he now slaps Mufasa and Mufasa fells on his own.
Sarabi after Simba's return is acting as the commander, able to give tactical commands as if it's a video game or something.

2463,Dimefan21,Visually amazing but emotionally felt flat,6,21 July 2019,"I took my 6 year old son to see it and from the get go I was highly impressed by the visuals. From the sunlight reflecting off of fur and water to the dirt and grass I had to ask myself if they actually filmed on location. However with all the attention to detail in the way everything looked they seemed to choose to stay away from the animals actually showing emotion. I understand they were trying to be as realistic as possible but I couldnt help but feel like the ""animals"" themselves didnt care about what was happening...only the voices seemed to. Also because of this realistic approach the fight scenes and things of that nature lacked the drama that the original conveyed. For instance when simba and scar are fighting on top of pride rock there wasnt the slow motion shot of scar being thrown off. There was a great slow motion shot earlier in the fight when they are standing on their hind feet. So when scar just quickly and quite anticlimacticly fell off the rock I was like that's it? so humor...this movie had a few laugh out loud moments...mainly from zazu which was a bit surprising because I figured of course that timon and pumba would steal the show. Not to say that they didnt work because honestly their characters probably felt the most well casted. Ok now for what is probably my biggest gripe...every second that beyonce was singing was like nails on a chalkboard for me. No soul in her voice at all when she sang. Her voice was overbearing and crowded every word of the songs. Where as everyone else sang in a way that felt real her performance felt more like hey look what I can do. In the end my son seemed ok with the movie but didnt spend very long talking about it after we left and outside of the visuals I felt pretty much the same.

And if you actually watched the movie you'd know that they did make changes to most scenes so that they weren't exactly like the 1994 version. Obviously this isn't going to be better than the original, the original is a masterpiece, but for a remake I think they did an amazing job. The CGI was breathtaking and the film was hilarious. Even though I do agree that the emotion wasn't captured as powerfully as it is in the original, there were still many heartbreaking and touching scenes. I cried and laughed just as much as I did watching the 1994 version.

2467,JelesL1,"The Lion King remake, like a live band.",6,16 September 2019,"Hve you ever gone to see your favourite band play live? How was it? Were the songs as good in-person as they are on the album? Be honest. They probably weren't. Oh, sure, theres a lot about a live performance that you don't get when you stream songs on Spotify. But the quality of the music when listening live is almost always worse. It's just a fact. You realistically know that when you buy the concert ticket. But you're not paying to hear the songs in perfect quality, your paying to see the performer live on the stage, for the experience of being in the crowd, for the novelty of a night out. It's a trade off.That's exactly what the new Lion King movie is. Let's be honest, no one bought a ticket truly expecting it to be better than the original cartoon. You knew that some parts wouldn't be the same. You just kan't have a ""live"" (technically photorealistic CG) warthog sing and dance the same as a cartoon. There is a trade off for the feeling of live animals truly living this story. The novelty factor is real. You get a different experience.If you ever thought ""what would this cartoon look like if it were happening in reality"" then congrats! Because someone else was willing to spend 260 million dollars to give you the answer. And the answer is, it's just fine. Like any live band, it was enjoyable. But I don't need to see it more than once.The parts that worked, worked very well. There was some small aditions to the film that made it a bit better, more cohesive, and fixed small plot problems. The wildebeast stampede, for example, is about 4 animals wide, rather than about 20 wide in the cartoon. You'd need a heard of 4 million to charge for a full 5 minute scene, but if they're running only about 4 across it makes more sense visually.The motivation for the animals/characters were also a bit more fleshed out. Nala, especially, seems to have a more reasonable story arc, rather than just being there. A scene depicting her escape from pride rock makes it more meaningful that she should find the rightful king, and then work hard to put him in power.But these things don't bring the film up as much as other parts drag it down. You can feel how much the filmmakers loved the original, and stuck true to many of the lines, lyrics, and camera shots that we expect to get (knowingly or otherwise). But some added footage of the Savana just makes the film feel stretched. It's a full 30 minutes longer, where as only about 5 minutes add anything to the story.But the largest problem of all was unavoidable. A CG animal just can't emote the same as a cartoon. And the loss of that just can't be replaced. Other talking animal movies go as far as to give the creatures more human facial features, like the eyes especially, so they can give them a look of surprise or rage when needed. Think Michael J Fox's Stewart Little. But here they go in a different direction. With strong vocal performances mixed with superb body language, they try to deliver the emotion the story requires. It's a bold direction, and a valiant effort. By all accounts it works. But just not as well as a cartoon form the 90's.I could go on about the voice acting for an hour, but it's largely subjective. So I'll leave it alone. All in all, the movie was a very interesting experience, and a very worthy re-telling. I'm glad I paid for the ticket. But it's not going to be a staple of near as many households as the oringinal, which is just straight up more fun.",The Lion King

Someone forgot to animate emotions in the faces of animals?
Someone forgot to do good tone processing? Especially in music, really bad tone production.
What about animal speech? Was it so difficult to figure out how it was done in the original? Onomatopoeia!
In the original Lion King, the speech of monkeys, lions, pigs, hyenas, etc. sounds just like these animals sound in reality. In this version, everything is flat.
""Interesting"" ejecting the portrayal of ""god"" in the movie. Eg. in a scene where Simbas hair a ""strange wind"" bring to monkey, it is now shown that nature alone does this miracle.

Singing was very cringe worthy. FYI Seth Rogan should just not sing.
Disney has done the worst job with remakes lately. Some movies should never be made into live action or cgi. If Disney reads this review.

2474,armisteaddaniel,"if you are a professional critic, or haven't seen the movie, please read",10,15 July 2019,"In light of the terrible reviews and before it's out officially yet, I wanted to share some facts and some thoughts.1. It's essentially a shot-for-shot remake. You can have an opinion about that alone, but you have to know this going in. Don't be surprised as the movie starts, and then you want to hold that against it coming out. Find it within yourself how you feel about that now, then move past it. Because the only thing worse than a shot-for-shot remake, is if anything was changed from the original.
2. It uses state-of-the-art animation technology. This is stuff that wasn't around in 1994. It will be more photo-realistic. The animals won't have as animated or as personified facial expressions. It will be MORE real. Not totally real (as the movie wouldn't be in English, or any human language, and the lions would eat all the other characters in the first scene), just MORE real.
3. It uses voice actors that are more diverse and more relevant to culture and entertainment today, in 2019. Imagine being an 8-12 year old kid, watching the new Lion King, and growing up and listening to Beyoncé's music, experiencing Donald Glover in music or TV, seeing other actors in other great movies and hearing their voice and being like, ""wait, were they that voice in that lion king movie?"" And the world means something to them in that moment, and they feel like they just figured out a secret connection that no one knows but them, and they are slowly figuring out who they are and what kind of entertainment they like and and what speaks to them the most. It's beautiful. Just like we were when we realized Randy from Home improvement and Ferris bueller was simba, Darth Vader was Mufasa, mr bean was Zazu, Whoopi and cheech were hyenas, the guy from mouse hunt was Timon, and guy who sings tiny dancer and Bennie and the jets also sings all the movie songs we love.In conclusion, if you are in high school or older, THIS👏🏼MOVIE👏🏼ISN'T👏🏼FOR👏🏼YOU. The movie from 1994 used the best animation and best voice actors from its time, and was SO GOOD that it has impacted and left a mark on kids ever since. 25 years. But time has changed, and the same story and characters can do the same for kids from now into another 25 years. Your opinion of it does not matter. It wasn't created for you. It's not trying to please you. Sure, you could say Disney is trying to make easy money. Duhhhh. They are a movie company. That's their shtick. But years of work still went into respecting the original film, while creatively making it new.Still not enough? Then this movie is your step dad. He's not trying to replace your real dad. You and your real dad will still have a very close relationship. But your little siblings need a real dad, and that is what your step dad will be for them. Love your step dad for who he is. Do not hate him for something you yourself are accusing him of.Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.",The Lion King
2475,JoeDew,I LIKED IT.,8,23 November 2019,"I really don't get why so many people are hating on this movie. Okay, you're right, it is basically the exact same movie as the 1994 version, but what else did you want them to do? I'm pretty sure that if director Jon Favreau gave a spin to the story and how it develops, people would still have hated on it. And then there's the argument that the animals show no facial expressions... Have you ever seen a lion or any other animal for that matter smile like the Cleveland Indians mascot? I think the movements of the mouth when the animals spoke were the creators' way of trying to have them show emotions. In a cartoon movie you have the freedom to basically do whatever you want with facial expressions, but in a real live action, it would have looked pretty stupid to see Simba shed actual tears. I'm glad they try to keep it as real as possible and boy, did they do a fantastic job CGI-wise.",The Lion King

They tried to compensate and there were instances they succeeded like the Belle and the Beast scene that Timon did in place of the Hula scene in the original. But they didn't manage to make the hyena's as crazy and menacing.
On the whole it's beautiful and a joy to watch but still a bit disappointed because I hoped for more.",The Lion King
2485,email-132-217689,You Have To Ask - What Was The Point?,3,21 November 2019,"The lion King has a special place in my heart. Apart from Disney ripping it off from a Japanese guy back in the late 80's and making out like it was their own, the film itself, particularly the characterisations, are about the best to be found in any work from this company. There are some spectacular animated scenes, the wildebeest in the gorge for example but you can't get past that excellent voice cast.So forward fast nearly 25 years and we have this remake, using all the latest technology, fur rendering and photo real CGI. The first thing that hits you is just how good it looks. This is a triumph by any measure, probably the best looking CGI film to have been made to date and when you consider the sheer volume of characters and sets, it boggles the mind even more. The way the animals move is amazing, every nuance perfectly captured. But then they start speaking...You have to wonder who made the creative decision to not render the faces with expressions. Probably lies with Favreau, who knows but it was a fatal mistake. I mean, are we Disney or are we David Attenborough? Are we 'cartoon' or are we BBC Natural History unit? From the very get go, it was extremely hard to connect with the characters because you couldn't feel any emotion from their expressions. Even with hand drawn cartoons you can garner so much from them that the original film is hands down more emotionally engaging than this, even given that it looks totally real, it's just totally flat in terms of vibe. The mouths moved, the eyes flicked but there was nothing else there, it was just like adding voices to safari images but shot in such as way that it told a story.Then the characters themselves: Mufasa, obviously couldn't be anyone else, I'm glad they got the big guy back for that role. Simba, well yeah, he pulled it off but the others were pretty grim with the exception of maybe Pumbaa. Scar was absolutely flat. Just think back to Jeremy Irons performance here and it was a performance. He was nasty, full of hate and vitriol, you could hear it behind every word, you could hear the spittle on Irons' lips as he delivered the lines. you could feel the hopeless pathos as he resigned himself to his place in the pride then how venomous he became when he saw a chance to end it and progress. The fella who did the voice in this film may be famous and had a few big roles recently but this part more than any character needed a super strong actor to become Scar and carry it. In my opinion it was absolutely devoid of any malice or any real detectable emotional aspect of the character. Even in the signature song it just felt like the guy was going through the motions, there was nothing to lift it from mediocrity.I felt sorry for Pumbaa and Timone who weren't able to have those faces that cracked up and made us belly laugh. Again it just felt like watching creatures from the savanna with silly voices recorded over them. Back as a child they had a programme called Animal Magic where they did just that and it's all I could think of as I made my way painfully though this film that I really wanted to like but just couldn't. Beyonce as Nala, well, this just follows a trend of getting famous people in because they are famous not because of their virtues as a voice actor. This turn was also flat as the proverbial pancake.But you can't take away from the animation and the look of the film which was exemplary in every way. Maybe someone saw some mock ups and decided that realistic animals with expressions and features were a bit silly but not as silly as letting this film fall flat on its face because emotionally, it's an empty shell. Now where's that VHS of the Lion King...",The Lion King
2486,blackamber_41,Pretty but underwhelming spoilers ahoy,6,20 July 2019,"Whereas the original was a grand spectacle, this remake fails flat. I really wanted to like this, I enjoyed Favreau's retelling of the Jungle Book, but I found myself comparing the lackluster moments to the original. Sadly, one of those being Mufasa himself.While there was no way to prevent this, his voice just doesn't have the power to it as it once did and when you compare the two performances, you know which version was better. For the most part, my problems with the film didn't have to much to do with the voices. There were moments I felt deliveries were done better in the original, one such moment being Scar's ""Long live the king"", in all honesty, my issue was that the movie felt rushed. There were moments that felt like they got breezed over that shouldn't have been, such as the interaction between Rafiki and Simba before his return to pride rock... And moments that shouldn't have dragged on that did, like the stupid dung beetle (did we really need the full journey of Simba's hair? What was wrong with it just getting blown on the wind?). All I can say is, at the end of the movie all I wanted to do was watch the original again.For the good, I thought the updates to the score were fantastic. Not the musical songs, the orchestral. Find a few on YouTube, close your eyes and just listen... It is beautiful music. I like that the hyena's were a bigger threat and that Scar had to convince them to help him... Though the update to Be Prepared was... Not a highlight. Much of Scar I did enjoy too, just one or two line deliveries (such as the one mentioned above) that Irons did better in my opinion.If you've never seen the animated Lion King you'll probably enjoy it just fine, but for those of us who have, I think we feel a little let down.",The Lion King
2487,ferry83,"This could have been amazing, but Beyonce happened.",6,21 July 2019,"In all fairness, the movie looks amazing, and purely on the looks the only thing that bothers me is that there is no emotions at all visible. Not the fear in Mufasa's eyes, or a smile when he's playing with the little cub.I under stand that animals don't have the possibility to use that much expression.. but a lot more could have been done. A WHOLE lot more.My other problem is Beyonce, I'm for sure not a fan of her except for a couple of songs that do show how talented she is.. but she is one of the biggest misses in this film.. her ad-libs and her annoying signature way of singing can you feel the love tonight would have made me walk out the theatre is I would have been alone...The last part which has changed a bit is the moment that Simba see's Mufasa inside him and when he returns home.. all I can say is that the original did it better.. and there is no need EVER to make Beyonce sing any song in a movie unless it's crazy in love with Jay-Z.I can't decide if this movie should be 5 or 6 stars.. the Hate i have towards beyonce's perfomance in this movie makes me want to give it a 5 or even a 4 star rating.
But in the theater, I have to say... I enjoyed the movie most of the parts.. There's countless of times where the expressions don't matter and where beyonce is not singing or doing her weird voice thingy..So 6 stars, it's worth a watch for sure.. but people in Hollywood should really let Beyonce go.. she's not that talented on screen and I can name countless of people who would perform better, but Tessa Thompson, Zendaya or Leona Lewis, Rihanna, Alicia Keys and Kelly Rowland would have been better if you want a famous singer.",The Lion King
2488,pinkmoon385,"Not an original story, but a visually stunning original",9,20 July 2019,"I was 9 when the original was produced. The Lion King is THE movie of my childhood. Like everything from childhood, you're likely not going to feel everything with the same intensity or wonderment as a 9 year old. The script is 98% the original so you will spend too much time focusing on how the lines are delivered slightly different. Know that going in, and try your best to shake yourself into watching with a fresh mind.
Yes, I felt a lot of the lines aren't delivered as well as the voice actors of original. The voice stars of this rendition are hands down Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner.
Once you shake yourself out of that, you'll stop and see the beauty of the visuals they presented in this rendition. It. Is. Stunning. You will want to boop all the animals noses. You'll feel like you're being guided through a gorgeous safari being narrated with one of the greatest most meaningful storylines of all time by today's A list stars.

Incredible on that account!I loved the opening sequence and sequence and how true to the original it was...and didn't mind the lack of emotion on the animals. I was completely dumbfounded by the complete rewriting of the song, ""Be Prepared"". Why???!?And the gratuitous sing written just for Beyoncé to sell a song was awful. Very obvious they were showcasing the artist and not the sentiment of the show during the scene where Nala and Simla return to the Pridelands.Beyonce's riffing on the classics was annoying as well.Everyone and everything else was good, not amazing, but good. Beyoncé, however, was overpromoted and detracted rather than added to the movie.",The Lion King

The CGI is beautiful and realistic, but that's where the good in this remake ends.The voice acting is incredibly lacklustre, which is sad considering they had a good cast to work with. The singing was mediocre, and hearing Beyoncé completely take over what was supposed to be a duet was frustrating to say the least. I'm not sure why they felt the need to include a new pop song in this when they had all kind of material from the stage musical that they could have used. They also ruined Be Prepared, which was arguably the best song from the original film. Mufasa's death had none of the impact from the original film, either.Don't waste your money seeing this in the theatre, wait for it to come out to rent or watch for free.

2516,dafi79,What happened to the DIALOGUES - why did you change them...,3,24 November 2019,"The original Lion King is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made...So why would you change it in such a drastic way.1. WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE THE DIALOGUES SO MUCH?!?!!?! I understand that this is re-make, that people will have different interpretation with pronunciation and stressing on different words but this has changed the tone of the conversations in several crucial moments. Not to mention that some important lines were completely omitted - what happened to ""It is time""?!?!?! I am sorry but this was the main thing that ruined the movie (for me personally). There are so many wise and important quotes that were simply lost. Mufasa - even though had the same voice actor (whose voice is really calming) - his lines were again butchered and all of the wisdom was faded away.2. The visuals of the movie were true - great, but it lacked all the facial emotions that can be seen in the animated version. I appreciate they have made it more realistic (same as Aladdin's carpet ride not going around the world) - with for example Rafiki not standing when he's presenting the cub - great but no emotion can be seen in their faces.3. Music - timing. As this is so well known and beloved movie by many generations it was always going to be difficult to replicate the success of the original movie but simple things such as the music being on time and the same sound effects (the lion's roar) had to be on point but for some reason they were not. And the tune with Timon and Pumba before the hyenas - really?!?!?!4. Some characters as mentioned in other comments have completely changed. I didn't mind Scar at the beginning up to when he tells about the elephant graveyard but then even his iconic song is ruined. The hyenas I'm not even going to comment on. Rafiki is playing such a small part and his important life lessons are lost. Zazu ... overall everyone was a meh really which is sad.Overall I don't get why Disney would re-make an animal based animation - I get Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast even the Jungle Book (not huge fan of either) but seriously animals... It's a NO NO. I made the mistake of watching it and I regret it and that's something I would've never thought I would say for The Lion King as it is one of my top 3 favourite movies of all times if not the most favourite ever.I am giving 3 stars as the visuals are beautiful and impressive but that's all.",The Lion King

The CGI was fine but the voice acting was disappointing. It's easy to notice when the iconic voices of JTT, Jeremy Irons and Matthew Broderick, to name a few, aren't there.The delivery of some of the iconic lines fell short. And a couple of scenes and quotes from the 1994 version were excluded.Hopefully any future live action remakes of animated films aren't as bad as TLK because 2019 Aladdin set the bar pretty high.",The Lion King
2522,rosesmckayla,"This never cease to amaze me..well, everyone else for that matter",1,8 December 2019,"Ok, I was already skeptical about this. I will write the sins for this horrid adaptation to ""The Lion King"" (1994) to spell this out for you.
Consider it as the Seven Deadly Sins:
1. Live-Action (seriously)
2. No emotion
3. The expressionless characters/actors
4. The movie being filmed frame-by-frame that you can watch the original run through your head while watching it (this similar thing happened to ""The Beauty and the Beast"" (2017). I do mean similar, because they decided to add the Beast's solo song).
5. The scenery is not even close to convincing because it's all about the atmosphere to feel the emotions of all the characters. Other than that, it's supposed to be beautiful Africa, not Background-Screensavers.
6. (Worst two sins for last) The actors. Oh, I got LOADS BUT SHORT THINGS TO SAY. What the hell were they thinking?! Oh yeah, money!
Worst actors to match up the characters (Not James Earl Jones who played the original/remade Mufasa. He's a freaking treasure.)!!!! Shortly after I found about this remake, I looked up the cast for this. As I was browsing through the list, all can say was, ""Oh god. Seriously?"".
This is an example but it's like you try and like the Twilight franchise but you got skeptical because everything about those movies were bad and gave up them. This is what happened with the live action movies based off the animated movies. The books are slightly different because some movies try to stay true and respect the books.
Aside from that, that's when I got skeptical since Beauty and The Beast (2017).
7. Omigod, ( WORST SIN ) The DISNEY INDUSTRY SCREWING THE AUDIENCES OVER!!!!!! And it was so bad that I made through the first 20 minutes. I am being serious! That's how horrible it was!! I know that I'm all talk about this but I have seen enough to know what the hell's happening. I've heard and seen reviews of this but knowing all this....DISGRACE!!!Isn't there a saying somewhere saying, (loosely) ""You cannot fix what's not been broken.""?? Anyone? Nope! I guess not, because CLEARLY the Disney industry has created live-action movies. We all didn't ask for this whatsoever. I was opened minded about live action and hoping it would be a little different but if they're going to be doing this frame-by-frame movies, this has to STOP NOW. God, if I was a professional movie critic, I would it give it a negative zero on Rotten Tomatoes and this website. Yeah, I would seriously do that, because The Lion King (1994) was my favorite Disney movie EVER!!!
BETRAYAL!!!!
Enough said.",The Lion King
2523,martin-356-972069,New Standard for Visuals,7,21 July 2019,"Lion King is for many, and for a good reason, an all time classic and favorite Disney wonder. The original movie had plenty of great dialogue, humor, and most of all Disney spirit that turned it into the timeless master piece it is today.The new rendition, however, does not exactly live up to the original in terms of these very elements. The humor, dialogue and the relationship between curtain characters is not being put forward with the same strength. This is arguably due to the photo-realistic scenery throughout the entire movie.Disney have namely on the visual side set a new standard for animation quality and realism. It is remarkable that any studio are able to produce these kinds of real-life-looking animations. Disney has clearly spend a lot of resources on producing this stunning visual treat, which is clear in every single frame. The photo-realistic approach, however, limits the cartoon-feeling of several characters and therefore limits the expression of emissions in several key scenes. The dialogue also seems to have been impacted by these limitations.Do yourself a favor and watch this on the biggest screen possible, for you to notice the level of details that has been put into the visuels in this film.What the new Lion King in some places lack in Disney spirit, it defiantly has in remarkable visual scenery and characters. Well done!",The Lion King
2524,dj_sandor07,Dissapointing,6,27 July 2019,"Amazing CGI and Good music but 0 emotions animated on the characters. Just look up a few scenes with Aslan from Narnia on Youtube and you gonna see that even though that film was years ago, a better job was done on animating emotions on a lion. Also the voice acting most of the time felt emotionless, I felt like I was watching a foreign movie which was then redubbed in english... I rate this 6, with generosity",The Lion King

2526,nikkikthegreat,Terrible acting!! Doesn't compare to the original,1,20 July 2019,"I LOVE the original. I wanted to love this movie. I was over the moon excited for it. They took out too many important parts of the original. Showing the strength of Mufasa but also his friendly side (his friendship with Zazu, how he respects and hugs Rafiki, that he taught Simba how to pounce). Even the opening scene wasn't the same. Why would you alter that? The huge rising sun in tune with the music that gives almost everyone goosebumps. The new one you see trees with a slightly lit up morning sky and then a small sun appears off to the side that isn't in sync with the music. Mufasas personality doesn't sound the same even though it's still James Earl Jones' voice. It's different somehow. The hyenas are not the same. They don't make jokes and laugh at themselves like ""make mine a cub sandwich"" then laugh hysterically at their own jokes. They eliminated Ed, the one who doesn't speak, just laughs. Timon isn't flamboyant or half as funny as the original. The hula scene in the original was fast paced and funny to distract the hyenas. The new one he slowly sings ""Be our Guest""?? No action and not as fun. In fact, ALL of the new characters (including Beyoncé) sound like they are just reading from a script and it's really mundane and forced. None of them are in character and flow like the original. There's no sass or wit. The music is boring. It's a huge disappointment. Rafiki catches Simbas hair and knows immediately it's him. In the original, he knows the scent, but it takes him a minute to figure it out and when he does, he's ecstatic. Not in the remake. There is no image of Mufasa in the clouds to guide Simba to remember who he is. Rafiki doesn't give him a lesson about how the past can hurt with his stick. Simba doesn't hug Rafiki like his father did which is also symbolic to how Simba is like his father. I don't understand why Disney would eliminate these bonds and characters that we all love and change it to make what is a visually stunning movie into something I will never want to see again.",The Lion King

I was open to this remake and was impressed by the graphics even though the character portrayal lacked something. However, when Timon arrived I was immediately repulsed as they had taken a beloved character and trampled it underfoot with a re-imagining of him turning him into a prancing idiot nothingness. Every other character was treated with respect and kept primarily true to the original, yet with Timon they diverged from the original to such as an extent to make him unrecognizable in a bad way.

If you like the lion king and aren't cynical by default then go see it, this movie made me very nostalgic and I think I'll go see it again.Yes, this movie is a cash grab, if you define a cash grab as making art and expecting people to pay to go see it.If you go into this movie with a negative mindset, you will probably not like it.

Fast forward to when I was 30yo and saw it on stage. The music and the emotion and grandeur made me sit in awe and tears rolled down my face.
Sitting down yesterday at the cinemas to watch my most anticipated remake movie of my life. The music and the story line carried my emotions. However the lack of emotions in the Prides faces made me feel like i was in the recording studio not a cinematic movie theater.
Seth rogan and Billy Eichner saved the film on many levels, comedy and projected emotion.
I love the lion king and that's why I've given it a 7 As thankfully Jon Favreau didn't change or add anything.

The only real misses were the intro song, which they should've left for a legend like Elton John, and the lackluster first 15 slow minutes of the movie. Timon and Pumbaa, believe it or not, were somehow much funnier than the original, and the best part of the live action version. The Elephant Graveyard scene was unbelievable, and the Gorge scene, as expected, was earth shattering. Beyoncé was a strange pick for Nala, and they should've kept Jeremy Irons as Scar (although his replacement did a great job), otherwise I think the casting was fantastic.

Not particularly good, but ok. I wanted to rate it 6, but then the spirit song came and it lost them two points instantly. I don't think it gets more cringe than that. Of course you are bound to get disappointed with these kind of remakes, but come on, sometimes it felt like they were trying to ruin it on puropse...

What an amazing remake of a beloved childhood movie. Yes, it's in fact, a remake, and missing a bit of visual emotion from the animals but you can't change a classic.

The visuals are speechless. Yes, the lions could smile more or express a little bit more emotion, but for me it was still very good. I did not think about that and I really enjoyed the movie 100%. Spirit is a bit unecessary, and adult simbas voice could be better.
The hula song is not there, but they replaced it with a very funny little scene too :)
Timon and Pumba are unforgettable as always. Don't miss this movie!",The Lion King
2561,cgpowell-512-727899,Absolutely exceptional - and exceeded all expectations,10,22 July 2019,"Having read some of the negative reviews on here I was almost not looking forward to seeing this. And that is saying a lot given how much I was originally looking forward to doing so. I speak as a 50-something man who watched the original way more times than I can recall with my daughter and love that version very much.I have to say I was completely captivated and enthralled from the time the initial 'naaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' of The Circle Of Life began until the very end. I was emotionally engaged to the point of tears running down my face on at least three occasions too.The CGI is breathtaking, the humour of Timon and Pumbaa brilliantly done, and the standout moment of the bushbaby in The Lion Sleeps Tonight absolutely superb. I felt totally engrossed and engaged with all of the characters, loving Simba and Nala, and hating Scar, which is exactly how you should feel. The amazing thing also in overall terms for me was when realising that the movie is 2 hours long, and it felt like I'd been in there for about 30 minutes.You don't need to know anything about The Lion King to love this movie, and maybe in fact it is better that way, as of course comparisons with the original are inevitable. How can you, how dare you, try to improve or better something that has probably been the most famous and most-loved animate production of modern times? The answer is you can't, and some people just need to get over that fact. This movie is wonderful, breathtaking, has you drawn in from the word go, has you singing, toe-tapping and laughing, and then sad and emotionally drawn at the same time. Disney has knocked it out of the park, and I cannot and wouldn't knock anything about it at all.I look forward to watching it again, and buying the blu ray, and having it to keep for all time. It's simply magnificent.",The Lion King
2562,computergeek2000,"Same story, worse execution",2,22 July 2019,This film is a perfect example of why some stories work better as true animation.,The Lion King
2563,klgmbrouwers,Amazing,9,21 July 2019,"I don't understand why there's so much aversion to this film. The CGI is breathtaking. I had goosebumps during the opening scene. Shot by shot, this is what I remember, but now looking like a NG documentary. I expected an Attenborough voice-over to kick in at any time.The film stays faithful to the original, scrapping some scenes that make it feal less 'realistic' (it's also quite strange to have the idea you're watching a nature documentary and all of a sudden a lion starts speaking) and including more real to life animal behaviour. People who criticise the animations for lack of emotion should closely watch the mannerisms of the animals. Their postures, ear twitches, movements, they are filled with non-human emotions. The animators are trying to realisticallu depict animals and have thus avoided using too human-like emotions.Rafiki finally looks like a baboon, Simba has blue eyes as a young cub and later on his eyes turn yellow (like with real lions). Timon and Pumbaa are superbly done and their nee friends are not annoying at all. Some iconic scenes have been changed or adapted, which feels a bit disappointing for fans of the original, but it works for this movie.On its own, this movie is really good. The only thing that bothered me was Beyonce taking the lead in some songs and the inclusion of one of her own songs, replacing another short but good song from the original. But that's personal taste I guess. All in all, I was really pleasantly surprised!",The Lion King
2564,p-h-m-Lyle,"A Reasonable Take On a Classic Animated Film, But Some Characters Could Have Been Better",9,5 September 2021,"Disney announced they were making a live action version of the Lion King in 2017, but despite their best efforts, many fans didn't see why they had to remake the very good 1994 film.Having seen all 3 of the animated Lion King movies growing up, and having enjoyed all of them _ though not to the same extent _ it's taken me a while to get all my thoughts together. But here it goes!The opening scene is largely like what we see in the original film, but the graphics and visual effects make it a visual masterpiece! The sun rising made me feel like we were starting a new film in a good way, but like what other critics have said, I do agree that it does seam that there weren't as many animals at the ceremony. Moving on to when we see young Simba, my first feelings were that I wanted to hug him, and I felt goosebumps right to the end of the scene.I loved how they recreated the scene when we meet Scar, who _ despite being the bad guy _ is one of my favourite characters from the original film _ along with Zazu _ voiced in this version by John Oliver _ Rafiki _ voiced by John Kani _ and Timon and Pumbaa _ voiced in this one by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan. Knowing we're in an age now where we want to see things from the bad guy's perspective, I was worried Scar wouldn't be shown as evilly as he is in the first one, but nothing from his appearance to his lines disappointed me. I know it would have been impossible for them to make him brown with a black mane, but the way they ended by making him seem more downtrodden, along with the scar, didn't take anything away. I also loved how he actually sounded evil in all his scenes, adding more of a King Claudius vibe to him compared to the original.I liked what they did with the hyenas, with Shenzi being the head of the pack _ as it is in the wild. I think this gave it more a real life feel compared to the original, which I think worked as a way to make this a new film compared to the first.The Lion King is never complete without Timon and Pumbaa, and while they were voiced by different actors than in the original, I think they were just as funny, if not more so! The ""We're gonna call him Fred,"" line had me laughing in my seat, and the Beauty and the Beast tribute replaced Timon's hula in a way that worked. The only thing I didn't like, was how 'Be Prepared' was almost completely scrapped.But while I was happy with most of the film, there were still bits that disappointed me. As mentioned above, some of my favourite characters from the original movie, other than the two main lions _ are: Scar, Zazu, Rafiki, Timon and Pumbaa, but while some of them _ Scar, Rafiki, Timon and Pumbaa _ were taken from the original, I can't help but feel that Zazu wasn't done as good as he was in the original. I know others will say that this is because John Oliver is voicing him instead of Rowan Atkinson, but while growing up, I couldn't tell the Zazus in the 2nd and 3rd films were different from the original, and they were closer to Rowan Atkinson's version. I agree that this Zazu isn't a bad character, that they have got him more Hornbill like, that he is still funny, and that John Oliver does a brilliant job voicing him, but I feel like a few of the classic Zazu lines and moments were left out when they could have been included, or at least have edited versions. Going into the cinema to see it for the first time, I expected to see Zazu singing the morning report, but was disappointed when we never got to see it. Saying that, there were some of his other scenes when I was nearly disappointed, but the scenes were rescued with a bit of comedy in the end.I was also disappointed with the way that the scene where Simba and Nala are running during the 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' song and don't get on top of the animals. Saying that though, I can see why they wanted to do something different.Also on a slight negative note, I thought there were slightly less wilder beasts, but the storyline and visual graphics made me forget about it.On a more positive note, I loved all the songs, and all the new and recurring actors did an excellent job in recreating a modern version of an animated classic. The visual Effects are a masterpiece the whole way through, and the animals look real life despite being animated.",The Lion King

There was no drama, no feeling it really lacked the soul of the original movie.A part of that is down to trying to bring the characters to life, like living breathing animals. It just doesn't work. The other part is down to the god awful voice acting. (With the exception of scar who was the real standout) John Oliver as Zazu was cringe worthy and lacked the humour of Rowan Atkinson's take in the cartoon. Beyonce overpowered the duet for 'The love tonight' and ruined it. The remainder just felt like there was a lack of passion.If you want to watch a technical marvel go ahead and watch this but don't expect it to blow you away like recent Disney adaptions like beauty and the beast.",The Lion King

The visual effects, models, animations, environments and music was superb. The only reason why I couldn't give it 10 stars was because the action and effects accompanying the songs could've had more effects and colours, and nala's voice acting was very false and broke the immersion of the movie.

Casting singers to be professional voice actors was just a huge mistake. A lot of riffs and no emotion, terrible acting. Also disney really tried to make this motion picture to be realistic, which I respect however, you couldn't see or feel any emotion through the facial features of the characters, which just took away from the experience.

The story is beautiful as always, the visuals are stunning, the acting is good. The movie looks like a nature documentary because the animals look so real. Because the animals look so real, the facial expressions are less exaggerated. You have to be prepared for this when you go to see the movie. The animals look very real. I wasn't bothered by this and looked at the subtle changes in the facial expressions. I still thought the movie was very emotional and touching. The timing was also great!! It's a way better movie than the new Aladdin, which wasn't touching or emotional to me and didn't have good timing.Plus points of this film:1. Having James Earl Jones back for the role of Mufasa
2. Rafiki
3. The voice actors of Simba and Nala as children
4. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. He did an excellent job with his deep voice.
5. The more realistic appearance of Scar
6. A more clear role for the hyenas.
7. The voice actor for Simba as an adult
8. The voice actors for Timon and Pumbaa
9. The new joked Timon and Pumbaa made
10. The voice actor for Zazu
11. The bringing back of the 'Morning report' by Zazu
12. The voice actress for Sarabi
13. The more prominent role for Nala

2597,triston-coombes,Enjoyable... but missing heart,3,17 July 2019,"Ok. I enjoyed this. I had really high expectations, and perhaps they were a little too high.
The Lion King is one of my all time faves, so I was going to love this regardless.
The opening scene is beautiful, and the rest of the film is beautiful to watch.
The movie is pretty much scene for scene the exact same as the cartoon, but there's a few new lines and things added.
The songs aren't great, and fall a bit flat. There doesn't seem to be any gusto to them. Personally I would have left the songs out all together.
There is a new song in the middle of the movie, Beyoncé sings it, which is completely unnecessary. Beyoncé being in this movie is quite unnecessary actually.
Some of the CG lions are a bit strange to look at, but for most part you could be looking at real lions.
I would have had more of the original cast return if possible. Most of them are still alive. Jeremy Irons as Scar, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu and Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi are deffinately missing from this movie, and it's a real shame.
However I am all for and all about the mostly coloured cast - except Beyoncé, her role could have easily been given to an up and coming actress who needed her big break. Beyoncé does not need the big break or the money. Does it sound like I'm hating on Beyoncé? Good. I am. I hate her.
While it doesn't have the heart of the original, it's still a good movie. I would recommend it, Even if for nostalgic purposes.
Is it a money grab for Disney? Yes absolutely! But so what?",The Lion King

Is makes me sad because every single dam part of the movie feels a drop off because the lack of human like emotions is painfully disconcerting.My rating: The emotionless expressions on the animals faces are impossible to ignore and made me want to rate it low because if this glaring error.

Brought back so many memories from my childhood I used to play, rewind, repeat the original all the time to the point I drove my family mad heheh.Lion King is my all time favourite movie ever made and this definitely did the original justice the CGI was stunning and breathtaking the voices were great and non of the characters disappoint.I like how there was a slight change in certain characters but for this type of movie it worked as certain things in the original movie would not have worked with this modern and realistic look (not a cartoon) . I like they didn't foget certain things from the original movie which made it magical and emotional. Lots of tears, laughter and heartwarming moments.No matter how many negative comments this will get it will not take away the feelings I have towards the film. People need to remember this is a completely new way of filming and is very different from The Jungle book they wanted to take it one step further and they did. Lions don't cry, smile or show human emotions, if you want that watch the original movie.Loving the soundtrack as usual as well as new songs from Elton John, Lebo M and Beyonce. Hans Zimmer doesn't disappoint still makes me cry it sure hits you deep inside.Special thank you to the legend Sir David Attenborough who helped and gave advice with the animal behaviour and movements to help create the film it definitely payed off. Loving nature programs of these animals makes you want to rub your eyes watching this as non of it is real it is that believable.Will be seeing this multiple times!Well done Jon Favreau and all the cast and crew you did an amazing job please do Lion King 2!",The Lion King
2609,matb-89,Nostalgia Not Enough,4,28 July 2019,"It's almost impossible to critique a remake of a movie purely on its own merit. Frankly, I'm my opinion, if you choose to remake a movie then the privilege of individual merit is void anyway. Having said that, I'll try to limit my bias. The opening scenes were stunning, both visually and audibly, and a deep sense of joy and wonder swept through my being as I awaited to see the reimagining of a childhood favourite movie. I had to restrain myself as I almost let out an audible sigh of wonder as little cub Simba was revealed. The animation was truly beautiful.
With the opening number finished, I waited, with excitement and unease, to see how the animators would tackle the challenge of making realistic looking animals engage in human communication. Unfortunately, this is where the magic of the cinematography and animation quickly gave way to, what I would describe as, cringeworthy and unnatural interactions between characters that don't have the body language or facial queues to portray any human emotion. Listening to the emotion in the character's voices come out of a lion, or hornbill, or hyena, or warthog, and not seeing their faces or bodies portray those same emotions felt awkward, and distracting. A lot of the dialogues, for example, listening to Scar and Mufasa's opening exchange, where they passionately engage in discourses of family loyalty and displeasure in each other's differing opinions, only to be portrayed through emotionless lions where their faces didn't express any of these ideas or emotions was really quite annoying and, simply put, bad. It felt like there was a real struggle to find the balance of realistically animating these characters and then trying to suspend our disbelief that they are capable of human ideas, language and interactions. I don't feel as though that balance was found. It seemed very jarring feeing like you're watching a BBC documentary, to then have these animals start talking to each other. The things about the movie I did enjoy were the beautiful songs and the score. Unfortunately, the majority of the songs and music was from the original movie, so I can't really give credit to the 2019 remake for that. Seth Rogan as Pumba was great, and everyone else was decent enough. Although, I'm not sure that you can blame the voice actors for much, considering they had the almost impossible task of making us believe these animals were talking to each other.
In summary, the cinematography and the animals looked amazing, and my only real concern was the awkward exchanges between the characters. But, considering the movie is a remake, I am rating as a remake, and in my very humble opinion it fell short of the original.",The Lion King

I'm sorry but Jeremy Irons voicing of Scar is one of the most iconic villain voices in all of Disney. Why Disney didn't bring him back to reprise the role makes absolutely no sense. My only hope is that Jeremy Irons lives long enough that he can be in the remake of this disaster of a movie. The lack of emotion to be more realistic was a terrible decision. It literally takes away from the movie. Half the time Scar looks like he is being sincere. And my favorite song, ""Be Prepared"" is ruined by the little nod to it in the movie. You suck Disney. You such bad.",The Lion King

2619,elliew_101,Somewhat disappointing,4,21 July 2019,"Reluctant to subside to actually enjoying a Disney remake, The Lion King definitely did not change my attitude. Despite having outstanding visuals and a neat take on the classic soundtrack, this film lacked the energy and emotion that the animation pulled off so effortlessly. It seemed to feel as though something was always lacking. For example, the voiceover and interpretation of Scar lacked the true evil, menacing character that was depicted in the original. Despite this laissez-faire attempt at remaking a beloved classic, I would like to commend the film for its clever and cunning humour, led by the popular duo of Timon and Pumba. With some glimpses of the original Disney creativity, this film overall was a disappointment and Disney must keep in mind that when remaking films that were and still remain to be so popular, makers should not rest of their laurels in order to live up to the highest expectations and even, if possible, improve these classic originals.",The Lion King

2623,caine-k88,The Lion King for this generation!,9,17 July 2019,"Just came back and with the original being my #1 favourite movie of all time, this still deserves a big fat 9!Does it improve on the original? No.
Was the movie necessary? No.
Are the voice actors comparable to the original? For the most part...no.
But is it enjoyable? Most definitely!!!I found the emotions on the animals' faces to be even better than the original. Mainly because of the small movements of ears, eyes, whiskers etc.If you go watch the movie with the attitude: it's a remake and it can never be as good as the original...you will leave the theatre as grumpy as you've entered it.
But give it a shot, go in there open minded and be amazed (again) about the new technology and the awesome animation, the great voice cast, good songs (ok I missed Jeremy Irons) and still to date the best Disney story ever!In the end it's all a matter of opinion.
My opinion is that if you rate this movie a 1, you are comparing it to the likes of Sharknado and embarrassing the original in your score.This is the Lion King for this generation!
And also a great trip back in time for the people who saw the original and can enjoy good movies.

Unfortunately Beyoncé's voice was so recognizable and different than the other voices in the film that that's all I could hear. The song ""can you feel the love tonight"" was also over done. It did not need to have that many riffs, it's a simple classic song I wish they couldve kept it that way. I felt like she tried too hard. Knowing that she made an entire album about the film is a little obnoxious.",The Lion King

Although I knew what was going to happen, I was still completely engaged in the movie. Many people will never like live action remakes and will always be dissatisfied. If this is you, don't bother watching it as you will be constantly nit picking and disappointed. However, if you treat it as a standalone movie and enjoy it for what it is, you may actually like it.
Reviewers complain about the lack of emotions. This didn't bother me, nor did I even really notice it. Plus, it may have been a little weird to see ""real"" animals conveying much emotions.
I love the original, but I think this is great as well. We have our ""Lion King"" and the next generations have theirs. Why is it terrible to have both? Besides, my children (who have seen the original) loved this movie. That's enough for me.",The Lion King

2633,iyatheo,The potential was there but not meet.,3,23 July 2019,"It lacked so much emotion.There was no emotion in the animation, no emotion in the voice acting. Aside from Mr Jones himself, the rest lacked the range to driver this classic home.There were times when I thought the camera angles could have lingered on a little longer, like for instant the stampede scene, when the angle descends from the top of the sloap and the music rises, it felt like a ride you go up the hill anticipating a deep fall but nothing happens, they didn't drive it home.The shot of Simba's paw swallowed by Mufas's the creaters could have captured the moment to really drive forward the immense overwhelm Sima was feeling but didn't.Even when Mufas comes to rescue Simba at the elephant graveyard, there was no terror, no fear, no remorse in the cubs faces. And later, no gratitude.Furthermore, Timone and Pumba was totally ruined, it felt like most of their dialogue was adlibed and poorly.For me, they couldn't shine a light to the original.

Had the original 1994 movie never been made and this movie given to us as an original, I highly doubt that this would have made it to theatres. No character in the movie has a discernable personality. There's not really any character growth. Two of the most memorable songs aren't even songs and instead are the voice actors talking slightly faster with a faint music score. Some of the best dialogue in the movie is cut out and new dialogue and scenes are inserted in their place. The new scenes are blatantly obvious in comparison to the old, as the writing falls flat and is ultimately irrelevant. It's impossible to care about or have any emotional investment in the characters, as the whole movie lacks entertainment value or the typical fun and excitement of any given Disney movie. Instead we have a line that summarizes the feeling of the entire movie: ""life is meaningless"".",The Lion King

The characters are without any personality and it feels weird when they talk as there is more or less no facial movement except a blabbering mouth.The whole movie looks like an attempt at making a (extremely well from a technical point of view) animal documentary with a horrible voiceover.This was disappointment from start to finish.
Changes to scenes we all know and love butchery of familiar characters lines.Waste of money, I really can't understand how no one during the production said ""wtf are we doing...?""",The Lion King

2639,jpedrosous,It's impossible to achieve what they wanted,2,10 August 2019,"I saw this dubbed in other language and have the same opinion as most users here. My conclusion is that if you want to focus on realism, you'll have to give up on character's emotions and expressions. Simply because ""real"" lions and other animals don't have such expressions. Raise your hand if you ever saw a lion smiling or crying.The result is that you hear a certain emotion, but you don't see them. We immediately think the cast was awful because there is no association between sound with image. But it's actually a visual problem.Music is awful as well. Very bad film. CGI was great but it's just unnecessary and makes things way worse on this case. I hated it.",The Lion King

It's a fun movie to watch and all the excitment and over hyping is wrong and changed the way of lovers of the old movie.

Each emotional scene was ruined with the deadpan delivery of some great lines. I couldn't hear a difference of feeling from when a character was mad or happy. Those are two very different emotions.

2646,pixhoof,I am disappointed,5,19 July 2019,"MAY COINTAIN SPOILERSThis is my first and probably my last review on IMDB, but since The Lion King has been the most precious animated movies to me since my childhood I have to give this a shot.PROS: As many of the reviews here have noticed the CGI was spot on amazing. There is nothing to add here, it was literal o.r.gasm to watch this and if this was a documentary about Africas wildlife based on The Lion King animation it would be absolutely perfect,... but it was not.CONS: Since the CGI was so amazing the animals were basically, well just animals,.. they do not show any emotions (since they obviously can't) during some tear jerking scenes from the animation (after watching The Lion King for all of my life, every year I still cry at the opening scene, the death of Mufasa and the ending roar of Simba).
But the movie would be great if the lack of the emotions from CGI was the only problem. The music. They butchered it. They ruined every amazing song from the original. Every. Single. One. I don't know why they tried to improvise or renew the original songs, because they were perfect. The movies versions suck. Period. This was the tip for me. I am so sorry for Hans Zimmer, since he probaly tried to incorporate the original soundtrack into it, but the singing, oh god.... I was in pain. It's like Russell Crowes singing in Les Miserables or Gerard Butler in The Phantom of The Opera (no offence to Mr. Crowe or Mr. Butler, you are both amazing actors \m/).
The cast did not put any emotions into the characters. They were just blank. Simbas famous »NOOO!« at Mufasas fall from the gorge cliff was in one word,...pathetic. Also Casting John Oliver for Zazu is a no go for me. I sometimes watch his shows and I am very familiar with his »acting« and voice. He was not their best choice to my opinion. If you are doing something so monumental as The Lion King, the cast should be used to making great emotional expresions throught their speaking (like they did with the animation).I was not expecting to enjoy the movie as much as I enjoyed the animated version. I was prepared that for it and did anticipate that the CGI and the realistic version of animals would take away part of the emotions that the animation could provide for the animals (and thus lowered my standards and went in with a: okay, this is going to be different). What I did expect from the movie, was a professional solid out-of-heart emotional representation of the characters through voice acting and an amazing incorporation of the exceptional original music into this movie.",The Lion King
2647,patricklaunspach-920-468537,"An Okay, Maybe Even Good, Movie That Falls Short of It's Source Material",7,24 July 2019,"First of all this movie is visually impressive-the landscapes are breathtaking and the animals look incredibly realistic (though when comparing establishing shots I'm not sure that the African sunset of the live-action remake outshines that of the original). This remake trades in the stylization for extreme realism-though this seems like this movies greatest strength, it quickly becomes it's downfall.The movie feels like someone edited and dubbed over an animal documentary. Super realistic, but devoid of facial expressions and therefor emotion. This creates a juxtaposition that make it's awkward, almost off-putting, when these real-world animals start talking. I wonder if the movie would have been better if Disney would have conceded that this was a kids movie and sacrificed a little bit of the realism for the sake of humanism.The realistic feel of this movie also pushed Disney to make the appropriate choice to make the tone of the movie more real and even keel, but the result is that the movie feels flat. Simba is missing his boyish charm. Mufasa lacks his grandeur and gravitas. There is far less chemistry between Simba and Nala. And worst of all much of Scar's sinister sarcastic, sneering, and delightfully evil scheming is lost behind his vacant albeit realistic expression. In addition, or as a result of, the voice acting feels bored and uninspired.In a similar vein, the film tried to play it cool or at least safe on the musical numbers-many song intros are spoken instead of sung, sung parts feel mellow and noncommittal, and the musical numbers are completely void of choreography. This results in an underwhelming hollow soundtrack that moves the plot along, but does little to inject any energy into the film. I wish Disney would have decided that it was making a musical and committed to it or accepted that it wasn't a musical and scrapped the musical numbers completely.I hate to spend a whole review discussing the aesthetics of a film, but the challenge of working with this realism ultimately weighed down the whole film. This burden, and the stark contrast to the original, is made even more apparent by the fact that the remake follows the original almost entirely beat-by-beat.The movie is most interesting, engaging, and ultimately successful in the 30-second glimpses where it deviates from the original script and explores new ground-a brief discussion between Scar and Mufasa alluding to the history of their beef, a darker more sinister lead hyena, Nala's slightly hair raising exodus from the pride. A new ensemble of supporting characters fleshed our Simon and Pumba's bohemian paradise (even though the subtle hilarious fart jokes of the original became a little too spelled out and tired).Again, I wish Disney should have either kept the original audio track and updated its visual look and feel or, preferably, had the courage to scrap more of the original script and allowed the movie to approach the story from a fresh, new, probably darker, perspective. The movie (especially the trailer) alluded to a fantastic discussion on the disenfranchisement and resentment of the hyenas, a narrative that could have been greatly expanded.Every so often the talent of a cast, skill of a production team, and a little bit of luck come together to catch lightning in a bottle in a way that is nearly impossible to reproduce. The original Lion King was great, almost perfect, the Citizen Kane of a consistent powerhouse of an animation studio. It balanced a kid's movie with profound storytelling all while delivering a collection of Disney's greatest sing-alongs. When Disney decided to remake this movie, it took on an impossible task and made things worse by refusing to try explore anything really new. The result is a movie that is okay, maybe even good, but falls terribly short the source material it tries to replicate.",The Lion King

2650,aebarval,Good visual match for original but a miss,4,19 July 2019,"The visuals were stunning but even that couldn't make up for the flat voice acting. The lack of visual emoting on these ""live action"" animals also contributed. That said it feels like you're watching a National Geographic show at times, which is awesome.The Beyonce song shoehorned in the middle of the film was distracting and really pulled me out of it. Her singing voice is obviously incredible but she really took over Can You Feel The Love Tonight and washed out Donald Glover's performance. It felt like they were trying to make it all about Beyonce in some parts.Arguably the best song of the original film, Be Prepared, was cut very short and hardly noticeable in this new film. It takes a minute to even realize the song has started. While I appreciate they tried to do something different with it, it failed to impress.On the note of the music/audio, I'm not sure why but the music and sound lacked impact. When they opened with Circle of Life it didn't have the same gravity or swelling as the original. This also contributed to the overall lack of energy in the film.On the positives, Florence Kasumba did a brilliant job bringing a new sinister edge to Shenzy. Timon and Pumbaa played by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen respectively were a breath of fresh air. The supporting characters made the film watchable but even they couldn't make up for flat performances by Donald Glover and Beyonce.Ultimately, it's just another pointless Disney regurgitation of beloved films for a moneygrab. Fine for a watch once but don't think I'll watch again.",The Lion King

Sure the CGI looks remarkable, but that's simply not enough to make up for this weak remake of a classic Disney film. Where do I start? The voice acting is mediocre, with the only stand out performances coming from Timon, Pumba, and Zazu. The voice actors for these 3 really took the characters and made them their own, causing them to stand out. Donald Glover does a fine job but he never does much to really shine other than his vocal performance in Hakuna Matata. We lose the song ""Be Prepared"" in this movie and instead get a worse, shorter version. Pretty much none of the songs were better in this version. They all felt very dull with only flickers of engaging action on screen. The first half of the movie is honestly kind of boring, thank God Timon and Pumba save this sinking ship.
All in all, The Lion King remake is simply this: A bland, uninspired, Disney cashgrab",The Lion King
2654,agajudd,Favreau Fizzler despite star-studded cast.,1,9 November 2019,"Favreau hamstrung himself by trying to pay fan service to the original masterpiece and simultaneously shifting the story slightly so to make it simpler to follow. I would offer three critiques here:1. It's too soon to remake this classic. Your audience is predominantly made up of people who grew up on the 90s Disney classics who are now seeing it with their kids. Nostalgia filter aside, this doesn't hold a candle to original.2. I understand the want to change the story slightly and make it your own but this is both unnecessary and demeaning. The original contained subtext, innuendo and dialogue that carried the plot of the film. This remake spells out every action with painstaking dialogue, bludgeoning you with rafiki's lack of stick and constantly asking you ""do you get it?""3. Don't mess with the music!! The fact that songs are cut short, replaced with dialogue is bad enough but when the redub versions sound like the cast of Glee you know you have take it a bridge too far.This remake needs to go the way of Old Yella. Very pretty cinematics but just needs to be put down.",The Lion King
2655,OtterlyMad,Amazing!,9,1 August 2019,"The original ""The Lion King"" is my all-time favorite Disney movie, so I had high expectations going into this and I was not disappointed. Nay-sayers complain that the hyper-realistic animals strip this movie of all emotion, but I beg to differ. What's sadder than a cartoon Simba trying to wake up his dead dad? A tiny, adorable, super realistic Simba trying to wake up his dead dad. Of course, I can't make it through a David Attenborough nature doc without crying, so I guess I find animals emotional enough without them having human facial expressions. The visuals are stunning and harken back to an Africa that existed before humans decimated its population of amazing wildlife. As for those claiming this is nothing but a cash grab, I can only hope that none of them support the legion of D.C./Marvel movies that seem to be released monthly. I deducted one star because although Beyonce wasn't as bad as I feared, I would've much preferred someone else as Nala.",The Lion King

Everything seem great until Beyoncé came in. There is no doupt that she is a great singer and she coukd have been great in the movie, but it seemed that she was showing off with her voice. In songs which are more focused on the story she decided to ruin it with her incredible singing skills, with unecessary control of her voice.

The struggle up the cliff is heart wrenching and because it looks so real you're rooting for him even though you know the outcome....and then...ugh.Seth Rogen as Pumba in absolutely hilarious.Not a huge Beyonce fan for Narla TBH, but Mr Glover continues to impress.Excellent recreation of my favorite Disney story, well done :-)",The Lion King

The one good thing was that the Characters and scenery are so real life looking , however that's also a downfall. . I found the life like effects to be distracting and that it made it even harder to be a comedy. ... it's simply one of those movies that shouldn't ever be remade in my opinion.",The Lion King
2675,joanneb4,Not bad but not great.,5,18 July 2019,"I thought the CGI was great although at times the emotions of the characters weren't portrayed overly well which really ruined what should've been some highly felt scenes (for eg when Mufasa dies or when Nala finds Simba alive.) I had packed tissues expecting that I'd be bawling my eyes out but I didn't cry once.What really ruined it for me was the music. The songs were fine but they were so quiet that it offered no impact at all. Music is a big part of this movie and it needed to be felt but it wasn't. My daughter felt the exact same way.Also, all the lions looked the same. At times it was hard to tell who was who in fight scenes and I think Scar should've had a darker mane.Timon and Pumba were great but again when they were singing Hakuna Matata the quietness of the song ruined what could've been a ""get up and dance"" scene.Overall it could've been done a lot better. It lacked soul and heart.I didn't hate it but I certainly didn't love it.",The Lion King
2676,hazzamorris,On a par with the Original,7,28 July 2019,"Without knowing what to expect, after first watch, I was left divided. After letting it sink in, thoughts: it was amazing. The story differs very little from the original - bar some modern day references - but there's just something about the superbly done animation that intensified every location, emotion and melody. The deserts felt dry, the jungle felt dense, dark and dangerous, and I mourned for Mufasa like he were my own kin. The storytelling was clear and well orchestrated, even answering some questions I had from the original.I would love to say it was better than the original, and for those seeing this version first, it may be. But there is nothing that will compare to the nostalgia of the OG, and it's for that reason I can't score it higher. I have to say, from a remake, I was anticipating at least one nugget of new information. I was left longing.Overall though; perfect animation, skillfull storytelling and hair raising moments. Truly well done.",The Lion King

2687,kwray9614,Beautiful reimagining of a Disney Classic,10,22 July 2019,"First and foremost the movie is visually stunning!! Like everything looks amazing! And second, props to the cast! They did a wonderful job lending their voices to these iconic characters. Everyone did a good job! Donald Glover I felt killed it as Simba, I shed a tear when his transition from cub to adult hit the screen and he hit that first note in Hakuna Matata.I see a lot of people complaining about the emotion, but you have to remember that this is a ""realistic"" reimagining. Which puts a limit on the amount of expressions the characters can show because they are supposed to be realistic. And I think the voices continued to help convey that emotion. But I think people are stuck on the ""expressionless"" faces that it makes it hard for them to feel the emotion the movie is trying to portray.Overall I think the translation from animated to live action was perfect. I don't think they could've done any better, to be honest. The movie is well worth the watch! You can tell the cast had a great time working on this! Good job to everyone involved!

2694,paulgalazo,The Emotionless and Expressionless Lion King.,5,20 July 2019,"First and foremost I love the lion king, one of my favorite movies of all time. The live action version was beautiful visually, but unlike the original, this version lacked emotion and expression, especially in the eyes.I get the fact that many animal movies gets humanized through expression, but the live action remake did not have much or any at all. Not even a simple flicker in the eyelids. Sure real animals do not possess a great deal of expression but they sure do not lack any. Aside from that, the voice over felt rushed in certain places and did not carry a great deal of depth. Surprisingly hardly any excitement or anger from the great James Earl Jones: it felt like Mufasa was tired. Grown up simba was meek and Nala was just the same. You knew it was Beyonce.Overall the movie didn't feel epic like the original. Most of the time it felt like you were watching a documentary from Nat Geo. If it wasn't for Timon and Pumbaa, the film would've been boring. I still did like the movie because the original is so dear to my heart.",The Lion King

2701,StarTracer-76726894,Beautiful Visuals but Lacking the Heart of the Orginal,2,22 July 2019,"Like just about anyone, I thought the visuals are gorgeous and an amazing feat of technology. The animals are beautifully realistic, but the movie's greatest feat is also it's greatest downfall. I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times already, but the lack of emotion on the character's faces is a glaring issue with this remake. Emotionally powerful scenes such as Mufasa's death and Simba seeing his father amongst the clouds have lost their power because of the lack of any emotion.The story is overall exactly the same and may be the closest to a 1 to 1 remake of any of the Disney remakes so far. I wanted to keep as open of a mind as possible watching this, but I honestly couldn't finish it without becoming very bored because you cannot connect with the characters like you used to. We humans rely so much on faces for deciphering emotion and the characters have pretty much zero emotion because of the realistic take on them.Comic relief characters such as Timon and Pumbaa cannot move with the same vigor and vive and rely 100% on the voices to get any response. Movies are a visual medium and this lack of movement and emotion really, really brings the movie down. The animals are just staring at each other with mouths that hardly move, making the movie seem like a nature documentary with people talking over the footage.Another thing I found really disheartening was the removal of some powerful lines. When Mufasa dies, I knew not to expect much emotion from Simba, but his ""Noooo!"" was so underwhelming with a dead-eyed character model and lacking the dramatic zoom-out of the original. When Simba approaches his father's body, in the original, asks him multiple times to get up, tells him they have to get up, they have to go home and cries ""Help! Somebody... anybody... help"" before breaking down into tears. I still choke up at the scene.Here, he only tells him to wake up once and screams ""Help! Somebody, help!"" before curling up next to his father. No tears were shed of course, because of the realism. That inclusion of ""anybody"" in the original and begging him to get up more than once really makes a difference. Such a powerful scene that made us all cry was ruined.When Rafiki meets Simba again, the scene of Rafiki teaching him about the past hurting is cut. Rafiki in general isn't the same fun, eccentric, lovable character in the remake.Then when Simba sees his father among the clouds, I was expecting something really magnificent because of what we can do with today's tech, but you'd be hard pressed to find Mufasa's image in the storm above as only occasional lightning flashes show the rough outline of his eyes and mouth, nowhere near as intense and beautiful as the original. And the once powerful line of ""Simba, you have forgotten me. You have forgotten who you are, so you have forgotten me. Look inside yourself Simba, you are more than what you have become. You must take your place in the circle of life. Remember who you are. You are my son and the one true king. Remember who you are...""Here Mufasa's sad excuse of an image says ""Simba, you must take your place in the circle of life. You must remember who you are, the one true king. As king, I was most proud of one thing, having you as a son.""
Simba says ""That was a long time ago.""
Mufasa replies with ""That is forever""
Simba tells him not to leave him again and Mufasa says ""I never left you and never will. Remember who you are.""
Simba is left staring blanky into the sky as the storm clears. He does not try to run after him and I feel like Simba's actor could have delivered his lines with a bit more emotion since his character model has none.While I think the inclusion of having Mufasa tell him that he will always be his son and will never leave him was touching, opening with telling him that he has forgotten him had a lot of power and its just gone.A few more things I didnt like was the remake of ""Be Prepared"" and the way ""Can you Feel the Love Tonight"" was sung. Beyonce's powerful voice drowns out Donald Glover and you can barely hear him. Of course, the scene during the song is also dull with no expressions of love and the odd choice of being shot in daylight. And ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" lacked the fun of the original, again, because of the realistic approach. The fun animation of the original was replaced with Simba and Nala walking around a watering hole among some animals while singing. That's it.The good things I can say is that I liked:
Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Timon and Pumbaa. I still prefer the originals, but they did really well as the comedic duo.It was nice to hear James Earl Jones return as Mufasa.The children who played young Simba and Nala did very well.Scar's voice actor could never top Jeremy Irons, but he was still pretty good, though he still just lacked the same flamboyant, dastardly tone of the original.The end fight scene was pretty impressive.Hans Zimmer's gorgeous score is literally exactly the same with some extra instruments or vocals in some parts. This isn't a bad thing though since the score was already perfect.Again, the visuals are really impressive but just don't work with the premise of The Lion King.I haven't liked any of the remakes so far except The Jungle Book, which was pretty good. They've stomped on two of my favorites so far, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King so now I'm just waiting for them to ruin my last favorite, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.If you have kids and want them to experience the magic you did as a child, please just watch the original as there is no magic to be seen here.",The Lion King

The naysayers out there feel like a reimagining of this classic story - as well as many recent and upcoming Disney remakes - will tarnish their memories made as a little kid. I am here to tell them to shut the hell up.Overall I give the 2019 movie a 9.9/10. Without giving too much away, I will say that nearly every single aspect of the original is in this new film. I'm sure people will complain that it is too similar (those same people would also complain if it changed too much). The visuals are stunning and it is crazy to think you are watching a computer generated visual throughout the movie. Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen steal the show as Timon and Pumba. The reason I am not giving it a true 10/10 is because it was missing my favorite song by Zazu about coconuts...",The Lion King

2707,andreasolsson-18963,"Suberb CGI, slight changes in story detail, same story.",7,17 July 2019,"OBS, marked for spoilers for the people who hasn't seen the original version.First of all this movie is enjoyable not because it brings something new to the table but for the classic story told in amazing photo-realistic visuals. The CGI animals could easily be mistaken for real ones. If it weren't for the animals having the ability to speak you probably would be thinking that the filmmakers filmed real lions. However the realistic look also comes with a cost, which is that the charcters, due to being animals have it difficult conveying the emotions fitting with the tone of their voice and the scene they are in. This issue is not the actors fault because the voice acting is fine, but it is understable difficult convey the facial expressions connected with human emotions onto an animal with completely different facial features. Because of this issue the 2019 Lion King doesn't have the same emotional impact as the original 1994 release.Other than the visuals there are also slight changes in some characters personality and motivations, resulting in varying significance. The most prominent example is the hyenas toned down comic-releif which makes them feel more of a threat to the lions at pride rock. Without going into to much detail, is the lack of comic releif, beneficial for the hyena chracters, which makes them more of scavenging predators desperate for food rather than fools loosing a prey due to joking around instead of making an effort to kill their prey, resulting in more threatening ally to Scar.To conlcude this review I would say that this version of the Lion king is worth watching if you would like to see the majestic beauty of the savannah and realistic looking animals in a familiar story, but when remembering the story the original 1994 version will leave a more lasting impact.",The Lion King

It just felt like watching an Animal Planet documentary with good cinematography. With Jungle Book, having a human as a frame of reference helped with the emotions expressed by the animals but obviously Lion King doesn't have the reference. Disney should have left Lion King alone. At the end of the day, Jungle Book was still able to portray the emotions but Lion King failed to do it so I feel that Disney might have messed up on its part this time.",The Lion King

2722,franckavanputten,It was pretty good,9,19 July 2019,"One thing to start with.. don't watch the original 1994 version before or keep it in mind. For me with a 3 year old the original is an almost daily DVD to watch.
The live-action is about 80% the same (story, dialogs, music). I expected it to be more different like for example The Jungle Book was. I was happy that not everything was littery redone and new scenes were added. It probaly was so much the same because it was Walt Disney's last wish that it would be turned into live-action. In that case it was really done very well!I think the voices were cast greatly. The not really perfect songs (in sync voices together) made it more real for me. Otherwise it would have been too cartoony. The CGI was breathtaking. The emotions didn't bother me, but I can imagine some people mentioning it. The emotions did get to me and I got tears in my eyes on a few occasions. It made me laugh many times as well, so enough humor.
It is true that watching almost real live animals talk takes a little getting used to, but it didn't bother me.
Its a movie that doesn't have to live up to the original because it could never be done. They got close tho..
For me it was definitly worth watching and I had a good time!",The Lion King
2723,rafaelvianafc,Amazing - everything changes,10,25 July 2019,"It is comprehensible why so many people are hating on this one, similarly to what it is going on with many other live-action movies produced recently. It appears to me that people tend to have an affective memory towards the original Lion King (1994), since a lot of folks have watched it as a young kid, and because of that people idealize everything about that movie to the detriment of the 2019 version. So almost by reflection, as an impulse, folks reject a lot of things in this one; the novelties and even the things that are repeated from the 1994 flick. But in fact, if you try to watch the 2019 Lion King with the heart of a kid, you will very probably like it, and furthermore, get emotional and involved with the story and the characters again.",The Lion King

Most of the actors were good too, with the exception of Beyoncé. I looove Beyoncé, but something about her delivery just fell flat. (She made up for it with that beautiful companion album, though.). Other critiques were: music and sound was too low, especially for the songs, and they cut the BACON SONG. Other than that, I did enjoy myself more than I thought.

The CGI is for a more realistic interpretation and animals don't show emotion just in their faces. Animal emotion is shown throughout their body language, seen in the way they hold their ears and uses every feature of the animal. I think they did a wonderful job trying to show realistic emotions in wild animals.

Unfortunately Robert Guillaume passed away so Disney had no choice but to replace the voice of Rafiki. The other 4 actors voices are too unique to have been replaced. I went in with an open mind and tried to like it but as soon as I hear Scar I couldn't help but dislike it right away. I will say that even though I prefer the original Pumbaa Seth Rogan did a nice job with the part. The CGI is great and they stuck to the original story line well enough that I didn't think it was ruined. But those iconic voices being replaced was to much for me.

But rafiki was great, simba and nala were spot on from the original. Timon and pumba were great and funny but timon didnt dress in drag and do the hula lol but other then that, it wasnt too bad.

Timon and Pumba in my opinion were the best characters in this film. Young Nala and Simba were great and old Nala and Simba were okay. It was great to have James Earl Jones return however his lines were changed slightly especially the scene when Mufasa appears in the clouds.CGI:
No doubt the CGI in this movie is amazing. The animals look very realistic. It's as if you are watching a documentary. The problem is animals can't Express emotions like humans do so for that reason, some scenes didn't feel sad as they should do e.g. when Mufasa dies.
Everything Else:
The music was good but it didn't give an impact like it did in the original. The scenes felt rushed and they were not going along with the music e.g. the scene when Simba walks up pride rock, that scene in my opinion was disappointing because it was not going along with the music and the impact was lost.",The Lion King

The casting was perfect. The movie won't win any awards but it was nostalgic and enjoyable if you take it for what it is.,The Lion King
2746,sq-58273,Underwhelming but decent CGI,4,20 July 2019,"First off, the CGI is great but not amazing. I'd give it a 8 out of 10. Most of it was excellent but there were some parts that didn't gel well together, such as when Simba tries to pull himself under Mufusa's paw after he died. They seem like their bodies are not interacting well together. Also the opening scene when all of the animals are in front of pride rock, something seems off. That being said this is an amazing leap forward in technology but it still needs to be perfected.As for the movie, the animals faces are hard to convey speaking and acting, sometimes being out emotion/character. Many of the hyenas don't come off well and neither do the lions. It's hard to tell when they are angry, joking, sarcastic, happy, sad, etc. There wasn't enough emotion to see this. It seems too realistic, which it shouldn't have, but that's what they went for. Sometimes they'd speak and I wouldn't see them doing so. Also what's up with Nala and Simba not singing ""can you feel the love tonight."" They're just starring at each other, it was a bit off. The whole scene was weird and rushed to me. Not at night, not much emotion, not singing, jumped into it, etc.As for the voice acting. James Earl Jones does an amazing job as Mufusa. JD McCray and Shahadi Wright do well as young Simba and Nala. Chiwetel Ejiofor does good as Scar. John Oliver is good as Zazu and so is Alfre Woodward as Sarabi. Donald Glover grows into adult Simba (on purpose it feels) and I'm ok with that. Seth Rogan as Pumba grows on you but it feels weird at first. Billy Eichner as Timon is a miss for me. He lacks that sarcastic tone. The biggest miss is Beyoncé as Nala. She sounds too old for her age (unlike Donald Glover) and doesn't mix well with the acting of the lion. When she says ""lions attack"" it seems unnecessary, both screen shot and voice out.Overall it was a let down. I'm more of a fan of the original movie or the broadway play. It's such a great story but it can't shine through the missed pieces in this film for me. I really want to like it but I can't. This seems like a lot of effort to capture a lot of hearts but comes up short.",The Lion King

2752,mayabutler,Hyperrealistic yet boring,4,24 August 2019,"Thanks to endless reruns of the original, animated film ""The Lion King"" the last couple of weeks (thanks TV), I've unintentionally prepared myself for this year's live-action remake of the Disney classic.Just like ""Cinderella,"" ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" and other beloved tales, the story of a young lion reclaiming his rightful place on Pride Rock has received the seemingly inevitable live-action makeover, which can be seen as a blessing or a curse. The familiar landscape of the savanna in the 1994 original is now home to photorealistic (and I mean very realistic) animals that all share life-like environments, from the water they drink to the ground they walk across. And the lions themselves are impressive to see in their hyper-realistic appearances. While care was taken to maintain Scar's intimidating presence, however, the lionesses all looked the same. The fact that an adult Nala visually blends into the group instead of standing out botches the film's attempt to give the character more narrative material.Another inescapable main problem of the 2019 version is that it gains a sense of animal realism in terms of visuals while also losing the animated charm that heightened the original's raw emotions. There was one major scene that was meant to be dramatic (I think you know which one I'm talking about) that ended up crossing the comical line due to the animal's inappropriate facial expression.Under Jon Favreau's direction, ""The Lion King"" presents a new cast of voice actors, including Donald Glover as Simba and Beyoncé as Nala. You'll also recognize Seth Rogen's voice in Pumbaa and see television host John Oliver's interpretation of Timon. Luckily, James Earl Jones reprises his role as Simba's father, Mufasa, a smart move on the film's part; no one can replace the veteran actor's deep, distinctive voice that gave his character the right amount of aged wisdom in the original. The one distracting voice throughout the movie, however, was Beyoncé herself.The singer lends her voice to a grown-up Nala, but it's a difficult task masking a world-famous voice that has sold millions of albums to a character whose facial expressions are already hindered by the film's focus on hyper-realistic visuals. The task is made even more impossible with the added fact that Beyoncé sings several songs (including an original yet unnecessary set of lyrics that ruin one particular scene's tone).This year's ""The Lion King"" stays faithful - some would say too faithful - to its predecessor. From beginning to end, the narrative is amped up in visual realism yet predictably still matches the original almost scene to scene. Having said that, the filmmakers did make the effort in including a few fresh scenes and tweaking familiar ones. It'll be up to moviegoers, ultimately, in deciding if those short scenes make enough of a difference when it comes to distinguishing the classic from the remake.Longtime fans will be happy to hear popular tracks such as ""The Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata,"" as well as laugh at some new jokes. The best part of the live-action remake involves all the critical action scenes, with the extended showdown between the lions and the hyenas serving as an entertaining example.If the never-ending string of live-action remakes has proven anything, it's that nostalgia sells.Big time.",The Lion King

2754,restwhenyouredeadx,Y'all are ridiculous,9,2 November 2019,"This movie was done so well, and I'm so disappointed in people who give this such low ratings. Let me start by saying that the animated movie has been my favorite since I was nearly an infant. In my baby book, at the 18 month mark, my mom wrote that it was my favorite thing. I had Lion King everything, and spent my childhood studying lions as they were my favorite animal. I have shared the animated movie with my own children, and we've enjoyed every other real life remake of other Disney movies. When I found out this was coming out, I was apprehensive, but excited. I didn't want them to ""ruin"" it, but trusted the studio and Faveau - I thought Jungle Book was excellent and knew he could pull this off as well. And he did! The quotes and songs that were important were there, and they added lots of other fun quips as well. I was nervous for the voice acting because the reviews rip it to shreds but surprise! It was fine as well. The animals were so lifelike and I appreciated the authenticity of their design. I was nervous to see how songs were handled because of course they can't be entirely accurate to the animated version, but yet they did what they could and still go their point across. The magic of the movie was not lost, and I loved sharing this with my family. We all laughed, we all cried, and we will all enjoy both versions for years to come. My biggest complaint is that I did miss Jeremy Irons as Scar, but Ejiofor still did a great job and brought new personality to the character. I am totally pleased with the renewing of my favorite movie for 24 years, and look forward to more retellings of my favorite stories.",The Lion King

But it was a big, big, big disappointment.The only things I genuinely enjoyed about this movie were James Earl Jones' reprisal of Mufasa (I actually cried a little when I heard his voice) and the stunning CGI. Everything else fell completely flat. The voice acting -- particularly Beyonce's role as Nala -- was absolutely horrendous. There was no emotion, no feeling, and I felt that she (+ 95% of the other actors) were simply reading the words vs. ACTING the words. Everything was spoken in the same kind of casual whispery tone that really broke the illusion of the movie and story and distracted me from an otherwise beautiful visual experience.If you can watch this movie for free (ie. through a streaming service) it's worth the watch just for the visuals, but not much else.",The Lion King

Most of the time, the characters seem to be empty shells unable to strike an emotional connect despite the ""superior"" graphics and visuals it incorporates. In spite of this it does, the movie provides a number of instances that causes goosebumps/ shivers down my spine and almost leading me to tears. Bring a remake, alterations to certain scenes provide a nice addition of humour that works well in the movie's favour. Hans Zimmer has given this movie an amazing carry with his OST, compensating for what the movie doesn't offer.

The CGI and the incredible attention to detail give this movie at least a 5/10. When it comes to the movie being ""emotionless"" like many people before me have stated, that just didn't resonate with me. Yes, it is a lot easier to show more emotion with cartoons like the original but when it comes to live action, the animals were portrayed exactly how they should have been. I think a lot of the disconnect comes with most other movies not staying as true to the live action title.

The animation is beautiful - the animals look so real. Some of the voices are a little disappointing but that's mainly because the originals were so individual and strong. I thought it was a little over long for younger children; my 7 year old was more intererested in his drink and my 12 year old was bored.
My favourite character is Musafa. Especially with the original voice actor. I always get the shivers watching the opening scene and the music is fantastic throughout the film.

They made the exact amount of changes and in the right way to maintain all the real classic lion king. Even the discography was absolutely incredible. They didn't add any new songs or different plots that you wouldn't recognize and fail the point of making a remake. By far the best remake Disney has given us cause that's the point, to watch the movie you've been watching for many years but with a little extra special effects and a plus upgrade from nowadays technology but having the same feelings you have when you watch the classic.

2766,mlightunicorn,A complete and utter disappointment.,1,13 August 2019,"**SPOILER ALERT**
I was so looking forward to watching this, because the animated cartoon was one of my favourites from Disney. It started out promising, and then as it continued on, I started dreading what was going to come. The character's voices lacked depth, and feeling. It was almost like they were sick of saying the lines over and over - the moments between Mufasa and Simba felt emotionless. Zazu was turned into a complete idiot, he was no longer the lovable snob we saw in the animated version. I hated Nala - Beyonce was the worst possible choice for her, not even sure why she was included in this movie. The songs were boring because once again, emotion was lacking; Beyonce's song made no sense because it simply didn't match the rest of the score, and her rendition of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was cringe-worthy. The original score was amazing, but was used at the wrong moments for this movie, so once again, this ruined scenes that I was looking forward to. Hakuna Matata was completely spoilt because they changed the lyrics, it wasn't charming anymore, it just ended up being disgusting. Also, Timon's accent is one you cannot forget from the cartoon, nothing can replace that voice - why they would fail to include proper voice actors is beyond me. The original voice actors were perfect, and this version was a massive fail (I'm sad to say that even Mufasa sounded very emotionless... he just wasn't the same, and he didn't seem to be as majestic). So for those of you looking to watch a good version of the Lion King - just stick to the original, because this movie has nothing on that.",The Lion King

2768,acdragonx,Beauty Isn't Everything,3,26 July 2019,"The good first: The visuals here are nothing short of amazing and Seth Rogen made me laugh a couple times. That's about it here, nothing more to see.The bad: Nothing is totally bad here either, although I'll just say that for me Beyonce's songs were very out of place. My brain simply refused to believe that her voice fit into this world in any real way.Now the meh: Unfortunately nearly everything else falls almost totally flat. I wasn't bothered by the loss of character facial expressions others have cited, the near shot-for-shot reproduction, or the majority of the musical changes (other than Beyonce, see above). The issue for me was mostly with the absence of feeling throughout and I'm not even sure what to point at for a reason.in contrast, I still get emotionally invested whenever rewatching the original, despite seeing it probably a couple dozen times over the years. I have also been to see The Lion King Broadway show twice and look forward to going again in the future. These two productions of the story are, for lack of a better word, timeless.This version of the story; however, didn't elicit any kind of emotional response. All I ended up feeling was disappointment that Disney hadn't simply re-released the original in theaters again instead or that I wasn't at the Broadway show again.",The Lion King

Having watched the movie (at the very least) once a week till I was the age of 6, I can assure you this movie did not disappoint. It was extremely realistic, and everything I would have hoped for as a kid. Having Beyoncé and Childish Gambino play the two main characters added a lot of extra taste to the soundtrack. See the movie for yourself. It will allow you to reminisce on the good old Disney days. It is a truly amazing movie, and the amount of hard work that was put into it shows in the opening scene. Although this movie was incredible, it will never top the original Lion King.",The Lion King
2774,LobbyLoiterer,A Different Look for a New Generation,10,19 July 2019,"*Spoilers* tag, because you never know.This was admittedly a bizarre experience because the movie really is a shot-for-shot, almost word-for-word remake of the 1994 animated film. It's very similar to the Beauty and the Beast remake, except for some pretty significant differences: Whereas Beauty and the Beast didn't work because the style was gaudy and the story changes were confusing and convoluted, The Lion King's style is gorgeous and natural, and all the story changes only work to make it stronger (for the most part).With the goal of The Lion King being to remake the original story for a new audience with a new look, it succeeds on just about every level. It beautifully captures the emotion and the heart of the original story, and you can tell everyone working on it had great respect for the source material. It feels like watching a stage show you know by heart, just with a different cast and set than you've seen before.The animation is next-level in a way that was unthinkable 25 years ago. It really is like watching some kind of modern Homeward Bound or Babe, only here they were able to avoid stubborn animal acting by just animating the entire animal. While they had to abandon the flexibility of old-fashioned elaborated animated facial expressions, they did an excellent job getting the emotion across in the way the animals actually would in real life. The way they hold themselves is so natural and normal that it really does feel like you're watching some kind of strange nature documentary where the animals can talk and sing.The weakest part of the film is how they incorporated some of the music from the original. Most of the songs work, and I really like how they adapted ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"", considering just how much they needed to change. But ""Be Prepared"" really felt shoehorned in due to fan backlash at its omittance, and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was just poorly handled all around. The scene comes out of nowhere with no build-up, and the entire thing takes place *during the day*. I was thinking maybe they just didn't know how to make it look good in a pitch-black jungle, until they actually did a night scene and it looked great. No idea what they were thinking.But as a whole, the movie works. There's going to be a whole new generation of kids experiencing this beautiful, important story in a way that we could never have imagined at their age. I'm very happy this movie exists, and I'm happy that it was handled so well. And if this just isn't your thing, then the original still exists and is readily available.",The Lion King
2775,bthesea,Too real to relate to,7,24 July 2019,"The movie itself is a master piece in terms of design and technology. It is as if they cast the animals to perform in the nature. However, for a plot most of us know in details, it is too real to relate to. I was bored and wondering how time will pass watching a wildlife documentary which I already know the plot! Maybe Disney should stop recreating our childhood sweet memories and leave them as they are!",The Lion King

The animals all looked beautiful but carried no expressions nor emotions whatsoever, which really hurt and diminished the story and its events.Absolute realism doesn't suit this movie since it has the exact same plot as the original, which was strongly based on emotions.Jon Favreau really should start directing wildlife documentaries though",The Lion King
2778,tremblettben,Awful.,1,26 July 2019,"I went in with an open mind, but as soon as I saw Scar with the mouse and he said his first line I knew I was going to hate it. One of Scar's best lines ""Long live the king"" was absolutely butchered, the delivery felt rushed, and emotionless. The voice acting for almost the entire cast sucked a lot. I liked Donald Glover as Simba a lot actually, and Seth Rogan as Pumbaa wasn't really here nor there, didn't hate it but didn't love it either. Even James Earl Jones didnt perform very well, and he was the orginal Mufasa. A lot of the lines from the original felt like they were thrown in there in a spot that made them sound forced and just not right to me. I ended up leaving when I saw they took out Simba and Rafiki's talk...you know, the one that makes him go back to pride rock while simultaneously teaching him he shouldn't run from his past but learn from it instead. I was also really dissapointed with the music, I couldnt sing along how I ised to. While it looked stunning, literally everything else was lacking, there was none of that Disney Magic in this remake.",The Lion King

You will find yourself throughout convinced that real animals were used. The film is funny, sad, tense, everything that the original was. I was very pleased to see the storyline remaining almost identical as it's not a plot that should be messed with.If I was forced to find fault, then I would say some of the voicing could have been cast better. On occasion it felt very slightly rushed in some of the scripting, but this is probably more of a case of expecting it to be identical to the original, and any newbies to it wouldn't notice.I would happily watch this again and again and again. I've seen a few of the Disney remakes and this is definitely the best one yet!",The Lion King
2780,hey_ladd,Pointless,5,3 August 2019,"Pretty to look at, but completely pointless.No reason for the film to exist. It brought nothing new, yet didn't live up to the original (in anything other than animation/cinematography).
If they had of simply re-released the original, I still would have taken my kids.
Or they could have used the original audio track with the new animation. I'd watch that.
But this new film was completely uninspired.(This is actually my first movie review... I've never bothered before... There are fair, thoughtful reviews already out there... But I felt compelled to say how pointless this film was.)

There's no need to be worried about it for a story like The Lion King. The characters need more emotional expression and, despite CGI is very impressive, the movie probably fell into the uncanny valley. I still prefer watching the 2D animation because it's much more convincing.I have the feeling that some people (specially some influencers) deny the fact that the movie makes us a bit uncomfortable. Maybe the love for the original animation made people to accept this dissonance.I watched the Brazilian version with dubbed voices and at least the voice actors of Timon and Pumba did a great job.It's still worthy to watch this movie, but it could be better.",The Lion King

2786,bratcipheo,Pretty good in Danish Dub,8,9 August 2019,"At first I was worried when i watched the movie in Danish, and not english. But after reading a lot of reviews, i was apparently fortunate.
Many of the original voice actors of the first lion king voiced this one again, so it was a pleasant familiarity. With the lines presented well and with emotion, the movie felt delivered well and I would give it a 9. There were a few pacing missteps and missed opportunities for it not to become a 10. Such as lack of comedy etc.The reason I gave it an 8 instead, is only because of the changed desert run song. Instead of the epic piece from the original that underscored the emotion of ""coming of age/accepting ones responsibility/accepting who you are"" really well, they used a super lame ""spirit"" song. It ruined it.So overall, this movie may not be as bad in non-english speaking countries, where the dub is superior.",The Lion King

2790,heinpotas,A visual masterpiece... that falls apart at its heart,2,9 August 2019,"Visually, it is a true masterpiece and a technical wonder! It really looks like Disney stole some footage from a National Geographic Lion special.Unfortunately, this is where the praises end for me.
Knowing that the ""realistic"" approach will severely limit facial expressions and somewhat curb body language, I knew that they would have to double down on the dialog and its delivery in order to fully convey the character's state.
I was sorely disappointed when even James Earl Jones sounded like he was reading his lines with a gun to his head.
NONE of the characters delivered their lines with any emotion!
Except Timon and Pumbaa as Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner famously recorded their dialogs in the same booth. As a result, their interactions felt real and natural.
Whereas everyone else's dialog felt robotic, stale and out of context as their interactions were clearly spliced together from multiple recordings.Byoncé (God bless the queen) is a phonemal performer, but as a voice actor, she only dragged Nala's presence down to hell.
Donald Glover gave a cardboard box performance as Simba and their rendition of ""Can you feel the love tonight"" was painful to listen to as, together, they had as much harmony as a bunch of kindergarteners singing Happy Birthday at a birthday party.The biggest disappointment was that they cut out Rafiki's lesson about dealing with the past, but felt the need to pad the film with extra and often unnecessary extended scenes.Do not expect your kids (or you) to fall in love with this adaptation, tonight.",The Lion King

2795,mr_oreocookie,Just the right amount of expectations,8,19 July 2019,"Contrary to what most critics are saying, I find this remake impressive and true to the original. I rewatched the original animation to refresh my mind of every scene and this remake recreated important scenes shot per shot, same blocking and dialogue. It bank on nostalgia. I'm glad they didn't change or twist the plot as what other remakes' cases. They just enhanced what has already been a beautiful film. I don't complain about animals should show more emotion. That's how these animals behave in real world scenario, less the required verbal mumbling. John Favreau is referencing the style from ""Babe"" and other films using live animals as actors. You don't wanna see an animal drooling eyes or smirking. The talking is already enough. Those complaining about Scar should have a darker mane, in reality, lions with darker mane have more sex appeal to lionesses, making them the choiced leader of the pride. Thus, the character design opts in a grungy and malnourished looking Scar. The only couple of things I don't like is the Mufasa's death scene, where they could give an extra couple of minutes for the voice actors to express sadness so for audience to sink in the emotional scene. It was delivered too fast. Also, the hyenas could do more laughing, like literally LOL.",The Lion King

One thing I was truly looking forward to was the soundtrack, but it truly missed the mark, ESPECIALLY when Nala and Simba sang, ""Can you feel the love tonight.""

The cinematography and production is next to none. I continue to see people criticising the film for its lack of emotion, and all I have to say is this is rubbish. People simply cannot empathise or feel emotions for animals. You can see and feel the emotion in the voice acting, and given that animals don't react in the same manner humans do, it's self explanatory that they won't be displaying the same array of emotions shown in the animated version. Many improvements people recommended are to give the animals humanistic features, which again shows how little people can emote to animals, and that the only conceivable way for people to feel emotions towards animals is to make them look like humans. People's lack of empathy is hardly a criticism of this truly great film, showcasing the broad possibilities that can be reached with technology.",The Lion King

It's not necessarily the voice acting that lets the movie down, but the script and delivery are very poor.My advice, just watch the cartoon.

I am impressed by how much CGI has been developed but it was the first time ever I've wanted to walk out of the theater during a movie. The original movie is one of my most favorite Disney movies ever made and ever since I saw the trailer I said that this would turn out awful and so it did.

It feels like this territory of 'live action' and this kind of material just does not work. Singing real looking lions is a hard sell in anyone's book but yeah - it doesn't hit the mark at all.Much of the dialogue feels very weak. Some of the lines are terrible. 'Lions!

2815,echristensen-02908,"Visually stunning, emotional flatline. Pretty packaging and no heart.",2,7 September 2019,"This movie was a marvel in how far CGI technology has come, and the artistry and sheer work that goes into creating an entirely CGI photorealistic movie.That being said, choosing what is essentially known as ""Disney's Hamlet,"" a deeply emotionally resonating, musical storytelling masterpiece as the one film to showcase how you can make a lion look exactly like a lion, down to the movement of individual hairs and light dynamics, was a huge mistake. People didn't love the original Lion King because it had lions, any more than they loved Beauty and the Beast because it had anthropomorphized dancing candlesticks in it.They loved and respected that Disney could tell fundamentally human stories with characters that were not themselves human, and use music and animation to channel the heart and soul of these characters directly into those of the audience. The lions were designed to have more human features, to express those emotions, and animation filled in the gaps of what was not physically possible. RESPECT THE FORMAT OF 2D ANIMATED STORYTELLING, AND STOP TRYING TO FILE CONVERT IT TO CGI.Nobody cared that the lions don't look exactly like lions, because they were too enthralled in the storytelling and what they're feeling to care. Taking away the emotional heart of the movie with characters that don't emote in a way audiences can identify with flatlined this movie.I watched this movie as part of a double feature, with Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, because they had cheap tickets for Labour Day weekend. I watched OUATIH first, and the Lion King after, because sometimes Tarantino can be a little heavy, and I thought watching a childhood favourite would be a nice light way to end the evening. Boy, was I wrong. Once Upon A Time was such a great movie, fun and gripping and surprisingly laugh-out-loud hilarious, and then to go into this movie, which just undid everything the original did, killed my buzz and made me sit there in stunned silence for the majority of the movie, pondering what the original filmmakers could have done to deserve this treatment.""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" didn't even take place at night?! Wtf. And definitely not the right song for vocal gymnastics, Beyonce. Flex on the strength of your gorgeous pipes, not practice scales.I miss the days when Disney used mostly unknown voice talent and Broadway talents, making stars, instead of paying out a ton of money to big-name celebrities, who can't even sing, or whose singing don't fit the character. I'm looking at you, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and your spoken-word ""Be Prepared"" .... poem? Makes me think of Lindsey Ellis' youtube vid about Disney vs Robin Williams, and how this whole accursed trend started.I love the fact that they are actually trying to represent characters by casting actors of appropriate ethnic backgrounds. Representation is important!! But damn, what about all the fantastic actors of African descent that have absolutely crushed the stage productions of the Lion King? How was the role of Timon given to Billy Eichner without so much as an audition, when Tituss Burgess literally had a whole storyline on Kimmy Schmidt about being in a bootleg version of the Lion King? Aside from being an openly gay, talented Broadway star, like another certain Timon we know?Honestly, I wanted to see this film in theatres, because I knew the CGI was going to be stunning, and 50-foot screens really deliver on that end. I just wasn't prepared for the emotional fallout and sense of betrayal I was left with all the way through this. I can't imagine how the original filmmakers feel, especially when all their hard work is being copy/pasted into a new movie, and they're probably not seeing a dime.I was going to give this a 4, but after all this, I think it's going down to 2.

2816,wakka-58639,"+5 story/cinematics , -5 emotion/voice",5,20 July 2019,"THE SPOILER ALERT IS AT THE BOTTOM AND IS NOTED BEFORE READING FURTHERSo this is the first review I've ever done for a movie.. and I've seen a LOT!
if you're going to watch this, and hope to see the original story and beautiful cinematic's, then you'll love this. However if you're hoping to walk out of the theater with a smile on your face and say ""omg they nailed it!"", instead you will be walking out disappointed and wonder why Disney didn't even try to put effort into the emotion and voice. Other than Pumbaa, I felt like the entire movie was abridged, like a horrible voice over.I mean no disrespect for the actors/actresses who voiced the rolls, but Disney picked the incorrect cast for the voices. Simba has a voice that, at times, sounds somewhat natural.. but other times..like he's a Lion from the hood. Nala.. has absolutely NO country twang to her voice whatsoever. That cute little ""pinned ya"" and ""pinned ya again""... is no longer cute, and sounds like Beyoncé was reading the paper as she continued to voice the cub/lion. Some people liked Timon.. but I felt like the voice was stale and pieced sentences together. Also.. until I looked it up, I swore Timon sounded just like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. Mufasa was alright, but they could have picked someone who sounded more like the guy from State Farm to cover his voice. Scar.. I can't explain scar, but he didn't sound right.Simba - should have been a more clear.. straight American accented voice
Nala - should have been voiced by a country girl
Pumbaa - I have no complaints
Timon - should have fluently voiced the dialog
Timon's rule here also applies for NalaScar - just weird----//SPOILER ALERT!--////So I don't remember Ed speaking in the original.. if so, wasn't much.When Nala pins Simba, in the original, Simba ends up on his back, with her paws on his chest. How hard is this to duplicate? He ended up each time turned sideways with her paw pinned on his cheekZazu never got put into his cage singing the coconuts and Pumbaa never did his hula hoop thing.The way Scar reveals the truth that he really killed Mufasa is done differently.",The Lion King

I like that the director stayed true to the original, but added his little subtle spins here and there. Timon and Pumba are still the stars.

2822,afmercier,Stunningly beautiful! Horrible screenplay! Just DON'T!,1,22 July 2020,"First I want to say this, I just saw the Aladdin remake and loved it! So, I am not a hater of the new Disney ""live"" action remakes.First of all, let me say, the movie is just stunning. No, it is not colorful and yes maybe it it has just a bit too much dust and grime but, it looks great! The animation is gorgeous! This is the only reason for a star. CGI has come a long way! And of course the score is good because, they had a great score to begin with. The look of the movie is also good because it is shot almost exactly, scene for scene, like the original.So many people have already posted reviews detailing how bad it is so, I will add my two cents about it in ways that others have erred, in my opinion, or missed.I must be the only one to hate the changes to Timon and Pumba. I am a big Seth Rogen fan, maybe I was expecting too much. These two characters brought in so much wonderful humor to the original and here they just didn't. I did not laugh at any of the jokes. And where Timon, in the original, stops Pumba from saying farted, he doesn't, and some poorly timed line comes next with a not so funny fart. So Disney now thinks that farts are more funny than excellent writing complemented by comedic timing. The duo had chemistry in this film but, they were not funny. It seems like the screenwriter, Jeff Nathanson, wanted to make sure that Timon and Pumba didn't steal the show this time??? I want to give credit though where I believe credit is due, I enjoyed the ""Be Our Guest"" substitution for the hula scene. It was unexpected and very funny, in my opinion. And, I guess politically correct. I actually laughed at that almost as much as I laughed at the original sequence.I am not going to beat on the Beyoncé horse too much here. I did not hate her nearly as much as many others have. BUT that line, ""Lions attack!,"" was bad. It was just horrible. That line really should go down as one of the worst lines ever written. Like seriously, did that have to be said. There were other lines in that scene that were just not needed but, that one is the absolute worst. That line was so sophomoric it is freshmanic. I had to make up a new word for that line. Did the other lionesses really NEED her to tell them to attack? I do believe they knew that on their own. Well, maybe they did need that to be said, because they forgot what their job was anyway. Notice how they weren't doing the hunting? Scar was. In the original, Scar even tells the hyenas that, ""It is the lionesses' job to do the hunting."" People, get over this feminist thing, in nature the lionesses really do all the hunting, not the lions. This is one time that the girl power is real and already there and you changed it. They, the lionesses, aren't cooking and cleaning for the man, they provide for the pride.Anyway, as long as this was, I want to repeat that my review is not exhaustive. I am only adding to the long list of reasons why I wish this film hadn't been made.People please, just don't watch it. It is not good and might tarnish your feelings about the original. It is wonderfully animated, that is it.** This is to Disney directly... If you are going to make a remake of a favorite film and make it almost identical to the first, DON'T take out the best lines. Leave the good lines in! IDK I'm just saying.....",The Lion King

We've watched a lot of kids movies with our daughter, but for some reason, we hadn't seen the original Lion King. So we watched it recently and none of us were impressed! We'd been expecting something great given everything we'd heard about it but we found it kind of lame, honestly. It felt dated and the music didn't hit home for us. (FWIW, My husband played in the Lion King orchestra on broadway for a year, so he knew the music from that and loved the broadway version) I thought this version had more emotional weight.

The dialogue between Scar and Sarabi about Sarabi becoming his queen. What purpose does it serve? It hinted that they may had a love triangle between the brothers and Sarabi, but that was never mentioned before or after.2. While it filled in the hole on how Nala left the Pride Lands to find help.

However over all there was a mismatching of casting and (i don't know if this was just me) the songs felt shorter. When Mufasa dies, even that was very meh...I waited for it to get me as the original did, but it was all cut short.

and i will explain the good points and the bad points about this movie
#The good things:
1-sooo much nostalgia from the music of hans Zimmer even after that slight change they made to it
2-the movie is the same story but you really will feel that you are watching a different movie except some scenes which are iconic from the original movie which was extremely important to include them in the new movie and they made these scenes soo good.
3-the remake of the stamped scene was unbelievable.. magnificent..gorgeous..it really made me cry and gave me a lot of emotions and goosebumps from Simba's fear and the death of mufasa.
4-scar's character is soooo different from the original one..he is a real criminal..sullen.. spiteful.. malevolent..he will make you really hate that devil unlike scar of the original movie who was really criminal but funny and you have to love him
5-a different taking of scenes made me feel that iam waiting for what will happen in each scene although i know the story..which made me feel good and excited through the whole movie.
#the bad things:
*-that movie is sooo real..so they passed up some entertaining and gorgeous things from original movie just to make it just real (by the way if you deal with that movie as real action that will not be a problem with you).
# At the end i wanna say that the movie is so real even more over the entertainment..but they made it extremely good with reality",The Lion King

The few songs from the animated version and the show that were not sung were not missed as the staging was perfect and the music of those songs was played in the background. The emotions ran high - everyone in the theater was crying and laughing and clapping just as it was in the theaters for the animated version and the Broadway show. The inclusion of several bars of Mozart's Requiem at Mufasa's death was absolute genius! And I loved the portion of Beyonce's new song ""Spirit"" - it really fit the scene.

2862,mccammy,A Technically Incredible Disaster,2,30 July 2019,"The Lion King remake follows the exact same story the original does, revolving around the character of Simba, a lion who after tragedy strikes, is fed lies and is forced to flee and never return to his homeland.A reoccurring theme from Disney lately has been to remake some of their most beloved animated classics into live action films. While there has been a debate as to whether The Lion King (2019) is live action or not, it certainly appears that way due to the highly impressive animation. And while it is undoubtedly incredibly impressive, it's also one of its biggest flaws.Some of the greatest aspects of the original Lion King were the character designs and the small mannerisms each of them had which made all of them original in their own right. However all of that is stripped away here, due to the stale animation which closely resembles a nature documentary. Nothing against nature documentaries, however the decision to go into freakishly detailed animation takes away the energy and heart of the original, leaving us with a soulless and dull feature film filled with characters who cannot display any kind of emotion.Even the performances from the very talented cast are almost entirely lacklustre, although it is admittedly a tough task to bring any kind of life or character to the roles, again due to the stale animation. An exception to this were Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner who play Pumbaa and Timon respectively. They do their best and if nothing else bring a slight amount of comedy.The Lion King (2019) will almost certainly make a lot of money at the box office which in all honesty is a worry. To reiterate, the technical achievement of this film is remarkable, however for me this was not the right way to go about remaking it, not that it should have been remade at all. To be honest I fear Disney may continue to remake these fan favourite films in an effort to squeeze any remaining money from their franchises that are so precious to so many.To conclude, just watch the original.",The Lion King

Timon and Pumba were PERFECT, but not quite sure about Beyoncé's performance. I didn't hear Nala, but Beyoncé. That's the reason I'm giving an 8.

The Lion King was a movie I watched everyday during my child hood and I was so amazed by the new graphics and how amazing the story was that I literally cried during almost the whole movie because I was so happy they didn't ruin it. Those complaining that all the lions looked the same, well I could easily tell them apart they literally looked like their cartoons but realistic obviously, or maybe that was just me because I've watched the original like 600 times. If there had to be flaws, it would be some unnecessary scenes that were just filler chapters and Beyoncé slightly oversinging Nala's parts, they didn't need to be so extravagant but honestly that doesn't take away from the movie at all. Go see the movie and decide for yourself because this rating doesn't give it justice.",The Lion King
2866,rupalikespie,Shocking flat. Lacked any emotion. Completely overhyped,1,29 July 2019,"The CGI in this is incredible, it's mesmerising and beautiful. But that's all it is, is beautiful cgi, they've completely lost sight of the story, the emotion and the magic. It's so boring, the focus has been so much on keeping this photo realistic, that everything else has been forgotten about. They've cut numbers, when Mufasa dies you feel nothing because the characters aren't showing any emotion and none of the acting is convincing. Really badly cast. The fur is so intricate, especially the attention to detail when it get's wet, it's very very telling where the money has gone from the get go.",The Lion King

However, when I saw the number of negative reviews on THIS movie, I knew I had to clarify something. No, the characters don't show much emotion through facial expressions, but we have to remember, that is what follows making a live action movie based on ANIMALS, they don't show emotion the same way humans do through facial expressions, the animals show much emotion through body language. The emotion lies all in the PLOT itself, the way they have constructed the movie is beautiful and it really does move you in ways NO other Disney ""re-make"" has done so far, not even close. The movie is a golden masterpiece! Come ON guys! Yes, you have your right to express what you found to be disappointing about the movie, but that one thing you didn't like about it, should NOT be a reason to drag the ENTIRE movie down, as there were oh so many positive sides about it. You guys need to calm down with your 3s and 4s on this one, because it is worth so much more. This is how I, personally, feel about the it.",The Lion King
2868,kusialma,A good movie,8,20 July 2019,"I think we can all agree that the movie is visually stunning and some of the scenes were just absolutely magical. No more needed to say about the visuals.I don't understand why people keep saying they ""forgot to animate the emotions"", I did see the emotions. You don't expect a lion to cry do you? Maybe they were a bit more subtle than in the original but they definitely were there.I think a lot of these negative reviews are driven by the ""the original is my childhood favorite and the best so this remake MUST be crap"" mindset.There were also negative things about the movie of course. One of the things that bothered me were the voiceactors. Honestly casting Beyonce as Nala was a mistake in my opinion. Other voiceactors were mediocre/good and the singing sings weren't bad either. Maybe except for the ""can you feel the love tonight"" song, just sounded a bit weird in my ears.I'm not sure why but I cried through out the whole movie and it really hit me in the feels. All in all, a good movie and I recommend going to watch in the cinema so you get to see the CGI in all it's glory.",The Lion King
2869,andrewken93,A bit meh,5,18 July 2019,"10/10 for visual effects. 1/10 for originality. And a meak 5/10 for everything inbetween.
Quite clearly in the efforts of creating a visual masterpiece, there has been a sacrifice in humour and story. Apart from a few relative fresh scenes from timone and pumba, it seems that the other characters had to be stripped back to achieve pure realism. Perhaps this could have been saved by the music and artists singing the classic songs, but a different and severely shortened take on 'Be Prepared' and the choice to keep the musical hit 'He lives in you' omitted leaves the music falling short also. Worthwhile to see for the visual effects alone, but don't bother comparing it to the 1994 original.",The Lion King

So it seems those working on this film have done their homework & studied the movements & each hair of every animal on the screen & there are a lot of them showing up at one time. So along with a story-line that keeps you watching the screen, this is one movie that is very well done & seems so real at times it just may scare the younger children, not like the 1st Lion King!

2874,mthdude,Can photorealistic animals convey emotions?,8,27 July 2019,"Can photorealistic animals convey emotions?...This was the question I had in my mind when I went to watch The lion king .
The answer was a bag of mixed feelings.
Coming to the storyline there is nothing new .It's exact copy paste of Classic.They have aborted some scenes from older version ,why did they do that?
I hope there was little more to story.They could have told the same story in a different way without losing its soul.Each and every scene seems to be a copy paste.
But this time they are realistic.
The one problem with realistic animals is we will not understand the facial expressions .
I think that was okay for me .But when the emotions are less they should have added some more to story so they could have proved even without facial expressions story could be conveyed,because we all love animals.
For me the new version moved so quick.
But for me the reason for seeing the movie the CGI.
It's marvelous.The photorealistic animation seems so real that you will start noticing each and every details.Its massive ,minblowing.You start thinking how technology improved in these years.It will give you the same feel when you watched Avatar for the first time.You will forget everything and involved in this new imaginary realistic world.I do agree that there is nothing new with the storyline but movie is worth watching for its graphics.It feels fresh and new.",The Lion King

2880,elmarschroder,Blew my expectations out of the water.,9,29 July 2019,"""Comparison is the thief of joy."" - Theodore RooseveltFirst of all, I am probably the biggest Lion King fan on this planet (self-proclaimed). I'm your typical '93 kid. Seeing my childhood memories coming to life and being recreated in a new and creative manner is something that I could never have dreamed of. When it comes to the Lion King, this was the live remake I was the most excited for.My unpopular opinion: it was SUCH a great film. I went into the movie not expecting it to be exactly the same as the animation, and wanted to watch it as a film by itself. I went to go see it with an open mind. I did not want to watch it, and compare it to the original. I think that's the key in watching these remakes.Overall, most people seem to be critiquing (complaining about) the ""emotionless"" characteristics of the animals. Personally, it did not affect my viewing experience at all. One could still feel the emotion, and feel the mood of every scene. If the animals were portrayed any other way, it would have felt awkward and unnatural in the ""live world"" that the team created. Especially in the ""real life world"" - it would not have suit the narrative. If you wanted to see unnatural emotions and expressions, then rather go watch the animation again. The cinematography compensates for these ""lack of emotions"", and creates a beautiful atmosphere that pulls you right into the story.For me, my only critique would be the character-design of Scar. I think that, visually, he wasn't up to scratch. The absence of his signature black hair and more prominent scar on the face made him fade a bit.All in all, I was absolutely mind-blown, and I have already seen it twice. People were tearing up during the Mufasa scene. People were SINGING the songs they heard when they grew up. I was very pleased with this live adaption of The Lion King, and would advise everyone to go watch it for themselves, and appreciate the fine art that was created.",The Lion King
2881,csksterner,No magic,1,23 February 2020,Loved the original and kept an open mind about this remake. Beautiful cinematography but that was the ONLY redeeming factor.

2885,iacobus_maior,"Great visuals (with a huge downside), but misses the heart and charm of the original.",6,18 July 2019,"I don't know exactly what I expected and I also don't know how to really evaluate the film. First of all: the film actually looks excellent. The animals all look close to reality and it looks more like a film with real animals as actors than an animated film. That was it, however, with the positive changes worth mentioning, whereby even these monumental visuals have its downsides (see below).
The movie sticks very close to the original and offers only small differences, which negatively influence the overall picture. While the ""real""-movie of the Jungle Book is, in my opinion, quite well done and skillfully changes the story of the cartoon to a more mature tone, we actually have exactly the same story with the Lion King, but which is told in the dialogues in a more rushed and emotionless way.
For example, the opening sequence is taken exactly frame by frame from the cartoon, which I actually found a successful introduction and fully felt the nostalgia. Already during the first dialogue between Scar and Mufasa it becomes clear what the movie will miss all the time: the emotional connection to the characters. The crux is that you can put more emotional facial expression in a drawn lion's face than in a ""real"" lion's face. Furthermore, the old voice actors were all better for me, which can also be due to the dialogues, which remain almost identical, but are delivered in a different way, or to the fact that they get some small, but sensitive cuts.
The film is therefore optically a hit, but the few changes it undergoes make it almost exclusively worse compared to the original. Only a few new scenes around Scar's reign as king and the design of Timon and Pumbaa and their jungle friends I find well done.
Otherwise, the film doesn't come close to the charm and magic of the original as expected. Of course, it's possible to watch an already known movie in the cinema, if you want. Apart from the changed production values it doesn't offer anything new.
I would argue that if the film would be released today without the existence of the original, it wouldn't go down in history as the best Disney film and most successful Disney film ever created. The differences in the dialogues may seem small, but they have serious effects on the character drawing and thus the emotional connection to the characters, that made Mufasa's death so traumatic for many viewers back in the day.",The Lion King
2886,mkimb-98766,Disappointing,3,30 July 2019,"Before watching the new lion king I tried to keep an open mind as I knew that it would be hard to live up to the original, however I was pleasantly surprised by Aladdin so I thought maybe I'm jumping to conclusions. Unfortunately It was a huge disappointment the only good points for this remake are the graphics and a few extra scenes with the lionesses which were a nice add on . The voice acting was flat, due to the graphics being so realistic you would think if anything the voices would be even larger as there is little visual emotion. Rafiki was not humorous at all and therefore lost a lot of his charm . Timone and pumba were probably the best but still at times the humour fell flat. Scar was boring . The Hyaenas were ok the lead female was a nice new addition going for a more sisnister character and less humorous, however the other hyaenas lost their charm they definitely tried to save a bit of laughter with a new take on them but this failed miserably . I feel that the script was all over the place it had many lines from the original with parts added in that either weren't necessary at all or they completely changed it apart from one line which made the lines less impactful it almost felt like they didn't bother re watching the original and just looked at the script took tiny snippets and thought that will do!. The biggest issue was the emotional response was just not there everything was over sang and my biggest annoyance had to be Beyoncé's new song in what I think is one of the most iconic moments of the original when simba is running back to pride rock the original gave me goosebumps and the music was perfect in the new one it's Beyoncé's own song spirit which doesn't fit at all and simba bumps into nala half way home like wtf ! Just no! . Lastly zazu and Marla accept that simba is simba far too quickly it's embarrassing! Considering they thought he was dead ! . I think that's the end of my rant really the only thing this film had going was the graphics and a few extra scenes that were interesting .",The Lion King
2887,nicholasoleary-45074,Fantastic remake,10,14 July 2019,"My first point is that the critics of this film are totally missing the point.

I've always been a fan of the Lion King. In recent years with the improvements with cgi I've never personally looked at the traditional animation the same way.
It's a fantastic story and I'm so pleased they have brought it up to date for the next generation.
The kids of today won't relate to the original animated films like they will with their counterparts. It was 25 years ago but time hasn't stood still since then.
The remake is visually stunning and not as childish in some ways as it's predecessor.

The result is that the real animals and their species are more limited at expressing emotions and movements and the colorful cartoony musicals and scenarios that existed in the animation are now gone.

Going into this as an adult I wanted to see what it would become when those don't make any sense and we get down into reality.
A lot of people have bashed on the lack of facial expressions, but I felt otherwise (on top of this is if you wanna see how bad facial expressions would turn out on animals watch Netfilx Original Mowgli), though their faces were more realistic it was subtle changes in the eyes and twit hes of the moith that gave things away, really watch characters like Scar and you will see what I mean.

I thought the movie was flawless and absolutely wonderful! I loved it. The BEST movie I have seen this year and one of my favorites of all time. The animation, cinematography, and music are all beautiful and the story is elevated by the super realistic scenery. I love the original animated cartoon version so I don't want to compare the two. This one is it's own version, and I love them both.The animal's mouths don't move as much, nor are they as emotionally expressive as their cartoon versions, but this minor detail didn't bother me. It's supposed to look and feel like a more realistic version. It would have looked comical if they'd pushed mostly natural looking animal's facial expressions too far. I confess that I'm also a huge cat lover so seeing the adorably animated Simba and Nala on the big screen made me joyful.Critics just want to complain and pick apart something for the publicity of saying it isn't any good. Maybe I'm looking for different fare when I see a movie. I don't have kids of my own yet, I'm a millennial who grew it with the original, but I appreciate a painstakingly animated family-friendly movie that uplifted me. It's just enjoyable and I will see it again! This isn't just a Disney cash grab tapping into nostalgia as critics have said. I thought they offered enough new elements, like a new song, to make it their own without deviating too far from a classic story. The IMAX audience I watched this with cried and laughed together, and the middle part with the new song was powerful.Bottomline: Don't always listen to critics. Form your own opinion and don't miss out on seeing this great movie!",The Lion King
2916,noahswart-46294,Actually Liked It,10,13 August 2019,"Soo, a lot of people seem to put hate on this new movie, but I actually really enjoyed it.People are saying that the characters lacked any form emotion. I really felt connected to these characters, because they looked real. I think that that would've been different if there emotions were drastically animated.Also, the music was amazing!Overall, I really enjoyed seeing this movie in a fresh new style!",The Lion King

Won't give it a 10/10 review since I missed some of Rafiki's humor, but other than that I thought the movie was quite accurate to the original.Also: stunningly breathtaking CGI!",The Lion King
2919,cejkufabiola,Great movie,10,19 July 2019,"I see many criticising the movie, because it didn't seem like the original, while others claim that it looked so much like the original and that's why they didn't like it. Point is, no second part nor remake will ever match the original, not just in the case of this movie, but also in any other. To me it's really important that the key moments should have been there and yes, they were, which marked the movie. Everyone did a great job, I laughed, I cried, then I laughed again and the end cried yet again. It gave me incredible emotions and so many things were on point. Might get a bit of hate here of what I am about to say, but the thing is that no matter how much they tried to focus on Nala as Beyonce, she still couldn't top Glover's Simba.",The Lion King

It still got you in the feels and was just really well done! Slight improvements would be the voice of young Simba just wasn't as strong and impactful- and they took a bit of the humour away from some of the characters like Rafiki. Hard to really get the emotions out of the characters but as is expected to a degree with CGI

I'm an original lion king fan and this movie was freaking PERFECT. I didn't read any of those reviews because I imagine they're based on resentment rather than observation. People went into this movie expecting to hate it and came out of it with contempt. Not me - I laughed, cried (hard), sang - what is there not to love about this movie? People left 1-3 star reviews! Really? Haha, it was that poorly done? Get out of here - it was beautiful. The scenery was breathtaking. It was almost a shot for shot remake! James earl jones plays Mufasa again! People had told me the animals talking was kinda weird - I didn't think so. Their mouths moved just as I would have expected them too and I didn't find it weird at all. I can't wait to watch it again! Stop taking your entitled, nostalgic anger out on Disney, y'all are being ridiculous! Beyoncé wasn't hyped up too much - I forgot she was in it until Can you feel the love tonight!",The Lion King
2923,kirstybrain,"A more mature, darker take on the original.",10,19 July 2019,"I have always been a massive fan of the original Lion King, but I went into this not expecting a scene for scene remake. The live action is more mature, it's darker, it fleshes out parts the original skipped over, and gave significance to the insignificant.
I've seen a lot of people complain about the lack of emotion, and while I agree there was less emotion to facial expressions, there was a lot more emotion in the character's actions, their minor movements, and the way they held themselves. I am personally glad they didn't go too cartoonish with the facial expressions, as it would've taken away from the realism.
I recommend going in with an open mind, and the understanding that this is more mature than its animated predecessor.",The Lion King
2924,thecarrollsatoz,Perfect Live Action REMAKE,10,22 August 2019,"The opening, circle of life was PERFECT. SHOT FOR SHOT. I loved that the film makers didn't change something that was already amazing and iconic. If it ain't broke don't fix it. It's so fun, as a 90s baby to watch a beloved çhildhood movie and it not be ruined (*Alladin). The feels were real. The songs still just as catchy and exactly like the OG. Loved Beyonce's additions and Timon and pumbas add lib. So happy. Will be going back to see.",The Lion King

2927,peteygsounds-09626,"I just left asking ""why did they even try?""",2,20 July 2019,"Seriously given how timelessly classic the original is, was there really any need to do it with more ""realistic"" graphics?A constant issue throughout the film is that the human emotion of the lines is lost when the realistic looking animal faces are unable to reflect what the dialogue is trying to deliver, purely because if they did over-animate to move like a human face would, then it would look corny and lose the realism.As an unfortunate side-effect of the dialogue and facial animation not matching up, some of the dialogue feels forced and as though the actors were just not feeling it.As many others have mentioned, a lot of moments from the original have been cut, some of which were my favourite parts of the original, but also parts that gave important context to inform certain character decisions. As a result of this there are moments where a character seems to jump too quickly to a decision or reaction without enough context to back up why, and these moments lose their immersiveness.I'll leave it there, but suffice to say that I left deeply underwhelmed, and I'll need to rewatch the original to remind myself why I love it.",The Lion King
2928,brendan-90465,Gd adaptation just lacking Disney magic,4,24 July 2019,"If ur gonna do a live action remake if. Classic, try to keep the original voices or have some peoe who can portray as good as the original, no co edy/emotion. Jeremy Irons even wanted the Scar role, but went to someone who couldn't make the role his own, just let it down. Whoopi was definitely missed as the head hyena. Don't forget Beyonce..... 😳 😳, it seemed to be her limelight, simba meeting nyala scene messed up with her song/singing... 😳 Ic your doing this, respect the original",The Lion King

Why are you going then? Don't you want some things to be different. These are suppose to be realistic animals people. Animals don't flip around and smile! I thought the movie was just like the original but with a few parts added. I laughed, cried, and my heart raced at a few moment even though I knew the storyline from a kid. I loved they added the extra scene how Nala escaped which they never explained in animated. A few comment said you couldn't tell animals apart. Helloooo there is a big scar on his face and definitely a lot uglier than Simba! I think if you go into this movie expecting it to be horrible then don't bother. Exactly same movie. So enjoy 90's generation! That's what's up",The Lion King
2930,margaagenbag,Biggest disappointment of my life!,2,27 November 2020,"Growing up The Lion King was one of my favourite movies. I must've watched it a thousand times. I know the dialogue off by heart and every single word of every single song. It had humour, heart, intelligent dialogue, a fantastic soundtrack & amazing voice acting. I had such high hopes for the remake. I mean they had amazing actors, Jon Favreau directing and James Earl Jones as Mufasa! Alas, the only thing this version has going for it is that it looks spectacular. It's like the only thing they were focusing on were to make it look good and didn't care about the rest. Everything that made the first movie great has been left out of this one. The jokes fall flat, the dialogue has been dumbed down and the voice actors seem to have been chosen for their musicality not their acting skills. The only saving grace of the movie is John Oliver as Sazu who gives back a little bit of the heart of the story. And Pumba and Timon is not too bad either.
If you're a big fan of the original, DO NOT waste your time watching this version!",The Lion King
2931,pauldoherty-03228,Ignore the 1 out of 10 reviews.,10,28 July 2019,"Have to admit took my 8 year old to this and was not expecting to enjoy it. Not being a fan of the original or the story which I read to my child many times, I have to say I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it. The visuals are a technical masterpiece, the original and vital soundtrack remains, the heartfelt circle of life story is told beautifully and the humour from pumba and Timon saves it from feeling like a lecture on life.If you love the original and ain't gonna give this a fair chance, then do yourself a favour and don't watch it only to say it's not as good as the original.",The Lion King
2932,ohhstar,Don't compare...,9,21 September 2020,"If you compare this to the old one ofc it's not gonna be good since the other movie is not with """"""real"""""" animals. So it's harder to get all the effects on the animals faces and gestures.
But I really enjoyed this movie after I stoped comparing it to the old one. How ever I disliked Beyoncé's voice in this move, love her otherwise but the voice acting was just bad.

2935,mktjwrangler,A film that exceeded ALL expectations,10,17 August 2019,"I was reading the reviews on here and I'm just surprised to see so many negative opinions on the film and the lack of emotion they felt from it. That and beyonce low balling herself for this role. First of all, beyonce is just a hyped up pop culture figure for this generation, she's not perfect and its impossible for her to make professional decisions that please EVERYONE. The main thing Nala's character brought to the table was her voice and her influence over Simba.
I had goosebumps throughout the entire movie. Not to sound too corny but it was almost like a spiritual experience. You grew up with this story and now you're in it... there were some points in the movie where I actually questioned if some scenes were actually CGI. The emotion came along with the imagery, the classic story, and real life/relevant issues from the importance of wildlife conservation to the meaning of family and moving on. If you dont feel something emotional after watching this if not while watching it then I don't even know what to say....... But on the other hand if you're unfamiliar with animal behaviors (I'm not talking about your pet dog or cat) then maybe you won't feel the emotion the characters DO in fact deliver. This whole realism without retro fitted expression like eyebrows was definitely a risk taken by directors and producers, but in my opinion they NAILED it.",The Lion King
2936,AlexanderHager,An updated version of a Disney classic,10,19 July 2019,"25 years after the original was released, Disney has introduced The Lion King to a new generation. This is a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible , in order to be able to appreciate the mindblowing VFX, which are some of the best ever put on screen. The new cast does a good job at portraying the classic characters and givning them a fresh feel. The music segments of the movie worked really well, the same can be said about the animals facial expressions, which had many concerned that they would look ""emotionless"" due to the realistic direction, thankfully this is not the case and the animals emotions work very well. Overall this is a movie that sticks very close to the source material but makes it feel new and fresh thanks to incredible VFX, a new cast and extensions/alterations of certain scenes.",The Lion King
2937,apaltice,ITS A GREAT MOVIE,8,10 May 2020,"The music was good, it had emotion. It was cute and overall a very great movie.

2941,bobrock-13269,Great CGI is the only difference...,1,17 July 2019,"Between the original and this remake. The one star is because why waste the time and money on a remake that is simply a reanimated version of the original that millions of people still watch and enjoy al, of these years later? Then, try and spice it up with saying you are only casting race-appropriate actors, which makes no sense because I barely saw any actor listed that was actually from Africa if that is what they are going for here. You can't hire just any ol' black actor from L.A. or anywhere else in America and say it is a race or culturally-sensitive casting choice. When have they been to Africa? I'm ""Anglo-Saxon"" white, but I have never been to Europe so what is the difference in skin color when it comes to this movie? None.It is a visually stunning movie that was only made along with all of the other live action remakes being done by Disney so that they can feel better about making such CLASSICS without the actors that have the right skin color, which is also very stupid. Write something new and stop with the ""We're sorry for not hiring black/asian/hispanic actors"" remakes. Maybe when everyone gets over what color their stupid skin is we can all just refer to each other in relation to where they live now.If you live here, work here, build a life here...you are a(n) (insert country term here).People are so stupid.",The Lion King

The CGI was truly revolutionary and innovative. Amazing! People are saying there was no emotion on the lions and other characters, well let me ask, how does a lion show emotion? They don't. The voices were enough to show emotion. Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner were hilarious and the ""Be our Guest"" rendition was phenomenal. James Earl Jones stole the show, no one could ever replace him. His voice is timeless and will forever be the greatest voice actor. Although this version cannot top the original, it is still incredible.",The Lion King

2948,agross-60078,A breathtaking remake that is true to the original,10,20 July 2019,"The remake was worth the wait. It wasn't just the story, and the characters, and the songs that were all beautiful in itself. The CGI of the African ecosystem is absolutely stunning, and this is what took my breath away. The truth is, we are losing the African ecosystems and the lions at a very scary rate, and I hope people can leave the theater motivated to help spread the message in conserving these ecosystems and the biodiversity of Africa. The remake does this in a way that the original doesn't, and while the original animation is stunning, the remake portrays Africa in a way that the original can't, because it is done in a photorealistic way. In regards to the movie, it's definitely funnier than the original, and Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen add so much comic relief to the movie. They are hilarious. James Earl Jones brings the nostalgia, JD and Shahadi do great. Donald is great, and Chiwetel puts his own more ferocious spin on Scar. Joliver is great and Kani as Rafiki was just pure. Beyoncé was good but wasn't worth all the hype her fans were giving her. She didn't blow me away. All in all, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Movie was incredible and I will be going again and again before it leaves theaters. I recommend that before you see it, try and stay away from the critics and their opinions. Don't let the negativity take away from your experience with the film.",The Lion King

2968,jymarshall,The CGI is the only good thing about this movie,3,3 August 2019,"If this review were to be based solely on the CGI, it would be a 10/10.But unfortunately everything that made the Lion King one of the greatest movies of all time was undermined, tarnished and watered down.Starting with the music. Simba and Scar's singing voices were dreadful. What makes this especially annoying is that it is in the middle of the most iconic songs from the movie, namely 'Be Prepared' and 'Hakuna Matata'. Be Prepared was especially insidious as they took all the personality and drama out of the song to make it darker. In principle, I've no problem with this as long as its either as good as the original or better. But it wasn't, it was rubbish. As for Simba's singing, it so was flat and out of tune it was painful to listen to.Secondly, the characters personalities were extracted and replaced with either celebrities. Rafiki is supposed to be a bit like Yoda, wise yet gregarious and playful. But instead, he's quiet, stoic and uninteresting. Scar is supposed to be suave, cunning and quite camp. But instead he's miserable and quite stupid. Nala's Beyoncé voice was distracting, lazy, and didn't make any sense. The hyenas went from being dumb but quite fun to watch to being dark and really irritating. The only one's that were any good were Timone, Pumba, Mufasa and Zazu.In short, I hope the animators get given awards, but that's it.",The Lion King

Some complain about that but I am very pleased with their honor to telling the story the way we all remember it. It was remarkable.My only complaint would be lack of animated expressions in the animals, but I don't know if it is even a valid complaint considering these animals may not use heavy facial expressions in real life in the first place.All in all good job Disney, very well done.",The Lion King

Don't get me wrong the visuals were great albeit the Cubs never had facial expressions. Even my chihuahua has facial expressions. The things that let it down is the voice overs, all except Mufasa. They were terrible. Lacked the enthusiasm of the original and the singing was no where near as good. To have a female sing can you feel the love tonight took away from that scene in my opinion. And they changed sooooo many lines!! As something I've known word for word since a child, this really annoyed me! They were meant to make a classic into a film, not change it. Stupid things like when Mufasa appears in the clouds, completely different script. And my all out favourite scene was chopped. When Timone and Pumba do the hula!

2977,k-10108,Sensational movie,10,26 July 2019,"We loved this movie, all of it. It is so much more emotional and better than the original despite what bad reviews said. The songs, the voices, the picture, everything was perfect. Now it's on my list of my favourite movie 👍",The Lion King
2978,eduardofelipe-97521,This movie is bad or less,4,21 July 2019,This movie is the same film practically frame by frame with some extra scenes and if you want something new you will probably disappear more if you want to see the same thing from the original movie this movie is perfect for you because this movie has a very big problem that is the facial expressions because the feelings of the characters are not expressed according to the face of them for example when mufasa died the simba screams no but he screams with face of nothing and only his mouth moves that leaves the film with impression that it was done with a low budget and even comic but there are parts that I liked for example the fidelity of the characters but I think that it saves its filmede its defects.,The Lion King
2979,amandux-10716,The Lion King,9,28 July 2019,"This film i watched first time then I was little. So, I really wanted to see it now. I trully can say, that this film is worth your attention. Sounds effect, story and songs are amazing.",The Lion King
2980,pradeepdixit-82753,The king is here,10,20 July 2019,This movie reminds me my father's love. This is a family friendly movie.,The Lion King
2981,samilaribi,copy,1,14 July 2019,Like i said the stupid version of the movie they make The same movie with higher quality just for money and there is no Creativity I think the old version was awesome i am going to see it again to wash that thing out of my mind,The Lion King
2982,valeriavol,"Very realistically, perfectly made!",9,12 August 2019,"I don't understand those who comments, that there were no emotions, how the animals supposed to SHOW emotions as much as in the cartoon?! You should rate this as a movie, not as a cartoon anymore. The voice over were lacking sometimes, but in general beautifully made, sad, and fun family movie. Timon and Pumba are truly stars, who taken away your sadness, and make you laugh right after you wiping your tears out of sadness.
Cartoon is great, so is the movie!",The Lion King
2983,businessgoodorbad,Gorgeous and Heart warming!,10,16 July 2019,The Lion King is just so beautiful and gorgerous. The VFX used in the movie is so damn amazing. Ste story as usual is heartwarming and beautiful. Recommended,The Lion King
2984,sofiaali-47391,Definitely worth a watch,9,22 July 2019,",,I had goosebumps throughout the movie ,,,felt soo reall and loved how everything was portrayed and so well put together,,",The Lion King
2985,sunshinesilje,An emotionless copy,2,27 July 2019,"I have to admit that I am amazed at the ""live"" animals, and I like what they have done with the song ""In the jungle"" (or what it is called).
But the rest... nah, not very interesting. The characters, both to look at and to listen to, portray little to no emotions. The sass from the original is gone. Some one-liner jokes were good, but the rest left me with nothing.
I will not recommend this version.",The Lion King
2986,dannygelder,National Geographic made a movie with voice-overs,7,21 July 2019,"It didn't feel like a Disney movie to me, its just a story being told.
I missed a lot of emotions on the characters faces, I didn't feel much (emotionally moving me) when watching the movie.
The execution of Timon and Pumbaa saved it, it was easily my favourite part and was stunning to look at.
But even the little children who were sitting next even noticed that it wasn't interesting to look at, and they are the target audience?I hope they could do it over in another 20 years, and make it a real Disney movie.",The Lion King
2987,momdanes,Some hate just to hate,10,20 July 2019,"This movie was amazing. If you want to sit and pick it apart, I guess you could find a way to do that. If you want to go see a beautiful, funny, movie and be entertained from the first minute through to the last, you CERTAINLY can do that!",The Lion King
2988,momosalo,I absolutely loved it!,9,17 July 2019,I'm only removing one start for Rafiki not hitting Simba over the head as I totally love that scene in the original.,The Lion King
2989,anischrianna,Simply Beautiful,8,22 July 2019,"If you are looking for perfection, you'll get it nowhere. This movie is beautiful and amazing. The depiction of family love is there and thats almost the most important thing in the Lion King. CGI was great, no doubt. People are too busy to be digging and criticising deeply for no reason. Just enjoy the movie and the story line. I cried too a couple of times. Would watch again with my loved ones!",The Lion King
2990,vixstewart,"10/10 visuals, otherwise this movie is trash",6,6 August 2019,"I went into the cinema looking forward to a live action Lion King, with all the memorable moments, with some creative license. What I got was a mess. A very beautiful, but utterly confusing mess. Sequences have been altered to subvert your expectations, actors feel like they're held on a leash- all emotion ripped away for bad one liners and flat acting. With the exception of Beyonce (Nala), who seems to be the only one given the chance to sound genuine - to the point that she's the only one you can hear in ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Scar by far is mistreated the most, reduced to a snivelling creep with no sass and all pathetic. They even cut in half and changed all the lyrics to ""Be Prepared"". And of course, the infamous gorge sequence- very short and very meh. It's surprising how much you can chop of the original film and still have it more than 2hrs long.
Very disappointed, Disney can't resist messing with something perfectly good - don't fix of it ain't broke, y'know? Timone and Pumba kinda save the film a little, but even then it's cringey and bizarre.
This film is probably better if you haven't seen the original, otherwise, you'll probably hate this.",The Lion King
2991,natp-69771,Amazing,8,19 July 2019,Missing 2 of the main songs. Animation is amazing. Overall worth watching,The Lion King
2992,bfurr-57092,Character voices,1,21 July 2019,"If it had the original voice actors from the original lion king, I think the movie would of been better",The Lion King
2993,lubnanbt,Disney's successful adaptation,9,21 August 2019,"The lion king 2019 is a very beautiful adaptation of the cartoon version, the pictures are really very beautiful I really appreciated this adaptation ...",The Lion King
2994,knoxmasonry,Visually stunning but Empty,3,21 July 2019,"A CG masterpiece but I felt no connection like I did in the old one. Most of the actors sounded like they just woke up from a nap. A true shame all around, I really wanted this to be the ""BIG"" movie of the summer.",The Lion King
2995,dmarquesto,If you loved the first one you'll love this,10,21 July 2019,"I don't know why people are so disappointed, I for one appreciated that they didn't change too much from the original. The imagery is beautiful and the story just as well told as the first time. Loved this movie as a child and loved it again now.",The Lion King
2996,paula-faust,Awesome Animation,7,22 July 2019,"Well yeah, yesterday I saw the movie and I'm bipartite.
On the one hand the animation is absolutely fantastic (one reason for watching the movie) and the plot is strongly oriented to the original. On the other hand I personally didn't feel really much during the movie.
The feelings were secondary because I was focused on the new animation (all the time I was thinking about it).
I felt he was over too soon (didn't feel like 118 minutes).
All in all I still recommend watching the movie (for all Lion Kings fans).",The Lion King
2997,camdenbrownortho,Meh....,4,15 December 2019,"The speaking felt like a table reading. In the animated film, the scenes had power. In this version, everything felt and sounded subtle and subdued.",The Lion King
2998,iamandalang,"Great movie, although lacking emotion",8,13 August 2019,"This movie is actually really good. Jon Favreau (director) had an impossible task when deciding to make the lion king live action because to many people, including myself, nothing can be compared to the original one because original is original. But i still think he did a good job with it. The story is almost the same, even though 30 minutes of footage is added. It's obvious that they put A LOT of focus on the visual effects and i'm definitely not disappointed in that because it looks incredible and the CGI is amazingly realistic. So if you're a lion king fan i really think this is worth watchingI actually love what they did with most of the songs, many of them I think turned out even better than the originals. Especially hakuna matata. And the new song ""Spirit"". WOW. Beyonce did a great job with that one.
But ""Can you feel the love tonight""... Don't get me wrong, I love Beyonce and her voice is absolutely amazing but it doesn't fit this song. In the original song the voices compliment each other but in this one, even though it's a duet, you almost only hear her. i don't think Beyonce's voice work well with others cuz it's too strong and high pitched which makes it extremely hard to find someone that can actually compliment her. Her tone is over all too powerful for the song making it too ""over the top"" instead of what's supposed to be a beautiful, soft love songThr CGI is amazingly realistic but it's obvious that they focused way more on the visual effects and realism than the actual emotion of the movie. Even though that's kind of the point with realism, the animals aren't supposed to have any exaggerated facial expressions, i would've liked to feel a bit more with some scenes.Opinions on tve voice acting
James earl Jones (Mufasa) did his job. Same actor as before so ofc i can't complain about that. Spot onDonald Glover (Simba) was good too. Nothing special but i gotta say, he did an amazing job singing ""hakuna matata"". His voice works perfectly and i think he made it better than the original one. It's a shame i didn't hear him during ""can you feel the love tonight"" cuz that was basically the Beyonce showBeyoncé (Adult Nala) should've been cast by someone else. Like, we get that you can sing but it's too much. The soft love song turned into a power-ballad. it's just too Beyoncé.I think she should've just sung ""Spirit"" and nothing else cuz her voice was perfect for that one.
Chiwetel Ejiofor (Scar) should've been someone else too. He missed the sarcastic, dark, scary, deep voice of Scar that Jeremy Irons (former Scar) had which kinda destroyed the feeling a bit.Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen (Timon and Pumbaa) were the real legends of this movie though. The sarcasm, the jokes and nailing ""the lion sleeps tonight"" (btw, i love what they did with the longer version of that song)I love the ""be our guest"" part",The Lion King
2999,ellabuckingham,what's everyone moaning about? Brilliant remake!!,9,25 July 2019,"I found this remake heartwarming, extremely loyal to the original with only one or two little tweaks that were nice little editions and the cgi was fantastic. Timone and pumba were brilliantly cast and hilarious.
I left the cinema feeling like I'd relived a part of my youth and couldn't get the grin of my face.",The Lion King
