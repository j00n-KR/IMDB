0,MartinHafer,"I see no reason, other than a crass desire for more money, for this film to have been made.",4,20 June 2013,"Tim Burton's career took off with his creation of the original film ""Frankenweenie"". It was a very cute and sweet short film—a homage to the horror films of yesteryear. Now, more than two decades later, Burton is back with a remake.of sorts. In fact, although the title is the same and the first half of the film is quite similar, it is much more a re-imagining of the original. The last portion, oddly, bore no resemblance to the originaland in this portion, the film became tedious. In fact, it was so bad I am shocked that it was Oscar-nominated—especially when better films (such as ""ParaNorman"") could have been nominated instead.Like the first film, a boy's beloved dog is struck and killed by a car. And, the strange boy decides to revive it using Frankenstein-like contraptions that zap the carcass with electricity. This is much of the film. Then there is the new material—where several kids from school also decide to create their own undead creations in order to win a science fair. Unfortunately, the kids all end up creating monsters that terrorize, very briefly, the city. In the end, all is well.and I was thrilled that the film was finally over! So why did I dislike the film? Well, it certainly wasn't the look of the film. Using stop-motion, they created a very imaginative black & white world that you have to like even if the plot itself is stale and the new material is simply awful. At least the art department deserves kudos. As far as the story goes, the biggest problem isn't that they changed the original story (I expected they would)—it's that the fun and comedy of the original film was non-existent and in its place was cliché-ridden and joyless romp. And, while I am not a huge fan of political correctness, I thought the way the Asian kid was portrayed was cheap and very stereotypical (his creation turned into Gamera—the Japanese monster who often battled the likes of Godzilla). Overall, apart from the artistry, I thoroughly disliked this film and STRONGLY recommend you see the original—which is very clever, fresh and fun. Or, see one of Tim Burton's good stop-motion films, like ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""The Corpse Bride"".By the way, you might wonder why I even watched this film. Well, I was on a Disney cruise and the movie was free—so it isn't like I paid to see it. If I had, I am sure my score would have been lover than 4.",Frankenweenie
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A spine-tingling delight, quite possibly Burton's best since Big Fish",9,20 October 2012,"This 2012 film of Frankenweenie I don't think is as good as Edward Scissorhands(my personal favourite), Ed Wood, Beetlejuice, Batman and Big Fish. If Nightmare Before Christmas counts, I'd include that as well. Sleepy Hollow was also excellent, as was Sweeney Todd. As a matter of fact I was dithering whether to say that this was Burton's best since Sweeney Todd, but I felt Big Fish had more heart. And I consider the 1984 short film superior. This in mind, it is vastly superior to Planet of the Apes(his worst), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows.Frankenweenie(2012) is not quite perfect. The story wavers slightly in pace and focus when Victor's classmates plot to uncover his secret. That said, I was hugely impressed with it, one of my personal favourites of the year so far actually. The visuals are simply gorgeous. The black and white shadings fit with the Gothic atmosphere, and the deliberately grotesque characters are vivid in their design. The music score by Danny Elfman has this haunting undercurrent that Sleepy Hollow had as well as the sparkling beauty that made Edward Scissorhands so poignant. It is a very dynamic and atmospheric score indeed.It is a very well-written film as well. It is wickedly funny, already improving on Dark Shadows with some very clever nods to Godzilla movies and other B-movie horror films. But Frankenweenie doesn't rely on manic humour, fart jokes or slapstick to make itself funny. The humour here is actually very subtle and deadpan. What is further special about Frankenweenie was its story. Having seen and loving to death the short film I knew what to expect, but I found the telling of this story to be fresh and just with as much heart. While there are funny moments that don't jar with the focus of the story and generally the film is full of energy, the film is often very poignant. The ending in particular has genuine pathos to it.The characters are instantly engaging, oddball like with the best of Burton's films but engaging nonetheless. Aside from Sparky, the most memorable of them were Victor, Mr. Rzykruski- there is an intentional uncanny resemblance to Vincent Price- and the creepy girl with the cat. The voice work is really excellent, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short and Winona Ryder give wonderfully dry vocal performances but it was Martin Landau who stole the show, he was an inspired choice for Mr. Rzykruski, and he is deliciously eccentric yet does equally wonderfully in conveying the character's wisdom.All in all, a really delightful film, not Burton's best or quite one of my favourites, but I do consider it his best film in the past decade or so. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Frankenweenie
2,Leofwine_draca,Good-natured tribute to classic horror and monster films,6,27 December 2015,"This is pretty good, if you like the subject matter and animation style. It's Tim Burton's film version of one of the early shorts he did in his career; a tribute to Universal's FRANKENSTEIN, in which an imaginative young boy brings his dead dog back to life in the time-honoured tradition.I'm sure that FRANKENWEENIE worked very well as a short but as a feature-length movie it shows some evidence of padding. There are many extraneous sub-plots involving other kids and their own creations so the subsequent journey can feel episodic at times and slightly unfocused. Still, the calibre of the animation is top notch - was this really stop motion? - and I liked the decision to film in black and white to give it that classic look.A lot of the fun arises from seeing all the tributes to classic horror films - Burton even manages to get Christopher Lee in this, via an old TV clip playing from Hammer's Dracula. I particularly loved the inclusion of a Japanese kid and the reference to various kaiju (particularly Gamera and Rodan). Sparky is a lovable character and the voice acting isn't quite as irritating as it could have been, so over all this is my favourite of the various dark stop motion films made over the years.",Frankenweenie
3,SnoopyStyle,Tim Burton through and through,8,31 August 2013,"Young Victor Frankenstien's pet dog Sparky is hit by a car. He decides to bring him back to life. When Sparky returns and wreck havoc, he enlists his friends Edgar 'E' Gore and Elsa Van Helsing to help.This is Tim Burton's style through and through. It's a black and white stop motion animation film. He has set this in a nice suburbia populated with weirdly vanilla characters from classic horrors. It's not only the style but the material. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed. Even if you're not, you'll probably like it.",Frankenweenie
4,Prismark10,One boy and his dog,5,20 November 2016,"Tim Burton returns to stop-motion animation in Frankenweenie. Shot in black and white and inspired by the Universal Frankenstein films.Young Victor Frankenstein is intelligent but a loner and he loves his energetic dog Sparky so is downhearted when Sparky is run over. Although buried in the cemetery after some science experiments at school where they discharge electrical charges to dead frogs which makes their legs twitch, Victor digs up Sparky, smuggles him into his attic where after patching him up with a few stitches he reanimates him with bolts of lightning. The newly revitalised dog is as good as ever although sometimes bits drop off and he needs to be recharged at times.However once it comes to be known that Sparky is alive, pretty soon Victor's school mates are trying to bring their own dead animals to life but these experiments go awry and wreak havoc in town.Burton has crafted a homage to the old horror films of his youth, the science teacher Mr Rzykruski looks like Vincent Price. It is energetic but also low key and rather sterile.",Frankenweenie
5,claudio_carvalho,Adorable Tale of Loyalty and Friendship,8,28 January 2013,"In New Holland, the boy Victor Frankenstien is a bright but outcast student without any friend but his dog Sparky. When the newcomer science teacher Mr. Rzykruski challenges the students to participate in the science fair, Victor's father forces him to play baseball otherwise he would not sign the necessary authorization for his son.During the game, Sparky chases the ball and is hit by a car. Victor recalls Mr. Rzykruski's class about the effects of electricity and successfully resuscitates Sparky using lightning. Victor hides Sparky in the attic but the weird Edgar sees the dog on the garden and blackmails Victor to learn how to bring the dead to life. Edgar does not keep the secret and soon Victor's envious schoolmates revive several creatures to win the science fair contest. When the town is invaded by the monsters, Victor and Sparky are the last chance to rescue the girl Elsa van Helsing from the claws of Mr. Whiskers.""Frankenweenie"" is another stop-motion animation by Tim Burton in black and white with a great tribute to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein with a happy ending. The story is actually an adorable tale of loyalty and friendship and it is delightful to see the frolic of Sparky. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Frankenweenie""",Frankenweenie
6,nogodnomasters,AND THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S SCIENCE FAIR..,6,6 December 2018,"Wow! This is what kids want: A black and white claymation-like story set in the 1950's based on a 1940's film they never saw. I enjoyed it more than the kids who were too busy taking pictures of their privates and posting on Facebook to care about the movie.What was with the cat poop the girl was holding? Why did all the bad kids have French accents?What was with dead Sparky rotting like a zombie? Frankenstein never did that. I thought the names were a bit cliche for adults, and the kids who could enjoy the film wouldn't understand them. All the kids looked spooky and like their pets, which I liked. The girl with Mr. Whiskers was my favorite.This is a film the kids will watch once and enjoy and grow out of real fast.",Frankenweenie
7,kosmasp,Fetch,6,30 May 2013,"Tim Burton returning to his roots. Or at least to one of his first projects. One that he made for Disney, who surely didn't mind him making a feature length movie out of his original short story. Of course back when he first made it, they weren't that fond of Mr. Burton. But time heals all wounds I guess and it's good if you can forgive and forget in this business.At least the forgetting part is kinda hard to come by in this movie. The cover does suggest it, even for those who didn't hear what the movie is about, plus the name is a big hint too. Names in general (character names that is) are fine and might provoke a laugh or at least a chuckle with old school horror fans. Also nice the addition of Vincent Price once again. Not only in a film snippet, but also as a voice actor and a crucial part of the story.All in all it's a nice and scary movie. If that is possible. While I didn't feel it was better than say Paranorman, I do understand that quite a lot of people are fond of the short movie and will just love the usual Burton quirkiness. So depending on your taste, you will either like it more than me or less. One thing is for sure: It does have a few scary scenes in it, so it might not be entirely suitable for really young ones.",Frankenweenie
8,gavin6942,A Return to the Glory Days of Tim Burton?,7,13 January 2013,"Young Victor (Charlie Tahan) conducts a science experiment to bring his beloved dog Sparky (Frank Welker) back to life, only to face unintended, sometimes monstrous, consequences.As I like to do, let me respond to another (better?) critic. Roger Ebert says ""the whole story benefits from the absence of color, because this is a stark world without many soothing tones."" Whether or not I agree with the second half of this is undetermined -- is it a stark world? Not sure I felt that way. But the lack of color certainly does enhance the film -- because it is a Tim Burton creation.Burton works best in black and white, because he is an artist first and director second. His best films worked not so much because of his direction, but because of his vision. ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" could have been done by no one else. Even the ""Batman"" films are incredible because of Burton's view of the world. He may not be Christopher Nolan, but that makes his Batman no less great.We can tell that this was a trip down memory lane for Burton, too, back to his glory days. And I do not mean simply because he made a new version of something he made almost thirty years ago. Also notice his choice of voice actors -- we have neither Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter, who have (for better or worse) dominated his films for over a decade. We have Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara, two of his best actresses. Seeing them back together and with Burton -- even in cartoon form -- was a real treat.What made this film especially meaningful was the science teacher's speech. Sure, I loved the references to classic monsters (and the turtle named Shelley was a touching nod to Frankenstein's creator). But the farewell speech wherein science is held to be a neutral field with only its uses truly good or bad... that was a key moment. Not only did it show the difference between Victor and his classmates (he was not only brilliant, but pure-hearted), it pointed out an important truth about the world: science can be a weapon or a salvation, depending on whose hands we wish to put it.",Frankenweenie
9,lee_eisenberg,Suburban America goes loony!,10,7 October 2012,"Some years ago I saw Tim Burton's short film ""Frankenweenie"", about a suburban boy named Victor Frankenstein who reanimates his dead dog and turns his neighborhood upside down when the pooch escapes his control. Naturally it intrigued me when I learned that Burton was doing a feature-length version. Well, the feature-length ""Frankenweenie"" is even better than the original! This stop motion movie is mostly an homage to the classic horror flicks (does the name Elsa Van Helsing ring a bell?), but also takes the time to poke fun at the oh-so squeaky clean world of 1960s suburbia (at least everything has that look). The setting is the fictional town of New Holland, which is preparing for a Dutch festival. Everything seems really wholesome, but Victor's little project ends up unleashing a litany of wackiness unseen in our era.I should identify that this is not a movie for little children. There ARE some mildly scary scenes, and the weird look of some of the characters might unnerve tykes. But the good thing is that film buffs will like all the references. The science teacher looks like Vincent Price (whom Burton cast as the narrator in ""Vincent"" and the scientist in ""Edward Scissorhands""). Victor's friend Edgar (hmm, now who was named Edgar?) looks like Peter Lorre. One of the other students has a hairdo like Boris Karloff's most famous role. It's just a really fun movie. I don't know if it's Tim Burton's best, but it shows him at his best. Above all, ""Frankenweenie"" shows that animation does NOT need to be all cutesy; after all, it's just another type of filmmaking. I'd call this the perfect Halloween movie (excluding full-fledged horror movies, obviously).In conclusion, you really AIN'T nothing but a hound dog!",Frankenweenie
10,jboothmillard,Frankenweenie,7,29 June 2016,"This film started out as a short film in 1984 from director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), a parody and homage of Frankenstein (1931), based on the classic Mary Shelley novel, 28 years later Burton turned into a full length cartoon feature. Basically young Victor Frankenstein (I Am Legend's Charlie Tahan) lives in the quiet town of New Holland, with his parents Edward (Martin Short) and Susan Frankenstein (Catherine O'Hara), and his beloved dog Sparky. At school Victor is recognised for his intelligence by his classmates, gloomy neighbour Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder), mischievous Igor-like Edgar ""E"" Gore (Atticus Shaffer), obese and gullible Bob (Robert Capron), overconfident Toshiaki (James Hiroyuki Liao), creepy Nassor (Short), and the eccentric Weird Girl (O'Hara), but Victor hardly communicates with them because of his relationship with Sparky. Victor's father encourages him to take up baseball, to get out of isolation, and make achievements outside of science, at his first baseball game Victor hits a home run, Sparky runs for the ball, like a game of catch, pursuing the ball the dog runs into the road and is hit by a car and killed, Victor is heartbroken. In a science lesson, teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) demonstrates electrical impulses in the muscles of a dead frog, a depressed Victor has the idea to dig up Sparky, builds himself a makeshift laboratory, stitches his dog back together, and uses the power of lightning to reanimate him, this is successful. Undead Sparky hides in the attic, but he escapes and explores the neighbourhood, he is recognised by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to bring animals back to life. Meanwhile many students are preparing for the upcoming science fair, Edgar brags undead fish to Toshiaki and Bob, they are panicked they will lose the prize, making rockets out of soda bottles, this fails miserably with Bob breaking his arm, Mr. Rzykruski is blamed for influencing them, he is replaced by the Gym Teacher (O'Hara). Edgar is confronted by Toshiaki, Nassor and Bob, he accidentally reveals Victor's actions, inspiring them to reanimation themselves, meanwhile Victor's parents are frightened discovering Sparky in the attic, he flee, Victor and his parents go in search for the dog, while classmates invade the lab and discover the reanimation formula. Classmates separately perform experiments on dead animals, they go awry and the creatures are turned into undead monsters, Weird Girl's cat Mr. Whiskers is electrocuted biting on an undead bat, he fuses with it, becoming a bat-cat monster with wings and fangs, a rat becomes a wererat, a hamster becomes mummified, a turtle becomes a giant Gamera-like monster, and Sea-Monkeys grow into amphibious humanoids, all these creatures break out and cause havoc to the town. Victor finds Sparky in the town's pet cemetery, he then finds his classmates to help conquer the many monster creatures, during the chaos, Elsa's poodle Persephone is taken by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill, Victor and Elsa chase after them. The townspeople are blaming undead Sparky for the devastation to the town, Mayor Burgermeister (Short) accidentally ignites the windmill, Sparky and Victor enter the burning windmill, Elsa and Persephone are rescued, but Victor is trapped inside, Sparky rescues him, but Mr. Whiskers drags him back inside, before being killed by falling debris. The windmill finally collapses on Sparky, killing him again, but the townspeople work together to help Victor get his friend back again, using car batteries to reanimate him once again, Persephone, who now has a hairstyle like the Bride of Frankenstein, comes to Sparky, the two share their love and kiss. Also starring Conchata Ferrell as Bob's Mom , Tom Kenny as New Holland Townsfolk (voice) American Dad's Dee Bradley Baker as various characters and Frank Welker as the barks of Sparky. The voice casting is well chosen, the use of black-and-white colour keeps with the feel of a classic scary B-movie, the cast is full of suitably weird and grotesque looking characters, the story sticks with the concept of the original short, but leaves room for some new additional stuff, but best of all is the impeccable stop-motion animation, it is funny and spine- tingling in equal measure, a most worthwhile animated fantasy horror comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!",Frankenweenie
11,ccthemovieman-1,"A Little Of This, A Little Of That....And A LOT of Fun!",9,1 September 2013,"Frankenweenie was a pleasant surprise: a very entertaining film that was fun for a number of reasons. The story featured drama, comedy, suspense, action and even a little romance.....it had everything. Plus, it had a terrific black-and-white palette. The stop-motion animated movie looks gorgeous.Anyone who is familiar with the original Frankenstein film and Bride of Frankenstein had to get laughs out of the references to those 1930s classics. I know I did, laughing out loud several times. There also were touches in here of other pretty famous movies such as Godzilla, Gremlins, Gremlins 2, The Mummy and probably a couple of others that don't immediately come to mind.All of that is involved in this story about a young ""Victor Frankenstein,"" whose beloved dog ""Sparky"" is killed and then brought back to life by the young kid scientist (who went on to bigger things, as you know.) In this story, it's fairly mild until a bunch of weird schoolmates want to cash in on Victor's secret for re-animation. Then it gets tense/dark......probably a little too much for young viewers, so parents beware. However, for teens and up - particularly adult film buffs - this is a fun flick, start-to-finish.",Frankenweenie
12,Tweekums,A delightfully dark stop-go animation from Tim Burton,8,17 November 2017,Young Victor Frankenstein lives in the town of New Holland; he is a quiet boy whose only real friend is his dog Sparky and he has a love of science. When Sparky is run over and killed he is understandably upset but is later inspired by a science class to bring his beloved pet back to life. After stitching Sparky back together and harnessing one of the town's frequent electrical storms he successfully brings Sparky back to life. When he goes to school he leaves Sparky in the attic but he manages to escape and is spotted by Victor's classmate Edgar Edgar wants Victor to work with him on the upcoming science fair so blackmails him into repeating the experiment with a dead goldfish. It isn't long before the secret is out and soon all the children are planning to reanimate animals. Their results somewhat disturbing and soon the town is in danger.I must say I really enjoyed this black and white treat from Tim Burton but am unsure how younger viewers will feel about it. There are some fun scares that might disturb young children as might the death of Sparky. There are some good laughs to be had; these are improved if you spot the movies that are frequently referenced. These references are to both classic horror films and earlier Tim Burton films. If you don't spot these references it won't spoilt the film though; they are just a bonus for those who do. The story contains plenty of other amusing moments as well as a good amount of excitement; this excitement increases as the story reaches its dramatic conclusion. The character designs are great I particularly liked the teacher who is clearly modelled on Vincent Price and Edward E Gore he looks like an Igor! Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting an animation that is darker than typical Disney fare.,Frankenweenie
13,BA_Harrison,Typically Tim Burton (make of that what you will).,5,24 October 2016,"When his dog Sparky is flattened by a car, young Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) makes his dead pet the subject of his school science project, bringing the mangled mutt back to life with a massive electrical charge. But when Victor's schoolmates learn of his success, they also try to reanimate some deceased animals, unleashing several monstrous beasts on the community (including a giant tortoise that looks like Gamera and a group of mischievous mutated sea monkeys).Tim Burton expands his 1984 short movie of the same name into a full length feature, delivering impeccable black and white stop-motion animation but failing to connect on an emotional level. An homage to James Whale's Frankenstein, with references to other classic horror movies along the way, there is plenty to please the eye and appease the classic horror fan, but the storytelling is remarkably unengaging, with unappealing characters and a narrative that goes nowhere, the whole affair feeling very much like the drawn out short story that it is.",Frankenweenie
14,tavm,This feature-length version of Tim Burton's Frankenweenie provided plenty of enjoyment of atmospheric chills,8,18 October 2012,"Just watched this black-and-white Tim Burton stop-motion animated film with my movie theatre-working friend a few hours ago. Taking inspiration from the old-school horrors of the classic era from the '30s to the '50s-not to mention his own short version of this tale he did in 1984 that I have admittedly yet to watch, I and my friend were thoroughly entertained enough by some humor and many scares that permeated throughout the movie. And once again, Danny Elfman provides another perfect score for a Burton film. And the voices of veterans like Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Winona Rider, and Martin Landau as the science teacher who looks like Vincent Price contributed immensely to the whimsically suspenseful atmosphere. If there was one flaw, it was the end when Sparky the dog conveniently woke up instead of staying dead, thereby defeating the purpose of teaching the lesson of how final death is and should be. Still, me and my friend had a good enough time that I highly recommend this version of Frankenweenie.",Frankenweenie
15,Coventry,Gone is the Burton-magic,4,31 October 2017,"I've always been a giant admirer of Tim Burton; particularly his imaginative script ideas and his fairy-tale filming style. But, somehow, my appreciation for him has gone down tremendously since ""Alice in Wonderland"". There were his greatest films (""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Big Fish"") used to be macabre, unique and melancholic, his newer efforts (""Dark Shadow"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Big Eyes"") are sentimental, childish and dull. Burton has become his own caricature, but I still had reasonably high hopes for this ""Frankenweenie"". After all, Burton's other two stop- motion/animation flicks (""Corpse Bride"" and ""The Nightmare before Christmas"") belong to his finest efforts and I also really liked the 30-minutes short that our director made in 1984 for Disney and largely kick-started his career. But alas, the magic has faded away here as well Oh sure, ""Frankenweenie"" is undeniably a masterwork in terms of meticulous and professional stop-motion techniques and it still remains admirable how Tim Burton continuously pays tribute to so many older horror titles; famous classics as well as obscure foreign gems. Unfortunately, however, he also always reverts to the same old clichéd trademarks, daft character drawings and tiresome pacing. Young Victor Frankenstein loses his beloved dog Sparky when a car runs over it, but he paid close attention during the classes of his eccentric teacher Mr. Rzykruski and uses the next electrical thunderstorm to bring it back to life. Victor's creepy classmates also have deceased pets they want to give the same science-project treatment as Sparky, but these critters aren't as cute and raise a little hell during the town's annual Dutch festival. Fellow horror fans can moderately amuse themselves by spotting all the references and tributes to legendary films, characters, and actors/actresses, but ""Frankenweenie"" on itself is a feeble story without any highlights or even remotely memorable parts. I watched this with my 8-year-old son and even he was disappointed, and more particularly frustrated about how infantile and tame this was!",Frankenweenie
16,grantss,Sweet family movie,7,17 September 2020,"Sweet family movie. Directed by Tim Burton and based on his first movie, a short. Original, quirky plot (which you would expect from Mr Burton).

18,neil-476,Marred by its Burtonishness,7,26 October 2012,"When young Victor Frankenstein's dog Sparky is killed by a car, Victor is inspired by science teacher Mr Rzykruski to try to reanimate his pet using lightning.There is a history to this Tim Burton animated movie which I haven't gone into: I am considering it solely on its own merits. It is a black and white movie using puppets (and possibly CGI) to tell a story which is a variation on the original movie Frankenstein story, moving it solidly into an Edward Scissorhands location, and cross-pollinate it with a bay and his dog.It is full of the customary Tim Burton visual flair, and I guess that is my main complaint about it, for two reasons. One, the character design is just plain ugly - none of the characters is visually appealing. And, two (and following on from one), the look of the piece overpowers the content: at times when I should have been touched by what was going on, I was thinking, instead, of how ugly the boy and his dog were, or how carefully they had modelled the lightning sequence of the James Whale movie, or how obviously Mr Rzykruski's appearance had been based on Vincent Price. I think I would have enjoyed the film more had it been made in non-Tim Burton mode.And I respect black and white as a stylistic choice, but I didn't like it here.The 3D was good, but not essential.",Frankenweenie
19,AlsExGal,No humans - stop motion or otherwise - were harmed in the making of this film,8,7 April 2019,"This is really Tim Burton at his best, and you'd probably enjoy it even if you came to it without any background in Burton's work or Universal classic horror. But it helps if you know about both. After all, who isn't moved by a boy and dog's pure immovable unconditional love for one another? When this love is interrupted by death, as it is in the case of young Victor Frankenstein and his dog Sparky, young Victor takes what he has learned about science to bring Sparky back to life, albeit with a bunch of stitches and a couple of bolts in his neck. When Sparky escapes the attic where he is kept while Victor is at school all day, that is when the trouble starts.You see elements of ""Edward Scissorhands"" including the clueless although well meaning parents with the 60s decor, characters inspired by Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff, and you just really need to have seen Bride of Frankenstein - and might I add Jurassic Park? - to get a few of the jokes. The score is trademark eerie Burton, and the scenes in the pet cemetery are spooky or heart rending, depending on the situation.Most poignant scene? Reanimated Sparky - still the friendly little dog he was in life - is discovered alive by people who know he died and they shriek in terror. The bewildered little dog makes for the safety of the Pet Cemetery and curls up next to his headstone.This one made me shed a tear at a few points as well as laugh out loud at other times. I'd highly recommend this one.",Frankenweenie
20,ferguson-6,Wonderfully Shocking,8,14 October 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Being a huge fan of Tim Burton's 1984 short of the same title, news of a feature length feature was very exciting. It's obvious from both films that director Tim Burton holds the story and project close to his heart. The obvious guess is that young Victor Frankenstein has much in common with the enigmatic director's childhood experience ... a social misfit who finds joy in less than popular outlets (science, sci-fi, filmmaking).The story begins simply enough, Victor - a socially inept boy, whose only friend is his loyal dog Sparky, quickly connects with the new science teacher, Mr. Rzykroski (who bears a striking resemblance to the late, great Vincent Price). Victor's parents try to get him more engaged and that leads to a tragic accident that kills Sparky. Victor is heart-broken but his scientific mind leads to a shocking development thanks to a local lightning storm. Soon enough, Sparky is back! Of course, the secret gets out and the Science Fair takes on quite a competitive nature.Burton really treats the film as an homage to old monster, horror and sci-fi films. We get tributes to Frankenstein, The Mummy, Dracula (complete with Christopher Lee), Godzilla, Bride of Frankenstein, Gremlins, Jurrassic Park and others I certainly missed on first viewing. But this is so much more. Mr. Rzykroski gives a less than PC speech to the local townspeople, and though it is straight to the point, that point is lost on these fine folks. The importance of science and learning and accepting the differences of others is all touched upon, but not in a preachy way.The voice work is stellar thanks to Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Winona Ryder, Charlie Tahan, Martin Landau and Atticus Shaffer (Brick on ""The Middle""). The style and texture of the film is extraordinary. The shadows and lighting provide an atmosphere that adds just enough creepiness. The detail involved with the characters and setting is remarkable for stop-motion animation. Not just that, but how many movies have you seen recently that include a cat-bat, sea monkeys, and a giant turtle? The suburban setting is almost identical to the neighborhood seen in Burton's Edward Scissorhands, just without the 1960's color palette.This is excellent movie entertainment for adults and children alike. Unfortunately, the black and white presentation has meant a lack of interest from today's kids. Sure it has some darkness to it, but the PG rating means nothing too heavy. This is Tim Burton at his finest ... and without Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter! Also, Danny Elfman's score perfectly compliments the story and characters, and stay for the credits to hear a very odd Karen O song.",Frankenweenie

22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Frankenweenie,6,12 November 2012,"Director Tim Burton returns to his visceral dark roots with Frankenweenie, a animated film that features all the dark, brooding themes he is famous for, in what would seem like an opportunity for the story teller to deal with all his favourite, classical horror elements all in one fall swoop. With Disney's backing, Burton crafts a somewhat charming little film inspired primarily by Frankenstein, dealing with the artificial creation of life and how this whacks nature out of balance, although one can almost feel that his direction probably got superseded in the final moments to toe the line, given that mass market merchandising, or the lack thereof, is probably the compromise reached.Face it, the characters here aren't really plush toy material, even though they are grotesquely beautiful to look at, with physical flaws that seem perfect. As usual, like the animated films that feature his involvement, the characters here aren't designed to be anatomically correct with their longer than usual limbs. Being in black, white and grey, it provides that old school look and hopefully elevated this film to that nostalgic status of old, ringing with the air of familiarity for elements that you've probably experienced especially if you're a classic horror movie fan.As the story would have already been suggested by its trailer, it centers around a boy, Vincent Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) whose dog Sparky had passed away, only for Vincent, a smart boy with scientist potential, emulating his namesake to resurrect his pet dog, and succeeding. He tries to keep this undead version of Sparky under wraps, only for the antics of the dog to be discovered, and from there, having his peers, who are all vying for best science project, trying to emulate what he had done, with vastly different results.Here's when you can see what had inspired Burton, or had been his favourites, as the story took on homage paying moments especially when the story went on its own little spree to have loads of fun. Tributes got paid to the likes of a Godzilla-wannabe, critters, and characters that were amongst the same level of recognition as Frankenstein, in addition to a whole slew of name dropping. Even the science teacher Mr Rzykruski (Martin Landau), looked very much and unmistakably like Burton's tip of the hat to one of his heroes, Vincent Price, who is straight talking, and providing a stinging criticism against those who are closed minded, and superstitious, clinging on to values of the old without the guts for exploration and scientific adventure. Those who follow blindly, or copying without full understanding, are also put under the spotlight, and it's little wonder how the chief reverse engineer happens to be Asian.But it's not all formula, facts and numbers. Frankenweenie, like most of Burton's films, no matter how dark they may look and feel, contains plenty of heart. While the hinted at love story between Vincent and Elsa (Winona Ryder) was almost non-existent, being but neighbours who communicate through a hole in the picket fence, it is the bond between boy and dog, and the extent one will go for the other, that moved, even if, like Frankenstein's tale, the whole world goes after them, being some bastardized by product of nature. But outside of these two characters, the support cast was woefully one-noted, and largely wallpaper.While this film marks the umpteenth time that Burton has had Danny Elfman score his film, it is with a heavy heart, as a fan of their partnership, to listen to moments that seem lifted from their Batman score, and being repeated so obviously during the film's finale that you'd wonder if Elfman had finally run out of steam with the lack of inspiration in coming up with new tunes that dance around similar themes. I guess one can only recycle to a certain degree, before being dangerously left exposed.I had enjoyed the quirky tales and characters that Tim Burton had the knack to conjure in his mind, but Frankenweenie, despite being nice to look at with moments that will touch your heart, as a whole still felt as an unfulfilled potential. One can only hope Burton's next effort will be as inspirational as his earlier ones.",Frankenweenie
23,Rainey-Dawn,A Brilliant Animation,10,13 October 2014,"Frankenweenie is a brilliant stop-motion animation. I did not think I would like this movie better than ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""Corpse Bride"" but I did. The other two Tim Burton films are outstanding and I still love those movies - but Frankenweenie quickly became my favorite Tim Burton animated film (so far). Maybe it's because the movie is loosely based on one of my favorite classic horror stories ""Frankenstein"".... maybe it's just the idea of bringing back to life someone you love (even a beloved pet)? I can't say for sure why Frankenweenie is my favorite of the Burton animations - it just is.This is a great Halloween Holiday film -- and I'm sure it will be a classic. This film would be great to watch along with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Hotel Transylvania"" or ""ParaNorman"".10/10",Frankenweenie
24,KineticSeoul,It's decent but nothing all that spectacular or groundbreaking,7,25 December 2012,"This movie has Tim Burton style written all over it and I guess that is what drives this movie. Without him trying to be overly self-indulgent or anything like that. ""ParaNorman"" which is another stop-motion movie that came out on the same year as this one with the Halloween style going for it as well. And both have protagonist and premise that are slightly similar to each other. Both has to do with a boy that doesn't fit well with others and is different, one can talk with the dead while the other is a science wiz. And they both has weird characters following him around and they both need to stop a huge disaster from harming the town. In a suburban style neighborhood. Although the editing in this is better I think I liked ""ParaNorman"" slightly better. Despite it relying on sexual jokes for humor adults can catch onto. Which this one doesn't have. The thing is even if this movie is visually entertaining to some degree with it's old school monster flick style in stop-motion and all. It just lack development and doesn't have that much depth going for it so the climax and everything else seems a bit too quick. And before the climax this movie seems to move along slowly without much innovative development although the movie is only about an hour and a half. Overall this is a decent Tim Burton style stop-motion movie that is worth a watch. Nothing all that groundbreaking or spectacular like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".7.4/10",Frankenweenie
25,Hellmant,If I had seen it as a kid I'd probably have enjoyed it a lot more.,6,18 October 2012,"'FRANKENWEENIE': Three Stars (Out of Five) Tim Burton's feature film adaptation of his 1984 short film of the same name, which is an homage to the 1931 classic creature film 'FRANKENSTEIN' (which is an adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic book). The film was directed by Burton and written by John August (who works with Burton frequently). It features a voice cast including Charlie Tahan, Martin Landau, Martin Short, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder (which marks a reunion of Burton, O'Hara and Ryder who previously all worked together on 'BEETLEJUICE'). The film is a black and white 3D stop motion horror-comedy about a boy who resurrects his beloved dog using science. The movie is charming and a good children's creature film but it lacks the energy and cinematic style that made Burton's previous film efforts so memorable.The story revolves around a boy named Victor Frankenstein (Tahan) and his dog Sparky. The two live in New Holland where Victor pursues his interests in film and science with great passion. Victor's father (Short) encourages Victor to try out for sports as well and at his first baseball game Sparky is struck by a car (and killed) while chasing after a home run ball Victor hit in to the parking lot. Unable to move on and forget his fallen best friend Victor decides to use science, and the lessons taught to him by his teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Landau), to bring his dog back to life. When he succeeds (using the electricity from lightning) all seems right in the world again until his friend, Edgar 'E' Gore (Atticus Shaffer), starts snooping around and Sparky starts disturbing his parents and their neighbors. Victor then has to prove to his family and the town that Sparky is not a monster in order to save his resurrected dog once again.The film is an effective kids movie and if I had seen it as a kid I'd probably have enjoyed it a lot more. It's a good homage to classic monster films (including one of my all time favorites 'GREMLINS') and it is a good Halloween film (for the whole family). It just didn't live up to my expectations and continued my disappointment in Tim Burton and his films as of late. I had no real problems with the film though, I just found it a little dull at times and nothing to get too excited about. Under a different mindset I can see why others might enjoy the film a lot more though. It's definitely not a bad film in any way. Fans of the original (which I am) or Burton (which I also am) might be thrilled with it, I was just a little disappointed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",Frankenweenie
26,thesar-2,Doggone Ads,5,21 January 2013,"There are two things I despise when it comes to advertisements: overkill and the ads themselves.Yes, I know we ""need"" commercials to fund the ""free"" stuff we see/use, but they really are a chore to get through and when there are too many, I simply make mental notes to never, ever buy their product.The other marketing ads I hate, and mentioned, is excess. My poppa always said, if the ad's too big, or if they over-advertise something, they have little faith in their product. Okay, I was paraphrasing there, but I 100% agree with him. Movies, these days, like the Star Wars, Harry Potter and even the Twilight series, don't even have to promote so much because they're brand names. Smaller films, or products, should advertise some, but let word-of-mouth take over.Whoa, I digressIn Frankenweenie's case, every single movie – and I AM NOT Exaggerating, from the beginning of 2012 until the film's release in October, I saw a preview for this movie. Sometimes, even one of those stupid, Pre-Show-Countdown segments before the previews in the theatre, had behind-the-scenes clips of Frankenweenie, in addition to the inevitable preview following. It was so much overkill, so much advertising, that I vowed never to see this. Besides, it looked like an animated, though Black & White, remake of the 100x told story of Frankenstein.Seriously, it was too much. With each over-used trailer, I wondered how bad this movie was that they had to show it to me a minimum of 4 times, per month, for 9 months. It's absolutely no wonder that it made such an incredibly low sting at the box office. (To date: $35 million domestically and overall, $66 million, worldwide. To most animated films, these days, that's about 10% or less of the normal gross.)Now, that all saidI did break this vow – but then, I saw it at home, once you get through the first half's retread of the classic story the promos laid out, the movie actually gets better. I did find myself enjoying the ""retelling/re-imagination"" story Tim Burton presented. Although, I still have yet to figure out why it HAD to be in black and white. Sure, it's because, again, it's an old story, but I don't think it needed to be without color.Young Victor brings his dog back to life after a tragic death scene and attempts to hide his secret and yapping dog. When other kids learn of this undead dog, they want infor the school science fair. Chaos ensues and it's a fun climax of corrections.Overall, the movie isn't up to par, even on Director/Writer Tim Burton's standards, or other ""fun"" animated tales. But, if you can make it through the first half – and you should, then you might be pleased with how Burton could turn his all-but boring (re-)introduction around.Side Note: A lot of people have criticized this as not being ""safe"" for young kids, i.e. too dark. Maybe, I'm desensitized, but I will admit, it's not for too-young children for being somewhat violent.Side Note II: Another example of way in excess, overkill advertising is this stupid horsey show I see billboards for up and down my work commute every morning and evening. There is a grand total of 7-8 billboards advertising some horse boutique ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD. I will not name it, because that's just fueling the fire I want extinguished. I mean, come on, I've heard this show is actually supposed to be good, but why do they have to over-advertise it, sometimes, every few feet with the same billboard advertisement? Even if it's good, I will never, ever, EVER see it because they've shoved it down my throat every day, up to 16 times. No need!",Frankenweenie
27,cherold,Entertaining trifle,7,22 June 2013,"Judged as a comedy, Frankenweenie isn't really that great. The humor is rarely more than mild. But the movie actually did a pretty good job with the story, which is well paced and has moments of genuine - if mild - suspense. It's also - and this is to be expected from any Tim Burton movie - really good looking, with stylish black and white animation and a cast of creepy looking kids.As someone familiar with the original movies, I appreciate the way it pays tribute to its source material. It is also wonderfully imaginative, most notably in the first resuscitation scene.One criticism; even by the standards of kids cartoons or old horror movies, this thing makes zero sense. The lack of any sort of logic is, however, so in-your-face that I accept it as purposeful and thus just accept that this is a movie that's not supposed to make any sense.",Frankenweenie
28,Robert_duder,Another dark entry into animation by the master of dark animation,7,11 January 2013,"Another reviewer said it perfectly. Its good but not great and that is the simplicity of it all. Sometimes animation can blow you away and yet I found 2012 to be the year of ""okay"" animation. This is the second type of animated film I watched that was extremely dark and more for adults than kids or at least older kids. In fact, I was surprised at just how identical to content and idea this was to Paranorman. The big difference for Frankenweenie is that it was helmed by the master of weird pseudo-horror Tim Burton. If you've seen his other animated entries then you'll know exactly what you're in for. The characters are good, in particular Victor and his dog, Sparky. Yes, the dog had a ton of personality and really captivates which bodes well considering he is the heart and soul of the movie. It is a fun take on the whole Frankenstein story but the entire idea of a loner child whose beloved pet is killed, and then brings him back to life is a little dark for the youngsters I think. But for older kids and adults, its fun and simple and doesn't try too hard which sort of leaves it in the ""okay"" category. The supporting characters (something Paranorman really excelled at) don't jump out at you. They don't have enough personality despite a really terrific cast.Charlie Tahan leads the voices well as young Victor. He has a ton of emotion in his voice and really makes you believe in his character. He gives the best performance of the entire vocal cast (impressive given the experts in this cast who get higher billing than he does.) The rest of the cast is made up of some incredible comedians and actors including the amazing Martin Short, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Landau, and Winona Ryder. I just really think they underused someone like Martin Short who can be so funny and versatile with his voices. You barely notice him and as Victor's father he is downright bland.When you combine talent like Burton with legends like Short and O'Hara I think you just expect more. The film is cute at times and I think even for a Burton film the dark angle will really take you aback but its still a decent movie to watch. The problem is nowadays the bar for animation is set so high by Pixar and like-minded studios that animation has to consistently be better than okay. I said the same thing for Brave which was a Pixar film but far from their previous outstanding classics. Frankenweenie is worth seeing but it won't blow you away and be cautious about the really young kids watching it because I'm afraid it will scare them and open a can of worms for parents everywhere when it comes to pets and death. 7/10",Frankenweenie
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Play dead, boy... oh.",6,20 April 2021,"'Frankenweenie (2012)' doesn't quite know what it wants to be, but for its first two thirds it actually works rather well as an offbeat, downplayed but inventive take on the 'Frankenstein' story. Although its characters all seem somewhat depressed, the film itself isn't dour at all. It's brisk, breezy and, generally speaking, enjoyable. In its third act, though, it completely loses its way and slips into bizarrely action-oriented madness. It just piles random - and incredibly obvious - monster movie references on top of one another until it reaches an almost arbitrarily dangerous climax. It just washes over you and leaves things on a fairly sour note. Still, it's not as if it's terrible. It's as well-animated as the rest of the feature and it doesn't stick around for too long, either. It's just so far away from what was previously the heart of the piece that it's really rather jarring. As a whole, though, the movie is a decent throw-back to the odd innocence of old horror. 6/10.",Frankenweenie
30,Cineanalyst,Spark of Pastiche,6,25 August 2018,"Right off the bat, I must say ""Sparky"" is a good name for a Frankenstein dog; at least, it's more befitting, if not as exotic, as ""Zoltan,"" the name for ""Dracula's Dog"" (1978). I also chuckled at the science teacher calling the parents ""stupid,"" but, otherwise, ""Frankenweenie"" isn't as funny or as clever as it's movie-reference-laden, stop-motion animation family fare may imply.In the beginning, it's mostly a pastiche of the 1930s Universal Frankenstein films. It's in black and white, full of shadows and grotesque or otherwise odd characters. A kid, of the same name as Mary Shelley's protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, reanimates his dead dog. His makeshift laboratory in the family home's attic is made up of the electrical charges of household appliances, but is otherwise very much like the lab in the 1931 film, full of blinking and spinning gizmos and requiring the spark of life from a lightning bolt. Unlike most other Frankenstein movies and the opposite of the original novel, this Frankenstein loves his creature.There are plenty of other nods to the Frankenstein films, including the poodle's hair turning to resemble the Bride in the 1935 sequel, a hunchbacked kid being named E. Gore, à la Ygor from ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939) and ""The Ghost of Frankenstein"" (1942), a windmill and fiery climax, a mob of townsfolk and another kid resembling Boris Karloff's monster, among others. Beyond that, the movie references a bunch of other horror movies, especially the B-picture monster variety. A giant turtle, especially, wrecks havoc on the town, and lest anyone misses the Godzilla-Gamera connection, the monster is the work of a kid of Japanese descent. Meanwhile, the Karloff-looking youngster reanimates a few tropes from the Mummy movie series, the first of which, the 1932 ""The Mummy,"" starred Karloff. In one scene, the Frankenstein parents watch Hammer's ""Dracula"" with Christopher Lee on TV. Hammer's series is well regarded for introducing color, gore and sex to horror films, which are entirely voided in this black-and-white children's movie. But, the Dracula theme returns later in the form of a flying half-bat-half-cat creature. There's also a pet cemetery, and the parents hide from the monster attack in a toilet, referencing ""Jurassic Park"" (1993), and a phone booth, as in ""The Birds"" (1963). Much, if not most, of the fun of ""Frankenweenie"" is spotting these quotations, but I'll stop here. I'm sure there are more.Moreover, the monstrous climax and the stop-motion animation of ""Frankenweenie"" itself is alluded to in a film-within-the-digital movie made by Victor and starring Sparky as the hero. Victor screens his film to his parents at the beginning of ""Frankenweenie,"" and it basically establishes what the rest of the outer movie is going to be about. Except it doesn't mention the corny sweetness that belies its homage to horror films. The science teacher tells Victor a load of malarkey about love being necessary for science, and the entire movie is about the boy's love for his dog. They should stop putting this cornball stuff in everything; they're giving everyone diabetes. It also sugarcoats an odd and tired message of quite a few movies that children know more than adults. According to ""Frankenweenie,"" they also love more; after all, Victor and Sparky run into the fire while the Frankenstein parents and the rest of the adults remain spectators. There's a lot of stereotype shorthand, as well, so stupid people are often fat and short, nerds tend to be tall and skinny, those with deformities are duplicitous or otherwise evil, etc.Anyways, the use of stop motion is somewhat interesting, although the 3D look and rounded faces of the characters contribute to making this look similar to CGI animation, which, indeed, the filmmakers employed to touch up their work. It's an interesting choice because the Frankenstein creation myth is analogous to the filmmaking process. Frankenstein's monster is created from once-living parts and is reanimated to life. In other movies, he's created from parts from various sources, which is also analogous to the editing process of film. That's somewhat lost here, although the dog is stitched back together--just like Victor stitches back together his film-within-the-movie. In live-action cinema, the analogy is more complete, too, because it involves recording living beings into still images (a figurative death) and reanimating them as motion pictures. Stop-motion animation and puppetry, on the other hand, involves animating inanimate objects. In more ways than one, the lack of a spark in ""Frankenweenie"" is due to it having no life to begin with.",Frankenweenie
31,g-bodyl,Tim Burton At His Best!,9,24 March 2014,"2012 is the year of animated horror films and this film, Frankenweenie might just be the best of the bunch. Tim Burton is at his best and is most effective here and this film gives off Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands vibes and that's a good thing. Filmed in stop-motion animation, this is a story that is creepy and borderline scary, but also funny and sometimes emotional.Burton's film is a story that digs deep. It's about a boy and his dog but there are some underlying themes prevalent such as friendship and tight, life-long bonds. Victor loses his dog, Sparky to an unfortunate accident, so Victor decides to reanimate his dog's corpse and things may not be the same afterwards.This film doesn't have many recognizable names here, but there are several Burton regulars here such as Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Martin Landau, and Winona Ryder. They all do a good job here.Overall, Frankenweenie is an excellent film and a good spoof of horror classics. I like the use of black and white because it adds to the film and almost make it seem fifty years old. This is a creepy but sometimes funny film.

The music is fabulous so is the stop motion animation. I am glad Disney reinvented it. I can say this is Tim Burton's greatest animated movie. After being fascinated by his Batman series, I am looking forward for more from him. I kinda like his weird ideas and ingenious plots. Splendid!Frankenweenie is a must watch for all the animation, horror and slapstick lovers. Because the whole plot is so interesting that you cannot miss it. It surely goes haywire towards the end, but I am pretty sure it will keep you hooked. The voices are great and the trivial use of humor just complements the whole film. Make your kids watch this because it's a way of life. For big morals and valuable life lessons with a horror punch, watch Frankenweenie! It shows a severe relationship of a boy with his dog and how far he goes to bring it back from dead. Yes, of course some plot points are way too imaginative and unrealistic, but yes the whole of FRANKESTEIN idea is also imaginative. But this one's better than Brave or ParaNorman.

They are able hours on top of hours to view all the nasty shows they can find and imagine.For them parents science like technology are dirty words and unbearable subjects that have to be kept away from the children's ears and from the dinner table, when there is a family dinner, once every blue moon. For them parents a science fair, festival, competition, fest or carnival only has one aim and goal: to learn how to be badder than bad and produce both Viagra and ecstasy.

The European accents only accentuate the Otherwhereness of these kids (the hunchbacked kid in particular left me laughing) and their collective decision to do as young Edward has done leads to some of the funniest scenes ever committed to film. PARANORMAN was fun, but FRANKENWEENIE is a true Master at the top of his ghastly game.

The script makes an interesting reinterpretation of the original Frankenstein. Throughout the film, Burton has honored Ed Wood, one of the worst directors in history of cinema. The story is easy to understand, it's not too adult for teenagers and not too childish for adults. The voice actors did a good and flawless work.However, it's not a particularly memorable film. The story entirely rounds around the dog and its owner in a very predictable manner. It has some moments of humor but we cannot say it's a funny movie.

(rental)",4,4 November 2017,"Frankenweenie is a fun adaptation of the classic Frankestein and also a Pet Semetary for kids Tim has already done it in 1984 in a amazing short movie with human cast For me that was enough! It was cool, moving, dark and crazy so his work should have been rest in peace! But no! Like his character, Tim wanted it back, with the power of Electr-Onics and this new animation is like Sparky, a gentle, kind companion with a lot of scars. It's a pity to see that today, artists have become lazy, without inspiration and new ideas: Lynch comes back to TP, Spielberg works on another Indiana Jones, Blade Runner has a sequel while the novel stands alone, U2 celebrates Joshua Tree, Waters does the Wall one more time, and I don't forget Alien, Star Trek, Star wars that work like industrial factories. So here you know what you will receive: nothing new! It has been already done and told so what do you except? Maybe the mass experiences were left of the short movie but if you have seen Gremlins or Ghostbusters, you know the flavor I already heard the racial complaints to have a bad Japanese student as nobody accepts difference and understands imagination! OK the movie is filled up into the bones with all the things that Tim likes and packs in one movie all the others but at the end, it stays nearly worthless (and even Danny's score is pretty much uninspired!) So there is a lesson: dead things are meant to left be still RIP",Frankenweenie

42,freemantle_uk,Tim Burton being Tim Burton,7,19 July 2014,"Tim Burton has had a tough few years with many of his newer films disappointing his fans and audiences. He returned to something more personal by turning his first short film, Frankenweenie into a feature length film. Frankenweenie is a film that Burton was committed to project, making a homage to Gothic horror films of the 30s, particularly Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein and mixing it with the 50s small town Americana of Edward Scissorhands and focusing on many outsiders. The Elementary School is populated by strange characters, Victor (Charlie Tahan), an intelligent boy more interested in science and filmmaking, Elsa (Winona Ryder), a depressed goth girl, Edgar ""E"" Gore, a creepy hunchback kid and ""Weird Girl"" (Catherine O'Hara), a girl who is obsessed with her cat's psychic visions.Frankenweenie is a fantastically animated film: Burton brings out a creepy look: the characters are deliberately exaggerated as it tells a story most people can relate to when we have suffered some sort of lost. Burton recreates the look of both old Black and White monster movies and B-Movies from the 50s. But this disadvantageous because Frankenweenie is a bit too much of a love letter to though films. The humour for the most part is mild with the funniest moment being when a Eastern European puts down the parents during a public meeting in the most condescending matter possible.Frankenweenie is a solid enough film with a running of 80 minutes. But it is essentially what you would think a Tim Burton film would be like.",Frankenweenie

Although its visual approach is quite different, trading kitschy live action for super-stylized stop motion, the first two acts are virtually unchanged. And while that dedication to the core concept surely deserves some praise, it also feels a bit thin for a ninety-minute feature. When it's not tossing out pocketfuls of sugary homage or good-natured parody, the plot seems startlingly content to just hang around and gaze back at the audience, right up until the climax arrives to slam on the gas and give us all a bad case of whiplash. A star-studded cast of underachieving voice actors doesn't help matters, either - Winona Ryder is particularly dry and soulless as the quiet, mumbling girl next door, and we never see quite enough of Catherine O'Hara or Martin Short. The animation work is top-notch, though, serving as a nice reminder that not everything needs to be computer generated to succeed in modern Hollywood.",Frankenweenie

47,3xHCCH,Not for Young Kids At All,5,21 January 2013,"I am really NOT a fan of Tim Burton's dark and macabre stop-animated films. I have to admit I did not like his classics like ""Corpse Bride"" or ""A Nightmare Before Christmas."" Now, I'm afraid I would have to add ""Frankenweenie"" to that list.""Frankenweenie"" is about a boy Victor who just lost his beloved dog Sparky to a heart-breaking car accident. Inspired by his eccentric science teacher, Victor devised a machine to bring dear Sparky back to life. His friends try to copy his experiment set-up to revive other dead creatures with various disastrous effects, wreaking havoc on their town. The film is essentially a homage of sorts for the Frankenstein movies, with side tributes to other monsters seen in similar classic campy horror flicks of old.First off, I believe this movie is not really for kids below 10 years old at all. The subject matter is way too mature, darkly intense and disturbing for their young sensibilities. The imagery of the dead coming back to life can be the subject of nightmares for many kids, especially those events that transpire in the second half of this film. Technically, the stop animation here is a throwback to old style unsophisticated animation, in contrast with the very polished looking stop animation employed in a similar kiddie horror film released also last year, ""ParaNorman."" And that one had the more family-friendly horror story to boot. I would not have watched ""Frankenweenie"" if it were not nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature this year. Now that I have seen all five nominees, I would probably give the award to either ""ParaNorman"" or ""Wreck-It Ralph.""",Frankenweenie
48,TOMNEL,"Sweet, nostalgic and chalk full of old monster movie references.",9,8 October 2012,"Tim Burton detractors and fans alike seem to agree that his recent offerings have not been up to par with his best, or even his middle works. One criticism is that he is just repeating himself visually, without anything to say or show. This film definitely is a repeat, being a remake of an earlier Burton short, and an homage to monster movies in general, but it's got a great heart, and unlike ""Alice in Wonderland"", this one is a Burton pet project (no pun intended). As a result, you can just feel that he wanted to make this, and for a black and white movie about death, this is really a lovely tale.Young Victor's dog Sparky is run over by a car one day, leaving poor Victor depressed. After a lesson from his new science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau doing a cross between Vincent Price and Bela Lugosi), Victor realizes he can bring Sparky back from the dead. Soon, other students at the local elementary school bring their pets and various animals back from the dead also, to try and win the upcoming science fair. Things don't go quite as planned, when the animals turn into monstrous creatures and chaos ensues.What drives this movie is it's heart. Victor's love towards Sparky is very apparent, and Sparky is such an innocent little thing, that it's hard not to like him. The characterization for Sparky is perfect, having him easily excitable and sweet, but not obnoxious, as dogs can be. This movie should especially hit home for those who've previously or currently have/had a dog. The scene where Sparky is hit by a car is heart breaking, and the ending (which I won't give away) will also stir a lot of emotions in you. Sparky is such a loyal, caring and innocent dog, where anything that happens to him, you immediately begin to empathize. The visual style is what you'd expect from Mr. Burton. Either characters look emaciated with long bony arms and stretched out faces, or they're morbidly obese with fat sprouting from their back. It works well, and sometimes for comedic effect, like that of Weird Girl's cat Mr. Whiskers, which brings laughs to every scene it's in. Burton rides the line on character designs often between unique and slightly grotesque, but the line is never crossed here. These characters are unique, and they inhabit a visually appealing world. To give the characters life, are the voice actors, all of whom are superb. Especially good are Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short who provide three voices, all of them unique to their characters.If there's something wrong with the picture, it might be that Victor and his family are the least interesting characters here. Victor is a fine lead, because he has these bizarre classmates and his dog to support him, but by himself, he would be a fairly flat character. Perhaps this is to make him and his family more of the typical townsfolk type (some alliteration there), while most of the other major characters are strange looking homages to movie monsters, and have a lot more personality in general. But, if Victor was more bubbly and bouncy, he wouldn't be the kind of quiet introvert that he is here, so it's a double edged sword. This is a small complaint really, and it's not something that will bother most people.""Frankenweenie"" has the ability to draw on the audience's own personal nostalgia for their own furry lost loved one's, but even those that aren't dog people should feel something here. This is a very sweet film, beneath it's monster movie exterior, and at the heart of the picture is a boy who loves his dog and doesn't want to lose him. Any fans of old monster movies should love the references, and any fan of Burton's past work should find some pleasure in the visual look here. Even Burton detractors may find this one hits pretty close to home for them. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 87 mins. PG for some violence and thematic elements.",Frankenweenie
49,aidanratesmovies,"Could have been better, could have been worse",6,25 October 2021,"A mildy enjoyable, albeit all too familiar little creature feauture- Tim Burton largely uses Frankenweenie as a tribute to many 1940's and 1950's horror favorites- but not much else. I feel like this film could have been a lot better had the script been given the chance to stand on its own two legs, or I guess in this films case, four legs. At it's core it's a sweet simple story about a kid and his love for his dog, but in terms of substance, it lacks much else besides that. Many of the characters are quirky and wired, and the films style and look is fascinating to watch and look at- but it seems to be missing something. It doesn't have Burton's signature charm, and rather, feels like Disney is taking the helm of a Burton project and shaping it into what they seem is best fit for their box office gross. I enjoy the look of the film as well as the black and white pov and stop motion animation. It isn't much of an original film, nor is it particularly interesting, but it's a good Halloween flick to have on in the background I suppose. In the end, Frankenweenie proves to be on the decent side of Disney's remake extravaganza, but lacks the originality and charm that makes Burton's films so memorable to begin with. It may not be good as his past efforts, but it certainly could have been a lot worse.My Rating: 5.6/10.",Frankenweenie
50,dalydj-918-255175,Frankenweenie is cute be dramatic when it needs to be,8,1 November 2012,"""Finally Tim Burton has made a film showing the talent he once had"" Back in 1984 when Tim Burton started working for Disney he made a short about a dog that was brought back to life by his owner. 28 years he makes the short into a full animated film. The story is simply about a young child named Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) who is best friends with his dog Saprky but when Sparky dies he tries to bring him back to life through methods his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) showed him to. When he brings the dog back to life he seems happy until other kids at school find out he has done this and try to bring back dead animals or objects back to life. This then leads to the end of the film which is where Victor has to save the day while keeping sparky safe at the same time.Tim Burton is one of our most visionary director because he knows his style and he does not let anyone try to change his mind. That has been his problem because even though his movies have been so over the top audiences have loved it but critics and pure movie fans have had really big issues with his films. With this film he has finally been able to connect to me. I enjoyed this film more then any films he has made over the last decade is because the film was purely about the animation and not about trills. The animation fits well with his style because he gets to create this strange looking human figures that do not work live action but it does work better in animation.Victor Frankenstein the main character is voiced by Charlie Tahan and he is OK but compared to all the other characters he is less interesting. The most interesting characters in this film are the kids that cause trouble for Victor. My favourite character design that was done was for the little girl who's eyes just stayed so wide open and it was just very funny. Most of the characters seem based around monster type characters most noticeable in Edgar ""E"" Gore who is based on the character design of Igor. Martin Landau plays the science teacher and in his short scene in the class room he made such an impression as he was based on one of Burton's childhood hero's in Vincent Prince.If Burton wants to get back into good graces with critics he should continue on the track he is made with this film. The animation was the best part of this film because each character seemed like they had so much detail put into them and it was great to see that Burton can make a good film if he does not go to big with his ambitions.MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Charlie Tahan)",Frankenweenie
51,jadepietro,Burton's Monster Mash-up,8,9 October 2012,"This film is recommended.Frankenweenie, Tim Burton's latest stop motion-animated fantasy film, is a re-animated black ( and-white ) comedy about a re-animator that is wonderfully bizarre, macabre, and with enough adult asides and tongue-in-cheek humor that only older audience members can fully savor. ( Younger kids will still enjoy the film, but Burton's sly references and his homage to 50's Hollywood horror films will be lost on that generation of moviegoers. ) Filmed in 3-D, the director's latest venture is based on his earlier 1984 short that starred two very young newcomers named Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern. That live-action short became a cult success after Burton was unceremoniously fired by Disney, the same studio who is producing this expanded animated version. Back then, the studio did not release the film, claiming that the young animator had wasted company resources and feeling that the film was too scary for young audience. ( It still is. ) Now, more than 25 years later, Burton has joined forces with his former employer. Strange bedfellows indeed! Strange results too!Frankenweenie (2012) still tells the same story, essentially adding new characters and some flourishes to help pad out the length of the film to an acceptable 90 minutes of mayhem and humor. For those who may not know the basic story, it goes like this: Little Victor loves Sparky, his loyal companion and dog buddy, and like most pets, Sparky unconditionally loves Victor. All goes well in this 50's suburban utopia until one day, Sparky meets with an unfortunate accident and dies. Later, a remorseful Victor discovers that electrical shocks can create temporary lifelike reactions as he learns from an experiment with a dead frog in one of his science classes at school. ( Yes, I remember those gross labs with their icky chloroformed specimens too! ) That idea sparks Victor into bringing Sparky back to life with some serious consequences happening to his family, his beloved Sparky, and their odd neighborhood friends.Frankenweenie is a visual delight. Burton's fine satirical edge and his fondness for lost childhood innocence bolsters his artistic energies. Burton takes on the Frankenstein legend in animated form and enlivens the story with enough humor and pathos to give this film version an euphoric soul. His trademark characters with their unique stylization and exaggerated features create an exhilarating strange ( almost ) new world. At times, these characters too closely resemble some of the filmmaker's other past film creations. ( The Night Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, and Edward Scissorhands quickly come to mind. ) Yes, Burton may be stealing from himself, but his twisted mind is uniquely his own creation. Yet, the overall effect of Frankenweenie is one of pure joy, even if it unfortunately falls apart in the film's final half hour, largely due to John August's overwrought screenplay. ( May I digress a bit: Lately this seems to be an on-going malady with most of today's films. Let's call it Unfinished Concept Syndrome, an affliction caused when the ending fails to exceed any film's successful beginnings. It is rampant and building to epidemic proportions. A heavy dose of rewriting is the only cure. Now back to the film...)The sight gags are abundant in Frankenweenie and the time-consuming stop motion animation is fascinating to behold, but the dialog and plotting is not as clever as it could be. The script introduces certain uninteresting characters and complicates this charmingly simple story of a boy and his dog unnecessarily. These minor characters ( crude-looking classmates like Bob and Toshiaki, and Victor's one-note neighbor, Mr. Burgemeister ) and other re-animated creatures ( sea monkeys ) do little to advance the story and become plot devices used to overdo the spoofing of other monster movie legends rather than rely on the film's central duo. However, the characters do come to life not only due to with Burton's many imaginative touches but also because of excellent voice-over work by Charlie Tahan as Victor, Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara doing Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein and other assorted characters, and Winona Ryder as Elsa Van Helsing. Also providing top support are Atticus Shaffer as Victor's friend, Edgar E. Gore, and Martin Landau as Victor's science teacher, Mr. Rzykruski, a Vincent Price clone with a similar Legosi accent which is absolutely hysterical.Also, there are several memorable sequences that register among Burton's best examples of film animation. ( These stand-outs include the makeshift laboratory scene in Victor's attic with everyday household appliances substituting for the real electrical gizmos, Sparky's frantic chase at the fair, and the windmill sequence with its skewed perspectives. ) Burton's use of shadow and light, his glorious contrast of white, black, and gray tones, and his quirky details to most of the characters are remarkable achievements in animation, especially evident in Sparky, Victor, Weird Girl, and the aforementioned Mr. R. The director again looks to his musical collaborator, Danny Elfman, to create a score to ideally match the comic weirdness which Elfman does seamlessly.Frankenweenie may be slightly flawed but its creative spirit is wholly alive and needs no resuscitation, even if it occasionally meanders from its small but heartfelt beginnings. There are some unneeded detours in the lackluster script and some minor characters really become extraneous to the film's main action. But as long as Burton stays close to that beguiling Victor and Sparky relationship, the film can do no wrong. Even with its shortcomings, Frankenweenie is alive!!! Alive!!!

53,RainDogJr,Frankenstein's Monsters,10,17 October 2012,"I recently wrote a commentary on Kevin Smith's JERSEY GIRL, and there I mentioned Tim Burton. The reason was the well-known (at least for fans of Smith) ""conflict"" between the mentioned two directors; a ""conflict"" that began with the insinuation that Burton had stolen something of his PLANET OF THE APES version from Smith's work. Anyway, I'm mentioning this just to bring a quote from Smith about this whole stuff: ""Great minds think alike, mother*****!"" While I was watching FRANKENWEENIE I recalled a very cool story that deals with two other filmmakers. One American and one British: Quentin Tarantino and Edgar Wright. What do they have to do with Burton and his remake of the short film he made for Disney back in '84? Well, you'll find out in the next paragraph but pretty much all deals with that ""great minds think alike"" quote. The story is part of the awesome commentary track that Wright and Tarantino did for the HOT FUZZ DVD/Blu-Ray. And it took place while they were watching the final battle of that film, between Simon Pegg and Timothy Dalton; that battle takes place in a model village so yes, Pegg and Dalton look like giants fighting in the middle of a town. Then Tarantino unfolds an idea he had for his KILL BILL; he wanted badly to pay homage to yet another type of Asian movies in KILL BILL: the ""Big Giant Tokyo Monster Movies"". Quentin wanted to have the Bride and Elle Driver ""taking a pill to grow 20 feet high"" and ""have their big-giant-battle-royal amongst the town and destroying buildings"". Freakin' cool, right? However Mr. Tarantino couldn't figure out a way to do it ""realistically in that universe, not our universe"" – he remarks that, on the contrary, Mr. Wright could. However, is never clear whether Wright intended or not his scene as homage to the Japanese monster movies. What's clear is that Tarantino now can be now jealous of Tim Burton too since in the new FRANKENWEENIE Burton did figure out a realistic way (in that universe) to have not a giant human character but actually a freakin' turtle growing to giant size! Since the '84 short Burton was paying homage to Japanese monster cinema; the short actually opens with Sparky the dog as a Godzilla-sized monster destroying a city. Burton's ""realistic"" way to have that was having his main character Victor Frankenstein (the kid) as the director of a monster movie, which featured his dog (a precursor of Uggie from THE ARTIST if you will). That opening was improved in this remake – now the homage is simply marvelous, with some shots that perfectly recreate the style of those Japanese flicks. Burton remained faithful to his short film – pretty much everything from the short is here, from that opening to the dead frog. Being an animated project this time, Burton had the chance to create a whole lot more emotion with the dog; the main improvement comes in that element since most of the scenes from the short involving Sparky were done with POV shots. I mean, it's understandable as he was working with a real dog and I'm not judging the short but really just pointing out that Burton make the most of the possibilities that animation offer to create emotion. Needless to say, the stop-motion work is priceless and the sets are extremely beautiful and detailed (as I could personally witness at the ""Art of Frankenweenie"" exhibition). Then, the original short film was all about the idea (the FRANKENSTEIN story done with a boy and his dog) and the people's reaction to it; the film, now that the idea is well-known for everyone, is all about emotion and, of course, the freakin' giant (Gamera-like) turtle! I had a great time with it and it's definitely Burton's best or better said, his only worth watching one (maybe with the single exception of CORPSE BRIDE) since 2003's BIG FISH. PS: THE WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS (aka SANDA VERSUS GAIDA), directed by Ishiro Honda, is the film Quentin mentions in the HOT FUZZ commentary track. ""Gargantuas"" is the sequel to the film FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD (a Japanese monster movie with the FRANKENSTEIN story).

54,p-stepien,Burtonesque Essence,8,25 January 2013,"Many of Burton's fans would agree that the gothically enticing director is at his dark best when sifting through the world of animation. ""The Night Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"", for all their narrative limitations, permeate with a murky essence of originality and creative opulence. When Burton returned to his debut short to expand it into a feature the result are invariably captivating with his creepy animated models and campy goth endeavour.""Frankenweenie"" is to some extent a return to the source after several failed movies, which continued to add to Burton's growing list of critics for his one-minded limitations. First conceived back in the 1980s, the full length feature tells the story of small town boy Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), who decided to reanimate his beloved dog, dead after being run over by a car. Lonely and detached from school Victor becomes inspired by his science teacher Mr Rzykruski (Martin Landau), thus attempting to revitalise his pooch with some lightning and ingenuity. When classmates discover Victor's success, they soon attempt to replicate this experiment...Probably nothing original in terms of narrative, following well-treaded paths and offering a recognisable and affable (family fare type) denouement reached by the use of a standard, but well-scripted narrative, ""Frankenweenie"" nonetheless trades with atmosphere abundant of the dusky realm of Burton's sensibility and vision. Inspired by horror movies of old, but coupled with your family movie genre, Burton offers a darkly humorous feature, which may feel familiar script-wise, but is touched by vintage Burton eccentricity. Possibly not enough focus was given to actually imbue higher emotionality to characters or the key interaction between Victor and his reanimated dog (making the story a bit hollow), but overall the flawed exposure of characters are hardly noticeable for the enjoyment of this little stop-motion animation gem.",Frankenweenie

It is a heartwarming and hilarious movie that I thoroughly enjoyed viewing.Frankenweenie is a touching story about a boy named Victor and his dog Sparky. When Victor sadly loses his dog in an accident, he is heartbroken, but then he becomes determined to bring his dog back to life with the power of science. He has to hide his creation from everyone because people would freak out if they knew he had brought his dead dog back to life. But when Sparky gets out, Victor's fellow students, teachers and the entire town have to stop the monstrous destruction of the town.Victor (Charlie Tahan) is a smart and clever 10-year-old boy who loves science, making films and inventing things in his attic. He lives with his parents and his dog Sparky in the town of New Holland. Sparky is a fun-loving and playful dog who loves his owner Victor very much. He loves chasing after balls and being the star of Victor's homemade movies. Mr. Frankenstein (Martin Short) is Victor's dad, a friendly talent agent who is very outgoing and who likes to give advice to his son. He is proud of Victor's accomplishments, but he is concerned he doesn't have any friends besides Sparky. He would prefer his son to be more social and he encourages him to join the baseball team. Victor's mom, Mrs. Frankenstein (Catherine O'Hara), is a loving and supportive mother who encourages her son to do what he loves most, which is science. She loves her family, reading books and watching movies with her husband. All of the actors' performances are fantastic, including Atticus Shaffer, who plays Brick on the sitcom ""The Middle,"" film star Winona Ryder and Oscar-winner Martin Landau.The thing I love the most about this movie is that it is a stop-motion picture. Stop-motion means that each character is a puppet and the animator must stop and position the puppet and take a picture each time, and once that is all put together, it creates filmed action. I think the stop-motion animation in this movie came out great. What's really interesting is that all of the characters from Frankenweenie are based on Tim Burton's very own drawings.This movie is very funny, heartfelt and packed with action. To make it even better, this movie is in 3-D. Even though it is rated PG, there are some parts that are a little scary and, honestly, a little creepy! I really think Frankenweenie will appeal to adults because of the relatable humor. I recommend this movie for anyone from the age of 6 to 70 years old. I am giving this movie five out of five stars! You can see Frankenweenie in theaters October 5th. Trust me, you don't want to miss seeing this movie. For more reviews by KIDS FIRST!, go to kidsfirst.org",Frankenweenie
56,moviexclusive,"A classic love story between a boy and his dog that also pays homage to the creature horror classics of old, this animation is one of Tim Burton's most moving films",8,12 November 2012,"Before Tim Burton cemented his status in Hollywood with 'Peewee's Big Adventure' and 'Beetlejuice', the well-known eccentric director made a live-action black-and-white film called 'Frankenweenie' in 1984. That short has been expanded to feature-length proportions here – thanks to frequent Burton collaborator/ screenwriter John August – and this classic love story between a boy and his dog loses none of its Burton- esque charm in the process.August retains the concept of Burton's earlier short in the first half of the movie, where we are introduced to Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), a shy, socially awkward but brilliant geek whose best friend is his faithful bull terrier named Sparky. The only child of Mr and Mrs Frankenstein (Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara respectively), Victor lives with his parents in the perfect American suburb of New Holland, where in his free time he makes Super 8 films with his toys, improvised props and of course Sparky.His life is turned upside down one day when Sparky dies in an auto accident while chasing his baseball down a street - and just as in the short, Sparky is buried under a large tombstone at the top of the hill in a creepy cemetery. Nonetheless, Victor's grief turns out to be short- lived – watching his Vincent Price-inspired science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (voiced by Martin Landau) apply an electric current to make a dead frog move its legs, Victor is inspired to do likewise to bring Sparky back to life by using lightning in the midst of a thunderstorm.Needless to say, Victor's experiment is successful – and after a scene that directly recalls 'Frankenstein', Sparky is back none the worse for the wear, save for a number of visible stitches and screws around his body. Before we get to the part where Victor's parents find out what he's done, August comes up with a whole new second act not in Burton's short. A science fair is coming up, and all the other local kids want to emulate Victor's breakthrough – whether it is to their pet cat in the case of Victor's next-door neighbour simply named Weird Girl (O'Hara again) or to one of the other pets in the cemetery long buried in the case of Victor's loathsome schoolmate Edgar (Atticus Shaffer).The reanimating game allows Burton's imagination to go wild, as all manner of monsters from the cinematic world of creature features descend upon the quiet town to terrorise its folk at a night fair. Burton's love for the genre is palpable, squeezing in multiple references to the classics of yesteryear – besides the evil beasties from 'Gremlins', a 'Godzilla-like' monster also appears courtesy of Japanese-American kid Toshiaki's (James Hiroyuki Liao) late pet turtle. Nonetheless, their inclusion does make the climax more bloated than it probably should have been – though fans aren't likely to mind the nostalgia.Neither are followers of Burton-esque likely to mind – as always, the characters are winsomely eccentric both in manner and more so in design. Moulded in the signature Burton style of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Corpse Bride', they have stick-thin limbs atop elongated egg-shaped faces with golf-ball like eyes, and in their uniquely weird and wonderful looks are not only differentiated from each other but given a unique personality.But Burton's visual achievement here goes way beyond the character design – for the first time, he has chosen to adopt a monochrome palette for the movie, a stylistic choice that might seem alienating at first for the modern-day audience so accustomed to stories told in rich dynamic colours but really an artistically inspired one that accentuates the very telling of the tale. The shadings and shadows are handled beautifully here, and kudos to Burton and his art directors Tim Browning and Alexander Walker for creating a visually stunning world just in black and white.If Burton's eye for the macabre is just as sharp here as with most of his movies, what ultimately makes this stand out from the rest is genuine poignancy. Victor is no less a misfit than the lead protagonist from his other films, but the central bond here between a boy and his dog that goes to the heart of just how much one is willing to do for the other is a love story that is relatable to young and old alike. Sure, there will be some scenes that may scare younger audiences given its inclination as a homage to the creature horror subgenre, but this is also one of Burton's most moving films, and such an enthralling fantasy deserves to be enjoyed by the whole family.",Frankenweenie
57,mike48128,A Unique Stop-Action Halloween Treat!,10,28 October 2017,"With a last name like ""Frankenstien"" (Intentionally misspelled) the story is obvious. Following a 1984 mini-version, this remake does not disappoint. Like ""Young Frankenstein"" filmed in black and white, of course. Inspired by his creepy science teacher, Victor puts together an elaborate collection of kitchen gadgets and electric wiring and manages to reanimate his beloved (dead) ""Sparky"" bull terrier complete with a sewed-on tail and stitches. Following that success, his creepy classmates do the same with their dead pets so that there is a monstrously-large rampage of a giant Godzilla-turtle, a were-rat, and annoying giant gremlin-like ""Sea Monkeys"" that look like the fanciful drawing on the packet's cover. Extremely well animated, in the grand style of Wallace and Grommit, George Pal's Puppetoons, and Ray Harryhausen. No movie is ""purrfect"" and I totally dislike the monstrous ""Bat-Cat"" monster created by lightning. The movie is set in 1950's America in the quaint little town of New Holland, which helps justify the typical burning windmill and villagers wielding lit torches at the climax. Sparky again manages to save-the-day and absorbs all the evil electric energy out of the giant creations, rendering them dead again. Several references to many other horror films throughout, including ""Bambi vs. Godzilla"" and ""Pet Cemetery"". Sparky dies again and is revived again with a ""jump start"" from the townspeople's car batteries. The cute French Poodle next door ends up with a gray lightning streak through her hair just like the ""Bride of Frankenstein""! It may be a bit long for some critics, but I loved almost every minute of it. The animation, sets, and props are incredible! Humorous note: Many ""reviewers"" took this movie far too seriously. Most of the puppets are fanciful exaggerations bordering on stereotypes. I don't recall ever seeing anyone ""real"" with a hunchback or as creepy as Victor's classmates who resemble various movie characters. One reviewer said it showed animal abuse. Quite impossible, as these are all just puppets and nothing is really alive! Enjoy this great Halloween treat!",Frankenweenie
58,valadas,"Funny, horrible and sentimental",7,13 May 2013,This animation movie combines these 3 features in an adequate proportion. A young boy who loves making amateur films in which his beloved dog Sparky is the main character sees it killed by a car on the road. He plunges into a deep sorrow for this loss and becomes obsessed with the idea of resuscitating Sparky. He learns at school that electricity can put life back into a dead animal's muscles and uses a thunder lightning to put successfully Sparky back to life after a few complicated actions. But the problem is that some of his fellow schoolmates take possession of this secret of him and adapt it to their dead pets which begets a big confusion in town and that is where a bit of horror and drama comes in without making the movie lose its funny and sentimental nature. This black and white version is properly adequate to the general atmosphere of the movie and the fact that the human characters are physically depicted in grotesque and even ugly figures very far from the usual beautiful characters we use to see in this kind of movies makes this animation movie very original in its kind not troubling us at all because faces and bodies are symbolically very meaningful after all. An agreeable movie to be seen.,Frankenweenie
59,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but it suffered thanks to modern humor",6,7 February 2015,"I loved the 1984 film Frankenweenie as a little kid, but I went to see this version of Frankenweenie not expecting much. For starters, it's a Disney movie, and Disney loves dumbing down a story to make it more cheerful - they seem to do this more for the parental audience than the kids - and judging by the trailer alone I knew that this movie wouldn't be very good.Well, it was better than I expected, at least animation-wise. It was typical Tim Burton animation, Gothic and bizarre and filmed in black and white to evoke a b-movie atmosphere. The voice cast wasn't bad; they brought back some of Tim Burton's more well-known cast members like Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands).That being said, this movie is lacking a lot. The ending is abrupt and seems fake, this movie really needs a better ending. No wonder kids today are growing up thinking that they don't even have to try in school because ""everything has a happy ending"". I can't believe this movie stooped to toilet humor too, putting crude humor into a movie always takes away from the story and it's immature and disgusting. Sure, it might make the lowest common denominator of society laugh, but there's just some things the world can do without, and crude humor is one of them. Only in the 21st century, eh? The plot sort of ran right off the rails when the other secondary characters started bringing their deceased pets back to life, we had a cat, a tortoise and a number of other animals just wandering around for no reason and by that point I sort of just gave up trying to pay attention.It's too bad that a movie with a lot of potential ended up being kind of a dud. This definitely isn't a Tim Burton movie I care to remember, I think his movies like Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Beetlejuice, Vincent, The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Corpse Bride had much more of an impact on me than any of his others. Maybe it's because Disney bought him off, but his work just isn't what it used to be.",Frankenweenie
60,rivertam26,Almost there,7,13 October 2012,I feel a little biased perhaps in my opinion of this movie cause the dog reminded me of my dog Yoshi a lot. And in that sense I felt myself completely engaged by the material and it's effect on me was pretty solid. Tim Burton goes almost bad to his roots in this darkly comic and morbid tale of a young boy whose pet dies and he decides to try and bring him back to life. Lots of inspired gags ensure as well as a nifty trip to the pet cemetery and some freakish mutations. But the films real magic lies in it's two main characters although I really did love the creepy girl with cat. Although a little generic in places Frankenweenie is a really unique cinematic experience a film that doesn't really cater to a specific audience but is a thing all it's own much like in the vein of Burtons best work Bettlejuice and Edward Scissorhands. Although not a complete success it's definitely a step in the right direction.,Frankenweenie
61,punishmentpark,Animated upgrade of the original short.,7,25 February 2015,"I was surprised to learn that this was actually a (3D) stop-motion film. I don't know the details of it, and how much was later added and altered by computer, but still, I thought it was 'just' a 'long cartoon'...I just went and saw the original 'Frankenweenie' (1984) after this one, and this is quite the upgrade. Better characters, better details, better story, pretty much everything is better about this one - although the L.A. setting of the original was quite nice I must say. To find this sort of rather dark animation in the mainstream segment these days is in any case refreshing.Tim Burton's sideline criticism on the American schooling system is a plus, though it's pretty much forgotten in the spectacular finale. Not really a problem. The wonderful and fantastic world(s) of Burton are (mildly) subversive in their own right anyway.A big 7 out of 10.",Frankenweenie

63,JvH48,"Entertainment for the whole family. The 3D is not a gimmick here, and not too much showing off what 3D can do. Beware of the un-science that you'll see",7,24 October 2012,"I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. It was the 2nd one in 3D in my whole life. I booked tickets notwithstanding some prejudice, because of the 1st one that had 3D-effects becoming a nuisance and far fetched, apparently showing off what 3D as a new medium made possible. This time I must say that it was not overly pushy, hence not that much distracting from the real contents.Many very unscientific things are happening in the name of science. If your educational background is in physics (like me), you'll have to grind your teeth from time to time);-))Perfect music score throughout, unobtrusive but still present and useful all along the proceedings.Given the many things that go wrong in the story at hand, I could not anticipate the double happy ending. Luckily they did not overdo it, unlike what we see in some feel-good-movies. Even a rationalistic nerd (me) could not prevent some tears from appearing.A superficial observant would describe the film as mostly suitable for children, but I disagree. The story line kept we awake all the time. That includes the black/white (literally and metaphorically) pictured characters that live in the hopefully fictitious village. Ditto for the overload of very unscientific experiments that nevertheless succeed, probably making fun of scientists who not always succeed in making clear what they are talking about.Typically directed to an elder audience is the way we see the convenient lies of the parents exposed. They admit later on that they are in the habit of easily promising things that are impossible by definition, like bringing the dog Sparky back to life after he is run over by a passing car. We observe more such ""meta"" observations in the course of the very unusual things happening in this film.All in all, I was very satisfied that I choose this film and ignored my 3D prejudices. I scored a 5 (out of 5) for the audience award when leaving the theater. I wonder whether the fact that the film is all black/white, will scare away the average audience, condemning it to be from a previous era and thus only interesting for old people. That may be a risk that the film makers took, and we can only wait to see how it works out on the box office.",Frankenweenie
64,Hollywood_Yoda,A Wonderful Film,10,31 March 2013,"I was fortunate enough to have seen ""Frankenweenie"" on its release in 3D along with my son, who was overjoyed and loved it. Definitely a movie that kids will connect with and love. Even though its in black and white (to keep with Frankenstein tradition), the movie still holds your attention in these two colors.It was truly exceptional to see in 3D and worth the extra ticket price. Tim Burton has outdone himself on this film, much better quality than some of his previous work, including ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" in 1993.Comparable to his 1984 short (Frankenweenie starring Daniel Stern and Shelly Duvall) however, this film adds extra plot points and an extended monster sequence. I especially liked the voice cast for this film. Even though they are stock actors for Burton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O'Hara stood out in this foray into animation. The best voice over that I heard was that of Martin Short, a great comedic actor.",Frankenweenie
65,natashabowiepinky,They've gotta learn sooner or later...,6,15 August 2013,"If anywhere there was a braver ending needed, it's here. Kids could have learned that life is but fleeting, we all suffer heartbreak sooner or later, say goodbye to the ones we love... This is an important lesson indeed. But, no. In the interest of a few mums and dads having to tolerate some waterworks on the way home from the cinema, Burton decides to go for what is essentially a cop out. Rather cowardly, if you ask me.The whole film has the feel of an old B movie (but is set in the present day) as it is shot entirely in black and white and contains more than one horror reference. Spookiness pervades the atmosphere, as Danny Elfman's Gothic score meanders in the background like a funeral march. Poor Victor loses his dog, and his mourning and subsequent resurrection of his pet carries real emotion weight.This doesn't last though, as the plot stretches to Victor's classmates experimenting on other deceased creatures, turning them into freaks of nature that invade the town. This is an arresting spectacle, but a betrayal of what transpired before... turning the movie from a personal tale about a boy and his half-dead canine, into an OTT monster movie. It feels like a different film, and not one that matched up to the poignant first half.Not for one minute would I suggest I could tell Mr Burton how to do his job. But I think less action, and more storytelling would have improved the final reel no end... As well as a more courageous conclusion. Oh well, everyone's a critic (Most don't enunciate their thoughts as well as I do, though)... ;) 6/10",Frankenweenie
66,Animany94,Cute and spooky enough to be memorable.,7,17 July 2018,"I liked Frankenweenie and how it tackled how an outcast can be so attached to something and therefore will do everything to keep it. That ties well into its tribute to old horror movies. Trying to make a dead dog come back to life via his science project at school was clever, but since I knew about how Frankenweenie is a tribute to old horror movies it got a little predictable to me. The horror references are quite obvious, like a Vincent Price lookalike and the fact that a couple of Victor's classmates are designed to look like other well known characters. Speaking of the characters, they're not that interesting. Mostly they can be summed up in a few words or a short sentence. But their voice performances are good and the science teacher is enjoyably eccentric and is my favorite character along with the adorable Sparky.Despite its mostly one-note characters and a bit of predictability it was a good and clever hooror tribute with a cute dog and a slow pace building up to a spooky and funny climax. Maybe not Tim Burton's best work, but one to check out.",Frankenweenie

From a lovable and captivating drama it jumped right into the bowels of horror (aspect which I didn't like) leaving with the impression that the man who wrote the script remained without any ideas. I can't say that I was disappointed by its finale but it was a bit, let's say inconclusive although it was positive. I really liked the animation, the fact that it was presented in black and white really gave it a great feeling but it was unfortunately let down (quite badly I'd say) by its plot.

69,DarthVoorhees,A mixed bag of bones,5,9 February 2013,"Tim Burton has made a quintessential Tim Burton movie and the problem is that it is a Tim Burton movie in the worst possible way. 'Frankenweenie' is a cute little movie but being cute isn't enough to sustain it. Once the viewer has gotten past saying 'awww' at the cute little doggie 'Frankenweenie' becomes a very boring and predictable movie. It's gorgeous to look at but in the end Burton populates his film with soulless characters(which for all of Burton's strengths is his Achilles' heal).'Frankenweenie' is a cute character and film. The dog is utterly adorable and anyone who loves dogs will love 'Frankenweenie' to a certain degree. I think the story of a boy and his dog is so classic and tugs at so many hearts that it kind of blinds people to when it is done badly as it is here. The dog is cute but the boy is boring. 'Frankenweenie' does not understand adolescence and thus it kind of fails at developing a rapport with it's audience in my opinion. Victor Frankenstein doesn't act like a real kid, he merely goes through the motions with hyper intensified trappings of childhood surrounding him. Burton loves archetypes and so instead of building characters he goes for crazy archetypes to substitute for character development. The sports vs. science fiction conflict is what is on Victor's plate for a good chunk of 'Frankenweenie' and I'm sorry but this is boring and predictable. 'Frankenweenie' doesn't have a single character in it. Burton has taken molded characters and sets them free on rigid paths. I just find this all the more disappointing in a children's movie because children's movies should give children's intelligence credit. But at least the dog is cute.The animation is of course stellar and Burton stages brilliant effects sequences that really showcase the quirkiness of everything. I was really hoping for something in the line of 'Beetlejuice' and while 'Beetlejuice' had a much better script visually 'Frankenweenie' does have moments that match the high points of that film. The film is at it's best when it acknowledges it's inspiration. I loved seeing scenes that hearken back to the Universal Monsters. By far my favorite sequence is the ending in the burning windmill which seems like James Whale's 'Frankenstein' on some tripped out hallucinogen right down to Victor being designed as the spitting image of Colin Clive. Is 'Frankenweenie' worth the time? It's a Tim Burton movie and it's one of his weaker ones but I think kids ultimately will get some enjoyment out of it. The boy and his dog still has weight even if the actual story doesn't it.",Frankenweenie
70,ersinkdotcom,"""Frankenweenie"" is a beautiful homage to the classic horror films of yesteryear which will entertain children of of all ages",8,10 January 2013,"A love / hate relationship has always existed between Tim Burton and critics. Ever since ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" hit screens in 1985, the renowned director / producer / writer is constantly put under a microscope over every project he's attached to. He's been praised for triumphs like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ridiculed for heavily panned for movies such as the ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. ""Frankenweenie"" should be added to his list of successes.Vincent is a loner who loves making homemade movies with his dog and best friend Sparky. After Sparky is hit by a car and killed, the boy is distraught and lonely. Thanks to his science teacher, Vincent is shown how to re-animate dead tissue and uses it to bring Sparky back from the dead. Things get out of control when the other students in class start bringing their pets back to life with less successful results.I've always liked Burton's movies. I loved ""Dark Shadows,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" and all of the other films he's been involved with throughout his entire career. Looking through his filmography, I can't locate a single movie I hated or consider unwatchable. The man has a wonderfully dark sense of humor and a great admiration of cinema history, which he shows off through ""Frankenweenie.""""Frankenweenie"" is classic Tim Burton at his best. It has crazy characters with the looks to match. A couple of them are patterned and named after classic horror actors and characters like Vincent Price, Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Igor, and others. The entire movie serves as a beautiful homage to Universal and Hammer horror. I smiled in delight when Vincent's parents are cuddled on the couch watching ""Horror of Dracula"" with Christopher Lee.My only complaint with ""Frankenweenie"" is it's too clean for what it's trying to emulate. This is even more evident when the film is seen in high-definition. A movie that celebrates the monsters of yesteryear would have been more effective if they had added some artificial film scratches and grain to give it an aged ""retro"" look.Danny Elfman's musical score for the film brilliantly blends his trademark orchestration with splashes of what you would expect to hear in movies like ""Bride of Frankenstein"" or ""Dracula."" Anyone who enjoyed ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Corpse Bride,"" ""Coraline,"" or ""James and the Giant Peach"" will embrace ""Frankenweenie."" It's an elegant tribute to the classic horror films of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s that will entertain children and their parents. It's definitely a return to form for Tim Burton. This is a successful culmination of what was obviously a 28-year labor of love for the eccentric filmmaker.",Frankenweenie
71,Christian_Dimartino,"It made me cry, so I'm calling it one of the best movies of the year. It's a pity not many have gone to see it.",10,21 October 2012,"Tim Burton has been making us laugh and creeping us out (sometimes all at once) ever since the 80's, and today, I feel that he still has the touch. People haven't really been feeling his latest works. Alice in Wonderland received meh feedback, and that's really all it was. I liked his last movie, Dark Shadows, but some people tore it to pieces. I felt like it stuck true to the material that he typically does and should do, even if it fell apart in the climax. But if you really want to see Burton go back to doing what he does best, go see his latest, Frankenweenie.This is a remake of a movie that he did in the 80's, so obviously it meant something to him. The film revolves around a smart kid named Victor who is a whiz at science. After his beloved dog Sparky is hit by a car, Victor feels like there is unfinished business, so he brings Sparky back to life.As in a Burton tradition, whether it's an animation or live action, there is a weirdly funny cast of characters thrown into the mix. A hilarious substitute teacher(perfectly voiced by Martin Landau), Victor's neighbor (voiced by Winona Ryder), a couple of other students at the school. Also, I felt that every scene with the parents (voiced by Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara) were wonderful.What am I talking about? The whole thing is adorable. At times hilarious and at times pretty much Burton, Frankenweenie is a loving tribute to old horror movies, and not only old horror movies, but even Burton movies, like Edward Scissorhands. This is the kind of thing that Burton does best, and I think it is one of his best.Is it as good as The Nightmare Before Christmas? No, but he didn't technically direct that. But I liked it more than a lot of the others, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Batman, Batman Returns, Corpse Bride, Alice in Wonderland, Dark Shadows, and even though I didn't list them all, especially more than Mars Attacks.This is Burton's best work since Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, his best movie, and even though this isn't as good as that one, it's still a wonderful movie, filled with energy. One thing that I always say is that if a movie makes me cry, then it's something special. Frankenweenie made me cry, because it made me think of my late dog, so I think it's one of the best movies of the year. Guilty as charged, it got me, but I'm not guilty about it.A-",Frankenweenie
72,meydiana-65242,Frankenweenie or bringing Tim Burton's mojo back from the dead,10,25 February 2021,"In 1984, when Tim Burton worked for Disney made a short film called Frankenweenie, which tells the story of Victor, a boy who after losing his dog Sparky in an accident decides to bring him back to life in the purest Frankenstein style, without considering the consequences this may cause. This work helps us to understand the basics of Burton's thematic and visual style, which became his trademark over the years: dark worlds with isolated and/or solitary characters faced to the reality of the world that confronts or rejects them.It is almost 30 years later and a streak of quite irregular films that Burton returns to his roots and decided to resume the story of Frankenweenie to make an animated feature making use of the stop- motion technique, with which he created some of his best works such as the Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, and Frankenweenie is no exception, as it represents a return to the best films of Burton.On this occasion the original story remains intact and makes a bigger emphasis on the impact of the resurrection of Sparky among Victor's friends and as they'll try to emulate the feat with catastrophic results for the small town they live in. Likewise, the relationship between Victor and Elsa, her neighbor and school crush is explored, through which a great reference to The Bride of Frankenstein is made, although it'snot the only one, since along the film there are winks to classic monsters movies from the 30's as the Mummy, Creature from Black Lagoon, Cabinet of Dr. Cagliari and even classic monsters like Godzilla. And the film itself is a homage to this cinema being filmed in black and white and with music in perfect tone by Danny Elfman (Burton's closest collaborator).An innate quality of Burton is the skill to create endearing characters out of the dark and grotesque and the best example of it is Sparky, a little dog now part of the most adorable creations on the burtonian universe, and that somehow reflects many of elements or themes that have remained constant in most of Burton's filmography: childhood, loneliness, friendship and a strange fixation with death and what happens after this.Excepting the end that seems to betray the original concept, it is safe to say that Burton needs to do more films like Frankenweenie and much less like Alice in Wonderland.",Frankenweenie
73,cardsrock,"Enjoyable, though not peak Burton",7,26 October 2020,"It's inevitable to compare Frankenweenie to ParaNorman due to both being 2012 stop motion animated films centered around Halloween. I would say Frankenweenie is the lesser of the two, but not by too much. The story is heartfelt, the visuals are distinctive, and there's a peculiar charm to it. This seemed like a passion project for Burton and it shows. There's a lot of love and care put into this film, but it's classic Burton in that it's often weird, idiosyncratic, and grim. Frankenweenie is a fun homage to old school horror movies and should be a welcome return to form for fans of Tim Burton.",Frankenweenie
74,Laakbaar,"Original, funny, dark",7,19 October 2012,"Burton's New Holland is a very American town, but many of its denizens are, well, weird, and a little creepy. This applies to their pets too. Young Victor Frankenstein is a nerdy loner who, after learning about galvanism, decides to revive his beloved Sparky with the assistance of lightning. Word gets out, so soon many of his classmates are also reviving various dead animals, with odd and disastrous results. Who will save the town? Being Dutch myself, I found it amusing to see that a windmill looms over the town of ""New Holland and that they grow tulips and ""Dutch daisies"" and celebrate ""Dutch Days"". (There is no such thing as a ""Dutch daisy"" as far as I know. The Dutch word for ""daisy"" is ""madeliefje"".) In the Song of New Holland, Elsa praises the clean streets and the ""average homes for average prices"".I imagine Burton was going for feel, not cultural accuracy. Holland, Germany, Transylvania, Sweden, Poland -- they're all the same, right? Candles on the bonnet are Swedish, not Dutch. The immigrants have the distinctly non-Dutch surnames of Frankenstein, Burgemeister and Rzykruski. OK, there is the ""van"" in ""Van Helsing"", but I'm sure that's more a nod to vampire hunters than anything else. ""Elsa"" is not a Dutch name; nor is ""Helsing"", I think. This was just a creepy town with creepy names. In Burton's quirky setting for this film, the various Continental cultures are jumbled together and associated somehow with Dracula and Frankenstein. Of course, when you view the world through a prism of American horror movies, an American town with such strong European links is just a creepy Frankenstein kind of place.I have been watching Tim Burton movies for most of my adult life. His movies cannot be ignored. They are always so original and thought provoking. Creepiness, horror, death, weirdness, bizarreness, monstrosities and otherworldliness are always themes. And then there is the sheer technical artistry. Who else is producing movies like this in Hollywood? This movie had a few good laughs, but I don't want to give anything away. In particular, I liked Bob and the weird girl with her demented cat. I was guffawing during the film, but I think other Dutch people in the theatre may have been confused by it all. Not just by the cultural butchery, but also by the many cultural references to old horror movies. Most young people outside America have little or no experience with old B&W horror movies and Hallowe'en is not celebrated in Europe. I'm sure most of them also wouldn't get the wordplay behind ""frankenweenie"" or ""sparky"". This is a movie deeply rooted in American culture.The stop motion animation was magic. For example, the scene with the various active contraptions in Victor's lab after the lightning struck -- just beautiful. However, the lack of colour did not work for me. Yes, I know Frankenstein was in B&W.With a Burton movie, you're never sure whether you're watching a children's movie or an adult movie. Children dealing with clueless or evil grownups is usually a theme. It did enter my mind during the movie that it might be too scary for small children. However, I noticed that the movie steered clear of showing gore or anything too graphic. We don't see Sparky get run over. I do think this film will get children thinking about the meaning of death.When it comes to Burton movies, some of them work beautifully for me; some are OK but not really that entertaining; others fall completely flat. I'd put this one in the middle category. It was moderately entertaining.",Frankenweenie
75,dfa120374,Disappointingly Boring,4,24 September 2014,"I definitely got what I was expecting with a Tim Burton animated movie here - dark, moody, and very Gothic. To be honest, though, I never really found this movie amusing and even my wife - who love's animation movies - was falling asleep. There were some scenes you chuckled at i.e. where Sparky was wagging his tail and it came flying off, but as a whole I found the movie to be pretty boring.I was hoping for more in this one than what I got with A Nightmare Before Christmas (that one DID send me to sleep), and while it was better, it wasn't by much. I did like that it was an animation based on the classic Frankenstein movie - but with a dog being brought back to life instead of a human. Even little ""Egor"" was in it as well and a reference to The Bride of Frankenstein.The animation is excellent, so at least that was something positive about the film. I usually enjoy Tim Burton movies on the whole - Batman and Beetlejuice being just a couple of my favourites - but I think he should stay away from the animated side of movies and stick to his classic dark live action movies.All in all, this is a pretty disappointing movie and is a bit of a let down.",Frankenweenie
76,billygoat1071,Pure Tim Burton,7,19 October 2012,"Tim Burton hasn't been making any of his original ideas since 2005. His recent films are adaptations that most of them are not outstanding nor creative like his own stories. Tim Burton's returns to his original roots with this. Frankenweenie is based on a short he made decades ago. He remade it into a full length animated feature film with sheer campiness. It's great when it goes there but when it tries to be emotional, it works in a short while but it is more interested to its craziness and the storyline doesn't know where to go. The director may return to his style but he still has his old flaws.The concept is fascinating. It sounds like it's going to be a heartwarming family fun film. It obviously tries to capture the old horror movies with black and white. Most of the characters are based on iconic horror movie characters. Tim Burton is always highly imaginative but somehow he's lacking something. In family films, he creates a charming innovation but he couldn't bring enough depth to it. There are things that could have been interesting. This is about a kid who brings his beloved pet back to life. There could have been more genuine cherishing moments of Victor and resurrected Sparky. There are times like that but it immediately skims to the comedy. The storyline doesn't quite know what to do until it hits to the big climax.The voice performances were good. Martin Landau's is probably the best among them who gratifies and delights his character with his campy accent that reminds you of his role in Ed Wood. The stop-motion animation is simply majestic. The black and white effect makes it a lot more fascinating. The character and monster designs are magnificent. It's wonderful enough as a Tim Burton animated film.Frankenweenie suffers with the same problem of Edward Scissorhands. Don't get me wrong, Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful film but there is a little depth to its concept and serves an awkward climax leads to an underdeveloped romance. At least there's an endearing performance by Johnny Depp. Frankenweenie is fun but it's kind of empty in the end. It's not bad, it just could have been better. The darkness of the film could have been something affecting instead of an impaled cat. The sad parts seem contrived for the idea's sake. The film messes around the rest of the runtime. I guess the throwbacks and the filmmaking are the only merits of the film. Fans of Tim Burton's dark and crazy vision would enjoy. Since we don't see a lot of stop-motion animation these days, I guess that what makes this appealing. To think about the story, still not satisfying.",Frankenweenie
77,dragokin,a nice strange one,5,8 March 2014,"I saw Frankenweenie in an open-air cinema, prepared for that purpose in a city square. That fit well with Frankenweenie, since it references several old movies that were presumably watched in open-air theaters.The movie itself is hard to classify. IMDb's description as Animation/Comedy/Family is only halfway there, since the main protagonist is a dog brought back to life by electricity. And apart from the reborn dog, Frankenweenie would have been a true family movie.But this is what is typical for Tim Burton and what puzzles me the most: Where does his fixation on death and the dead come from? There is nothing bad in that since i guess no one is actually harmed. On the other hand, this leaning toward Gothic fashion and subculture is something you grow out of after a certain age...",Frankenweenie
78,TheSquiss,Tim Burton is back on form with this dark delight!,8,25 October 2012,"Tim Burton is back! There have been some poor additions to the Burton canon in recent years (Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland) but our man in the world of his own is returning to his best form at last. Continuing the upward trend of Dark Shadows, Frankenweenie is a dark delight and even if your children are overly sensitive and suffer horrendous nightmares that make you feel like a bad parent, it'll be worth it. Or just leave them at home.Much has been said about the origins of Burton's story: Apparently Disney sacked him over it, refused to relinquish the rights as he penned it on their time and the irony is, decades later, Frankenweenie has been extended and is a Disney film. But it matters not a jot. What matters is the detail, the humour, the darkness and the quality. What matters is that Frankenweenie is a jolly fine film indeed and leaves the likes of Paranorman and Hotel Transylvania slowly sinking in its wake.Inspired by his unnerving science teacher, Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau), and the unfortunate demise of his dog, young Victor Frankentein (Charlie Tahan) reanimates Sparky. When one of his classmates discovers what Victor has done, he invites himself to be Victor's partner for the forthcoming science fair and all hell breaks loose.Production design has never been an issue with Burton's films. It's an area you can virtually guarantee will be breathtaking and that is no different here. Victor's attic surpasses anything Aardman Animations can create for Wallace, the town harks back to the clinical beauty of Edward Scissorhand's neighbourhood, albeit on a fraction of the scale, while Sparky's pet cemetery exceeds even the off-kilter magnificence of Beetlejuice's resting place. The sets alone give very good reason to buy Frankenweenie on DVD so they can be appreciated fully, frame by frame.John August, in his fifth collaboration with Burton as screenwriter, has delivered a script that is sharply funny on multiple levels. Yes, it may be aimed at children but this is very much a film for adults to enjoy. The occasional gross-out moments make every age group grimace in unison. Together, August and Burton have created a town filled with characters rather than just a few principals and lots of walking scenery. The classroom sequences are an absolute joy to watch as each child, regardless of how much impact they have on the story, unfurls his or her own distinctive character.Burton has been let loose in his filmic playground and frequently movie references flit by for the audience to 'get' or simply enjoy as a passing comment or image. You'll want to watch again to see how many you missed.The voices are superb and quite remarkable considering the young age of much of the cast. Its good to hear Winona Ryder back in the Burton fold as Elsa Van Helsing and, likewise, Martin Landau returns (for his third stint) to virtually steal the show. His Mr. Rzykruski more closely resembles Giger's alien than a human and his voice-over oozes with resigned petulance and a hint of menace. With Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara providing multiple voices, this is a very fine cast indeed and one almost wishes for a small box within the screen to watch them at work in the studio.Musically, this is yet another Burton, Danny Elfman project in a relationship that is at least the equal of that enjoyed by Spielberg and Williams, but the stand out moment is Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O's Strange Love which, sadly, is plonked onto the credits. For those of us purists who stay to the bitter (or hopefully sweet) end, it's a just reward. For the grunts who thunder out at the barest hint of text upon screen, yaboo sucks. You don't deserve to hear it.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",Frankenweenie
79,LloydBayer,"Entirely shot in black and white, Frankenweenie is a stop-motion animated film that is painstakingly with over 200 puppets.",6,10 March 2014,"For a stop-motion animated film, Frankenweenie has a lot of things going for it. Comprising of over 200 puppets strung to about 30 individual puppeteers, the result is a top notch, fluid animated feature that is very realistic to the naked eye. What is surprising is the fact that it took director Tim Burton two years to literally animate the story of a boy and his dog and the bond they share - an incredible feat when considering that a week of filming produces only five seconds of animation! Entirely shot in black and white, the setting is perhaps Burton's greatest triumph – a throwback to Hollywood's past while experimenting with the undead. Set during 1970s in the town of New Holland, it is the story of young Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) and his beloved dog Sparky. As is typical of boys his age, Victor loves his dog and even uses Sparky as the protagonist in his home-made stop motion animated films. All this changes the day Sparky is killed in a tragic accident. Inspired by his science teacher, Victor does the inevitable. Sparky is resurrected (no surprise, given the title) but soon attracts the curiosity of his classmates, who are all vying for the ultimate science fair project. Once they figure out how Victor brings Sparky back to life, clandestine trips to the pet cemetery results in grotesque consequences for the sleepy town of New Holland.With a fascination for the macabre and the morbid, I can't say this is Tim Burton at his best, nor his most original. No doubt, filming a stop motion animation in black and white, and in 3D, is a cinematic first but there are too many similarities to his 2005 animated film Corpse Bride, another stop motion film dealing with, well, the undead. The characters (or puppets) look almost identical with Burton relying on his signature Gothic dark circled eyes. Curiously, Sparky looks almost the same before and after his death. When it comes to originality, there's not much you can expect in terms of the story when the premise itself is an obvious homage to the 1931 classic, itself inspired and titled after Mary Shelley's seminal Frankenstein story. Knowing this, the black and white setting becomes a necessary aspect and a vital component in Burton's grand scheme of things. Another questionable flaw is the film's juvenile PG rating. Given the premise of Victor, his class mates, and their collective morbid curiosity, few children watching the film are going to be entertained. The bigger question is whether children are old enough to be entertained or fascinated when dealing with the subject of death or the possibility of life after death. Although there are funny moments, albeit very few and very dark, the subject shifts to an illustration telling children how to deal with the death of a pet and the ensuing process of letting go. Yet somehow, this does not appear to be the intended message if Sparky is meant to be brought backmore than once.Considering its absolute scope and production value, Frankenweenie can be justified as a painstaking film made with grand ambition. There is also Burton's panache for anything that goes bump in the night with various references to the early days of cinema monstrosities. To this effect, Danny Elfman's score is a perfect consummation further accentuating Burton's moments of intentional homage. And considering the sheer nature of its making, this film is a marvel to watch and recommended for a mature audience but not necessarily for kids. Speaking of which, there used to be a time in modern cinema when children were told not to try at home what they saw at the movies. But going by the last scene, Burton seems to be saying that it's OK for kids to go back home, dig up a dead cat, stick kitty's tail in the wall socket and yell ""It's alive, it's alive!!""",Frankenweenie
80,room102,Worth watching,6,10 October 2015,"Burton is back to basics. Lots of elements from the ""old"" Burton, which we haven't seen in over a decade.The movie starts great with 7.0-7.5/10 (I like the stop-motion inside stop-motion intro, sort of the like the beginning of ""Team America""), but it loses momentum, becomes a ""Godzilla"" movie (probably as a reference to the old stop-motion monster movies, but it's still too out-of-place for this movie) and finishes at 4.0- 4.5/10.All in all, an enjoyable movie, with some great characters (my favorites are the weird girl and her Mr. Whiskers the indifferent cat; For voice acting, I really like Martin Landau as the science teacher), lots of references to many Burton movies and other Gothic/Animation classics.Good score by Danny Elfman and good animation (although not as good as the animation of ""ParaNorman (2012)""). And I like the fact that they let Burton do the movie in B&W.BTW, how come Burton gets the leading credit if there's another person credited as ""animation director""???",Frankenweenie
81,cat_ranchero,Loved it!...,9,10 August 2013,"I love Burton's stop motion animation style; it really suits this type of tale. The fact it was in black and white was also a bonus for me; it made it look like the early horror films, many of which are referenced here. I also like that he made Mr. Rzykruski look an awful lot like Vincent Price; he was an early horror movie hero of mine. I haven't seen the earlier 1984 film and so cannot make a comparison with that but I did like what I saw. Definitely well worth a watch for any horror fan; or even if you just want to be entertained; it'll do that too!SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Frankenweenie

So many colorful animal movies are out there, but they have some tragedy too. It's a modern black and white movie with good use of sound effects and music. This is the story of a young boy that looses his dog, but he revives it with new technology. But other kids does the same, as it ends in disaster. At the end the dog and his friends must fight the monsters the bullies had created. By a moving scene the dog is charged alive again after the fight. Not many mentions this movie, but it's highly recommended anyway for kids that love a spooky cartoon.10/10",Frankenweenie
83,tankace,A good re imagining of the classic story.,8,23 June 2016,"Frankenweekie is a stop motion animated movie directed by the master of this type Tim Burton. In this film we see the story of the Frankenstein with a new twist and in more child friendly tone. However the basic themes are here and Burton made them work in to the story.Now it is by no means as good as a Nightmare before Christmas or Corpse Wife but it is not meant to be and as far as children movies go, is at least fine and has elements that will make it enjoyable for adults also. So to the main story Victor Frankenstein here is a boy in a small town, he is opposed with science and he only real friend is his dog Sparky ,but after a car accident which killed the K9 ,Victor tries to bring him back to life, but his actions create ,of course, problem that he has to face.OK the story and some of the character, like Victor's parents, are by the numbers for a children film and this is its only drawback, because when the person who for cry out loud make the slender man likable, a film like that seems to low for him. I personally disagree ,yes, although he has directed better films than that is still really good and its Gothic style of animation ,mixed with the fact that is in black and white(!) and the more kid friendly approach ,make a really good Burto film. To sum up I believe that is his best project since Corpse Bride and if you consider what he has directed and produced in the last 12 years ,be thankfully that he did not did to the Frankenstein what he did with Alice in Wonderland.",Frankenweenie
84,jamiedarlow-37510,Stunning animation,6,4 April 2020,"Based on Burton's short live-action film that was shelved by Disney back in the 80s, Frankenweenie follows the tale of a young Victor Frankenstein growing up in suburbia with his parents and his best friend, his dog Sparky. Victor is mortified when Sparky runs to chase a ball and gets killed by a passing car and discovers the notion of bringing the dead back to life. Delightfully animated to a stylish black and white pallet, there's a dedicated team here finally collaborating together to bring Tim's vision to a feature length outing. The stop motion is stunning and it's definately a more underrated art form nowadays that is really refreshing when it is used. It does strangely feel stretched out and after the half way point you can really tell it was adapted from a short film. Narratively, it can sometimes trail away from the central relationship between Victor and Sparky which is its biggest quality and I would've liked to have seen more of Victor's blooming romance with Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) but its entertaining for what it is and is certainly one that I'd happily watch with my kids to introduce them to good filmmaking!",Frankenweenie
85,asb_deutsch,"Theme stolen from ""Cloudy with a chance of meatballs"" and ""BOLT""",6,16 February 2013,"Yes, Frankieweenie, is a black-and-white film that lacks originality and story. Ill be very honest, people are just giving credibility to it because it's Tim Burton, and people tend to think that whatever he does is good. Burton really treats the film as an homage to old monster, horror and sci-fi films. He has given tributes to Frankenstein, The Mummy, Dracula (complete with Christopher Lee), Godzilla, Bride of Frankenstein, Gremlins, Jurassic Park and others I certainly missed on first viewing. But he is wrong, Tim Burton was great but recently he has been showing that he doesn't live up to his own expectations.COPIED? Remember the theme in ""Cloudy with a chance of meatballs"" when the city goes bizarre and the machine overloads and causes havoc? The protagonist becomes a hero. Same in ""Bolt"" where the dog rescues the boy. I just think some parts suffered from a visual overload. COMMENTS ARE WELCOME BUT NO OFFENSE PLEASE!",Frankenweenie
86,Donatien3,Heartwarming tale is typical Burton,8,10 November 2012,"A remake of Tim Burton's short film from nearly thirty years ago, 'Frankenweenie' is an enjoyable journey about the love between a boy and his dog. It also acts as a prequel to the Frankenstein monster movies.Victor Frankenstein is a young boy whose best friend is his adorable dog Sparky. When Sparky is hit by a card during a game of baseball, a devastated Victor brings Sparky alive in a manner reminiscent to the Frankenstein films.You're left in no doubt that Frankenweenie is a Tim Burton film. Filmed in black and white, Burton's iconic animation style is all over the film. At times 'Frankenweenie' feels like an old Saturday matinée monster movie (it contains homages to the old Universal monster movies and some of Burton's previous films), backed by Danny Elfman's score. While it is technically a kids film (the session I went to had a lot of kids there), the macabre vibe means a lot of scenes would be too scary for young children. The voice cast is relatively modest, with no sign of Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. The best known voice actors are Martin Short, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder.The highlight of the film is Sparky, who is absolutely adorable, even when all patched up after being brought back to life. Sparky is very loyal to Victor and his barks and whines convey plenty of emotion. Despite the macabre nature, the film is – in essence – a heartwarming tale about a boy and his dog.",Frankenweenie
87,ragingbull_2005,A good first half and a mediocre second,6,30 December 2012,"The first half of the movie is terrific fun. We have Victor Frankenstein who is precocious and loves Science. He has a dog called Sparky. His Science teacher tells him that there is a Science Fair to be held in town. One day while playing Baseball on the insistence of his father, Victor hits the ball out of bounds. Old Sparky rushes for it and has a fatal accident with a car. While listening to the talk of his Science teacher, Victor realizes that he can use electricity to reanimate his dog. He starts preparing for it. The second half of the movie is a sort of a letdown because of the shift in focus from Victor to others in the town who also start thinking about bringing dead animals alive. There is an interlude about ostracizing those who are different. The movie shifts the goal post in the middle of the game and for me that is going to hurt its chance at the Golden Globe and the Oscars where it should be nominated. The story is a clever take on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. There are settings and scenes which are homage to it. If only the pacing and the story of the latter part would have been better, this would have turned into a mini classic. This is a more than decent watch. 3/5",Frankenweenie

90,Ryan_MYeah,This is Tim Burton's weakest stop motion movie yet.,6,11 January 2013,"Tim Burton has made some truly great stop motion films in his life. I adore The Nightmare Before Christmas (even though he didn't actually direct it), and I love Corpse Bride, and I really wanted to like Frankenweenie. I'd say the first half is much better than the second half. The first half is what the movie really should be like overall. It's focusing so much on the relationship between a boy and his dog, and building on the emotion of such a relatable thing. It also manages to sneak in Burton's signature macabre stamp, including a hilarious rant by Martin Landau's character.However, the second half takes a turn for the worst. The script turns out to be more black and white than the actual photography, it's rushed, it's underdeveloped, and Burton indulges a wee bit too much in the classic horror movie references. At the very least, Burton's visual eye has not been lost. The stop motion animation and the stunning black and white camera work are just pure eye candy. For all my problems, and I do have plenty, it's not all that bad, and it shows that Burton still has talent in him. He's just misusing it.*** / *****",Frankenweenie
91,Darkjak007,Science,7,31 October 2021,"Directed by Tim Burton Frankenweenie is a stop motion parody animated film, based off of Burtons short film of the same name. That's of course based off the universal film and Novel. It follows the story of a young boy named Victor Frankenstein,who lives in the suburban town of New Holland. He has a love for science and even a bigger love for his dog sparky. He's seen as an outsider,but feels fine as long he has sparky. Until one sparky is hit by a car and passes away. Victor falls into a state of depression until one day in scienceclass, He gets the idea to resurrect to Sparky. He succeeded but now has to keep Sparky a secret from the town,but obviously that can't last. Frankenweenie is a a film perfect for the family as well as horror fans alike. It offers a heartwarming tale of a boy and his dog, but mixes it with the appeal of a classic horror film. The idea of shooting it in black&black help set the the early gothic tone. It's without a doubt that if it was in color it wouldn't catch the same tone. The film also pays tone homage to many film of the 30s-60s. The cast of characters while all the adult are 1950s adults, some of the kids have these Exaggerated Caricatures features down to their names. Pictures honestly the most normal one Out of this entire group him and Elsa. Elsa(Winona Ryder) name a mix between Elsa Lancester who played the bride of Franknstein and Van Helsing the character from Bram Stokers Dracula. Edgar is a parody of Igor with a hunchback. There's a kid Nassor clearly modeled after Boris Karloff, who even later in the film gets wrapped up like a mummy. There's tone of things like that, and it rather fun as a movie buff pointing them. The music done by Danny Elfman is good not not on the the level nightmare before Christmas, but still matches the tone of the scenes from organ music to upbeat suburban music. The animation not much to say whenever stop motion is Integrate into your movie it is always a welcome addition. Just to the amount of handwork and time that takes into each shot to making the characters in the scenery work. Overall it straight forward fun film, that a unique tone.",Frankenweenie
92,Quebec_Dragon,"Almost frankentastic, definitely unconventional yet nostalgic homage",7,10 October 2012,"Let's start by saying I'm a big Tim Burton fan, I relate to his cinematic sensibilities. That being said, I find myself a bit perplexed after seeing Frankenweenie. I enjoyed seeing it, but I'm not quite sure why. I didn't find it very funny or touching, yet it had an undeniable Tim Burtonian charm. In case you didn't know, this movie is unconventional by the fact it's in black and white, as well as in stop-motion animation (instead of computer animation like practically everything else). It's also an expansion on one of Burton's early short films. The story is kind of like a modern suburban Frankenstein tale with an affectionate normal dog (despite his condition), a lonely filmmaker boy (a bit bland but obviously inspired by Burton himself as a kid) and a bunch of somewhat freaky kids.I thought the designs of the dolls (or whatever they're called) was wondrously fantastic with special mention going to the blonde girl with huge eyes. The marvellous animation was graceful and a joy to watch. Some complained about stiff movements sometimes, I didn't notice. The characters were fun, distinctive and quite expressive, mostly through their eyes. I particularly liked how weather effects (such as rain) were implemented to create atmosphere. So visually and artistically, it was pretty great if you can deal with the lack of colours. Story-wise, I found that it was simple, nice, not extremely original, and a bit sadder than what North-American audiences are used to. However, for some reason I cannot fathom, the sad emotional moments didn't really work for me, and I thought the ending was kind of a cop-out. The humour was understated and gentle, sometimes with sinister undertones, the speech given by the science professor (looking like Vincent Price) being an highlight. I enjoyed most of the voice acting and the Danny Elfman music felt right, while giving us that sweet Burton familiarity. The movie made me smile, but it did not make me laugh. It probably wasn't Burton's main goal anyway. Unfortunately, some of the better gags were ruined by the preview.Frankenweenie definitely felt and looked like a Tim Burton movie, a nostalgic throwback to his previous works in several ways, an homage to classic horror films in others. I do not know if he needed to look back before moving forward, but despite a premise that might not seem strong enough for a full-length feature, Burton did well, but didn't do his best work. I would like to see Frankenweenie again at some point, just to marvel at the details for one, so that's already saying something. Is this worth seeing in the theatres? For Burton and animation fans, it's a no-brainer. For other people, it would be a yes but with reserves. For kids, it would definitely be something different than their usual, but not for kids too young or impressionable.Rating: 7 out of 10 (very good)",Frankenweenie
93,Stompgal_87,Not the best stop-motion film but the technique of making it black and white was interesting and it is more substantial second time around,8,12 May 2013,"I watched this film on a flight to Dubai due to my mum suggesting it and although certain parts were initially forgettable (such as the ending), the film was intriguingly produced nonetheless.The most memorable parts of this film were Victor (the second Tim Burton stop-motion character with this name, the other one being in 2005's Corpse Bride) and his parents watching a horror film starring Sparky, Sparky being run over (which may be distressing for people whose dogs have died) and resurrected a la Frankenstein's monster, Victor's parents becoming insulted about the resurrection and a mutant Shelley stomping around the town like Godzilla. Other high points of the film included its black and white animation, Edgar's full name being a smart satire of Igor, the part where Sparky drinks some water that spills out of his stitches like a fountain (the funniest part), Danny Elfman's chilling and dramatic musical score, and the decent voice cast including Catherine O'Hara (Kevin's mother in the first two Home Alone films) and Winona Ryder.All in all, this film was originally nothing compared to other stop-motion films I've seen (e.g. Coraline and Chicken Run) but it was entertaining enough to pass time on a long flight and more substantial second time around. 8/10.",Frankenweenie

The kids who looked like horror movie characters were just distracting. The finale where the kids create giant monsters was just too far fetched. The original movie worked because of the focus on Sparky, and this movie is more focused on the filler characters.Oh look, Catherine O'Hara is playing a mother........ AGAIN!Also, what about the cat that gets killed at the end? That poor girl. She'll miss that cat.When they did actually reinact moments from the original, that's when it worked.

I finally got a chance to see this movie and I'm glad to say that I did not regret watching this. The first 30 minutes I watched (the first 1/3 of the film) was so well done, clearly illustrating the character Victor and his relationship with Sparky. It was so well done that you actually feel for Victor and understand what life for him is like for him without Sparky. There were numerous things I loved about this film1) I loved how everything was black and white, making it really feel like a classic horror 'Frankenstein' touch to it all.2) I loved most of the characters, including the bullies. I found the character Edga surprisingly good, even though it was him who caused all the conflict! 3) I liked the parents. I'm glad that Tim Burton did not portray them as jerky parents, but as kind and caring parents who feel for their son's life. 4) I also like the part, approximately 25 minutes into the movie, when Victor is dragging Sparky's dead body into the house and his parents are watching the 1958 version of Dracula that starred Sir Christopher Lee. I somehow enjoyed that and it shows that Tim Burton truly respects Sir C. Lee.There were so many other things I liked. I particular liked Elsa Van Helsing and I thought Winoya Ryder did a superb job playing her. Boy, Tim Burton does like to use actors/actresses that have been in his other movies! I found the story, not funny, but emotional. It was extremely well executed and one of the biggest positives about the film was its pacing. The first 30 minutes never felt slow or dragged on, but everything was perfectly paced out.The animations were brilliant and creepy! Nothing less than you will ever expect!Superb- must see!",Frankenweenie

97,ultramatt2000-1,"Great movie, but I don't see what the fuss is all about here.",9,1 December 2015,"As you know I like Tim Burton but the thing about it is, that this movie got a lot of flack by the general public. I enjoyed it, because I not only like stop-motion animation, but I like old horror films. I bet James Rolfe of ""Angry Video Game Nerd"" and Cinemassacre fame, would enjoy it. So here are some possible reasons why this picture got some flack.1. It is animated with stop-motion animation, CGI is the biggest money maker when it comes to family films and special effects. ""Hotel Transylvania"" beaten that movie in the box-office.2. Too dark and creepy, but that's the nature of his works. This leads to three.3. Generation gap. There are a tone of references to the old movies of the 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. Nobody would get it unless you are over the age of thirty. (""Gremlins"" got referenced in this movie and it is the director's way of saying that he is hip and cool like anyone who grew up in the 80's.) Plus we are in an age where we can't let our kids watch horror films (old or new) until they reach a specific age. This leads to four.4. Black and white. Nobody makes movies in black and white! Kids will be turned off by that sort of stuff. Although ""The Artist"" was a smash hit, still, we watch our movies in orange and teal. I mean color.5. People jumped to conclusions that his remake of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and the film adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"" were flops.I like the short for which the movie is based on and I liked the feature for which it is based on. Bottom line: It is best to show this to kids over the age of seven, which leads to the reason why it is rated PG because of the fact that it contains, crude humor, peril and some scary scenes that (man do I love saying it) can make ""Scooby-Doo"" look like ""Sesame Street"". (That funny analogy never gets old.)",Frankenweenie
98,fjhuerta-2,"Stunning, beautiful, deep, emotional, dark. Tim Burton is back, and yes, he's better than ever.",8,29 October 2012,"I have to agree. Ever since Big Fish, Tim Burton seemed to have lost his vision. He was making zany, bizarre works like Alice, but although they had his trademark Gothic look, the stories were sort of boring. The human element that tied together the craziness in Batman or Beetlejuice, the search for life's meaning of Big Fish - he traded it all for huge budgets and epic movies devoid of heart and soul.""Frankenweenie"" is, then, a revelation. Proof that, just as one of the characters in this movie implied, experiments are next to worthless if they are not loved; it's obvious Tim Burton loved this film. It's basically 1984's Frankenweenie, but with even more heart and soul, a bigger, better story, and even more lovable characters. But underneath, it poses strong questions to viewers, and dares to gently challenge our perception of life and death.I'd dare to say Tim Burton made two endings - one that was as kid-friendly as he could make it, and another one, the real one, which happened 1 minute before it. It was almost as if the movie's ending was a wink to all the parents in the movie theater, telling us ""it's all right, kids will love this one"", while he had crafted the real one a couple of seconds before it.I'd say this is at least on par with Edward Scissorhands. It's so great to see an awesome director like Burton getting back on track. Frankenweenie is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.",Frankenweenie
99,kevinxirau,"Monstrously cute, fun, and heart-warming.",9,7 April 2013,"Honestly, I'm surprised Tim Burton remade this classic. For those of you who don't know, ""Frankenweenie"" was a short, black-and-white live-action film Burton made back in 1984, which you can find now as a special feature to his other classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". It, along with this remake, pays homage to the classic monster movies back then like Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, and even Japanese monster flicks. It' s so nice to see that Tim Burton is keeping the tradition of stop-motion alive with all the overused CGI running amok in Hollywood. So, how does this film hold up. VERY WELL! Plot: Young Victor Frankenstein is a reclusive boy with his only friend being his loyal dog Sparky. Sadly, a horrible accident occurs when the poor dog gets hit by a car. While naturally becoming depressed at first, Victor becomes inspired by an eccentric science teacher of his to bring Sparky back to life using lightning, to which he actually succeeds, though he fears what would happen if the ignorant and frightful adults of the town ever see his resurrected pet. But, that's not the least of his problems. When other students at his school find out about Victor's pet secret, they perform similar experiments of their own with monstrous results. It's up to Victor and Sparky to put an end to the madness.Burton's vision lives on as his character designs remain as bizarre and exaggerated as ever, if not even more so than usual. The characters are, while sometimes creepy (in a good way), most of them are highly enjoyable. Interestingly, Burton keeps the film black-and-white to not only honor the original film he made, but to also keep paying tribute to the classic creature features. Voice acting is great and there are a lot of cute, funny moments, many of which involve Sparky the dog. The other creatures are a load of fun too as they terrorize the townsfolk in a delightful manner. What really drives the stake in this one is how the film makes you feel for Victor and Sparky, often to the point where I was really moved and felt myself emotionally invested. Even if you're not a fan of Tim Burton, you'll find this to be just as heart-warming to you as it is to me.What else can I possibly say about this? This is definitely one of Tim Burton's best films. It has heart, comedy, dark atmosphere, great creature scenes, and a thrilling climax. If you're a fan of Burton's work, enjoy the old monster movies, or just want some family fun, then check this action out.",Frankenweenie
100,rgblakey,Frankenweenie brings Burton back from the brink of darkness,10,4 October 2012,"Tim Burton has had numerous tumbles over the last few years, making hardcore fans wonder if we would ever see him return to greatness like when he delivered films like Big Fish, Ed Wood, and Edward Scissorhands. His latest Frankenweenie returns him to his own creative world remaking his live action 1984 feature of the same name, but this time in stop motion form. Could his return to his own material get him back to doing what made fans love him or will it just be more of the same over used style he seems to feel the need to slap on every film?Frankenweenie follows a young boy whose dog is hit by a car. After learning about the effects of electricity in science he uses it to bring his beloved dog Sparky back to life. When his secret is discovered he will have to try and convince his parents as well as the town's people that Sparky is not the monster that he appears to be. Fans will be happy to know that this is a welcomed return to form for the Tim Burton we all loved. The film is beautifully creepy in both visual and story. Fans of the original classic will be happy to know that while they obviously expand and change the story up a bit, they still manage to include just about every aspect of the original in this new format. The voice acting is well done, with the real scene stealer being Martin Landau as a science teacher with a strong resemblance to the late great Vincent Price. It is an amazing visual experience on top of a clever execution of storytelling of the tale of Frankenstein. There are some truly strange and fun characters that have Tim Burton's imagination all over them and create a world like only he can. Of the stop motion films he has been involved with previously, this is easily the best one as a whole delivering one of the most unique experiences in some time for both Burton's work and just something different in theaters. There are some aspects in the middle of the film that some might find a bit slow, but in a way that seems more necessary than not. The 3D works really well when utilized, but for the most part didn't seem like there was any focus on using it much at all.While this is a Disney movie and animated, it undertakes a pretty dark tone at times, but it's necessary to really make this movie accomplish what it sets out to do. Fans of the 1993 series Family Dog, will notice that Burton used his own designs from that series to design Sparky here. Could this film prove that Burton still has what it takes to deliver? Let's hope so, because here he knocks it out of the park and has easily re-established any lost faith as a brilliant filmmaker. Who knows, maybe eventually we will get a film for Stain Boy and a whole new world to enjoy. Either way Burton is back better than ever let's just hope he latches on and keeps the spark alive.",Frankenweenie
101,robsta23,Terrible,2,25 May 2015,"Man, I admittedly hate Tim Burton's filmography except for a few titles such as Big Fish and Sleepy Hollow, but this has to be the worst Tim Burton film I have seen in a long time. Frankenweenie was below my expectations, and I set my expectations pretty low for this film.This film felt like it was really rushed in the production and post- production stages. One thing I cannot believe is that there was little emotion, let alone any characterization at all, in the adult characters of this film, excluding the science teacher played by Martin Landau. While Victor was animated to actually have emotions, exhibiting grief, fear, determination, all through well-animated facial expressions, the adults seemed to have one expression each throughout the movie. Way to put little life in the adults, Burton; I know this is a children's film (in fact, this movie is the epitome of a children's film) but please put more effort into the world of the story as a whole next time you decide to make an animated film.Plot points/conversations/crucial moments sometimes went by too quickly to have the significance they were meant to have. One example of this is when Mr. Frankenstein is trying to get it into Victor's head that experimenting with the dead is something nobody should get involved with. The sad thing is he conveys this to Victor in two sentences, and then they're all off to find Sparky – or undead Sparky, if you prefer. Well done dad, life lesson learned.Since this is a children's film and filmmakers have to meet what children can ""understand"" (children aren't necessarily stupid, you know) some things are left with little to no explanation, leaving the children who view this film to choose whether they buy into it or not. I may not be a child, but I am a viewer, and I barely bought any of the movie because it was so void of explanation. Victor sees his science teacher use electricity to create muscle spasms in a dead frog, and he suddenly understands how to bring dead animals back to life with electricity (specifically lightning)? Face it Burton, you just needed a way to reference the original Frankenstein, and with the little explanation involved, you put some plot points together quite sloppily.The film was even uninteresting when important issues were raised. There is a scene which had so much potential but fell flat; it is the scene where the townspeople are at a P.T.A. meaning, upset with what Martin Landau's character has been teaching the kids. This could have been a good commentary on how people are offended when evolution is taught or when somebody is trying to convince the children of what is not the truth, such as the South winning the Civil War. But no, the people are angry simply because the man is ""strange"" and ""weird,"" pretty much disregarding the fact that the people were upset in the first place because a child was hurt. Even if they went back to that child being hurt, the teacher had nothing to do with this – he just wanted them to make a project for the science fair.Which brings me to what I hated the most about the film. One of the main plots of the movie – I would call it subplot A – is who would win the science fair. As if I cared, Burton. All this did was give the other kids incentive to pursue raising the dead on their own which didn't really amount to anything anyway. The film ends before the so-called science fair, so this subplot isn't even resolved. With the ending being ambiguous, the viewers can probably guess ""oh, Victor will win since he brought Sparky back to life,"" but that didn't even have to do with the science fair; it was something personal to Victor.This might entertain very young children, but if you're in your teens or older, or if you're a very young cinephile I would advise you to skip this film and maybe skip some rocks in a nearby pond for an hour and a half – it's a better way to spend the duration of this film.",Frankenweenie
102,RhapsodyReviews,Not a Fan.,4,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Frankenweenie' is an American stop-motion-animated dark-fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. Right out of the gate I want to explain that I don't like Tim Burton's stop-motion movies. I find them slow, boring and the story and voice acting to be like a bad play. I've been trying to watch some and give them a chance, but this one is not a good one.
The story is a play on 'Frankenstien' and for the most part I can say that is was intriguing. It follows a young boy named Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) whose dog, Sparky, gets hit by a car and dies. Not accepting that his dog will be gone forever, Victor sets up an experiment to bring him back to life. The experiment woks and when Sparky is seen roaming around the town, some people expect fowl play and want to get to the bottom of what Victor is up to.
As I mentioned prior, I think a lot of voice acting in Tim Burton movies feels like a bad play. I enjoyed the voice acting here for the most part. I thought Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short who play Victor's parents Mr. and Mrs. Frankenstein did an excellent job bringing humor and heart into their characters. The actor who voices Victor isn't the best actor as I have seen him in multiple roles in the past, and in my opinion, voice acting would be a lot harder, not having anything to play off. Every time his character interacted with other, it took me right out of the story.
The animation was solid, and I liked the spot-motion feel and the black and white scheme. The story to me though, while it was intriguing it fell flat and was boring. There was no excitement or any feel of unease throughout this dark movie.
Overall, if you're a fan of Tim Burton's work, I can say that you will enjoy this movie without a doubt. I can't recommend it to you, just due to the fact that I am not a fan of this one or his animation films as a whole.

103,DustinRahksi,One of my favourite animated movies.,8,12 January 2013,"I hardly watch animated movies anymore, this and para-Norman are the first new animated films I have watched in a couple of years. What attracted me to this film was the story about a boy and his dog. I'm the same way, being my pug dog is my best friend. I actually got tears in my eye's at certain points in the film. The beautiful stop motion is another thing that made this stand out. I've always found stop-motion very appealing, and I prefer it over CGI. Fans of horror movies or monster movies will enjoy this film. There are many reference's to the old Universal films. And for you Japanese monster fans, there is a Rodan toy in in the opening film by victor, and a turtle turns into a Gamera type monster, I really enjoyed those parts. I know I'll be rooting for it at the Oscar's, but don't expect anything. Overall it's a great movie that most should enjoy, I recommend it.",Frankenweenie
104,havoke-74121,Its Gorgeous to look at.,5,22 March 2021,"With an Unsatisfying ending, forced plot conventions. Frankenweenie only achieves annoyance, rather than actual scares and suttle nuances.",Frankenweenie
105,LanceBrave,Met My Somewhat Reserved Expectations,7,11 November 2013,"Tim Burton is a brand name by this point. His signature Gothic style, of black-and-white spirals and character who don't own combs, has become so widely replicated that the director can't help but rip-off himself. The diminished creative returns for his most recent films attest to this. So why was I so excited for ""Frankenweenie?"" I like the original short film a lot. Even if Henry Selick was the real genius behind ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Burton's stop-motion films are usually a good bet. The cast was exciting and not a single Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter in sight. Maybe just the idea of a kid's film inspired by and visually patterned after classic horror was enough to excite me. (And, hey, I love dogs too.) I'm happy to report ""Frankenweenie"" met my somewhat reserved expectations.Of course, it's hard to say how much of ""Frankenweenie"" Burton is even responsible for. Trey Thomas is credited with ""animation direction,"" which sounds to me like he did most of the work. The story is ostensibly set in the modern day, if a brief line of dialogue about Pluto's dwarf planet status is any indication, despite possessing a wholly 1950s nostalgic atmosphere, recalling ""Edward Scissorhands."" One character, known only as Weird Girl, looks like she stepped right out of one of the ""The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories."" I can't help but feel this is less a proper Burton film then it is an animated movie in his so instantly recognizable style.Anyway: Is the movie good? I thought so. It doesn't take a lot to make a ""Boy and His Dog"" story tug at my heart, even if it's fair to say the movie undersells the emotional core just a bit. Mainly because the movie has to stay inside the standard kid's movie runtime and, since the entire movie revolves around bringing the dog back to life, you can't spend too much time getting to that point. The movie isn't really about coping with grief or accepting death anyway. Instead, it deals with the much more kid-manageable theme of the transcending power of love. Tying that theme of love into the other theme of responsible science is one of the movie's bigger gaffs. For what it's worth, the movie does a decent job of selling the love between boy and pet, as well as the budding romance between Victor and his equally goth-y, quirky neighbor.For a classic horror fan, there's a lot of references, homages, and throwbacks inside of this one. The movie starts with a film-within-a-film, amusingly presenting stop-motion animation in a stop-motion environment. The Frankenstein allusions go a little deeper then the obvious. Winona Ryder plays a girl named Elsa and a supporting character is modeled after Frankenstein's Monster and speaks with a Boris Karloff lisp. They even wrap him up like a mummy at one point. There's a lot more. The passionate science teacher is visually patterned after Vincent Price. Disappointingly, Walter Matheu never attempts to impersonate Price's signature voice. In the latter half of the film, a creature that heavily resembles Gamera wanders in, as do a gang of killer sea-monkeys that leap out of pools and chomp on popcorn, Gremlins-style. The references-heavy tone even makes a closet full of wire hangers look familiar.Of course, the black-and-white environment is gorgeous. The movie might actually be a little too scary for young kids. The body-horror-lite transformation of pet cat into monstrous cat-bat is played fairly straight, as is the Wererat stalking a gym teacher through the halls of the school. The spooky pet cemetery provides a lot of ambiance, especially in the scene where Sparky realizes his undead origins, one of the movie's best.The movie is a straight-up remake of the original short film, some scenes copied frame for frame. To extend the story to feature length, a major subplot about rival kids creating their own monstrous pets was added. Though fun, and leading to some of the biggest laughs in the movie, these scenes feel a little shoehorned in. Especially since, once the big exciting monster attack on the town carnival is over, we still have to get to the burning windmill as seen in the original. I'll admit that neither Atticus Shaffer as Igor-expy Edgar nor Charlie Tahan as protagonist Victor really work for me. Neither kid actor has strong voices. Luckily, the rest of the cast, Catherine Keener and Martin Short in triple roles and a meek-sounding Ryder, pick up the slack. A gag about psychic cat poop is unnecessarily icky. The movie is generally better then that.Over all, ""Frankenweenie"" is super cute. Sparky is adorable, it's nice to look at, and is frequently funny throughout. It would be a great movie for horror fan parents to take their kids too. If you can really credit the movie to Burton, it's one of the better films of his later-day period.",Frankenweenie

107,larry-411,A family-friendly entry-level feature into the world of Tim Burton and an evocative experience for viewers of all ages,7,8 October 2012,"The latest animated feature from auteur Tim Burton, the black and white ""Frankenweenie"" is, on its surface, a classic ""boy and his dog"" story. A tale of a tail, as it were. Sure, it's been done before -- many times. But eye-popping state of the art stop motion animation, combined with a loving homage to the great movie monsters of the past century, makes this film a unique joy to watch. Add into the mix a message about the importance of science education, a pitch in favor of under-appreciated teachers, and a healthy dose of schmaltz.The story and characters were first developed for a 1984 short, directed by Burton and scripted by Leonard Ripps. This full-length version was co-written by John August and Burton, who directs and produces.""Frankenweenie"" opens with a ""film within a film"" as the Frankensteins watch appropriately cheesy home movies of son Victor (the voice of Charlie Tahan) and their devoted dog Sparky. They're viewing Super 8MM film -- the picture is set, roughly, in early 60s suburbia although deliberate anachronisms abound. A tragedy befalls the family and it's up to the boy to use his love of science to make things right.The voice cast showcases talented newcomers and familiar icons. Charlie Tahan, most recently Zac Efron's little brother Sam in the tearjerker ""Charlie St. Cloud,"" turns in an understated and heart-tugging performance as young Victor. Landau's Rzykruski is the audience-pleaser who brings down the house again and again. As the naif Elsa Van Helsing, Winona Ryder is the perfect schoolboy crush with her sweet innocence. Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara excel at several roles, including Victor's well-meaning but (of course) bumbling parents. In a worthy homage to Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant, Atticus Shaffer (Brick of ABC's ""The Middle"") steals the show as Victor's classmate Edgar E. Gore.As in many animated features, the characters were modeled after the actors voicing them. While in the recording booth, the performers mimed the action of the puppets, not only to give themselves some context, but also because it enhances the emotional believability of what ends up on screen.If you haven't recently experienced the filmmaking method of puppetry with stop motion animation you'll be amazed at what can be done. Burton's attention to detail is legendary, and fully on display here.Viewers may be familiar with the term ""magic hour,"" typically the first and last hour of sunlight when just the right visual balance is achieved. Animation affords filmmakers certain luxuries. Magic hour can happen 24 hours a day. The interplay of light and shadow in ""Frankenweenie"" is wondrous.Peter Sorg's cinematography features dramatic crane and dolly shots with a liberal amount of slow pans that effectively mimic a live action production. Co-editors Chris Lebenzon and Mark Solomon get special credit for seamlessly integrating poignant flashbacks and witty dream sequences at the most unexpected moments.Audiences will immediately be aware of composer Danny Elfman's magnificent score. It flows superbly from opening to closing credits and serves as a critical element in advancing the narrative.But the real fun is in spotting the homages...from early-mid 20th Century classics like ""Frankenstein"" (and his bride), ""Dracula"" (Martin Landau's depiction of science teacher Mr. Rzykruski is dedicated to Boris Karloff), and ""Godzilla,"" to more recent faves ""Gremlins"" and...hmm...is that ""The Mummy?"" ""ET?"" Well, that's the point. Some see monsters that even Burton swears weren't intended. (I spotted more on my second viewing, truth be told.) Burton's latest foray into animation is truly a delight. It's a highly accessible entry-level feature into the world of a director whose previous work may have been a bit too quirky and mature for families with small children. ""Frankenweenie"" is an evocative experience for viewers of all ages.",Frankenweenie

My daughter Sienna found the death of Sparky very sad, which it was, but the ending is ""happy,"" in the sense that the resurrected Sparky gets to stay, whereas the other Franken-monsters don't.

110,julian-mumford,"Fun, albeit dark children's modern fable",6,10 April 2013,"Famously Tim Burton left Disney because his stories were too dark.Skip forward to 2012. We have a Disney presentation by Tim Burton, where a much loved childhood pet is killed by a car, buried, later disinterred and then subsequently re-animated in a child's pastiche of Frankenstein.Leaving irony trembling at the cemetery gates, we have a children's tale that is beautifully animated in black and white stop motion. A method which by now, everyone knows is perhaps the most time consuming, laborious and downright hardest way to make a movie.The characters are exaggerated in a style similar to ""Coraline"" and Burton makes the most of his character actors. Martin Landau as the voice of disgraced scientist Mr Rzykruski, who inspires Viktor to take extreme measures when events go south.Burton clearly undertaking another labour of love, has brought to life a story that maybe did not need telling. However, the film is clearly made with much care and passion, perhaps representing a childhood idea that just refused to die.Victor Frankenstein (Tahan - Voice) is a lad who perhaps does not fit in that well, he has no friends apart from a vague and not always welcome acquaintance with Edgar E Gore (Shaffer). He does have his pet dog ""Sparky"" and his film making which reassures his parents, Mr & Mrs Frankenstein (Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara - voices) that maybe he is okay and happy in his own way.Viktor does interact a little with his neighbour Elsa Van Hesling (Ryder) and her pet poodle which adds some emotional depth, especially between the pets before the trouble begins.All is well in a slightly, ""I am in the attic conducting weird experiments and making movies by myself"" sort of way. Not in anyway related presumably, to the director's own life experiences. However when ""Sparky"" is involved in a pet dog/car interface, the film takes a darker tone.The film does not shy away from the loss this creates. However instead of accepting the reality and engaging in the five steps of grief, Victor inserts re-animation straight in at number two. We are treated to a mini-me version of the creation of Frankenstein but with a much loved family pet, accepting the bolts and coarse sewing work instead.There are some scenes to treasure, Viktor in his attic attired with goggles and lightning all around is worth the admission alone. There is a perception that like ""Dark Shadows"", this was a film that Burton wanted to make, irrespective of any discernible target audience. Box office suggests that re-animating the dead is not the draw it once was.The film is relatively short and mostly enjoyable, although may be too scary for some youngsters. Some older viewers might bridle at the ending, something Burton perhaps fought over and lost.Summary Fun, albeit dark children's modern fable. Made with love and attention to detail, striving for but arguably missing out on capturing the true essence of the story.Not as good as ""Coraline"" but in the somewhat limited market of stop motion re-animated children's horror movies, far better than average in every way.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Frankenweenie

112,jburtroald95,"Burton does what he does best, and even a little more",8,17 December 2012,"The Claymation works of distinctively quirky director Tim Burton are always a ghoulish treat. They are the fullest forms of Burtonesque cinema with the boundless freedoms the medium gives its practitioners, who are able to form their own worlds with completely unique physical rules, colour schemes, styles of movement and grand set pieces that take up only a tiny amount of space in the actual studio. With this latest foray into his universe of pale disproportionate, baggy-eyed characters and creepy monsters that make their way jerkily across the screen, and into our hearts by a totally different route to Walt Disney, Burton not only has a great time in his old home, but finds the perfect outlet for an idea he first developed in 1984 with the live action short Frankenweenie. It had to be short, otherwise his fans would never have warmed to it, because it was basically a sugar-coated family animal- centred movie powered by one original concept – that of a boy re- animating his beloved dead dog in the manner of Victor Frankenstein – that can really only full sustain the first three scenes, but is the overworked of the entire half-hour speedy checklist of clichés. However, as a doggedly cynical kiddie Claymation horror fest, it works exceedingly well, and even manages to produce an organic moral.The young Victor Frankenstein is introduced to us as an introverted little budding scientist who enjoys making his own B-grade horror films using home-made practical effects (just as in the original short). The only company he needs he gets from his lovable, feisty little dog sparky. His typically narrow-minded dad thinks that he should pursue more conventional interests, and conform to the TV stereotype of a young sport-obsessed boy. Surprisingly, he is the only character in the film opposed to Victor's individuality. There is nothing typical to be found about Victor's schoolmates, a band of amusing macabre caricatures who seem like the classmates Burton wished he had. Two of the boys, Toshiaki and Nasor, with their slitted eyes and twisted foreign accents could easily be cornball villains in any James Bond, Get Smart or Indiana Jones episode. Nasor also resembles a teenage Boris Karloff, and to seal the deal Burton throws us an unmissable Mummy reference. Joining these uniquely evil children as Victor's other rival in the science fair, an event that's pleasingly regarded with prestige, not ridicule, at this school, is the classically creepy Edgar ""E"" Gore, a mischievous little hunchbacked cretin with an obvious archetypal counterpart. They quickly discover the old lightning experiment that the distraught Victor has conducted on the dog he tore from his resting place, and try to replicate it, giving a spectacular closing act where Burton and his animators transform with relish the most mundane of pets into grisly, nightmarish horror monsters.Victor's eccentric, but wise science teacher, Mr Rzykruski, wisely counsels him that no science experiment will succeed if it's done without heart, and the scheming jealousy of Victor's classmates are a far cry from the heartbreakingly innocent love for the adorable sparky, the one effective piece of sentimentality that screenwriter Leonard Ripps has allowed into this juicy horror outing. The heart is definitely there, but not in excess. The film stumbles through some inevitable family movie clichés, but doesn't dwell on them. Most of the characters, even the helpless monster movie crowds, go easy on the melodramatic reactions we've come to expect, either because of the jerky stop-motion medium, or because they're accustomed to such events in a Burton universe. While we do get an angry mob by the end of the film, they're ignorant impulsivity becomes representative of people's prevalent slothful attitude towards science. As Mr Rzykruski also says, ""people like what science gives them, but not the questions it asks.""This one of those ""kids"" movies that older audience members will enjoy even more than the wide-eyed youngsters, and boasts a highly impressive voice cast. Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short enthusiastically take three characters each, the acting personalities of Burton Winona Ryder and Martin Landau shine through beautifully in their parts, and due credit should also be given to talented young actors Atticus Shaffer and Charlie Tahan, who give standout performances as Edgar and Victor.",Frankenweenie
113,rmarkd,"Was okay, then lost interest",5,15 June 2020,"Frankenweenie is a story about a boy Victor and his dog Sparky. Sparky is killed after weird girl has a cat poo premonition. Victor feels bad until his science teacher shows an experiment where he electrifies a frog's legs. Victor decided to dig up dead Sparky and, because of the plot convenient fact that lightning storms happen in their area where it's plot convenient, Victor is able to revive Sparky.Then something about a science fair and other kids finding out about his scientific breakthrough. The movie lags at this point.It ends with the kids doing experiments of their own with corresponding plot convenient lightning storms. However, their pets don't come back the way Sparky does because, as the *science* teacher explained, their heart wasn't in the right place. The creatures instead come back evil and it's up to Victor and Sparky to save the day.In the end, the day is saved. Sparky, once thought to be an evil monster, wins over the crowd, and they bring him back to life via a multi-car jump start.Okay, so yes, this is a Burton movie, not a sci-fi movie. I do get that, and I get that most of the stuff going on is just the Burtonesque way, so I shouldn't bother nitpicking. But outside of all that, the story after the first act is just dull. It meanders until the third act where all the other kids' experiments go awry.That said, the visuals are nice. It's a B&W animated movie and certainly has a Coraline/Corpse Bride feel. The B&W does add a nice touch of nostalgia to things. If you like Burtonesque weirdness and visuals, you'll likely find this movie more than I did. I do like Tim Burton, and if they did something different with that middle 30 minutes, I might have rated it higher, but as it is, 5/10 -- mild dislike.",Frankenweenie
114,rebecca-ry,"Great comedy, horror and heart",9,27 October 2012,"This is the latest animated adventure by director Tim Burton and is probably the best one. The story is, of course, based on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' but it is also based on an early short film by Burton. You can tell Burton had a sense of unfinished business and had wanted to do this for a while. It is a really lovely, heart-warming story about a child's devastation after losing a pet – something which many of us can relate to – and his determination to get him back. There are some great comic scenes that both adults and kids can enjoy. Of course, it wouldn't be a Tim Burton film without some scares – nothing too scary but there are some jumpy scenes that work. It has been filmed in black and white which gives it this great old classic horror feel which almost brings feelings of nostalgia. There are some great references to classic horror films like Dracula and Frankenstein so you can tell this film has been made by a true horror and general film fan. Overall, this is a delightful film from Burton which has a lot of important themes included. It has great comedy, horror and most of all, heart and is definitely a film worth going to see.",Frankenweenie

116,plex,Status quo Burton,4,20 August 2013,"With the relatively recent injection of animated movies that cater to both parents and kids, I see no reason to offer films that are strictly for a child mentality WHEN the director has consistently offered-up projects that were clearly targeted for both. In this instance, Tim Burton has focused on, whether intentional or not, a strictly children's fare. I say this because only a child would find this film even remotely entertaining. IMO, it fails on nearly all fronts: from story line, to voice-over talent, to pacing, music ( even bland by Elfman's standards, which is saying something), and dynamics. Martin Landeau gives the only interesting voice over performance. The story is on the weak side as it fails to ever elevate in suspense or conflict. I never got the real connection between the boy and his dog. When the dog dies, the parents are seemingly despondent, not offering any concerns or care the next day. The attic of the house is about twice as tall as the main floor. We see our protagonist spend as much time digging up his dead pet and bringing it back home as he does to create the experiment to bring it back alive. The film looks like a cross between Edward Scissor hands and Ed Wood. Burton steals ideas from his other films and his MO(primarily his art-direction) is getting as tired as M. Night Shyamalan's. The only thing that made me react in a positive was the poodle being shocked into looking like the poodle version of the Bride of Frankenstein. Of course, there were some things taken from the original classic, Frankenstein, and that was to be expected; there was a semi-cute take on the laboratory, the villagers outcry, and mirrored characters ( like the Burgermiester, and more subtle Van Helsing exemplified by Ryder's VO ) We are led to believe that Victor is a genius, by conceiving/creating ( seemingly in only a couple of hours) this elaborate lab to pursue his experiment, but all of the other kids get the same result as him by simply hooking up charger cables and supplying electricity. It seem details like that were abandoned on purpose, but they need not be in a full length film, especially when so much detail was given in so many other visual ways. Burton has obviously mastered this format of animation and its a real pleasure to look at ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars) But this film conjures up no depth, is terribly paced, and is boringly bland. IMO, Tim's best works have been Beetlejuice, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Ed Wood. All of them are different, yet subtly the same but that is his biggest problem, hiding the subtlety. I cant help but feel he lacks the ability to step back and take a look at the bigger picture ( no pun intended) to see the inappropriate commonality between most of his work: Same production team, same actors, same composer, same look! I hope he is not so arrogant or insecure to assume they all should be the same. If you ever want to change Tim, contact me to compose music, it would be a small start, and I'd do it for free.",Frankenweenie
117,Animated_Antic,A cute and clever satire of the famous tale.,8,16 October 2017,"I do find it ironic that Tim Burton remade his older short film ""Frankenweenie"". For those that don't know, Burton started his career as an animator at the Disney studio and made a half an hour live action short film of the same name in 1984. The executives at Disney hated the short thinking it was too scary and fired him from the company. Burton later got hired as a director by Warner Bros. the following year and the rest is history.  Almost thirty years later, Burton decided to expand his original story into a stop motion animated movie. How were the results you may ask? Well, here's my synopsis.The film is essentially a different retelling of Mary Shelly's novel. A young boy named Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) is living a happy life with his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short) and of course, his dog Sparky in the town of New Holland. His happiness, however, is cut short when Sparky is accidentally struck by a car and killed. Victor becomes depressed and starts wishing for his dog back when he gets an idea. After his science teacher (Martin Landau) shows him the science of electricity on dead frogs, Victor builds a crazy invention in the attic to successfully bring Sparky back to life. After realizing what he's done, one of his pupils named Edgar (Atticus Shaffer) blackmails Victor into showing him how the process works which results in a chaos that should be seen to believed. I'd rather not give anymore details.There are things that I think that the film did better than the original short film. I liked how they gave more personality to Sparky to make the audience sympathize with him more. I also really enjoyed the details they included in the original in this film. But by far, the best part of the movie was the climax which was so insane and crazy that it really made me laugh. Even Burton reusing actors from his previous films like O'Hara, Landau, and Winona Ryder was also a welcoming addition.The animation once again, is great. I love how it was shot in black and white to add to the comedy and also really liked the crazy city they designed for this world. However, I did find the character's designs a little too similar to the ones from ""Corpse Bride"" considering that most of the crew that worked on that film also worked on this one as well. Speaking of the characters, I really enjoyed them as well. The fact that some of them even looked like the characters from the 1931 original film was also pretty funny. However, the film does have flaws. I do think that some of the emotional moments could have been handled a little better, and some of the scenes were a little pointless, particularly one involving the science teacher. But, I digress.""Frankenweenie"" might not be one of Burton's best stop motion films, but I think it's still a pretty good movie in general. I has a pretty funny story, some great animation, and some funny characters. I think the film may have been one of Burton's best film had some of the scenes were handled a little better, but I think the film had enough charm and humor for me to give it fair recommendation.",Frankenweenie
118,hayashimegumi,This film is bittersweet in its own ways. And I like that.,7,29 October 2014,"Frankenweenie (2012) is a beautifully animated stop motion film homage to classic horror films with references to Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and Godzilla. This animated feature though cannot be compared to Tim Burton's live action films as they are essentially different types of movie, it is just as dark, Gothic and artistic as his other films; perhaps just much more personal. Although completely in black and white, everything is lively. It would be extra appealing to those who love black and white films. There are certainly several scenes that are impactful even with no words expressed at all. Nostalgic as the whole film is old school, the main character Victor also resembles Tim Burton childhood; they both make their own films in their early years. In Frankenweenie (2012), the relationship between the pets and their owners are admirable, the children's competitiveness in fear of losing in the science fair are funny and the science teacher has unique personality that is honorable but it deals with the lost of loved ones, the mysteries of science and the fear of something unknown to the masses in addition to conformity, loneliness and ignorance too. Therefore, this film is bittersweet in its own ways. And I like that.However, one thing I don't really like about this film is towards the end, it feels a little ridiculous. It was really awesome until everyone conjured something different up. It is not that bad but the art seems not consistent anymore. Still, I still love this film and it'd be one of my favorite animated films!You will find that this film does have a lot of precious moments if you watch it. Victor's parents are supportive of his ventures. The pets such as Sparky, Persephone and Mr. Whiskers are so adorable and they are truly the best companion any children could have. I find the pets' eyes looks so real, realistic. Their expressions are genuine. Just like Tim Burton has mentioned, ""Dogs are special. You leave them and go out the front door. Then you come back two minutes later and it's like they haven't seen you in three weeks... You don't get that with people, really"".In short, Frankenweenie (2012) is endearing and certainly a black and white beauty.",Frankenweenie

The animation style is unique and captivating, pairing nicely with an ominous black and white color. The emotional depth is the highlight, being relatable and well-executed, due to smart dialogue and fitting editing. Character development was mostly good, but there were some holes in the supporting characters. This aligns with the exciting plot, that sometimes progresses too fast, potentially missing a couple scenes that could give the movie more meaning. The storyline is still well written, however. With a mostly satisfying conclusion, Frankenweenie turns out to be a good family friendly animated picture.",Frankenweenie

This is a remake of an old short film Burton did in the 80's, which also fans the flames of doubt that Tim Burton has run out of ideas. i guess their is one surprise in this film; Johnny Depp is not in it. he basic idea of the story is taken from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and it never veers from it, which could have make it an enjoying film. Tim Burton should have explored the paranormal or even some of his usual humour could have add to this bland story.

124,mronrox45,"No, this one didn't work.",2,14 October 2012,"Got to tell you. Most of what I saw in the movie was more marketing. I have many Nightmane before Christmas figurines, so I guess they want to sell me something new. Tim Burton is a great director, but he has not made a ""blockbuster"" in my opinion since Big Fish. I was excited to see this movie because I know its an older short film of his with new animation. Sounded like a cant miss. Well, there is a reason this wasn't a hit in 1984 and has been panned for almost 30 years! The story is weak at best. Most of the elements are borrowed and predictable. There are a few scenes as well where my kids felt a bit squeamish in the theaters. The part were the girl shows her cat turds to a very zoomed in camera was not pleasant to a person who was eating popcorn at the moment, me! And the part where the boy was ""re-animating"" the dog was a bit disturbing to anyone who has had a pet die. Its one thing for a mad scientist to bring Fankenstien back to life, most people will accept that. But a nice, well mannered kid? It just came across as disturbing. The ending might have been the worst of all the Burton movies I have seen. It was completely devoid of any type of moral lesson. Im not saying that a movie has to have morals, but the entire movie was set up (even the ending) to show some kind of message to all of it. None. Everyone has had a pet die and the growth we obtain by learning about life and death are lifelong and special to all of us. Yet this movie says, ""the heck with that""! I know Burton lives in a world of his own and I love him for that. But somehow it seems he has crossed some kind of line he shouldn't have crossed with this movie.",Frankenweenie
125,eatfirst,Tim Burton resurrects his pet project,7,4 November 2012,"In 1984, Tim Burton, a young animator / director working at Disney, made a thirty minute short about a boy who brings his dead dog back to life. His employers took one look at his mutant creation and promptly showed him the door.Nearly thirty years on, and ""Disney Presents"" his feature length stop- motion reworking of that nascent project, and, after the wobbles of Alice In Wonderland and Dark Shadows, it's the most charmingly Burtonesque feature he's made in some time. Featuring all the hallmarks of his instantly recognisable style (crazy angles, spindly-legged bug- eyed protagonists, chiaroscuro lighting, all set against a fat-bottomed, shock-haired variant of 50s suburban Americana) writ large in animated form, but at the service of a simple, sweet-natured slice of Gothic fantasy.An amiable riff on the classic Frankenstein tale, the story of young Victor and his re-animated beloved pet doesn't really offer much meat to put on the bones of his short story. But it does deliver a sympathetic portrait of childhood out of whack with the mainstream and all the healthier for it (no doubt somewhat autobiographical, in feel at least if not in the corpse-meddling details). There's plenty of fun to be had soaking up the loving homages to the likes of Universal Studios 1930s back-catalogue, a classroom full of Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney lookalike kids chief among them, leading to a small-scale monster mash that takes much the same route as Wallace & Grommit's Curse Of The Were- Rabbit, and to similar grin-inducing effect.

128,tyreeewebster,Retrospective Reviews- Frankenweenie (2012),8,2 January 2013,"After Tim Burton's other film of 2012, Dark Shadows (which I wrongly gave a rating of 10), I though to myself 'How is he going to redeem himself after bringing out, let's face it, a rather appalling film'. Thankfully, he brought out the wonderful 'Frankenweenie', a film that reminds us why we all loved him in the first place.PROS: To start off, I'm glad that Tim decided not to cast Johnny Depp in this one. As much as I love Johnny Depp, I think they should give their collaboration a rest, the voice cast in this movie is brilliant. The voices make the characters believable and likable, especially Charlie Tahan as the voice of lead character, Victor. Surprisingly, Martin Short was a good addition to the cast and so was Winona Ryder and everybody else. But, the actor/character who steals the show is Martin Landau as Mr. Rzykruski, who is actually my favourite character of the movie, and after seeing his performance as Bela Lugosi in 1994's 'Ed Wood', I'm glad to see him reunite with Burton, even if it is in animated form. Speaking of animation, the film looks spectacular, this film has some of the best stop- motion animation I've ever seen, and it suits the story very well too, which is a well structured story with good emotion and humour to accompany it. The decision to make the film in black- and- white was a brilliant decision, and a fantastic artistic change.CONS: My only gripe is that the film falls quite short (but is well paced) and the ending should have been different, but that is just my opinion.Overall, this is probably one of Tim Burton's best, watch it, and you won't be disappointed.Directed by: Tim BurtonWritten by: John AugustStarring: Charlie Tahan, Frank Welker, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Martin Short, Martin Landau, Robert Capron and Atticus Shaffer",Frankenweenie

132,Nibbler007,"Burton for Kids...? I enjoyed it, though",9,27 December 2012,"When Edward Scissorhands came out on the early nineties as a classic movie, I was a little fellow, maybe eight years old. The Edward Scissorhands thing sticked with me all this time, and there's no doubt Tim Burton made such a thing again in 2012. I may be thinking of this because of my attachment to those beautiful scores written by Danny Elfman, which have never been so close to that epic and beautiful film as they are now on Frankenweenie. Or maybe because Winona Ryder's voice and Johnny Depp's/Victor style. Or maybe because of that quirky self referential humor Burton displays on every frame, reminds me of Edward Scissorhands a lot, not to mention the scenery (mill on a hill and a humble ""american dream""-like neighbors. Kids wouldn't know that this is the director of a very poignant Batman series a long time ago. But we have lots of bats, even that strange umbrella.So, Batman-ish umbrellas, Beetlejui-sh scary pet monsters, Vincent Price-ish eccentric European mad professor, Igor Edgar Poe-ish sidekick on those experiments; Godzillas from the oriental monster mythology, even glimpses to Hitchcock's ""Birds"".All of them condensed in a delightful children and adult story. For me, who felt like the child I was on Edward Scissorhands and for the nowadays me, who is an adult and enjoyed Frankenweenie as well, the movie just filled every memory and emotions I needed from Tim. What more can I say, I just forgot how massively brilliant can be Mr. Burton when he sticks with that sense of beauty from the awful and the unnatural. Nobody can bring the dead alive so beautifully.I shall put it on my list: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, Frankenweenie, Vincent and a step lower Bride's Corpse (maybe I'm a fan of his ""darkest comedies""). They are Burton at his best. And that's really good news. We can rewatch Frankenweenie in a few years as part of a definitive Burton legacy. Yeah, on the other hand you can say this is a spin-off from previous movies. Don't worry, it won't bother you at all, the script is still a good one. Frankenweenie stands for itself.That's a nine for me. Mainly because it somehow moved me like no other animation film he had done previously. Cheers from Argentina..",Frankenweenie
133,Edd-N-Furter,Frankenweenie or bringing Tim Burton's mojo back from the dead,9,6 January 2015,"In 1984, when Tim Burton worked for Disney made a short film called Frankenweenie, which tells the story of Victor, a boy who after losing his dog Sparky in an accident decides to bring him back to life in the purest Frankenstein style, without considering the consequences this may cause. This work helps us to understand the basics of Burton's thematic and visual style, which became his trademark over the years: dark worlds with isolated and/or solitary characters faced to the reality of the world that confronts or rejects them.It is almost 30 years later and a streak of quite irregular films that Burton returns to his roots and decided to resume the story of Frankenweenie to make an animated feature making use of the stop- motion technique, with which he created some of his best works such as the Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, and Frankenweenie is no exception, as it represents a return to the best films of Burton.On this occasion the original story remains intact and makes a bigger emphasis on the impact of the resurrection of Sparky among Victor's friends and as they'll try to emulate the feat with catastrophic results for the small town they live in. Likewise, the relationship between Victor and Elsa, her neighbor and school crush is explored, through which a great reference to The Bride of Frankenstein is made, although it'snot the only one, since along the film there are winks to classic monsters movies from the 30's as the Mummy, Creature from Black Lagoon, Cabinet of Dr. Cagliari and even classic monsters like Godzilla. And the film itself is a homage to this cinema being filmed in black and white and with music in perfect tone by Danny Elfman (Burton's closest collaborator).An innate quality of Burton is the skill to create endearing characters out of the dark and grotesque and the best example of it is Sparky, a little dog now part of the most adorable creations on the burtonian universe, and that somehow reflects many of elements or themes that have remained constant in most of Burton's filmography: childhood, loneliness, friendship and a strange fixation with death and what happens after this.Excepting the end that seems to betray the original concept, it is safe to say that Burton needs to do more films like Frankenweenie and much less like Alice in Wonderland.",Frankenweenie

135,Jodro2,Entertaining movie spoiled by a monumentally immature ending,2,27 April 2014,"Frankenweenie is a beautifully realized movie, funny and poignant in places, with some deeper points about the nature of science, life and death, and people's herd mentality. As such it can be enjoyed by both adults and kids of, say, over 8 years old, despite the darker themes and images. It could have been quite a good movie, as the main character finds transcendence in the last few minutes, shifting his understanding of life, and with that of death, and having made many new friends in the process. Sadly, frustratingly, maddeningly, the movie throws all these achievements out of the window in the very last 30 seconds, by inserting the typical, cheap, sentimental, intelligence-insulting, Hollywood ending.There's a deeper and very tragic point here, which is that the ending is the embodiment of the dark side of the USA. I say this as a fan of the county, and someone who has lived there, but the essence of this dark side is a world view that's epically immature in several major respects. One aspect is its total incapacity to come to terms with the reality if life, and with that of death. Another aspect is dividing the world into black and white, ie only pure evil and pure good, and Hollywood's movie heroes are, of course, always all-good, and the only credible storyline is invariably the obliteration of their all-evil adversaries. The good versus evil world view leads to sentimentality and an utter lack of depth, understanding, and genuine emotion.In real life it means that Americans tend to see themselves as all-good and all-powerful, with a very sentimental view of the world, in denial of the facts of life, most importantly those of life and death, and whenever someone comes along to disturb this illusion, the typical response is to shoot 'm up, as happens in a murderous US foreign policy.My apologies for dragging all this into a review of a kids' movie, but the fact is that the US entertainment industry is one important aspect of US culture in which the US world view is reflected, and which also in turns shapes that very world view. One would hope that the more intelligent directors, like Tim Burton, would have the courage to stand up to the pressure from studios and focus-group findings and make movies with at least some degree of depth and a realistic understanding of the human condition. But not so,apparently.",Frankenweenie
136,ryansassy1,For those who love Burton the great and sour-ful!,8,7 October 2012,"So if I'm going to write a review, it's for the parents' sake, right? Well at least for the good parents' sake, who actually care to know what's in a movie before taking their kids. Kids don't read reviews. Mostly...Frankenweenie is a stop motion animated tale that lovingly parodies the classic old Frankenstein movies (actually, all the B&W horror films get a shout or two somewhere in the plot). The characters are all kids in modern American suburban town New Holland, with the dog Sparky, aka Frankenweenie, as Victor Frankenstein's best and only real friend. It's understandable therefore that when Sparky is killed by a car, science nerd Victor is heartbroken enough to try to use science to fix him. For a wonder, it actually works! Sparky is alive again, and now Victor has to hide him from the world...at least before unveiling him to the science fair.Tim Burton has come back in classic style doing what he does best: creating fantastic visual style with a Gothic flavor, humorous and macabre all at once. But is this really a ""kid's"" film? It does say PG, which most parents will interpret automatically to mean ""yes, take all your kids to see it, nothing inappropriate here."" Okay, but before you take your tender Under-Tens, you should be aware of the following scenes (Bug Duh Spoiler Alert for the Dull-Witted who didn't see it in the title): Victor stitching up his dead dog with needle and thread, then screws in bolts to its neck so that he can have something to attach the jumper cables for the reanimation experiment. No actual blood and gore is shown, but it makes for a little wince-y moment if you have a tot sitting next to you.After Sparky is reanimated, various body parts fall off throughout the film. Once again, no actual blood or gore is shown, but...hmmm. This should make for fun conversations about decomposition and its role on a dead body, eh? Hopefully not during the film, however: some of us are trying to watch.A cat holding a bat in its mouth gets accidentally electrified by his owner's science fair experiment, and somehow the two merge into a gruesome cat/bat monster. The transformation is graphic and on the scary side for the little ones to my way of thinking.Victor's classmates learn of his success with reanimating Sparky and so they raid the cemetery for the bodies of their own deceased pets. One of them digs a dead rat out of a trashcan. Then they all attempt to repeat the experiment with lightening to bring the animals back to life. One of the reanimations goes horribly wrong, turning a turtle into a giant mutant with a mouthful of wicked teeth; of course, it goes on a rampage Godzilla-style to crush/eat the town fair. I thought this sequence was funny as an adult, but probably a little disturbing for younger viewers.I mean, it's a Giant Turtle, With Fangs, that steps on living beings and tries to eat them. And for the record, it's not cute and cartoony like the TMNTs.In the climax of the film, the cat/bat mutant is attacking Sparky, then a beam falls from the ceiling and skewers the creature through the abdomen. Once again, no actual blood or gore, but this was a very intense scene...in a children's film? Really? And so, that's my final point: it isn't really for younger kids. The ratings board was off their game here. Would any of them GET the many references to classic B-horror films that makes this such a gem for us, the (presumably) more sophisticated viewers? More to the point, do under-tens really need to see a film--no matter how clever or funny it is to their parents -- about reanimating corpses? Would they understand the gallows-humor, cynical, chaotic, violent, and death-fixated Burtonverse? I say No, No, and No. Sorry to be the voice of sanity in this otherwise delightful and long-overdue Burton comeback.Let this great little film remain a singular pleasure for all of us big kids who've had the chance to love cheesy and glorious old movies about mad scientists, vampires, and monsters --we've earned the privilege. Let the little kids stay little kids a little while longer without the scary goth man giving them fodder for their nightmares. There's plenty of time for that sort of thing later in Jr. High School.",Frankenweenie

The amount of time, care, and raw creativity that is put into films like this one is mind boggling to me. It surely is not the easiest way to make a movie, but it is done with so much care. I love how they decided to keep the film black and white, pays respect to classic Frankenstein movies but also really shows the detail of the figures and sets used. The story is great, the characters are fun. Plus if you have a dog of your own who you love as much (or more) as Victor loves Sparky, this movie will pull at your heartstrings.",Frankenweenie

Has a decent story and solid characters, but here's my pros and cons:Pros: -The dog is awesome. I love the energy this animal has. -I like the relationship that Victor and the dog have. - It can be a really funny film. - It has a decent story with solid characters.Cons: -(This one isn't really a problem, but I think it's odd) Edgar always smiles. Every time you see him, he smiles. There's even one part where he's running for his life and screaming, and STILL SMILING! You could tell him his grandma died and he would still be smiling! -Victor is a very bland character if you ask me. True, he's a kid, but they've given kids good personality before. Look at Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. He's not unlikable, he's just bland. Almost everyone seems to have a permanent face in this film. I just mentioned Edgar with smiling., but there's also this girl with her white cat who always looks like she's shocked.

139,Cinebuff38,An insult to the memories of Disney and Shelley,1,20 January 2016,"Being a member of the ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"" brigade, it saddens me that the more we progress into the 20th century, the more of a throwaway culture we seem to be embracing. Whereas in yesteryear for example, we had films that have turned out to be classics and long remembered, their legacy handed down through generations. Nowadays it would appear that the movie moguls are making films on a whim seriously assuming that if they have the backing of a well-known and established studio, the same effect will ensue.The Walt Disney studios have strayed into that path with Frankenweenie, an animated take on Mary Shelley's classic Frankenstein, by director Tim Burton, a one-trick pony whose idea of cinema is to take a timeless piece of work then undermine it by turning it into a whimsical merry-go-round ride that suits the throwaway generation , the term throwaway being apt for this film as the poor animation designs alone (the Dog looks more like an aardvark) make this yet another modern film fit for the dust cart.Shelley's story, about a mad scientist who resurrects a dead body was an adult oriented story at the time, its subsequent films being given an X certificate. Making the subject in Frankenweenie a Dog didn't work for me. This reworking was a poor excuse in order to appeal to kids as well as adults just to get more bums on seats.Disney is still capable of making good films. Tangled is an example. I just wish they would go back to proper drawings like they had in the traditional films like Peter pan for instance. Frankenweenie may have worked if that criteria was used and the characters more in touch with humanity, the story more developed and less shallow. Perhaps a different director would have been more appropriate. As far as this version is concerned, Walt Disney and Mary Shelley must be turning in their graves, and if the current staff of the studios are not carefully, Walt Disney productions could end up as dead as that Dog.",Frankenweenie

One day Victor starts playing baseball with few boys as same ages like him. The first game became such tragic and suddenly Sparky is gone. Victor is so sad that he wants bring Sparky back to the life. Then the experiment went to wrong way and the horror is on the loose. Warning: spoiler alert.Frankenweenie is the new version Burton's short story from 80's. But the scales is now bigger and storytelling is more deeper. In visual side the movie looks good and black and white style made the look even better. Burton used same stop-motion technique like what he used for Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Corpse Pride (2005). Burton loves horror flicks and Frankenweenie's story is full of classic horror elements and the characters. The script is clever and different characters made movie more interesting.Somewhere the film can't handle full scales and the crew loosed they ideas and none knew how the movie should have ended. I don't know what kind of ending Burton wrote in first place. It felt that Burton's original idea watered down and he wanted more ""kid friendly"" ending.

I was more than 100% behind this movie and the last 30 seconds killed it. It WAS going towards the top of my Burton list, those 30 seconds made it go to the bottom. That may seem harsh to the random movie goer but, let's review. The entire movie is about a boy who refuses to let go of someone he loved, something we ALL have to do. Basically, those last 30 seconds, crushed everything the entire movie was about. Every kid in this movie had to let go of their pets, EVEN the little girl with the kitty, who hadn't even lost her pet yet. It's just ridiculous. Had the last 30 seconds of this movie been cut, I would've given it a 10. But to ruin everything a movie builds up to at the end just makes the entire movie pretty much useless.",Frankenweenie

The technical side is phenomenal as to be expected from a Tim Burton film! as for the story it was a really nice story well written, very imaginative. The characters were instantly lovable.

147,MoodyB84,Burton goes back to basics and back on form,7,23 March 2013,"The term 'A Tim Burton Film' has almost become a cliché in itself these days in that it basically refers to a film being weird almost for the sake of being weird, especially Tim's remakes, or 're-imaginings' as they are often called. Being the cynical bugger, I regarded Frankenweenie with a little scepticism, especially as I am an animal lover and do not want to see one die in any film, let alone a kid's film! However, I found Frankweenie a pleasant surprise. I remember hearing in an interview that Burton, as a fan of horror films as kid, wanted to make the kind of film he would have loved at that age. This is what lies at the very heart of what makes Frankenweenie such a success; it is obviously a very personal film and made with total compassion and affection. After all the big budget remakes, Frankenweenie is a much welcome reminder of why Tim Burton is popular and regarded as a unique director.However, when a film is personal to the director it can of course become over indulgent and alienate a lot of the audience and sometimes lose sight of even any clear narrative. An element of restraint is necessary, and I am pleased to say that I felt Frankenweenie demonstrated a perfect balance of this. This is a film that adults and children can all enjoy and relate to. Despite being all in black and white, this is a film children will enjoy; there is enough heart and a sense of adventure, as well being told from the perspective of a child. Victor's position as a slight outsider to the norm is one that is easy to relate to, and many of us do. There are also countless nods and winks to various horror films that adults will enjoy, these all always tremendous fun as well as respectful to their original source. Of course, it goes without saying that people of any age who are animal lovers (like myself) and have experienced the companionship an animal can give you will find a genuine emotional connection to this film. There is also style to the substance, with some important underlying moral messages within the narrative that keeps Frankenweenie being a film with a good narrative structure and character arcs. The inevitable 'dramatic' scenes towards the end, though they feel inevitable, they still are good fun and never feel they have to be there as they fit in perfectly with the tone of the film, mirroring perfectly scenes from past horror films in consistently fun way. My one issue was an aspect of the ending. I don't want to give anything away, but there is a certain aspect of the ending that was a little inconsistent with a moral message that had up until then been a major theme of the narrative. Of course, this is essentially a kid's film so I am sure that may have had something to do with it, which I understand. I know that Frankenweenie was not a major box office success, and I understand why, I was a little guilty of having reservations against it myself. However, now it is available to buy, it is a film I would strongly recommend to kids and adults alike. Made with passion and heart, Frankenweenie is Tim Burton's most personal for a long time. It is all the better for it as Frankweenie is very accessible, involving and great fun for viewers of all ages",Frankenweenie

His idiosyncrasy?And yes he proved that he is a miserable wretch. With flawed animation, and fragile plot no character actually were properly developed.

152,lbishopkyo,"Animal-lovers and small children, stay away!",2,21 March 2016,"I saw this movie in the theater back in 2012 and I thought it was just AWFUL. I have never seen the original 80's film with Shelley Duvall, but whatever. This movie is still terrible. There are tons of problems with it; let's dive right into them, shall we? First of all, I think that black-and-white does fit for this kind of movie, which is obviously trying to look like Frankenstein (1931) or some other monster movie from around that time. But the problem with that (especially if you're watching on a big screen in the dark) is that the lights are occasionally too bright. There are some flashing lights in the film and I remember I thought I was gonna be blinded sitting in that theater.Second, the character design (and the characters themselves) are just plain bad. We have a hunchback kid who can't be not smiling even when he's not happy, two Asian people who show little feeling, a creepy girl with an old lady motif who carries her cat around all the time, and a goth chick. The facial expressions are never appropriate for how a character is meant to feel.It should also be said that I am an animal lover. I love cats and dogs alike (preferably cats). This movie, however, should not be seen by animal lovers. PETA would be displeased. I assumed the film would start with the dog already dead, but we have to actually build up to its death, which is just unbearable. Later, we see a cat transform (for no reason) into a bat creature, and it doesn't change back. That whole thing just makes me sad and angry. Not only is all of what I just mentioned too scary for little kids, but it's also emotionally scarring for animal lovers like I said!I remember seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) prior to this movie and I didn't like it. This movie makes Nightmare look like a masterpiece. At least they didn't abuse animals in a way that thought it was being funny and wasn't, and that movie tried to be kid-friendly. Frankenweenie does not succeed in any of that. Please, for the love of all animals, stay away from this awful movie, and if your pets are alive and well, be thankful for that.",Frankenweenie

It has all the classic Tim Burton qualities - the extraordinarily weird characters (which are just plainly weird, with no extra explanation), some black humor, dark atmosphere, great music (courtesy of Danny Elfman) and artistic touch; yet it lacks of that certain something that makes movies out-stand.I must additionally comment on the fact that the movie is filmed in black and white technique - although I understand the reasons behind this, and generally approve of such ideas, I don't think this was as essential to this movie; in fact perhaps it would have been better if it were in color. Although I say this from an utterly subjective perspective.All in all, a nice movie to watch, but nothing to enjoy much about.

Creative and original, Frankeweenie illustrates its writer's original roots.The concept is fascinating. Most of the characters are based on iconic horror movie characters, like Frankenstein and Van Helsing. In addition, the movie is set in black and white, trying to capture the old look of horror movies. And yes, I don't think this film is suitable for children, more like teenagers and adults, containing some scenes that may disturb children.It's the story of Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), who, after losing his beloved dog Sparky, tries to revive him using lightning. The experiment is a success, but no one should know about what happened. Things start to get messed up when Edgar (voiced by Atticus Shaffer) discovers Sparky.The animation is great.

The decent overall voice performance does the job just fine, giving us spooky character, Atticus Shaffer's voice gave me the chills.

158,gogul1,Tim Burton jumps back 18 years and it's back to greatness,9,24 October 2012,"Not since Edward Scissorhands has Tim Burton been so fresh. Frankenweenie is based on his short film he made many years ago before Burton was even on the radar as an A list director (1984). He has kept the black and white cinematography of the original and its a great hark back to the old Universal horror era. The story centres on a boy who loses his dog and turns to science to resurrect him. Ultimately it's a story of loss and being able to cope with it. Something everybody in the world must face at some point in their life whether it's when their young or when they become much older. This is where the theme strikes a cord with everybody. As much as it's a story about a boy toying with the laws of science, it's about you and how would you deal with the same situation. For that reason alone I believe this will be a cult classic. The black and white visuals are not to everybody's liking and that's a shame. I doubt no matter how good the reviews will be there will be some kids not willing to go and watch this. It's small town suburb of the 60's feel that made Edward Scissorhands so delightfully madcap is back and it feels just as fresh as when it was seen first presented to an unknowing audience.But for people who love movies this is also a great tip of the hat to all the old movies that inspired Tim as a young boy. From Frankenstein, Dracula and the Mummy there's moments and characters that just scream Hammer and Universal Horror franchises.This is a film that Burton fans and classic film fans alike should enjoy.

The movie pulls its punches, however, by providing a conventional happy ending for the children in the audience, even though there are some very frightening scenes right beforehand.

In some ways I feel the film would have been much more profound if Sparky had been allowed to die at the end. Victor gives him tearful permission not to ""come back.""

I was surprised it was in black and white but the characters were great in my opinion. Danny elfman never let's me down with his score in Burton's movies. This movie makes me laugh, cry and just want to hug my dog. I thought it was creepy but interesting with humor for both pre-teens, teens and adults. It's a little too gory for little kids. Yeah the ending was a little cliché but then again it was directed or the younger crowd. Idk why a lot of people are hating on this movie saying there is not plot cuz there is. ( kid loves dog, dog dies in accident , kid being it back, his friends find out and do the same but the experiment goes wrong, kid and dog save the town but dog dies again, but since it needs a happy ending dog comes back to life with the help of the town folk ) I'd go see this again but bring the tissues if you're an animal lover Definitely better than corpse bride and Alice in wonderland.!!!! The animation was great! I love his creepy theme ! The kids like it too!",Frankenweenie
162,thecaliforniadreamer,Very satisfying.,8,31 January 2013,"I was one of the seemingly few people who was very familiar with the short film years before this installment, as I had watched it a good few times on TV. That, plus my love for dogs, Disney, and Tim Burton's stop motion animation, had me all set for this movie. And may I say it gave me exactly what I wanted! The flow and pace of it is admirable and the tone and plot are very unique. The characters are nice, especially Sparky, of course, who's a total cutie pie to watch. While it has it's weird parts as I expected, they work for the movie. While I can't call it a favorite of mine, It was in that ""between good and really good"" category, so I would recommend it. Some people try to stay away from it thinking it's too dark, and, while it may be for some kids, if you're an adult and don't like those kinds of movies, you may still actually like this one.",Frankenweenie
163,alexlangholm,Frankenweenie vs Frankenweenie,7,3 December 2013,"(WARNING: spoilers) A full-length version of a short television film, Frankenweenie is basically the same subversive suburban vision of Frankenstein but with lots of other horror and monster movie clichés weaved into the background to give it a longer running time.Our protagonist Victor is sullen, introverted and otherworldly in the mould of many other Burton heroes such Edward Scissorhands. His parents and surroundings are deliberately-clichéd depictions of suburban America (again, slightly Scissorhandish) and into this mix are all sorts of clever references to characters and concepts that are more usually found in Hammer films. From the strange science teacher to the neighbour's dog's haircut, the strength of cinema Frankenweenie is in blending this additional Gothic layer onto an already-familiar template.There are some additional sub-plots thrown in such as a school science fair, but these remain sideshows and the original main elements of the story dominate it.But is the cinema Frankenweenie better than the original television Frankenweenie? There's only one way to find out, fiigh... no, let's compare them instead.The original short is punchier thanks to its shorter running time, and has the same core joke of something a child might mistakenly believe (that they can bring back dead loved ones) actually turning out to be true. On top of that, in many ways it's far more disturbing to see a live action child actor digging up his dead dog (also played by a real life canine). This might well be what made Disney go ballistic when Burton presented it to them back in the 1980s, but it's also what makes it stand apart from mainstream America and why Burton was an interesting young director to watch. This starkness probably put some people off who expected Disney films to be easily digestible, and without the happy ending the original Frankenweenie would be a fairly bleak film about lost innocence. It definitely wasn't the kind of thing to help sell lunchboxes.The modern full-length Frankenweenie is much more mainstream, easier to handle, easier to accept, probably because the stylised animation adds another protective layer between you and the gore: if a dog starts falling to pieces it's much less distressing when it's animated, just as Tom & Jerry is more acceptable than Sam Peckinpah. Cinema Frankenweenie is clearly much more compatible with both the Disney branding and the merchandising that accompanies it. Whether that accessibility makes it a better film depends on your own personal requirements from a work of art (and maybe your mood too).",Frankenweenie
164,dottydolly,I sobbed more than when I watched Les Miserables :oD,9,20 January 2013,"I'm 48 years old, and I sobbed over this movie, several times :o) And I'm proud :o) It struck a chord, reminded me a lot of Edward Scissorhands, which I also sobbed over, when I was 24!! Believe me I'm not so soppy usually! What a shame, that person that rated this with one star because she didn't read the movie details which could have saved her getting upset about two 10 year old's crying over it, the DOG DIES!!! But........... I love all the little bits, Christopher Lee's Hammer Horror Dracula, obviously the ending had to be at the windmill, love the cat poo letters, just so much quirkiness & sentimentality all wrapped into one :oD Very happy I watched it, it was better than ParaNorman :ox",Frankenweenie
165,SaulAllerton,100% Burton Beauty,8,18 November 2012,"Frankenweenie follows the life of Victor Frankenstein, a typical Burton oddball living on the peripheries of life. He is socially awkward, seen as an outsider and his only companion is his dog Sparky. After a tragic accident Sparky gets hit by a car and killed. Victor, having a passion for science and coincidentally learning the power of electricity in school, manages to reanimate Sparky's corpse leading to the age old: 'you're alive!'. This discovery results in his classmates wanting a piece of the action and to exploit the new discovery for themselves. As expected this leads to disastrous consequences. From then on we face all the messages seen in the original Frankenstein and for that matter any creation/resurrection film. Do we have the right to play God? Why are we so afraid of scientific advances? The main problem faced for the film is who it is actually aimed at. Clearly the PG rating implies it is for children. This is further backed up by what seems to be the mandatory 'pop out of the screen' cheesy 3D effects the certificate warrants. However it is choc-a-bloc full of references to classic horror movies of all kinds that would be far beyond the children's knowledge, and for that matter quite possibly would be beyond the average teenagers' awareness. On the other hand the main audience is almost Burton himself, since the film is a recreation of his 1984 short of the same name. It is a passion project. Victor is pretty much Burton, he makes Super 8 films, is seen as the outsider, at one point his father says that 'He's in his own world' a quote that is never more fitting than when describing the director. However what it does best is focus on the aspects that everyone will enjoy. Regardless of whether you understand the hint to Creature from the Black Lagoon and Bride of Frankenstein or not it won't matter, there is enough to entertain as it is. The animation is immaculate; each frame looks like it has been created with care and precision and deserves the recognition it will likely get. The only problem being that in using clay figures you lose all the subtleties of emotion, only so much can be shown through the eyes. The action sequences are fun and exciting to keep younger audience members gripped and the laughs are plentiful and universal enough for everyone to love. Overall (as cliché as it is) it's a film the whole family can enjoy. 3D is a relatively dreaded term to put to a film nowadays; it's the new thing that everyone loves to hate, but alas do not fear. Animation is a much better medium for perfecting the 3rd dimension and as a result works with merit in this case rather than filling it with the array of problems that can often arise. As a Tim Burton film there is worry that you have seen this all before, especially one with such obvious links to already well-established films, but this isn't the case. Even with such a morbid premise, Burton handles it with such care that the dark aspects are only used to enhance the sweet and beautiful side of the film.",Frankenweenie
166,Aniron_Stratosphere,Good old Tim Burton,9,29 December 2012,"Tim Burton goes back to his roots with this dark animated film filled with classical horror elements, yet full of heart, enjoyable characters and childhood innocence.Still, I think that this is not a movie for children, not because it is scary in any way, but due to the fact that the director pays homage to many old horror/science fiction movies of past decades (the list is impressive), so adults will certainly enjoy and appreciate it more, especially those who ever had to deal with the stress of losing a beloved pet.Tim Burton not only made me laugh and cry with this heartwarming movie after a long run of impressive yet emotionally empty movies, but also reminded me that the child inside me is still there.",Frankenweenie
167,cthulhulurks,"bad script, somewhat lacking design, not much originality",6,6 February 2013,"The beginning of the film was quite entertaining, especially the resurrection scene. It was all quite promising till the point where the kids decide to steal Victor's technology, disappointingly followed by an impressive pile of clichés. Would this be an example of lazy writing? The visual design was somewhat lacking too. The best elements are the resurrection, the design of Sparky, Mr. Whiskas and his SHITTY PROFECIES. BRUTON (sic!) of course could have done much better. One of the problems is that Bruton tries to cater to kids of any age filming material that clashes with any form of puritan upbringing. 6/10 because it's a 3D film, otherwise its a strong 4/10.",Frankenweenie

I thought Alice in Wonderland was awful and was bored all the way through Dark Shadows. I really thought he had lost it but was so happy to sit through Frankenweenie last night and wish it could have started straight away so i could watch it again.The characters were simply fantastic. Weird Girl and Mr Whiskers (they better bring out some toys of him) will stick with me for ages. The nods to all the old horror films, and the links with other Buton works were so cleverly done. There were little pops at other brands and other monster movies. Perfectly executed and timed.This film earned a well deserved 10/10 and i will be rushing to the shop to buy my copy once its released. Bravo!",Frankenweenie
169,Light83,A Look inside Tim Burtons Mind,7,21 December 2012,"If ""Tim Burton"" were an adjective, it would be the perfect word to describe this movie. Frankenweenie is the most Tim-Burton movie I ever saw.It's like every stylistic decision Burton ever made collected in one single movie. I won't go into details, plot and characters can be found in Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, Corpse Bride, etc.If you ever recognized a Burton movie within seconds just because of the visuals or the sound, you will enjoy this. It's like a journey into the mans mind. It is the clearest way I ever saw an artist express himself and his ideas on film. Of course the movie has it's flaws. That what makes it (and in extension, the director) human.",Frankenweenie
170,MegaMaverick,A cop out ending to an otherwise great film,8,11 November 2012,"Although not a big fan, I like the majority of Tim Burton's work. His talent to create these imaginative, fairy tale worlds is amazing. Edward Scissorhands being in particular, in my opinion, his best work and one of my all-time favourite movies. There's no denying the man has got a gift. The story starts with a boy named Victor, a relatively normal kid with a normal family. However he doesn't have much friends and spends most of his time with beloved dog, Sparky. One day Sparky gets hit by a car while trying to fetch a baseball. Victor tries and succeeds to bring him back alive. But with everything in life - there's consequences. So what did I think of Frakenweenie? I thought it was very good. One of Burtons best in years, in fact. Very enjoyable (to both the adults and kids). The movie provided plenty of laughs, tears, excitement, scares and surprises. The atmosphere and style was pure old school Tim Burton, and it was great (Much like most of Tim Burton's work) It was near perfect and I was prepared to give it a 10/10... Until the ending. ***** HEAVY SPOILERS*****The movie should of ended when Sparky died in the windmill. And I'm not saying that because I like miserable dark, depressing endings. I'm saying it because the movie had a great message in it that most kids would benefit from knowing. Most of us lost loved ones in our life, whether it's your family, friends, pets and anyone else. I have. I'd loved nothing but to bring them back. But I can't. So I have to move on with my life. What's the message in this movie for kids? ""DONT WORRY! IF SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU DIES, YOU CAN BRING THEM ALIVE!"" No that's rubbish. And what's even worse about the ending is that they symbolised several times throughout the movie that Sparky shouldn't be alive (Parts of his body falling off, him sleeping by his grave etc.). So overall; A great movie for the kids and the adults that is very much worth watching. If you're a fan of Tim Burton... You will love it. If you're a fan of Disney... It will be different from what you're used to but still will like it. However, It would of been A lot better without the typical crowd pleasing/manipulative/Steven Spielberg BS ending where everything is resolved in a nice pretty bow and handed to you on a golden plate. 8/10",Frankenweenie
171,d0wen,Tim Burton at his best again - more animation please!,8,23 October 2012,"I have just got back from watching this film with my oldest daughter (12yrs old). I would recommend this film to anybody but I do feel that it will be mostly enjoyed by kids over the age of 8 possibly even over 10. I reckon it's too dark for younger kids.It is a very typical Tim Burton animation, although I do wish he would do more more animations! They are so easy to watch and my kids love them so it's great for us all. I do think some of his 'films' are too weird but I have enjoyed every animation he has done. Frankenweenie as you can imagine is a play on the old Frankenstien movies but it has a great feel to it. I am a horror fan and there aren't many good horrors these days (if any?). The good thing about Tim Burton's films like Frankenweenie, is that they blend horror into fun without the cheese that you get with most horror flicks. Tim Burton gets the eerie atmosphere and the scenery bang on with the animation. I really like the homage to the old films he uses too.",Frankenweenie
172,Wesyeed,Return of the original Tim Burton,10,10 October 2012,"Just as a lightning bolt strikes a deceased dog, bringing him back to life in this film, the old genius of Tim Burton has been resurrected after years of mediocre half assed studio garbage. This is in my eyes a passion project which recaptures a lost art in cinema these days, the art of intelligent meaningful storytelling in a very simplistic setting, ala ET, Home Alone, Goonies, Toy Story, and Burton's own Edward Scissor Hands.Kids today are so ADHD because of the cluttered video game messes they call films these days that of course releasing a throwback like this is going to flop right out of the gate. Which is a darn shame...Well I came from an age thankfully when one had no internet, no cellphone, read books to pass the time, sat through commercials because I didn't want to miss a minute of my favorite show. Were all these things tedious and boring? Yes, but they teach you to appreciate the finer things in life and have patience and have an imagination. All things that make great films great in my mind.I believe and hope that one day this will be considered a classic Disney film and join the ranks of its best. I'm starting to think it's better than Nightmare before Christmas honestly. Just because it has so much heart. And that's what's missing these days in movies HEART. Thank you for bringing it back Tim Burton. Don't lose that passion again. Keep making great classic cinema please!",Frankenweenie

It is a very alternative Halloween movie and is not exactly what I think of when I think of Tim Burton, but it is very creative and imaginative. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it is certainly not a classic either. Frankenweenie is worth a watch, but probably only one watch. It is well constructed, but very alternative.",Frankenweenie

I wore it out and was excited to see on the Nightmare Before Christmas DVD a few years ago. The new additional character and references to the original short and other horror films were great. Tim Burton has outdone himself once again. Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara are great in their triple threat of voices, many you can't even recognize as them. Classic actor Martin Landua channeled Vincent Price amazingly as well to play the teacher. I forgot many times that I was watching an animated film because I was having so much fun! I'm excited for what Tim Burton has up his sleeve for the Addam's Family and other projects in the future!!! High recommended. ENJOY!!!",Frankenweenie
175,papaliberis,Colorful As A Rainbow,8,23 November 2012,"Considering his expertise in stop motion technique (Nightmare before Christmas and Corpse Bride stand out as perfect examples in this field) Tim Burton could not easily disappoint in this level. And he doesn't.Yes, the 3D isn't remarkable and the retro black and white palette, might discourage the kids. But Frankenweenie wasn't made to be an eye-catching animated movie in the first place. It was destined to speak to our hearts. To our love of the departed. To the acceptance of the different. To the belief that anybody deserves a chance in this world. Burton toys once again with his movie obsessions, and delivers one of his best works in ages. He knows exactly which buttons he must push to activate humour, thrill and horror in one scene. My only complaint is, that he overplays on his references too much. That makes his movie a little predictable. Fortunately, his magic touch isn't influenced so much here, by his easy-to-misunderstand mainstream tendency.",Frankenweenie

I don't understand why a movie should be entirely B&W in this millennium. And stop animation makes the movie worse! Second impression: The movie has one of the most unscientific and illogical plot I've ever seen. Although the entire story revolves around a science project, it has little to do with science! Again the movie contains little, if any, humor which is in no way acceptable for an animated movie.Third impression: The movie has almost no twist. A very monotonous and boring one with everything way too much predictable.Final impression: The movie has disappointed me very much. I won't recommend anyone to watch this movie.

177,antomasov,Devastating to watch if your dog passed away,8,14 January 2013,"Frankenweenie is a movie that features Tim Burton's style of characters, black and white colored, superbly directed and visually stunning at the right scenes. And it is made by puppets animated by stop motion technique and not by computer animation. This makes the realistic movements of characters impressive. Especially the movements of one of story protagonists, the dog Sparky. The dog moves and behaves just like a real dog of his size would. I would know because I had the almost exact same dog, small in size, a bit fat, but playful and intelligent. I lost my dog last year and watching this movie was almost a traumatic experience. Because in the movie the dog moves so realistically, even though it is a puppet, and his bond with the boy named Victor is heartfelt. But this is what artists do, they give life to lifeless objects and if they make you feel for their creation they are doing a fine job. Tim Burton is an artist. Not even 15 minutes into the movie the dog dies in the most heartbreaking way possible. I tried not to cry, but he resembled my own dog so much, right down to the mannerisms. I found a stream of tears start to flow down my left cheek and was properly embarrassed for myself, but there was no helping it. The way the dog dies would break anyone's heart. Because Tim Burton decided to play with the emotion in a cruel way. A boy Victor hits his first homerun playing baseball, he hits the ball with his bat and the ball flies out of the field. He is a hero at that point and feels good. But the dog flies off the chain and tries to catch the ball running across the street. He then succeeds to catch the ball and starts walking back proudly only to be hit by a car. This is such a cruel way to kill a dog, because it happens on the best day of Victor's life (hits a homerun) yet he is also responsible that his dog went after the ball and even the dog manages to get his paws on the ball and achieves his happiness before he is hit. So from that moment of happiness a steep descend into sadness and loss. Of course the boy manages to revive his dog, in a comical frankenstein fashion. But the movie will have many such moments of tossing you up and throwing you down. Expect to cry if you love dogs or if your own one passed away.",Frankenweenie
178,donnabarr01,Don't Show To Girls,1,8 January 2014,"Black and white; interesting. Story cute. Martin Landau's pro-science speech before the fearful, ignorant parents? Much needed, today, and snarkily delightful. Which makes one expect great things with all the characters.But what a disappointment. Burton might have re-assembled part of the Beatlejuice cast, but nobody's got his or her head on straight. The one thing they do seem to have is a Tardis to the 1950's - a pink one, that puts all those annoying females, including Winona Ryder, smack back in their proper places.Don't show this to girls. Only the boys have any action alloted to them, or at least in a way they can get away with. One girl is beyond useless, and needs to be rescued - AGAIN - and the other girl, daring to experiment like the boys, doesn't get her pet back, and is ultimately ignored. And her pet? Unlike the boys' dead pet, it's a live pet. A helpful pet, who brings her a bat. Its fate? To be stabbed through with a burning windmill beam and burnt up. Her grief trying to deal with it? Well, evidently when the pet died, she evaporated, because we never see her again. We ran through the credits, figuring we'd been set up for a cute after-credit moment with the girl and her revived, if bedraggled, cat. Something snarky and funny and scary and poignant.Nothing. Black screen.Evidently, girls who don't just obey uncle and stand on the stage and sing, who dare to experiment like the boys, get punished and vanish. Come to think of it, don't show this to boys, either.",Frankenweenie

Maybe other people didn't bother this but I would, about those science project and all detail things. And I need the other character is dig deeper more and show the personality, some character has been well describe but the other was not.

181,rhisally,Enjoyable but don't expect perfection,7,18 October 2012,"NO SPOILERS I saw this film in 3D and it opens with a tacky add on telling you to put your glasses on. After that was over the film was tasteful with the 3d, on the odd occasion it was very impressive. However I say nothing (except for me a mild headache) was gained from seeing it in 3D so if you are unsure stick with 2D. The gray-scale used in the film was very impressive and I often found myself marveling over the visuals instead of the plot. The plot is pretty much in the trailer and wionna ryder's character seemed to be completely pointless. The film was an expanded version of the original short and if your a fan of the Tim Burton early years this film has a lot for you. However don't expect the quality of Beetlejuice or Nightmare. It had something lacking that made Tim Burton films so great, but it was as no means bad as Alice In Wounderland. BEST FEATURES- small detail and references to Frankenstien. WORST FEATURES - A very simplistic plot, with some underused characters. As an owner of a small white dog I cried twice. I think to get the full emotional impact you need to be a dog lover.

183,tpquinlee,"Tim Burton's funny, warm and Gothic return to greatness",9,19 October 2012,"Since Sweeney Todd, Tim Burton has shown a steady decline in quality. Alice In Wonderland was very soulless and lacked depth. Sure, the visuals were top-notch but the story was lacking and Johnny Depp, ironically, looked like he'd rather be someplace else. Dark Shadows was very lazy and poorly constructed, mixed with a very over-the-top performance from Johnny Depp. Burton faithful, like myself, grew worried that their hero had given up trying. Fortunately, Frankenweenie has him back in the saddle and unfortunately, facing competition from the lackluster and painfully uninteresting Hotel Transylvania. Whereas that tries to just be a mix of monsters and comedy just because, Tim goes to where his heart is: a loving story of a boy and his dog and the bond that keeps them so close, even after death. The black and white, like with Tim's Ed Wood, is perfectly beautiful and a visual marvel. It honours the original Frankenstein and more, like Kaiju films and other monster classics. The voice cast is top notch, especially from Martin Landau as the science teacher who gives Victor his idea. The story, quite unusually for a Tim Burton film, is very deep. Victor brings back Sparky out of love, because he wants his friend back and Sparky bounds for joy when he returns from the grave, like he never died. The other kids, on the other hand, want their pets back for selfish reasons. Their pets don't come back like Sparky, as pets bounding for joy but as monsters, especially one that's out of Gamera, that want to hurt them. The end result is a monster mash that any lover of movie monsters, especially me, would adore. While a bit uneven, Frankenweenie brings Tim Burton back from the dead with his a loving tribute to the bond between a boy and his pet, and to monster movies. Like with War Horse, it's up there as one of my favourite movies about that bond every pet owner feels and every pet owner understands.Thank you, Tim Burton - it's great to have you back.",Frankenweenie

Normaly a film would be shot with actors and they would just ordinarily move ,maybe for their hair and clothes etc. would but other then those directors wouldn't stop for minor things about apperences and set. That's where the difference of stop motion comes. In this type of films movie crew have to do set, characters by short everything by their own hands and it's pretty smal for human sizes.-Like action figures- They have to stop at every little movement of a being and change characters faces, bodies and set a little, very carefully!-Name ""stop motion"" comes from these process- It's something that wants extra effort and time. That's why I respect this type of movies but me being crazy about them is completely about their style.) science fiction movie which is directed by Tim Burton. It's a remake of Burton's same named short film from 1984. The 1984's short film was a parody of 1931's frankenstein. The film is in black and white like classic movies and it kinda brings spooky feelings to those who watches it.The plot is about a 11 year old boy named Victor Frankenstein who has a passion for science. From his early age he had always been together with his beloved dog Sparky. But because of a tragic car accident Victor's best friend slips away from his fingers.In a old school dogmatic town both an upcoming science fair and the idea of his best friend coming back to him gives him the inspiration to do something that hasn't been done before.(No spoilers please watch the movie :)Well certainly there are a lot of reasons why I love this movie. But let's be honest it's probably because of it being a stop motion film. There are a lot of stop motion movies and almost all of them have this spooky melancoholic sense to it. Then why do I like frenkenweenie better? I don't know exactly why but when I first watched it, it charmed me with everything it includes the pure but kind of twisted mind of Victor, his love for his pet who he sees as such a dear friend, him being a brilliant person among all those rude and negative people. Now thinking I most likely had a crush on him back then because even though I'm in love with all movies like this (stop motion, twisted theme but actually heart warming) maybe my most dear main character will always be him.",Frankenweenie

With such high expectations I had set for the film, I couldn't help but be afraid that I had built my hopes up too high and that I would be disappointed when I actually saw it. I was completely wrong and should have never underestimated the brilliance of Tim Burton's mind. Today I saw Frankenweenie and every aspect of this movie was perfect. The movie is in stop-motion animation which just happens to be my favorite kind of animation. There are so many references to the original story and it's in black and white which gives the film a spooky, macabre, classic feel. Each character's personality will crack you up, especially the duo of Weird Girl and Mr. Whiskers. The details of this film are absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it.

186,nattakiri,self-repetition or self-irony?,6,31 January 2013,"It rings a bell for all of us when someone mentions Tim Burton's universe. A bit dead-like, but very appealing characters, dark colors, trees with crooked hands. And more recently, all this combined with a disappointingly simple, tearjerker plot line and heart-warming endings. I think this is what happened here as well, from an amazing core idea something much less original came. Talking about originality, it is only a matter of perspective if you call the director's recent art ""self-repeating"", ""signature"" or ""self- ironic"". As for me, I would go for the last one; with Tim Burton we are dealing with someone overtly aware of the way his style is seen, and as such, he happily exploits viewers' expectations. This kind of reflexivity should be highly appreciated, and with me, yes, I am pretty happy with that. However, it still does not help much with the Disney part.Overall, it is a good 90-minute entertainment, with stunning visuals, just as always, definitely interesting, but I am afraid that although today I'll have semi-nightmares, I shall altogether forget the plot within a week.",Frankenweenie
187,chrisntimg,"It was decent, but nothing to rave about",7,6 October 2012,"No spoilers here - just an honest review. I'm not going to write a novel on the evolution of Tim Burton as others have. The movie is, after all, what is being reviewed here. In my opinion it's a ""just scary enough"" movie for kids for this Halloween season. My grandsons (ages 5 & 7)seemed to enjoy it, as did I. It has a little bit of everything - sad, happy, scary, funny moments. It doesn't focus too much on the ""darkness"" of the subject at hand before moving on to lighter moments, which kept the kids from either bawling their eyes out or hiding under my arm, and for that I am thankful. I gave it 7 out of 10 - it was a good movie to take the kids to to kill an afternoon, but it wasn't one of the best movies I've ever seen, so it doesn't warrant a higher rating in my opinion.",Frankenweenie
188,nhtapu,Absolutely rubbish,1,26 December 2012,"Not only that it's a stop-motion film and suffers from bad animation terribly, but also the 'overdoing' of horror environment like the tiny irises of the characters is disturbing. The plot has serious hole with no comedy at all. If thunder strike can revive dead,the science teacher (the one replaced by Mr. Rzykrusky) stricken by the thunder would have immediately revived just at the next moment he becomes dead due to thunder-strike. Just a crap theme and lame too. Clearly Tim Burton didn't do any brainstorming. And the animation quality is horrible, even for a stop motion film. The black and white is eyesore. Tim Burton would be lucky if he can just get back his money from this piece of trash he made.",Frankenweenie
189,nsv-shvm,Not so good and not so bad.,6,19 January 2013,"Frankenweenie is a weird movie and really is a disappointment to animated films. Some scenes of the movie are very good but most part of it just a waste. This movie could have been better if directed by Gore Verbinski or not-Tim Burton. From starting to end movie was just nothing but not also full waste of time. It's animation is also horrible, in times like these even video games has better visuals than this movie. Nothing is extraordinary about this movie and nothing is too bad about this movie but I expected something better from Tim Burton, not this crap. I just wish that movie do not get any sequel or any prequel. It looks something similar to the movie Paranorman, while not comparing to Paranorman movie is not too good as I expected it should be.",Frankenweenie
190,jakeu-imdb,"Not impressed, some issues for younger viewers",5,3 October 2012,"Overall, an okay movie. Kind of meant for kids, not a lot for the adults that go with them. This movie will not be added to my collection nor will I recommend it to others.Granted, Tim Burton films have a good deal in common (music sounds the same, same look/feel, etc.), but you could almost make a drinking game finding the direct ports from his other films. Most noticeably, Corpse Bride.Spoilers/scenes kids might have issues with: -there is a catbird that gets impaled on camera (no blood) -a large rat creature ""boo"" scare that was a little much -the main character sewing his dead dog back together, off screen, but you see main character, needle and thread. (may or may not be an issue) -death scene kids cried at when I was at the screening -Death, reanimation, death, reanimation again (may or may not be an issue) End spoilersAdults & Teens okay, preteens, it will depend on the parents. There are little ones in the family that I will not take them to see it nor rent it for them to watch.",Frankenweenie
191,anon94064,Burton what were you thinking?,1,3 October 2012,"The entire movie is a stop motion film. Each frame was filmed in a very well done black and white style. Great picture - although the animation had serious defects. They dropped the number of key frames enough for the viewer to see non-fluid movement .. skips and twitches. I thought it may be the style, but its not consistent throughout the film so I'll chalk it up as a fail in the animation department.The movie starts out with a child showing his parents a stop motion film he made. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but Burton was telling the audience exactly what they are going to be watching - a poorly animated stop motion movie that has absolutely no story but is nonetheless cute and heartwarming to watch.The story failed due to an incoherent story structure. A number of arcs are started, not developed, and left hanging. The main sequence in the film has no place in it and was essentially just done to showcase the special effects. The movie finishes with the majestic music sequence symbolizing a great finish, but you are left scratching your head and wondering what the point was.Burton actually filmed cat feces. Yes: Defecate on a plate, complete with bits of hair. And how could Burton actually go beyond that? He animated it. Wow. Just wow.I brought my three boys with me to watch the movie. I kind of regret doing it. The movie had the tones of a classic horror movie. You can call it Burton art - but I wouldn't show my young kids the original Frankenstein so why would I show this?I'm glad it was a screening I was watching - because I hate having to ask for my money back.",Frankenweenie
192,lholderwebb,Pure Theatrical Genius,10,6 October 2012,"I laughed, I cried. Sometimes both at once. The film is brilliant when ALL it is is a bang-up homage to the original Frankenstein franchise, including a marvelous nod to the ""Bride Of"". When it begins to morph in that brilliantly wacky Tim Burton manner - as we find ourselves not with one single Mad Scientific Genius, but six or seven of them, each of them pre-teens - it ascends to the level of genius. I can't think when I've ever laughed that hard in a movie. Burton managed to string together a juggernaut of Classic Film Clichés, and to take each one of them and twist it slightly so that it is fresh and different, yet still somehow recognizable, and he does so in a way that enlists a full range of emotions. He doesn't stop with horror genre clichés, either, throwing a delightful salting of ""Lassie"" genre cliché and Crusty Old Folk With Hearts of Gold...and a happy ending (that's the spoiler).I don't know how this film would come off for kids, but for adults with a solid grounding in the theatrical tradition of western cinema, it's an absolutely splendid offering.",Frankenweenie
193,jakes5103,Saddest and most disturbing movie ever!,2,9 October 2012,"I think that we can safely say Tim Burton is mentally disturbed. When Sparky got hit, all kinds of bad memories came flooding back to me. 2 of my favorite cats were hit and killed by cars. Not something I want to be reminded of during a movie! Not to mention that re-animating a corpse is wrong. And to do it twice! Ha! Victor must be a necromancer or something! Although, I have to admit, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Alice in Wonderland weren't half bad. If you have had pets who have been killed or injured by cars, or don't like seeing dead animals brought back to life, this movie is NOT for you!",Frankenweenie
194,info-502-442201,The entire movie was a misfire,1,14 October 2012,"Apparently this movie was developed out of a short that Burton made some time ago. Should have stayed a short. Unfunny, manipulative, definitely Disney hands on the story and ending, the entire thing was a huge mistake - which is why it is doing so badly at the box office. It is supposed to be a comedy, but there is little to laugh at. The lack of character development is astounding. The main character, the dog Sparky, has no character development, so the entire movie suffers. It moves in fits and starts, and is alternately boring and insensitive and cruel. The kid goes now where, and the pseudo science is inconsistent. Very manipulative in terms of action and structure. What a waste of time.",Frankenweenie
195,peterpunch2000,The most disturbing animation ever!,4,17 October 2012,"Frankenweenie is without a doubt the most disturbing kids film of all time. Starting with a boy named Victor's dog (best friend)Sparky is run over by a car, which I blame on his dad, because he is the one who makes Victor go to the baseball game (where Sparky dies). After you see him depressed for about 20 minutes, he discovers in class he can bring his dog back to life by lightning (creepy much?). He digs up his dead dog and continues with the plan. After helping a boy from class do the same with his dead fish, everyone tries to copy and it results in a massive traumatic explosion of monsters. Near the end the dog dies after being trapped in a fire (because of the monster) he is brought back to life once again and the film ends. Writing this review makes me so FREAKED OUT it's unreal! Overall the film is a creepy, freaky and disturbing animation. One thing DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS!",Frankenweenie

It left 75% of the children in tears and very scared.At bedtime my daughter came downstairs in floods of tears as it had affected her so much - in the end she had to sleep in the same bed as her mother and still she woke in the night in tears. We have no idea how tonight will go but we expect more of the same.My daughter is no wall flower and very much enjoys Marvel and X-Men films with no problem. Seriously think about the effect this may have before taking your children to see this film.Not sure what the classification people were doing with this, yes I understand that it is halloween but to leave several children so traumatised cannot be right.",Frankenweenie
197,blakecardoza11,Frankenstein versus Frankenweenie,10,9 November 2012,"I loved Frankenweenie. It had the best animation. The actor Charlie Tahan did a great voice of Victor Frankenstein. The movie was a great relationship of Frankenstein. Additionally, it was a good movie with great animation and the movie turned out great. Tim Burton did a great job directing the movie. The writers, Leonard Ripps,Tim Burton, and John August, did a great job writing the movie so it could be great. The movie was the best and it didn't needed anything added to it.Another example that Frankenweenie was so good is the actors' voices were great. Charlie Tahan, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Sharp, and Dee Bradley Baker did great jobs. All of the actors, but Charlie Tahan did the best with all their characters. All of the actor all did great parts.However, the movie Frankenweenie was a little boring. The name sounded unusual and it had an adequate story line. The movie seamed awesome; however, it was a little boring at the middle of the movie. The movie should have been in color also.Moreover, the movie was a my best animated movie. The quote, 'When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you. They move into a special place in your heart; was very touching to me. The movie had a great relationship with Frankenstein.Why was the movie on when Victor loses his dog and brings him back to life? Why not when he loses his friend and brings his friend back to life? The movie would be a lot better then losing a dog. Otherwise, the movie as great.",Frankenweenie

Horrible movie and will not watch another Tim Burton ""creation"". Thanks Tim.. Happy film making. Any disclaimer to parents describing the darkness and unexpectedness of this film would have been great. i would have Known to not to bring it home to show two ten year olds. Here's my disclaimer. Do not see this movie!",Frankenweenie
199,moviecritzhd,"Oddly common story, Tim lost his touch.",5,8 February 2013,"Making the animation different in a common story was not at all beneficial but instead it became dull and boring. From the title itself it is already predictable and Tim was stuck with the same common story rather than exploring it. Contrary to the story of giving life, the film looks dead in a grave. The idea of making a new animation film in an old black & white format was a good one but not for this this kind of story. I would rather see Nightmare Before Christmas in full black and white because of its complex and different storyline. Great animation comes from great imagination. Tim Burton was indeed among those greats but not in this film of copydog or copycat or copy frankie!",Frankenweenie
200,jessiejb29,Black and white can be great,9,22 February 2013,"Okay this is not your usual Disney film. There is still the themes of love and good old family values but there is also some darkness to this film. Children will love the relationship between main character Victor and his dog. Parents will love the constant references to old horror films.The actual film production is amazing. The back and white theme adds to the darkness of the piece and is actually a very unique viewing experience. Production designer Rick Heinrichs said (in this interview http://greatbritishmag.co.uk/lifestyle/coffee-break/the-masterminds- behind-frankenweenie ) using animation unlocked the potential of the film, which was previously a live-action short from the 80s. I agree with him on this as working with a live dog would have been difficult for this film.Definitely worth a trip to the DVD store for this one!",Frankenweenie
201,cbarnhart22,Dark Twist,6,20 March 2013,Frankenweenie is a Disney children's movie that has a dark twist. The main characters that the movie revolves around are Victor played by Charlie Tahon and his dog Sparky played by Frank Welker. Victor attends a local school where it shows him in his science class taught by Mr. Rzyeruski played by Martin Landau. There are other students in his class that have pets of their own. Each of the children's pets seems to have similar characteristics of the child. Elsa Van Helsing played by Winona Ryder and her dog Persephone played by Dee Bradley Baker have dark black hair that is tall and puffy. Victor and his dog sparky both are energetic and playful. The weird girl played by Catherine O'Hara and her cat Mr. Whiskers played by Dee Bradley Baker have large white eyes and are both pale white. The similar characteristics between the children and theirs pets show the closeness and the love that the children have for their pets. The unique characteristics are similar to the characters in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The theme of the movie is about a young boy Victor who brings his dog sparky back to life but doesn't realize what the negative effects a science experiment can have. Victor's dog Sparky died unexpectedly when he ran in the road to get a ball and was hit by a car. Victor was upset by the loss of his dog and would do anything to bring him back. When victor was in science class his teacher conducted an experiment using electricity. The teacher used a dead frog to show how electricity could pulsate the muscles. Victor ran home from school the build and experiment using small kitchen appliances any anything else he was able to grab. Victor waited until the evening when it started to rain and lighting started to strike. He then placed sparky on lift he built and lifted him in the sky through a window in the attic. The lighting struck and his contraption started to work and the lighting struck sparky and brought him back to life. Victor tries to keep his experiment of bringing Sparky back to life a secret but that doesn't last for long. Edgar E Gore spotted Sparky and he could not keep a secret. Edgar convinced Victor that he wouldn't tell anybody about Sparky if he told him how he brought him back to life. Victor showed Edgar how he did it with a dead fish. When Victor conducted the experiment the results were an invisible fish that was mean. Edgar thought this was really cool and had to show everyone. The other students in their class found out about this and wanted to do same thing so they could win the Science fair. The outcome was not what the children were expecting. The animals were brought back to life and they were mean and scary.,Frankenweenie
202,amslack1,"A cute story about a boy, his dog, love and loss.",7,25 March 2013,"FRANKENWEENIE (2012) is an animated movie about a boy, Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan –voice), and his dog, Sparky, which is also his best friend. Using science to remedy his heartbreaking loss, Victor reanimates his dog, setting off a chain of consequences that get out of hand for his quiet little town. It is then up to Victor and Sparky to stop the ensuing chaos. This film also stars, Winona Ryder as the voice of Elsa Van Helsing, and Martin Short as the voice of Mr. Frankenstein.Through Tim Burton's focus on emotion, the theme of the film is found within the stages of love and loss. The emotional stages involve love/happiness, deep sadness, and also acceptance. As the viewer, we go through these emotions with Victor: as he plays with Sparky on a daily basis; as he witnesses the premature death of his pet and best friend; as he decides to bring Sparky back to life; and finally, as he must come to accept his pet's true fate. It is through this acceptance that the viewer can still feel as though the movie has an overall happy tone, even with the recurring sadness of the loss of a friend/loved one. The emotions portrayed are real and very relatable to child or adult.Tim Burton has made several movies that deal with emotion, even some sort of loss, such as a dream, like in The Nightmare Before Christmas, when Jack Skellington wants to do something different, like be Santa Claus, but fails miserably. Through the use of appropriate music and sound effects, these films draw the viewer into the movie and keep the adventures interesting. An example is the use of the storm sounds and laboratory sounds when Victor is attempting to reanimate Sparky in his attic. Those sounds make the scene feel real and contribute to a feeling of hope for the experiment to work. Then the close-up of Sparky's tale combined with a moment of silence gives way to the feeling of disappointment, and a bit of sadness. The use of black and white during this and a few other scenes helps to guide the viewer's attention to what is happening, rather than to all the clutter in the attic or the gadgets being used by Victor for the experiment. This attention to the action more facilitates the emotional impact of what is happening; making it a good choice, whether or not it was meant to do just that. Using the innocence of childhood woes, in the proper story line is a brilliant way to present an emotional story that will touch the heart of people from all age groups. This was accomplished very well by Tim Burton through the use of a pet in FRANKENWEENIE.",Frankenweenie
203,annsla,Tim Burton has come back from the dead,9,3 October 2012,"There was a time when Tim Burton was systematically churning out great, original, quirky movies that endeared him to the general public and earned him a large amount of die-hard followers who hung on to every last idiosyncratic trademark. These followers have had a particularly hard time these last few years, ever since Tim Burton started to spoil. True, he was still using all of the unique little devices that made us love him, but his heart was not in the movies, and they all turned out commercialized and soulless, the cool ""Tim Burton-ambiance"" mocking us by hinting at how good he used to be.I'm glad to say now that has all changed.""Frankenweenie"" starts by showing the audience the ordinary life of an extraordinary kid called Victor, a young boy with no friends, but a burning passion for his specialist subjects (horror movies, film making and science), a childhood that will surely resonate with both Tim Burton and the majority of his fans. Then, to the surprise of no-one who has seen the poster for the movie or heard the title, his beloved dog dies, and Victor conducts an experiment to bring him back to life, á la Frankenstein. From that moment, everything gets deliciously out of hand and grows into a classic ""there is an imminent problem at hand that we need someone to deal with before this all goes down the toilet""-movie that we all love.While the movie does not really develop its characters deeply and sometimes drops certain plot lines we would have liked to see more of, it makes up for it tenfold with the thing that Tim Burton has more of than anybody else: imagination. So many moments in this movie are truly original, clever and, best of all, funny. ""Frankenweenie"" is a giant tribute to old horror flicks, set against a sweet story of a kid and his dog. It will find its way into the great list of ""Must see childhood movies"" and will remain there for the ages, much like his previous hits ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". I'm giving it a very high rating, not just because it is a great movie, but because it is proof of that Tim Burton still has great things inside of him, that might well be brought back to life one dark and stormy night.",Frankenweenie
204,crazygnome_13,"Perhaps, the worst animation I have ever seen!",3,14 October 2012,"I have not watched the original Frankenweenie but I doubt it could have been more boring than this one, at least not at its own time! Character personalities are so lame, particularly Vitcor's. There is almost no ups and downs in the story. There were few moments of laughter in the theatre but so few to label the picture a comedy! Moreover, the 3D adds nothing, absolutely nothing, to this picture. It was as if the technology has been imposed painfully to the animation after production, rather than being thought of and integrated to it from the beginning of the production project. One of few pros about Frankenweenie, however, is the ""graphic"" design of the characters. They are hilarious, particularly Edgar!",Frankenweenie
205,tuuli-reinsoo,A film for my heart,10,10 December 2013,"I could have written a review sooner. But it is now that I wish to say a few things. 1. to everyone who complains about a lack of logic: you obviously don't realize that with animation, especially stop-motion, you can even be totally metaphoric and logic has no place in it, other than how to switch on the camera. have you seen Estonian stop motion? Makes. no. Sense. and does life make sense? does it? Nope. yet Frankenweenie rings so true about all the things we have lost. that regret, wishing to bring them back, always remembering them. 2. what Tim does with stop-motion is a miracle. 3. I actually don't have anything very reasonable to say, just that this film went straight into my heart next to Edward Scissorhands. I haven't been so emotionally invested for a long time. I am so glad there is a person like Tim who still does real films. yes, he has experimented with that incomprehensible motion capture too, but stop-motion has this tangible quality, that makes you actually feel the touch of a filmmakers hand. you can see what he actually does. I am so glad he has the patience and will to do this. he is an artisan! a deep bow to him and his team.",Frankenweenie

This cartoon movie is in Black and White like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" its in the same story line as ""Frankenstein"" but with a dog. I love that this is a Disney movie. I didn't see it in 3D, because 3D makes me dizzy. I hate that all the Cartoon movies and some live action movies are going 3D. But anyway if you like Tim Burton then go see this movie!!!
