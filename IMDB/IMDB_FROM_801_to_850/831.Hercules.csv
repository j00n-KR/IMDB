0,MartinHafer,"It all depends on your perspective,...",6,10 June 2007,"Whether or not you like this movie really depends on your perspective. For the casual viewer, it's an entertaining film, though few would place it among Disney's best. For obsessive history teachers like myself, the film is so problematic that enjoying the film is next to impossible, as the film bears very little similarity to the Hercules myths. In fact, when the film debuted, I remember hearing about protests in Greece because many felt that Disney's ""fast and loose"" attitude towards the source material was cultural offensive. I can understand and appreciate this, though frankly, sometimes I wish I weren't as well-versed with history and could just turn off my brain and enjoy the film from a completely mindless perspective. Sorry, but if historical accuracy means anything stay away,...but at least the films are better than the Steve Reeves films or the god-awful Trans-lux cartoons of the 1960s!",Hercules
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Enjoyable, but not Disney's best!",7,26 February 2009,"First of all, there are a lot of things I like about this movie. The animation, in general, is very nice to look at, and Charlton Heston's narration is very satisfying. And it is one of the funnier Disney movies with a witty and funny script. More pluses are a genius turn from Danny DeVito as the hilarious Phil, and a wonderfully sleazy James Woods as the hot-headed villain Hades( a great villain, might I add?)Rip Torn also has fun as Zeus, especially when his statue came to life. The incidental music is lovely as well. However, there are a few negatives. Hercules himself, both child and adult, is a little bland, but Meg manages to establish herself as one of the best female Disney characters. Also, there isn't much of a story. The prove-you're- a-hero formula was a little unoriginal for me. The biggest minus was the rather dull songs by Alan Menken. The songs, especially ""Zero to Hero"" were a real disappointment, as Menken had so much better work before this, namely Beauty and the Beast. However, Michael Bolton's rendition of Go the Distance(the only song I had no problem with)was a joy to behold, as was ""I won't say I'm in love"". It wasn't a good idea turning gospel, should've stayed with the classical. However, despite the flaws, I did enjoy Hercules, which is a 7/10. Bethany Cox",Hercules
2,SnoopyStyle,second tier Disney,6,2 September 2018,"After imprisoning the Titans, Zeus and Hera have their son Hercules. Zeus' brother Hades in the underworld plans to overthrow Zeus by freeing the Titans. However, he must stop Hercules before growing up and his fate to stop the release. He sends his evil minions Pain and Panic to steal baby Hercules and feed him a potion to make him mortal. The baby fails to drink every last drop and he's adopted by a kindly farmer couple. Hercules grows up to be a bumbling part-mortal trying to control his powers. After yet another accident, he is banished from his home. Along the way, he is befriended by Pegasus sent by Zeus and recruits trainer Phil. He is joined by femme fatale Meg who had actually sold her soul to Hades. With Pain and Panic, she sets Hercules to Hades' impossible labors.This is second tier Disney animation. It is really a referential cartoon at heart. It tries very hard to be irreverent. I'm not sure about making young Hercules a bumbling teen. Setting him young does detract from any chemistry with Meg. He's a child while she's all woman. The movie mixes the origins of Superman with the classic Greek. Seeing how Superman steals from Hercules, it's par for the course. The only truly great character is Hades. He is deliciously evil. The songs are relatively forgettable. Despite being second tier, it is still very much Disney and has an overall competence.",Hercules
3,Hitchcoc,Watered Down Hercules,7,29 December 2016,"I was a little disappointed that Disney studios didn't look a little more closely at the Greek myth of Hercules. I know it's for kids, but there was so much that could have been added to the legend. He had the 12 labors, you know. Instead, it gets down to having a battle with Hades. Once again we have a terrifying villain (most are interchangeable) who actually serves a real purpose in the underworld. The confrontations are well done. As usual, the animation is spot on, but the sophistication of the story just isn't there. It ends up big lunk versus bad guy. We've seen it all a hundred times. Actually just about every movie, including those Sword and Sandal things in the sixties have the same basic plot. They used to give jobs to big time weight lifters.",Hercules
4,lee_eisenberg,get him to the Greek,5,3 October 2017,"I should admit that I've never read the original Greek myth. It was obvious that Disney was going to take more than a few liberties with their adaptation. What I liked more than anything were the pop culture references (i.e., Midnight Cowboy). I guess that like a lot of Disney's movies from the past 20 to 25 years, ""Hercules"" is all about giving the tykes something to find cool while the adults can laugh at the pop culture references. Having the muses narrate the story like a gospel song gave it an interesting dimension, as did the depiction of Megara as a femme fatale. And you gotta love Danny DeVito's over-the-top performance as a manic Philoctetes.Anyway, it's not any sort of masterpiece, but enjoyable enough for its length. Among the other cast members are Paul Shaffer (David Letterman's bandleader), Frank Welker (Fred on ""Scooby Doo"" and Ray on ""The Real Ghostbusters""), Amanda Plummer (Honeybunch in ""Pulp Fiction"") and Charlton Heston (who else but the king of sword-and-sandal epics could give the opening narration?).",Hercules
5,jboothmillard,Hercules,6,7 September 2005,"The Greek legend has always been in popular culture, some call him Herecles, but he is commonly known as Hercules, strongest man ever to live (in fiction), so this Disney film brought him to life. Basically baby Hercules is born on Mount Olympus, and Hades: Lord of the Underworld (James Woods) has plans to take over, but can't with this new God in the works. So Hades' henchmen Pain (Police Academy's Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Matt Frewer) kidnap Hercules, and turn him mortal, apart from the last drop which means his God-like strength remains. Growing up, young Hercules (Josh Keaton) feels like an outcast unable to control his strength, so his foster father Amphitryon (Hal Holbrook) and mother Alcmene (Barbara Barrie) show him the symbol of the Gods they found on him. After going to the Temple of Zeus, and gaining the wings of horse Pegasus, his true father Zeus (Rip Torn) tells him to seek Philoctetes the satyr (Danny DeVito), the trainer of heroes. He trains him until grown up and Hercules (Tate Donovan) is ready to fight, and after he meets Meg (Susan Egan), and defeats the constantly head growing Hydra his dreams start coming true. Hercules has become the most famous person in Thebes, and Greece, from all his fights with Hades' monsters, but Zeus tells him he still hasn't proved himself a true hero. Hercules then gets his chance to spend time with Meg, and they are truly in love with each other, she even tells Hades, who owns her soul, that she won't help hurt him. Hades knows that Hercules' weakness is his love for Meg, so he blackmails him to give up his strength to let loose the feared Titans from their prison and take over Greece. But his powers come back when Meg is hurt, and he saves her soul from the Underworld, punches Hades into the sea of souls, and Hercules has proved himself worthy to be a God, but he decides he would rather stay on Earth with Meg. Also starring Samantha Eggar as Hera, Paul Shaffer as Hermes, Charlton Heston as the brief Narrator, Wayne Knight as Demetrius the Pot Maker. Woods is great as the sometimes sarcastic and cool acting villain, and DeVito is also great as the grouchy and easily annoyed trainer. The animation is as good as your going to get, the characters are all good, and the story is simple and fun, it is an easily enjoyable animated musical adventure. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for ""Go The Distance"". Good!",Hercules
6,moonspinner55,"Solid animated effort from Disney...nice attention to detail, though it falters at the end",6,8 June 2010,"Disney-animated take on the Greek demigod Hercules and his mythical adventures begins with a spirited gospel number (!) and rarely lets up from there. Amusing, beautifully-designed package with bright musical interludes is certain to engage kids and grown-ups. Terrific voice-over work from Tate Donovan, Danny De Vito, Charlton Heston, and James Woods (perfect as Hercules' nemesis Hades, Lord of the Underworld) is a big plus, however the climactic events of the story are frenetic and routine, leading to a dispiriting conclusion. Still, fairly smart and enjoyable, with a freewheeling pace and a good sense of humor. Lots of fun! **1/2 from ****",Hercules
7,studioAT,Disney goes Greek,6,8 July 2011,Hercules has never been considered one of Disney's best efforts but it is well worth adding to your collection as it is a fun and entertaining film that combines some basic Greek mythology with good story telling and the music of Alan Menken.The voice actors bring a particular spark to the film and this so often is what makes or breaks a Disney film. While Tate Donovan is bland as the lead Danny DeVito and James Woods more than make up for it.The songs are good and the plot is simple enough to be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.Overall Hercules is a strong addition to the Disney legacy.,Hercules
8,CinemaSerf,"""It's not about sinew, it's about what's in you...""",7,4 April 2020,"Undoubtedly one of the better 1990s Disney films. The story and animation are very much centre stage with the music much less important - no big power ballads!. It is a fun take on the Herculean mythology of ancient Greece. Hades is desperate to avenge himself on Zeus who tricked him into ruling the underworld after he and his brothers defeated the Titans; meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. So Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer ""Phil"" that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely. Don't expect to see any of his twelve labours...",Hercules
9,utgard14,"""So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals?""",5,14 January 2016,"Lackluster Disney movie that tells the story of Hercules. The whole thing lacks creativity, calculatedly following the Disney formula to the letter. We have stupid comic relief sidekicks, cheesy songs, a clichéd story, and lots of dumb in-jokes and references. It's moderately well-made for what it is but 'what it is' is the problem. I thought the voice work was fine and the animation not bad (but nothing terribly impressive). The songs are really lame, including the insufferably corny ""Go the Distance."" Of the films that came out during Disney's Renaissance period, this is one of the worst. Not a terrible watch when viewed in a bubble but, if you've seen even a few Disney animated films before, this will seem very tired and unoriginal. The worst part of it all is that, despite all the action and comedy, it's incredibly dull.",Hercules
10,Boba_Fett1138,"I love the action in ""Hercules""!",8,24 October 2004,"Although it's far from being the best Disney movie and perhaps maybe even the worst Disney of the nineties, I still love some of the elements in this movie. The action is one of them.What makes ""Hecules"" a 'not so great' Disney movie is the story. I don't know, the way it's told makes it flat and too simple. Also the movie lacks some great and fun characters. Only Hades is cool and a memorable villain, also because of course of James Woods, who excellently voiced him. Also the love story disappoints.The movie is filled with some nicely done action sequences which I truly loved. It makes ""Hercules"" a cool and enjoyable movie to watch.Don't expect an animated masterpiece but expect an enjoyable movie instead.

11,Calicodreamin,Zero to hero,8,28 September 2021,"A classic 90s animated film that withstands the test of time. The songs are catchy and the storyline is more than not based on real mythology. The animation is stunning and the voice actors absolutely nail their characters. ""Uh...
Guys, Olympus is that way""",Hercules
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Fun,7,18 March 2008,"This is the first Disney animated piece(save for that one segment of Fantasia... and yeah, they are pretty darn similar, in some ways) to be inspired by mythology, not fairy tale. As usual, liberties are taken, and history buffs may want to abstain from intake of liquids during their viewing, so as to prevent spit-takes. It is a fun film, however. Woods clearly has fun with the part, as confirmed by the Trivia page, and any moment his character is on-screen is enjoyable(which is not to say that the rest isn't). DeVito more or less plays himself, but his self ain't bad. Torn is marvelous. Goldthwait is not bad at all. The plot is good, as is the moral to the film. The pacing is great. The visual style is fitting, characters reminiscing the depictions from the time. The animation is well-done, and both it, and the design, hold plenty of energy and creativity. The 3D elements are nicely done, and the use of color is effective. Dialog is well-done. Characters are, as well. Music choices are... interesting, in some cases. There are some well-integrated references here and there, herein, for us fans of mythology(the Greek of it, mind you). Comedy leans towards the positive(what exactly *is* with all the Jewish stuff, though? Not that I mind, mind you). The DVD has some good special features, including two videos(in addition to a short making of), one consisting of artwork, the other of clips, as the actual myths, in reasonable detail, are explained. I recommend this to any fan of mythology and/or the Disney feature-length musicals. 7/10",Hercules
13,neil-476,One of the best,9,30 March 2010,"An excellent entry in the Disney animated stakes.Hercules takes some liberties with the stories of myth, but all in a good cause - the tale constructed for the movie makes use of myth while telling its own tale.Gerald Scarfe's highly individual artistic vision, as filtered through classical Greek art and architecture, means that, while still recognisably Disney, the production design on this film means that it looks quite different to any other Disney movie - and this, I think, is a good thing.Hades is a great villain with a truly memorable vocal characterisation from James Woods.The song ""I won't say I'm in love"" is one of the very best.Highly recommended.",Hercules
14,evanston_dad,Jerk-ules,5,17 July 2009,"Completely unmemorable animated film from the Disney studios, one of the several audiences had to make do with until Pixar came along and revitalized the art form.It's not as dull as the previous year's ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" but it sure as hell ain't no ""Beauty and the Beast."" Since there seems to be some rule on file that every single Disney movie ever made must have one of its songs nominated for an Oscar, the Academy nominated Michael Bolton's ballad ""Go the Distance,"" but it's the title song, with the line ""Who put the 'glad' back in gladiator?"" that I remember most.Grade: B-",Hercules
15,anaconda-40658,Not So Mighty.,4,2 July 2015,"Hercules (1997): Dir: Ron Clements, John Musker / Voices: Tate Donovan, Danny De Vito, James Woods, Rip Torn, Susan Egan: Weak animation by Disney based on the Greek myth with Zeus ridding the earth of all disasters and his son Hercules is born. He is kidnapped and forced to drink a potion prepared by Hades that would rid Hercules of his strength. The catch being that he must drink every last drop, which obviously doesn't happen. He is raised on earth and brought into knowledge of who he is. When he finally meets Zeus he is informed that in order to become a true hero he must be trained. Crucial opening background is never followed up and falters to the end. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements who made the superior The Little Mermaid. Tate Donovan is humorous voicing Hercules who turns out to be the one rounded character in the film. Other characters are well introduced but then they follow predictable formula. Danny De Vito as the voice of Phil the trainer is pretty straight forward. James Woods as Hades is another predictable prop that is all surface no interior. Rip Torn voices the thunderous Zeus who also seems to flake off as the film drones on. Susan Egan plays an annoying damsel type character who amounts to nothing. Theme toys with superheroes strength but unfortunately that power never went into writing the film. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Hercules
16,KineticSeoul,Bland and narrow animated Disney flick,4,27 September 2014,"I read that this movie doesn't stand true to the Greek Mythology, which doesn't really matter for me cause I have no interest in Greek Mythology much. I thought this movie was passable when I first saw it as a kid, nothing worth re-watching but just alright. However watching it now, it just seemed too simple and bland with almost no real substance. It didn't even appear like much effort was put into it, but to just make another animated Disney movie. Watching this was like watching another 3 episode of a animated TV show on Saturday. Everything is just so darn narrow and predictable that it really does take away from the experience. Not only that, even the hero is super bland and the supporting character adds more flavor to this movie. Overall this is a forgettable flick that is maybe worth a watch only if you are a kid.4.9/10",Hercules
17,OllieSuave-007,One of my least favorite Disney movies.,4,12 December 2013,"This is Disney's 35th full-length animated film, a story about Hercules, son of Zeus, who was turned into a half-god, half-mortal by the evil Hades, who plans to overthrow Zeus. Hercules must become a hero if he is to return to Mt. Olympus and, along the way, his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr, try to help him.Like most Disney movies, the animation is vibrant. However, the overall story and plot wasn't entertaining and the movie's pace dragged. There is no suspense built-up and I thought the film was trying to be just one, huge laugh-fest, but resulted in overzealous characters with poor slapstick comedy and jokes.I know this is a cartoon movie but, in earlier Disney films, especially ones given Walt's personal touch, the filmmakers at least gave the movies realistic and believable treatment. ""Hercules"" doesn't attempt to do that, as evident with parts such as Hercules uttering, ""Look, I'm an action figure!"" It's a movie set with a Greek mythology theme, so, I wished it was treated at least a little more seriously. To top if off, the music was unremarkable; songs had no substance.Overall, if you're looking for a Disney movie to watch with the kids or to just pass the time, watch for ones prior to Aladdin, especially those made before 1980.Grade D-",Hercules
18,cherold,very funny,7,29 November 2003,"Sprightly, wacky take on Greek mythology, with gospel-singing muses, excellent acting and the same sort of slapstick comedy that is so much fun in Lilo & Stitch.  I can't help but wish the big monsters weren't so computer-animated looking, but they were still impressive even if they looked a little too slick and machine-like compared with the rest of the animation.  Very funny, and one of those rare Disney cartoons where I actually enjoyed some of the songs, notably I Won't Say I'm in Love, although I could have done without the boy Hercules' pining song.",Hercules
19,StrictlyConfidential,"Our Strapping, Young Hero (Hercules) Must Be Ready, Willing, And Able To Go The Full Distance",6,4 May 2020,"Originally released back in 1997 - ""Hercules"" is an American animated musical/fantasy/comedy film produced through Walt Disney Pictures. Its budget was $85 million.Featuring several songs - This fantasy picture would be Disney's 35th animated feature film. Its story is loosely based on the legendary hero Heracles (known in the film by his Roman name, Hercules), the son of Zeus, in Greek mythology.For the most part - ""Hercules"" is quite an entertaining film providing, of course, that you don't take its story too seriously and you are willing to forgive all of the liberties that its scriptwriters took with the original tale, concerning our muscular hero, which was derived from the touchy subject of ancient legend.",Hercules
20,FeastMode,there is nothing for me here,2,2 July 2020,"I loved this movie when it came out. watching it now, the songs are mediocre at best, it didn't make me laugh, and i didn't care about any of the characters or story. they chose the slapstick route which had me rolling my eyes on multiple occasions.

21,ElMaruecan82,Semi-good Disney about Semi-God Hercules...,7,14 October 2016,"After 19 years, I have finally watched ""Hercules"". Why such a long wait? Well, let's just say in 1997, and I had other priorities in mind. See, I was 7 when ""The Little Mermaid"" was made and 12 when ""The Lion King"" came to the screens, I guess this put me in the demographic category that most benefited from Disney Renaissance. We didn't call it Renaissance back then but I remember each new Disney was an event by itself, and ""The Lion King"" was the culmination. Then came ""Pocahontas"" and at 13, I didn't think she was worth my attention; Disney princesses weren't my cup of tea anymore. At 14, I didn't care about Quasimodo's romance with Esmeralda either. Still, ""Hercules"" should have tickled my curiosity. He was obviously a character in the same vein than Aladdin: young, cool and funky and the film felt laid-back and catching but I had more personal and bitter reasons to snub the semi-God.Number one, I studied Latin in class and naturally, Greek and Roman mythology were parts of the learning. Number two, Hercules was one of my favorite characters ever since I saw ""The Twelve Tasks of Asterix"" and I knew all of the tasks by heart, and once I got deeper on the subject thanks to Latin, I thought the journey of Hercules was the perfect material for a spoof comic. And I draw a story of Hercules in January 1997, one that combined the caricature with the real myth, I called him Hercules, but his father was Jupiter, not Zeus, the Disney film uses the Greek names, except for the hero, of course Heracles is less cool-sounding. So, I made the story and believe it or not, one of the gags involved Hercules becoming a super star and passing by a dozens of girls screaming and getting hysterical at him (a take on the then current boys band's phenomenon).And a few weeks later, I bump into an ad announcing the next Disney movie, and I see the exact picture. Seems like the God of inspiration tricked us, or made great minds think alike or maybe that it's just an unfortunate coincidence. Still, after that, I couldn't show my comic story without hearing a comment implying that I got the inspiration from Walt Disney. My hype was gone and I was angry at the film. No matter how promising and fun it was, I always felt it as the one that stole my idea. It took me years to finally watch it and now that it's done, I guess I can 'forgive' it, that the film didn't do as well as the other Disney movies prove that maybe the concept wasn't terrific enough to appeal to the masses, or maybe the film came in that period of uncertainty that transitioned between the Renaissance and Pixar era, the second half of the 90's.Face it, ""Pocahontas"" and ""Hunchback"" aren't the most talked about film when we reminisce about the nineties, and it's a shame for ""Hercules"" that it didn't even make it in the Box Office Top 10 (unlike the others). The film deserved better, it was entertaining, the hero was a cool and gentle guy who tried to blend in a society by being a hero in the 'literal' meaning of the word, his existential quest also cleverly questions what a hero is supposed to represent, is it just a bland name defining the protagonist, the source of merchandising and advertisement, or is there more that he's supposed to find out? The characters aren't undeserving, the sidekick is a satyr and an exciting coach voiced by Danny De Vito, the love interest Meg is perhaps the sexiest Disney female character, and James Woods plays a good villain, as a blue looking Hades. If his blue flame-like hair have a tendency to turn into real reddish ones when he's angry, he's as cool as ice when he handles the situation with Zeus, Meg and Hercules, well, he's James Woods.The movie plays it cool and low-key and I guess this is what allows the film to emerge as a nice little oddity with cult-like appeal, it's obviously meant to be one of these feel-good Disney films and not a heavy loaded drama with Shakespearian undertones à la ""Lion King"", the songs are upbeat, the Greek chorus chanting the hero like the Gospel gives the film a certain edge and overall, it's enjoyable, fun and entertaining in the same spirit than most Dreamworks' movies. So maybe the best compliment to Hercules is that it was ahead of its time. Even 1997 with ""Titanic"" and ""Men in Black"" was quite a tough year to compete in.",Hercules
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Zeus! Your son has returned.,7,30 December 2020,"Though 'Hercules (1997)' struggles to provide even one truly great song, the film is a colourful and enjoyable adaptation of Greek mythology. Its highlight is probably Hades, the easily enraged god of the underworld who's brilliantly voiced by a fast-talking and scene-chewing James Woods. The movie is mostly light-hearted entertainment; it has an underlying message, but it isn't as focused upon as in some of Disney's other fare. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Sometimes, you just want your animated musicals to be fun. After a somewhat slow start, the movie picks up the pace and is engaging right until its finish. It also features a few well-achieved and, even, exciting set-pieces. It's a solid entry in the Disney archives. 7/10",Hercules

It's not bad of course, but you can see that they are diverging from the original fairytale formula and experimenting with other avenues. In this case, the Hercules legend is modernised with a lot of pop culture references and a wittier style.",Hercules
27,filipemanuelneto,"Very interesting, but with script failures.",6,9 July 2016,"This film tells the story of Hercules, a bastard son of the Greek god Zeus, whom immortality is stolen and, therefore, is given to humans to be created, becoming a hero thanks to his impressive strength. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who also ensure the writing of the script, the film has excellent designs, a good cast of voice actors and musical pieces by Alan Menken.Despite all the efforts in merchandising, this movie is not the best that Disney has presented. First, the script is nothing more than an adaptation, too free and imaginative, of a classic legend, much publicized in mythology. The film does not tell the whole tale, preferring to create a new story with some of the elements found in myth, ignoring everything that does not fit the intention of making a film for children. One of the most interesting and comical characters is Phil, a chubby faun who becomes coach and friend of Hercules. At times, he steals the attention of the Greek hero. The way the film puts the nine Muses (as Soul singers and narrators of the story) does not convinced nor pleased. More interesting was Meg, a character who exemplifies the way the ancient Greeks regarded the woman, a beautiful thing, but bad and that could be dangerous.In any case, this film is still good, deserve to be seen and appreciated for what it is",Hercules
28,TheMovieDiorama,Hercules is indeed a good Disney musical but does have some stumbling blocks that prevents it from being great.,7,27 February 2018,"During Disney's Renaissance era, they pretty much covered a variety of different cultures past and present. With Hercules, they portrayed Greek mythology and made it accessible for younger audiences. Taking elements from multiple myths and putting it into one story, Hercules follows the titular character as he is kidnapped and placed on Earth. With his godly powers nearly diminished, Hercules must find a way to become a God again before the sinister Hades destroys him. It is essentially the animated version of Clash of the Titans, but with cutesy musical numbers and that typical feel good Disney plot that we've all learnt to adore. Highlighting the importance of love, inner strength and...love again? Children will leave the film wanting to find a partner and fall endlessly in love (good job Disney...). Plenty of memorable characters including Hades, Meg, Pegasus and a Satyr voiced by Danny DeVito who just about has the best lines. ""Rule number 95 kid: concentrate."", ""What are you doing!? Get your swooooord!"" (gosh I love that line). Only DeVito could pull that line off and make it utterly unforgettable. The animation was decent on the whole, I've always admired the hand-drawn technique. However, I found thin weak Hercules to be badly drawn and the mixture of 3D rendered effects such as the Hydra battle with hand drawings looks extremely outdated and takes you out of the narrative. The songs are mostly sung by five women (who are everywhere, much like The Little Shop of Horrors) who appear on pottery, sculptures and pretty much anything else. From 'Zero to Hero' and my personal favourite 'Go The Distance', Hercules is filled with some damn catchy songs, just not Disney's strongest. Like with most animations, the ending was rushed and everything is neatly tied up with a glitzy ribbon. Which is fine, but there really isn't any emotional impact in the story. So whilst this may still be a decent Disney animated musical that captures Greek mythology, it's not their best.",Hercules
29,Vartiainen,"Somewhat flawed and superfluous, but still has that Disney spark of magic",6,15 November 2015,"Disney's Hercules is an odd mix of elements. It takes Ancient Greek mythology, completely twists it around while still retaining enough to keep it recognizable, adds painfully bright pastel colour palette, throws in some CGI and simpering sidekicks, and crowns it all off with a soundtrack that takes all of its inspiration from American gospel music. Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology. I don't think nine would have been too much, seeing that they're usually the ones singing and gospel music is well-equipped to large crowds singing it, but it's okay. Though it is a bit strange that they dropped Euterpe, the muse of song and music (and elegiac poetry), from the lineup. The use of CGI is also a bit jarring nowadays, because it hasn't aged that well, but I can see that they wanted to experiment with a new technology. Disney has always done that, though usually with better results. What is a bit harder for me to understand is the fact that they made Hades the villain instead of Hera, who was Hercules's main nemesis in the original myths, seeing as she was jealous that her husband Zeus had slept with a mortal woman, siring Hercules in the process. Or Heracles, as he should be called, because this is the Greek version of the myth. Then again, Disney is all about family values, so it's not that surprising. And James Woods does brilliant as the voice actor of Hades.What really keeps me from liking this film more is the main hero, unfortunately. Hercules just isn't all that interesting of a guy, especially when compared to the ones that came just before him. Simba, Belle, Aladdin, Quasimodo, all of these deep, tragic main characters. And yeah, Hercules has his problems, but he still comes across as that perfect high school jock. You know, the nice one, who could have starred in any breakfast cereal commercial he wanted, was the homecoming king, went on to have a successful career in sports, founded a perfect family and died at the age of one hundred, surrounded by grandkids. You have nothing against the guy, but you're also not really all that interested in the details of his life.Then again, Megara is great, Hades is excellent, Zeus is enjoyably over the top and boisterous, Phil and Pegasus are alright and the rest of the cast do their jobs. The animation is also very nice, though personally I'm not a fan of the colour palette, but that's a pet peeve of mine and not a fault of the film in any way. And while the songs and the music style are not outright classics like so many other Disney soundtracks of the 90s, there are some decent songs in the mix. Though couldn't you have given Hades a villain song? It would have been glorious.Ultimately Hercules is one of the weaker Renaissance films, but still lands somewhere in the middle as far as the overall quality of Disney films is to be considered. It has its flaws, but is still an enjoyable experience for kids and adults alike. Give it a try if you haven't already.",Hercules
30,lisafordeay,Good animated film from the House of Mouse but not the best Disney movie ever.,6,14 August 2013,"Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty & The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused.Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules.Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny.Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place.So its a 6 from me.",Hercules

I find it wholly enjoyable, endearing, and witty.

I have little negatives, yet there isn't much the other way either. I like the cast, but that's honestly about it.James Woods, Danny DeVito and Rip Torn all give noteworthy performances in the roles of Hades, Phil and Zeus. However, Tate Donovan as the titular character is forgettable, as is Roger Bart's voice when Hercules sings.Bart isn't helped by the very average music, none of which is memorable to me. The plot is mild, one that is quite easy to predict and doesn't produce any thrilling moments. The animation is actually OK, satisfactory for sure.I can see this is very well rated by others, which I respect. For me, though, it isn't any good.",Hercules
33,MissSimonetta,A watered down Aladdin set in ancient Greece,6,15 May 2014,"No, it's not accurate to the original Greek myth of Heracles, but that isn't what keeps this film from being much good.Hercules (1997) is a part of the second half of the oft-praised Disney Renaissance, a second golden age which ran from the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989 roughly until the release of Tarzan in 1999. Fans usually split this period into two parts: we have the Big Four from 1989 to 1994 (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King), called such because they not only innovated and revitalized Disney animation after the roughly two decade dark age following Walt Disney's death in 1966, but they were also major hits at the box office. The second half starts with the artistic misfire that was Pocahontas, a visually stunning but soulless film obviously made with the Academy Awards in mind. It was at this point that the ""renaissance formula"" began to become more obvious and stale. Yes, a few of the films were good (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan), but most were bland and safe wastes of time.Hercules is as safe as these films got. I think only Fantasia 2000 (1999) was more of a disappointment in taking chances. The main character, his ""I Want"" song, and the supporting characters are all dull. The color scheme is wretched, just a potpourri of clashing neon colors competing for your attention. The whole movie feels like a less entertaining version of Aladdin (1992) honestly. The only redeeming elements are the hilarious villain Hades and the love interest Meg's song, ""I Won't Say I'm in Love.""I'm glad others find merit in it, but for me, it's only a mildly pleasant mess.",Hercules
34,dwpollar,OK Disney animated feature...,4,2 April 2009,"1st watched 3/28/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Musker & Ron Clements): OK Disney animated feature about the son of the great Zeus and his silly adventures. This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare). The movie is narrated by a 60's like Gospel group, who end every song with ""the gospel truth."" I'm sure this didn't make the religious right very happy about this movie(but they never really made movies for them anyway—but don't tell 'em). All in all, the movie is watchable but not the kind of Disney fare that we've come to expect from them. The same formula just not executed as well as some of their other movies.",Hercules

James Woods, Danny Devito & Rip Torn to name a few all put in excellent work using their iconic sounding voices to bring iconic mythological characters to life.
""HERCULES"" is good solid fantasy adventure fun with some of Hollywoods best sounding voices gracing this beautiful animated film.It's just great fun & an underrated Disney Classic.

On the other hand, Hercules (voice of Tate Donovan) and Meg (voice of Susan Egan) were truly meant to be friends. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""Go The Distance,"" by Michael Bolton. ""One Last Hope"" was good, too. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Phil's (voice of Danny DeVito) singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well.

37,jfgibson73,Lesser Family Film,5,8 March 2017,"Hercules is a Disney movie that doesn't quite reach greatness. When you look at some of the pieces, it seems like it should be memorable: Hades is one of the more entertaining villains and along with Pain and Panic offer some age-of-irony comic relief. Megara is one of the more interesting love interests in a children's film, coming off like a female James Cagney. The songs are fun, though not strong enough on their own to become hits. The obvious weak link is the central character, Hercules himself. There isn't enough character development to make us really care about anything that happens. He may as well be the nameless prince from Snow White for as much as we learn about him. I don't think his desire to become a god really connects with people-- many of us may have felt like we were out of place, but the whole goal of rejoining his immortal family just feels like the rich getting richer. It has some entertaining segments, and it has some boring segments, and overall is just an average animated feature.",Hercules

Greek mythology stuff is great (I love Greek mythology in general) and some songs were cachy. There is a lot of humor I wouldn't get when I was younger, there are also so many refrences to other movies (The Godfather, Midnight Cowboy...) I don't know why I didn't love it more, it was just ok the whole time. Also, Roman mythology is the worst!!!",Hercules
39,Spleen,Pretty damned good - but there is this ONE problem ...,9,19 July 1999,"The Ancient Greeks and Romans were twisting the Hercules legend out of shape long before Disney got hold of it.  So I'll skip the usual complaints about Hercules being Hera's son, there being a demon named `Panic' and so on.  I can understand people objecting on these grounds; I think such objections are often justified, but misguided in this particular case; but there are arguments on both sides I would need to present if I were to discuss the case here - and so I won't.  Let me just stipulate that fiddling around with classical mythology does not, in this case, matter.  If you disagree - well, you disagree.Alan Menken's music is hugely disappointing.  So is Musker and Clement's handling of it - they once showed a great flair for staging songs, but here they seem, for the most part, uncertain as to how to work the material in. (A notable exception is `One Last Hope'.)  On the plus side, animation has never been better.    Disney hasn't had a villain so well animated since 1967, possibly 1961.  (Look up the relevant villains, if you want.) Computer-rendering the hydra was I think a mistake, as computer rendering usually is, but that was a good scene, so I'll waive the objection.  -Oh, yes: I should also put in a word for the general look imparted by Gerald Scarfe.The story, really, was a strong one.  I have to say `really' because it's easy to come away with the impression that it was not, because of one tiny element: the big battle at the end.  Hercules defeated the bad guys with ludicrous ease in a weak and perfunctory scene - it lasts just seconds. This is a serious problem in the work of Musker and Clements.  If you look at `The Little Mermaid', `Aladdin' and `Hercules' you'll note that they all have a ridiculously large-scale set piece at the end which tends to prompt the reaction, `Yeah, yeah.'  They'll HAVE to do something about this.  For the story, was, as I say - look at it objectively and ignore the concluding battle - strong.  And AFTER the battle, when Hercules ...  Let's just say I found this smaller drama to be much more exciting, and certainly more creative.So it wasn't quite what it could have been.  Nonetheless I predict that `Hercules' will wear its years lightly; already, it is looking stronger, more muscular, and more likely to be immortal, than `Aladdin' ever did.",Hercules
40,onepotato2,pretty irritating,1,20 March 2008,"With Hercules, Disney accomplished a new goal: to get the enjoyable moments of a movie down to just a few seconds. Apparently the minute or two of pleasure to be found in the duds Pochahontas, Hunchback and Tarzan was far too generous. Every moment here cheapens the previous one. This team just can't wait to show you their next un-original idea. (columns falling like dominoes, anyone?) This one has it all: obnoxious, post-Aladdin characters who appropriate a celebrity's entire persona (a la Robin-Williams: James Woods, Paul Schneider, Danny Devito, Bob Goldthwaite) instead of developing a character; this is lazy and irritating in the extreme. I can't tell you who did the voices in The Little Mermaid, because that movie had it's priorities straight. You also get crappy post-Elton John schmaltz like 'Go the Distance,' penned for those who enjoy easy listening a.m. radio, or maybe (I imagine) for figure skaters to have something schlocky to skate to. And a mediocre end-credits performance from some bad singer who apparently needed the exposure. I have no idea why Meg is interested in Hercules. He's very annoying. Other characters note how irritating he is, and he is... an earnest jackass who keeps screwing things up isn't much to look at. There is one terrific way to not be irritating, and that's to take the hint... and calm the hell down. This idea never occurs to Hercules (or his creators). The song ""I Won't Say I'm in Love"" constitutes the films only non-irritating, pleasant moment. The movie is also the lame stab at a new aesthetic that Disney attempts every 5 movies. It just looks kind of flat and cheap. It's obsessed with spirals, notably in the depiction of nipples. So when the spiral appears obsessively all over the same character, they basically have nipple-ears, nipple-elbows, nipple-chins and nipple-pins fastening their tunics. It's weird. This movie reflects the continued lack of thought that would naturally follow the previous six or seven formulaic Disney flicks that people gave easy raves. So go ahead, and drink the Disney Kool-Aid. This time it's crap flavored.",Hercules

And are there really that many Greek God purists out there?Hercules is a fun kid movie, with enough sly humor, in-jokes and adult-ish plot developments to keep the parents interested.  James Woods is the standout here, in the comedic role of his career.  Tate Donovan is kinda bland (like most Disney male heroes).  I wasn't that impressed by Danny DeVito doing...well, Danny DeVito.  Everyone else is competent or a bit better.There are a few plot holes: why does Zeus have trouble defeating the Titans the second time around - how'd he do it originally?  Doesn't Hades _ever_ check up on his (obviously incompetent) henchmen?  Hades seems rather...Satan-like, what with the soul-trading and deals and stuff.I thoroughly enjoyed the musical score is enjoyable throughout, though. The Muses struck me as a bit over the top (and why do they keep talking about the 'gospel' truth? - that's a Biblical reference.).  I'd rather have heard the characters sing (and shouldn't Hades have got a number?), then hear the (literal) Greek Chorus chipping in from time to time.Generally, though, it's an enjoyable flick, somewhat of a return to form for Disney after Pocahontas and Hunchback.",Hercules

It is on the level as James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Hades. Great job Disney on this perfection.

46,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Very enjoyable entry in the Disney animation canon.,9,2 June 2019,"Hercules went through many iterations before finally landing on the big screen in 1997: Kevin Spacey was originally considered to voice Hades and the project almost came to being an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey, but was promptly cancelled after that story was deemed too weak for an animated comedy and so Hercules was chosen when that pitch fell through.This is a very entertaining film that's self aware of when it was made (during the 90s) and its liberties with the source material are perfectly natural choices for the story and happy-go-lucky direction it takes. Sure some of the choices haven't aged well (Disney's in-joke about merchandising and franchising is used in the film at points) but the animation is gorgeous and still very sharp in its distinction from the rest of the Disney movies at the time. I know there were critics who took issue with this aspect of the film at the time, but come on guys: it could've been those Beatles cartoons from the 60s for Pete's sake; or jeez, it could have been one of those straight-to-dvd knock-off films made to 'cash in' on Disney releases that were popular back then.Hercules is energetic, fast-paced and vibrant fun for film-goers everywhere.

48,TheUnknown837-1,one of the lesser Disney movies,6,16 May 2008,"Of course, it was only a matter of time before Disney decided to take one of the Greek or Roman myths, tone down the seriousness, create a happier ending, and turn it into an animated feature for children. ""Hercules"", a Disney retelling of the myth of Heracles, is a film that has a good heart and probably good intentions. If it was meant to inspire children to learn more about mythology, it worked. I marginally enjoyed ""Hercules"" as a child. The key word is marginally, and now as an older audience member, I still marginally enjoy it, but I do see it as flawed and a little bit of a bore at times.If you want something completely faithful to the myth, definitely stray away. I wasn't planning on seeing something entirely faithful, still ""Hercules"" did not fully interest me. I did like the voice acting talents and I did very much enjoy how Danny DeVito did the voice of the half-human half-goat hero-trainer. But one thing I did not like was how the other characters were put on screen. And that's another problem I have with this film. I was not all for the animation style. I felt it was too vibrant, too shoddy, and I just didn't think it was eye candy. I felt Zeus looked a little preposterous among some others. And I know that many, including the Academy Awards, will disagree with me on the next point. But I did not like the main song ""Go the Distance"" that Hercules sings like three times in a row within twenty minutes. I'm sorry, but I just did not like it. I knew it was going to be there, but I was hoping for something better than what I got.Don't get me wrong. I did not HATE the film. There were some moments that were quite fun. Such as Hercules's legendary battle with the multi-headed Hydra. Although I felt the serpent needed better-looking heads, the scene were pretty exciting and cool to watch.Bottom line, ""Hercules"" will appeal to most audience viewers who like Disney movies. Again, I did marginally enjoy it, but I have seen much better films come out of Disney. I would recommend ""The Jungle Book"" or ""The Rescuers Down Under"" and for children, I would say ""Hercules"" is worth looking at.",Hercules
49,blott2319-1,"Not one of Disney's best, but watchable",5,7 July 2020,"I never had a massive interest in mythology, but I certainly had some vague knowledge of Hercules before I ever saw this film. It is an odd story for Disney to adapt, and they needed to bring a boatload of bleach just to clean it up enough for it to be a kids movie. Knowing a bit more about the actual myths now, it's kind of funny to see this sanitized version of the tale that manages to make so many of these characters seem righteous. Perhaps the funniest aspect is the perfect relationship between Zeus and Hera. The other odd choice with this film was the decision to turn the muses (the narrators of the story) into gospel singers. Utilizing a genre of music that is traditionally Christian in its roots to tell the story of a Roman demigod is so weird it makes my brain hurt. Of course, I can't deny that the tunes are catchy. In fact, the best part of this film is the music. That's not a big surprise since Alan Menken is still the song writer, and he knows how to make great music.The story they write for this interpretation of Hercules is not all that interesting. It kind of feels like a retread of Superman, and frankly I'd just rather watch that film instead. I guess this movie has Danny DeVito shoved in there for something different, and for some people that might be a benefit. Personally, I found the character he plays to be a bit annoying. Although he is infinitely better than Pain and Panic, the little demons voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer. I guess these guys are in there because every Disney movie needs their goofy little creatures that are thrown in entirely for comedic effect (perhaps to win over young children.) The saving grace of the film is James Woods as Hades. He is entertaining and fun, with a sense of humor that actually works for adults as well. I don't have any active hatred for Hercules as a film, it's an acceptable way to pass 90 minutes. But considering the glut of amazing Disney animated films, I'm more likely to just listen to this soundtrack than watch the movie again.",Hercules
50,sharky_55,Aren't you a damsel in distress?,8,26 May 2016,"Hercules visibly diverges from the darkness of its Greek mythology source material for a brighter, more hopeful tale. It posits that a hero is not just someone who does heroic deeds but can also place himself in front of others and sacrifice his own well-being for those who need it more. Pretty simply, sappy Hollywood stuff. But it works marvellously. Disney do not ever hold back on the camp, which is perhaps why it is able to be digested and enjoyed so easily. The gods of the Olympus are all clearly drawn, multicoloured caricatures - not withholding the power couple themselves, Zeus with his hulking, bulging muscles and the stick-thin, bright pink Hera. The sarcastic yet sultry Megara is animated in a way that is not subtle about each exaggerated swing of her hips, and it is enough to make Herc and other young boys' jaws drop. The scene-stealer is James Woods' Hades, who could have been brooding and muttering darkly from the shadows, but bursts into fits of rage and quips like a comedian gone mad. Too many adaptations have made Hades into a dark, humourless character, a baddie played straight. Woods brings attitude, and a fiery temper matched only by his quick wit. The same subversion is applied to the opening narration. Of course Disney would never let this be a mopey, grim story with dark undercurrents and pessimistic endeavours. The regularly employ the bait and stitch, drawing on the audience's knowledge of these tales and then pulling the rug from right under us. The best and funniest example of this happens at the climatic sacrifice on Hercules' part; he dives into Styx, wading through dead souls and withering away right before our eyes. Quiet a shock from the ever-grinning, bouncing action figure that has dominated much of the film. This is intercut with the Fates inching closer and closer to his life-line, the music ominously building...until they actually try to cut it and it just won't snap and they descend into mayhem in forcing the issue. A less inspired example would be the glowing Hercules abruptly caving in Hades' face without the slightest acknowledgement of the slapstick manner of the moment. Of course, nostalgia plays his part. I find myself noticing things that I had not previously. The film could have used another half hour; stretch out his young, fish-out-of-water existence, or the training montage that leads him to become an over-excited action figure. The CGI Hydra is an unavoidable element, and clashes so horribly with the rest of the clean-cut animation (though they have merged some of Herc's sword swings well). And there is one thing that most kids would not notice. The animation of the facial expressions is at times quite bizarre; it is like when you pause a video and inexplicably create a funny, morphed face, only these don't need pausing to pop up. It does not take too much away because the film's zaniness never slows down enough to be sensible. And the songs are still great. Go the Distance is intimate enough for Hercules, but targets a universal feeling that we all know too well.",Hercules

52,vip_ebriega,Gods and Monsters: HERCULES is one of Disney's funniest.,10,3 January 2009,"My Take: The typical masterpiece Disney is capable of. Pure magic! The gods must be funny in this hilarious animated smash from the ever-talented animation artists at Disney. HERCULES, which was released after the studio dared to venture into darker territory with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, returns to the kind of light, fun-loving musical adventure. Despite being a magnificent instant classic of its own, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME proved to be too dark for the usual Disney routine. If that case so, HERCULES is a good throwback to the days of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID. It may just be their funniest yet.The movie is a twist on the tales of Greek Mythology, namely the story of the title character (voiced by Tate Donovan), who happens to be the son of the great god Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) who is robbed of his godly powers and turned mortal... sort of by the evil Lord Hades (voiced with maniacal glee by James Woods). Unfortunate for the hot-headed, comical Lord of the Underworld, Hercules maintained his god-like strength, making him look like a freak in the eyes of everyone else. So young ""Herc"" set on a voyage to find his true identity and reclaim his destiny as a god on Mount Olympus. Aiding as his mentor is a tough-mouthed satyr named Phil (voiced by Danny DeVito) and his magical bird-brained Pegasus, while also tempted by a lovely maiden named Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), short for Megara, who may just have a weakness for his ""Wonder Boy""'s charms.The magic of Disney's timeless animation is still stirring and imaginative, but the voice cast have never been more appropriate. James Woods was born to play the villain Hades. He basically steals the scenes he's in, if not the whole movie. He may be the bad guy, but you'll like hims so much, he's good! Other than Woods is Danny DeVito, who imbues his familiar voice and personality to his character Phil and comes up with a character that even adults will love. Then there are the lovely singing muses, who tells the series of events through winning musical numbers (reminiscent to the Greek Chorus from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). The songs by the way are written none other than brilliant lyricist Alan Menken (ALADDIN), here whipping yet another magnificent strain of brilliant songs. Mythology fans, film fans and musical fans rejoice! Here's the gods to deliver all your requests. Gather the family together! Rating: ***** out of 5.",Hercules
53,educallejero,"Hercules movie, saved by Hades",6,23 November 2019,"It's absolutely criminal that Hades (James Wood), by a large margin the best part of the flick, has so little screen time. Every single one of his interventions and lines was either funny, great (or both). The character's design is strange, but it couldn't be better for this interpretation of Hades. The final act (in which one he participates a lot) is really good and completes a simplistic theme/message in the movie. With all of this, the movie gets a pass as a good film, even if not Disney's best.From the rest, there is little to nothing to praise. The animation and designs are questionable, the score and songs, poor. The voice actors, boring. The jokes, ok at best. The story basic and unremarkable. There is one line ""being famous is not the same as being heroic"" that sounds like social commentary (how we are obsessed with being famous/successful while the best thing is being heroic/morally better), but is not supported in the rest of script, so I'm not convinced it is more than a good line and nothing else.",Hercules
54,phubbs,Hercules,7,1 February 2014,"For some time the animated Disney films didn't really hit me with much inspiration, by that I mean none of their outings grabbed my attention, the ideas just didn't excite me. Then along came this adventure based around the magic of Greek mythology and I was hooked. An animated Disney version of Harryhausen's mythic visions? count me in. So off I went on the day of release back in 1997, Swiss Cottage Odeon, North London (for some reason I remember, probably because this Odeon was unusually HUGE!).A simple tale of Hercules life from birth up to his teenage years. The loss of his immortality and God status at the hands of Hades, his young life as a mortal and how he manages to become a God again with the help of various friends in typical wide eyed Disney manner.The two things that attracted me to this kiddie flick were 1. the Greek mythology as already said, and 2. the visuals on display. Disney seem to go through different styles over time and this films style is really nice in its stark angled way. It comes across like a Geddy Tartakovsky project, reminiscent of his 'Star Wars: Clone Wars' series but with less CGI and generally a bit softer in tone. The colour palette is really vibrant too, so rich and alive, its really beautiful to watch going from the warm pastel golds, yellows and beige of Mount Olympus and Thebes to dark shades of blues, purples and black of the underworld. Loved the underworld!, wanted more time down there.Apart from the animation the characters are a big part of any film like this and would it be any surprise if I told you the bad guy was the best?. Yep its true, once again the villain shines through and in this case James Woods makes Hades a very likable guy. Not only does he look really cool with a brilliant design and a virtually monochromatic colour scheme, he also has a really awesome flaming blue hairdo which is such a sweet touch. It is of course the deadpan sarcastic fiery verbal from Woods that he's famous for and he doesn't disappoint here...minus the profanity of course. The only other character that stood out for me was Philoctetes perfectly voiced by De Vito, casting genius. In general the Gods all looked quite good visually but I was unsure about that heavenly glow they all had, I see what they were going for but it kinda looked tacky. The Titans were a tad cliché looking (dunno what I expected) and didn't blow me away, also a shame they used full CGI for the Hydra which looked awful. Not sure why Hercules was drawn the way he was because he looked a bit pug ugly to me, anyone notice how big his ears were?!. Also I didn't really like the little imp minions of Hades, typical stereotypical Disney sidekicks purely in there for silly laughs, oh wait its a kids flick isn't it...dang!.Talking about the Hydra, not sure how that worked, Hercules was cutting off its heads one after another yet it kept on coming back for more. In the end some falling rocks killed it? even though it had its heads cut off multiple times?. On the same note, Hercules is suppose to have retained his super strength BUT he's mortal (watch the film), yet in the film he's still comes across as immortal even after that was drained from him.All in all I did enjoy this Greek outing as I expected I would. Yeah sure its not perfect by any means, the animation is a wee bit dated now naturally but I can't complain about that really. The CGI moments were obvious and terrible...down to age again. I didn't like the soppy songs throughout, yeah I know its Disney but they really felt unnecessary and jammed in...plus they sucked!. I really think these lovey-dovey songs are no longer required for these type of films, its a very old fashioned concept which to be honest I'm glad is fading out...call me uncultured I guess. But I did quite like the little montage showing Hercules victories and his merchandise taking off, Air-Herc hehe nice touch.7/10",Hercules
55,Animany94,Unique visuals and a great villain steal the show.,6,14 October 2017,"I must say that after watching this childhood time-stealer, I found it a little underdeveloped. Hades and his sidekicks pain and panic have become more entertaining over the years while Hercules, Zeus and Megara have worn out a little. Mostly Herc whose conflict is as generic as can be. The visual style is unique to put it neutrally. I personally think it is the ugliest of the Disney renaissance era, but that's not the main problem with this movie. Its uninteresting characters are the problem as I stated in the beginning. Hades makes this movie worth watching and he gets a laugh out of me every time he is on screen and that is great.Despite its problems it has spawned one of my favorite Disney songs, though. ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" is a really catchy tune and along with ""Go The Distance"" the most memorable songs in the movie. Maybe Hercules' unique visual style and the standout performance of James Woods as Hades serves in its favor to make it memorable. Just the weirdness of it in general.One of my least favorite movies from the Disney renaissance, but I can appreciate its existence.",Hercules
56,aesgaard41,Excellant But Wrong,10,5 September 2001,"I'm a big fan of Mythology Movies, even cartoon versions, and Disney has made some very wonderful movies, but this movie gets one thing wrong after another. Hercules's mother was Alcmene, not Hera, and his main antagonist for his whole life was Hera not Hades. There were also seven Muses, not five. Philoctetes was the son of his best friend, Poeas, one of the Argonauts whose boat the Argo is shown in peices thirty years too early. Phil, the goat man, though, may be a substitute for Chiron the centaur, but he mentions Odysseus and Achilles (not born yet) and Perseus, Hercules' great grandfather. Theseus, though, is a contemporary. Hercules never rode Pegasus (neither did Perseus fot that matter). There is a scene with a Gorgon, the only creature Hercules never killed.The likenesses of Hermes and Ares are rather insulting, but several of the others are rather splendid and augmented by various voices if but colored rather egregiously (only the Hindu gods had a significantly colored pantheon). Meg was the daughter of King Creon of Thebes, not a lackey of Hades, but she is a part of Hercules' history as his first wife. She was probably placed in the script to avoid parallels with the Legendary Journeys TV series.Depicted as if Teri Hatcher would play her in a live action version, she is one of the truly wonderful characters in the film behind Zeus, Hades and Hercules. Pain and Panic are unnecessary if not inserted for the comic relief and two extra Happy Meal toys. Despite the bloopers and anachronisms, the movie is great entertainment for child and adult and should get any kid interested in mythology as an interest.",Hercules
57,ja_kitty_71,A Disney film for Mythology fans,9,9 October 2009,"I have a nack for the Greek myths, and Hercules is another favorite Disney movie because of the amazing music by Alan Menken (composer of The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc.) and colourful animation. The film is based on the myth of Greek hero Hercules who must become a true hero in order to reclaim immortality and entry to Mt. Olympus. The story has been altered in the Disney twist, so in the Greek myth, Hercules isn't the son of Zeus and his wife, Hera, but the product of Zeus cheating on his wife with a mortal woman, Alcmene (Hercules' mortal Foster Mother in the film) -- this was a fairly common practice for the king of the gods. Hera was really Hercules biggest nemesis and she hunted down and tried to destroy him many times, like she did with all of Zeus' illegitimate children. And, Hades doesn't appear in the tale except when Hercules traveled to Tartarus (the underworld) to retrieve his pet Cerberus. He wasn't a ""devil figure"" but the hard-working guardian of Tartarus. So anyway, this film might ""cheese-off"" mythology buffs like me...a little.I love the film really I do, it's just one thing that I am not to comfortable with, and it's the constant references to other things like: the jokes of a New Yorkish city that needs saving and the celebrity-product-endorsing; I mean it is getting old! I know it's family-orientated and I respect at what the animation staff (and Disney himself) are trying to do, really! So I am not going to complain about it. ""I Won't Say"" is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. Also the ""Go The Distance"" musical sequence, and when Herc and Megara go up to Mt. Olympus. So mythology fans, film fans and musical fans, I would advise you to over-look the flaws and enjoy this beautifully animated Disney classic.",Hercules
58,mitsubishizero,Another Disney classic,8,10 September 2020,"It may not be their best but it's still enjoyable nonetheless. I like the characters, animation, story as well as some of the jokes. It's not my favorite but I can still sit down and watch it if I'm in the mood. Some of the twists they do on Greek mythology's a little strange. Hades(James Woods) is actually a chill guy with the power of terrakinesis. Nothing like the hot head as depicted in the film. Also, anyone who's read the stories knows that he has every reason to be upset with Zeus.Nitpick aside, this's still an enjoyable film to watch. The action's cool. Particularly the scene where Hercules fought the hydra in the arena where it showcased some early computer animation. It also showcases his persistence and cleverness all thanks to his mentor(Danny Devito). Hercules' a film anyone can enjoy. With that being said I'd say check it out.",Hercules

The animation, although not nearly on the level of most recent efforts, did grow on me after some time, and did seem to fit the movie fairly well.  The humour was certainly hit-and-miss, but the story was generally fine and the ending was particularly enjoyable.  So even with a relatively lackluster beginning, this film eventually did display the terrific animated storytelling that Disney does so very well, and so I can heartily endorse this film.",Hercules
61,Mightyzebra,This is fun.,7,18 August 2007,"Genre: Based on Greek myths, animation, relationships.Actors: Famous ones are Danny DeVito (Phil) and James Woods (Hades).Main characters: Hercules, Zeus, Meg and Hades.What happens: Hercules is the son of the ALL POWERFUL Greek God Zeus. The day Hercules is born, he is captured and made mortal (only three of the characters know how this happens). Someone makes Hercules mortal and then he is adopted by mortal humans. This is only the beginningMessage: That you are a hero if you love as well as fight.My thoughts: I like this film. I think it has more of a potential of being liked to a 8-11 aged audience, as I liked it more than I do now at that age. I still like it because it is very fun, the animation is different, a little weird, but quite good! I also still like the characters, especially Meg and Phil and Hades is funny and I like funny baddies in Disney films. Of course I like all the good Greek Gods, they are somehow potentially likable. I used to like Pain and Panic (Hades's servants) a lot when I was younger, but I'm starting to like them less now because I'm growing up and they are growing a little too silly for my liking. Also this film has a good share of slapstick AND wit in it for my entertainment. I also really like the songs, especially ""Go The Distance"" and ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" or whatever it's called. My favourite character is Phil because I like his personality and he also looks kind of cute when he's excited and happy when to most people he's supposed to be quite UGLY (but I don't agree with that). So I like this film! Recommended to: Mainly people who are aged 8-11, people who like animated Disney films and for people who like ""fun"" films. Enjoy! :-)7 and a half out of 10.",Hercules
62,Dan1863Sickles,The Humor Saves It,7,19 December 2019,"This is one of those movies I would never watch on my own but as a substitute teacher I keep having to sit through it in different classroom.What really jumps out at me every time is how funny this movie is. Danny DeVito is famous for being funny, but James Woods is more like a serious dramatic actor. It's amazing how funny Danny DeVito is as the trainer of heroes, but what's even more incredible is that James Woods takes a very ugly, sinister villain, Hades, and makes him really funny. His dialogue and personality made the movie for me.I also thought Samantha Egan was incredible as Meg, the bad girl who falls for Hercules in spite of herself. Was I the only one who noticed the way the writers kept referencing Robert Redford's baseball classic THE NATURAL? Meg keeps calling Hercules ""Wonderboy"" and her relationship with him is just like Memo's with Roy Hobbs. And just like Memo is controlled by sinister bookie Gus Sands, Meg is being controlled by Hades and forced to ruin Hercules against her will!The humor and romance made this a great movie for me.

64,moviesleuth2,A step down from previous Disney animated films,8,28 October 2008,"The worst thing you can do when watching Disney's ""Hercules"" is to compare it to its predecessors. Not because it's impossible (it's not), but because it makes ""Hercules"" look a lot worse than it probably deserves.When it comes to adapting material for children's movies (especially the animated ones), Disney has always been known to change some of the darker aspects of the original story to make it more kid-friendly. Never has it been more apparent than in this film, though considering the source material, it's understandable...to a point. But Disney reworked the whole story, making only passing mentions at the original myth (similar to the fairy tale references to fairy tales in the ""Shrek"" movies).Hades (James Woods) is pretty peeved at Zeus (Rip Torn) that he was assigned to govern the underworld. But according to a prophecy, he will have a chance to take over Mount Olympus and rule the world. However, the prophecy also says that there is one person who stands in his way, Zeus' newborn son, Hercules (Josh Keaton/Roger Bart as Young Hercules). So Hades sends his two monster henchmen, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to off the kid. The plan almost works, and Hercules ends up living as a mortal, though his god-like strength makes him an outcast. Then Zeus tells him that the only way to become a god again is to become a true hero. So with the help of Phil (Danny DeVito), a hero-trainer, Hercules (played by Tate Donovan as an adult), sets out to become one. Meanwhile, Hades has his own agenda in motion.The problem with Hercules isn't the story, but that it's lazy film-making. It seems as though the filmmakers just wanted to make the quickest movie they could. The drama doesn't work very well, the characters are half-developed, and the energy level is low. There are only a few songs in the film (none of which is especially memorable), unlike in previous Disney features. The animation seems to be inspired by Greek art, but it's not as crisp or beautiful as in other films (and sometimes the merging of hand-drawn and computer animation is inadequately done).Most surprising is the lack of effective humor. Much of the jokes fall flat, and what works is merely amusing. The scenery-chewing sarcasm of Woods' Hades and DeVito's Phil are worth a few grins, but they're not laugh-out-loud hilarious.The other voice talents are uninspired. Tate Donovan is flat as Hercules, and he fails to provide the emotional anchor that the film desperately needs. Susan Egan is a good voice-over actress, and her later work in Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" proves it. But her talents are not adequately used here, and it makes her less effective (though she still manages to inject some sass into Meg). Rip Torn does what he can with Zeus, but his dialogue is so weak that there isn't much he can do.""Hercules"" is better than ""Pocahontas,"" but it's still a far cry from the other Disney features.",Hercules
65,Min111,He's the strongest Disney character,10,17 December 2019,"This is one of the less talked about movies within the Disney world, and I don't understand why that is.I think this movie, Hercules, is just as good as some of the other movies that came before it, as well as after. Hercules is another underrated Disney gem or movie.This movie has one of the best-looking and strongest hero in Hercules. I don't know who else can compare to Hercules within the Disney world.Not only this movie has a great set of heroes, but equally, has a great set of villains, with the one leading the charge - Hades. He is one of the coolest villains around - really like those blue flames coming from the top of his head.Also, let's not forget about Hercules horse called Pegasus, who along with Hercules, happens to be my favourite characters of this movie. Both of them compliment each other well, and make a wonderful duo. I really like the way Pegasus looks - like the design.I would say there isn't much difference between Hercules, and some of the other Disney movies.

When he grows up,  Hercules wants to be a God, but first he has to show that he is a true hero, by doing several tasks.

71,renegadeviking-271-528568,Hercules,7,4 February 2020,"During the late 1980s and 1990s, I was a big Disney fan (though I still am). Films like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and especially Beauty and the Beast were favorites of mine and I have fond memories of watching these movies on repeat. But after The Lion King (which I skipped seeing in theaters), I just wasn't interested in the films Disney was offering at the time. The greatest films of the Disney Renaissance, as it were, were essentially dwindling as the studio offered up seemingly less prominent works such as the grossly historically inaccurate Pocahontas (1995) , an under-performing adaption of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), and a quirky take on Greek mythology in Hercules (1997). Though I never saw Hercules back in the day, I became interested in it after watching reviews on it courtesy of the Nostalgia Critic (video contains spoilers) and the Nostalgia Chick. I always suspected that Hercules was an underdog movie, but is this take on Greek mythology really a colossal fail or a heroic hit?I will give Disney credit for this - Hercules takes admirable risks in its execution, particularly in its story, visual style, and musical choices. Some of these risks pay off and bring a sense of unique charm while others don't quite pan out but aren't exactly disastrous.Doing a movie based on Greek mythology marketed to kids is a risk. For those of us who are even vaguely versed in Greek myth, we know that most of these tales are rife with sexual exploits and bloody conflicts, making them tricky to fit into a story for younger audiences. So even though mythology aficionados will no doubt be offended by Hercules, I think the writers did what they could to make the story accessible for its target audience. While not seeing the more sordid parts of Hercules' story didn't bother me, I was disappointed that nothing more was done to try to foster an appreciation of Greek culture. It slightly saddens me when movies based on ancient cultures neglect important aspects of said culture. Disney did something similar in Pocahontas and it commits the same error here. I'm baffled why Disney didn't do more to expose kids to Greek culture as opposed to filling the movie with American pop culture references with a Greek twist (such as Air Hercs rather than Air Jordans). This was a minor point with me, so I'm not going to belabor it; but it's worth noting in case you think Hercules is rife with Greek cultural references - it's quite the opposite, I'm afraid.That's not to say the movie fails. Hercules as a whole is a good, entertaining underdog hero story, something we've seen before but it's the type of tale that holds a broad appeal. In fact, fans of the various incarnations of Superman might find striking similarities here and it's of no coincidence. Most of our modern-day superheros stem from Greek, Roman, and other ancient myths. Hence, Hercules assumes the typical hero plot: he's separated from his real origins, raised by ""normal"" parents, realizes he doesn't fit in with that world, goes out to find his purpose, discovers the truth about himself, and then decides how to act on this truth. In Hercules' case, at least as far as the film is concerned (not the myth), he tries to resume his godhood by performing deeds of great service, hoping to prove that he can be, as his father Zeus asserts, a ""true hero.""Plotwise, this type of story has been done before but that doesn't mean Hercules is a total bore. It does its best to balance out moments of quiet reflection, colorful action, gentle comedy, and even romance (albeit it's insta-love). Hercules, voiced by Tate Donovan, is a likable character who tries to do the right thing but isn't perfect, which makes him likable. However, I stop short of saying he's memorable as sometimes his wide-eyed wondering and bumbling antics grew a little tiresome, at least to an adult audience. Philoctetes (Phil for short) (voiced by Danny DeVito), Hercules' trainer, serves as a comic distraction but his character actually impressed me in that he's not present just for comic relief. Phil has been hardened by life to a degree, especially by the fact that none of the supposedly heroic folks who came to him for help have amounted to much. Thus, he lumps Hercules into the same category until the young man proves him wrong. Yet the two most memorable characters for me are Hercules' eventual love interest, Megara (voiced by Susan Egan), and the chief antagonist, Hades (voiced by James Woods).At first glance, you'd assume Megara (Meg for short) is slated to become the movie's damsel in distress. While she enters the movie playing that role, it's actually more of a spoof on those types of female characters. In reality, her distress is far deeper and more complex than getting captured by a monster and yelling for help. In a deal to try to save the life of a man she loved, Meg sells her soul to Hades and, in exchange, becomes his minion. However, we learn that her attempts to try to win the heart of her man failed, so Meg has all but sworn off the foolish notion of falling in love. But as the Fates would have it, Meg falls for Hercules who treats her nobly and genuinely cares for her. I will give credit to the writers that Meg is a good balance between a wise-cracking lass and a conflicted soul as she loves Hercules but is afraid of getting her heart broken again. That's a take on a female character I don't believe had been done before in a Disney film at this point as most of the ladies, from Cinderella to Ariel, never had any qualms about wanting to be in love. But for Meg it's a risky step though she does ultimately decide whether or not to take that step, so her story isn't left in limbo.But easily the best character, and the one totally worth watching the movie for, is Hades, voiced by James Woods. While it would have been tempting to portray the dread god of the underworld as a dark, dour character, I'm glad that approach was scrapped. Instead, Hades is a fast-talking Svengali who delivers some of the movie's best lines. Make no mistake, Hades is one seriously bad dude but he's not one dimensional. He's cunning, clever, and manipulative, but combines these traits with smartly timed humor and the wheeling-dealing sensibilities of a used car salesman. I love a villain who, aside from being morally unscrupulous, possesses a unique quirk, and Hades certainly fits that bill by being a powerful baddie yet enjoys kicking up his heels and having a good laugh at someone else's expense. Not to mention he garners a handful of sympathy points as Zeus and the other gods seem to view Hades as a bit of a failure, which fuels his determination to take his brother down a few notches. All in all, this combination of a villainous mind and a playful demeanor works brilliantly. (Though one big plot hole for me has been this: if Hades is lord of the underworld, how would he not know that Hercules was still alive? My reasoning has been that Hades was so busy planning his take over that he didn't have time to worry about who was or who wasn't entering the underworld. But I'm slightly biased in Hades' favor, so that's my theory and I'm stickin' to it.)Visually, Hercules is a departure from Disney's usual 90s style as it utilizes the designs of Gerald Scarfe, who also worked on Pink Floyd's The Wall. The film makes a great use of sharp angles and curved motifs that coincide with common patterns found in Greek art. Likewise, the palette employs bright, vivid colors that, at times, generate some very gorgeous landscapes. However, often the colors came across as a bit too cartoony and didn't try to capture any sense of realism or tie into the film's general tone. By way of example, other Disney films released during the 1990s seemed to adhere to a color scheme that fit with the story: The Little Mermaid emphasized blues and aquamarines to fit its ocean-themed story; Pocahontas and The Lion King used muted, organic colors to complement the films' nature-focused feel; and Beauty and the Beast employed rich jewel toned blues, reds, and golds that worked nicely with its elegant settings. There really is no similar corresponding color scheme to Hercules other than brightness and fun, which I suppose works but I think it could have been more refined to give the film a more signature look.Olympus Hercules DisneyUnderworld Disney Hercules
This isn't to say that Hercules is an ugly or even a boring movie to look at as some of the character designs are fun, creative, and fit with the character's personalities. I also loved the visual designs of Mount Olympus and the Underworld as they sharply contrast each other and work for the personalities who reside there. Olympus (pictured left) truly is gorgeous and its usage of playful, unique geometry and jewel toned colors really work to establish this stunning home of the gods. In stark contrast, the Underworld (pictured right) is dark, gloomy, and features severe, sharp lines contained within a smooth space. This works to meld with Hades' personality as he's capable of being a smooth talker but his true nature cuts like a knife. However, when the movie's action focuses on the more mundane environments, as it does for most of the time, it tends to resemble a run-of-the-mill children's cartoon and less of a stunning piece of cinematic art.The music for Hercules is decidedly different but became a bit of a head-scratcher for me. Again, much like the bold visual designs, the music takes an unexpected direction through its use of gospel as the principal genre. While the departure from grand, sweeping musical numbers is an admirable risk, its overall execution doesn't fully pay off. For starters, most of the musical numbers (five out of nine, I believe) are sung either entirely by or accompanied by the Muses, who also serve as the narrators of the story. I sense what the film was going for was a take on the idea.",Hercules

74,theinaniloquent,"""Hero to zero!""",8,15 May 2012,"I was afraid. As you would all know, Greek mythology has been twisted and turned by loads of people. So much, in fact, their original origins are unknown, because so many ""remakes"" were made. Worse, this was a Disney production. Disney surely has some great films, but others are cringe-worthy. So what would it be? I watched the film as a class study of Greek mythology, and I'm proud to say the source material hasn't been tampered with THAT much..First things first: great animation. For a 1997 film, the landscapes were beautiful to see, and this is a person who's seen all the CGI-made films nowadays. My favorite design was the hydra, who seemed 3D-like. They did a great job visualizing the characters and their designs, almost making us forget the fact they were, in fact, animated. Second things second: the music. At first glance, you would never know this is an adventure slash musical film. I really enjoyed the gospel singers and the songs snipped in from Hercules and Meg. They were nice to hear, and the gospel singers enhanced the stories by adding a new form of narration. Third things third: the plot. This is where the film falls apart, for me, because the writers obviously try to lean towards their initial audience. They stripped away some of the Greek mythology by trying to make it a family film, but they end up stripping too much away. There was some clever jokes packed in, especially dozens of pop- culture references, but none of them made up for the fact that they took too much away. Bad things stop there. Hercules was a very fun film that doesn't take too much away from becoming a fraud. It packs in clever references to Greek mythology, packs in lush animation, and packs in a key item in animations: heart. I recommend for anybody wanting to see a film that can still be enjoyable albeit forgetting some of it's source material.8/10.",Hercules

From the characters, to the songs, the animation and just everything about this movie is good.Hercules is not accurate to Mythology, but then again how many Disney movies are accurate to their stories? One of the reasons why Hercules is good is because it doesn't try to hide violence, it doesn't try to tame the underworld, it doesn't try to be absolutely kid friendly. The monsters can be slightly goofy, but generally they are creepy. The Hydra ranks as one of the coolest monsters ever in a Disney movie, because while it is CGI, it is animated to look more like a traditionally animated monster. The underworld is exceptionally dark for a Disney movie, but it is wonderful just how much detail they put into it to make it dark.The characters are probably the main reason why this movie is so good. None of the characters are your average Disney characters. Hercules is the brave, slightly arrogant, but a bit awkward hero. Pegasus (yes I know Hercules in mythology never rode Pegasus) is a good horse character though a lot of Disney movies have horse side characters. Meg is a unique female character because unlike most Disney Princesses who are near perfect and beautiful and everything, Meg is quite the opposite. She is sarcastic, a brunette, and doesn't seem to take anything too seriously. While there are plenty of more interesting characters, Hades is a fantastic villain. While at first he seems kind of wimpy for being the Lord of the Underworld, later you start to realize just how dark and evil he can be. He seems almost like a lawyer at times in just how well he phrases things and how well he plans.Overall Hercules is a much better Disney movie than the average animated movie because it actually focuses on action, unique characters, a beautiful art style, and a good soundtrack. The art style in this movie is good because it tries to be similar to Greek art style. Again, great movie that was actually original and had great dialogue. A great movie!",Hercules
76,Indy-52,the best since Aladdin!,9,11 September 1999,"wow! This movie was really a pleasant surprise! I went to the theater expecting another below-par Disney film (like Pocahontas and Hunchback), but it turned out to be the most funny and enjoyable one since Aladdin (The Lion King was good, but there's just no contest between Timon & Pumbaa and the Genie )! And a good laugh from a Disney cartoon is just what i needed. You just must see this movie!",Hercules
77,robert-710-767167,Fantasies are harder to rate,7,13 March 2012,"I love rating movies, because I get to express my opinion on how realistic the plot was, the actors were, what emotions I felt, if anything seemed out of place or rushed, etc.However, when it comes to Disney films, it's a bit harder. It's still possible to rate, but I have to accept the world of Disney. But then you get movies like this, which are based on myths and legends, that are more difficult to rate because the plots are based on more fictional ideas and thus realism doesn't exist as much.This was a good movie. How true it is to history and legend, I don't know. But it was entertaining. Basically it's showing what a true hero is by the things they do off ""camera"" and not when they are being watched.Thus, I rate this movie 7/10.",Hercules
78,Christopher_Reid,"Hilarious, energetic, nice morals, high tier Disney",9,9 May 2021,"Hades is one of the funniest villains of all time. James Woods' performance is great - apparently he ad-libbed a lot of lines. Overall, like many Disney movies, there's a lot of energy, good songs and slapstick comedy moments. Pegasus and Hades' too little henchmen are especially funny. ""If. If is good."" But every time Hades loses his temper and his flaming hair goes red, I lose it. ""I KNOW you know. I know, I got it, I got the concept.""I really like the style of this movie. Lots of swirls and bold designs for muscles, hips and other curves. This was made during Disney's Renaissance and you can tell they're still full of new, creative ideas at this point which unfortunately started to wane in the next few years.The story is very simple but effective overall. I guess it's probably not bad as an introduction to Greek mythology although of course it takes many liberties. There is not much depth to be found here but that's kind of appropriate. It deals more in archetypes. Hercules is a hero, halfway between god and human. He has to earn his place though. The choices he makes are what define him. In that way, several parts of the movie are quite powerful. The climax is moving, even if it's a bit cliched and predictable. But it's done earnestly. Sacrificing yourself to save another is certainly profound.Hercules is not as highly regarded as Aladdin, The Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King, but it's not far off. Its strength is its visual style, primal themes about what it means to be a hero, good if not amazing songs, the energy of the animation and the hilarious characters. Meg has some of the driest, most seductive wit of any damsel in distress in any movie I've seen. She makes Hercules weak at the knees and it's easy to understand why.",Hercules
79,BoydudeReviews,"An energetic, visually amazing, animated film.",10,9 November 2018,"Ok! Not only is this my favoute Disney film ever, but it is also one of my favourite movies of all time. I rememver the day when my parents got me the VHS of this film. I was about 6, so it was around 2003 when I first saw this and I put it in the VCR and I was hooked instantly. What got my attention was the very colourful and stylistic art style if the characters and that amazing gospel soundtrack. This film soundtrack is defiantly my favoute Disney soundtrack. All the songs are catchy, fun, energetic, sweet and just hear-warming. I absolutely love all thr characters, their voice actors and their designs. Hades is one of,if not the besr disney's villans. When he gers angry, my gosh, he's angry. There is one scene where hades is so angry that certain characters annoy him and woe, it's just terryfying to watch. Even 16 years later, it still gives me goose bumps. The comedy is just so good and I crack up everythimg watching it. But it also has alot of heart. I really relate to Hercules. Not being acknowledged at the start of the film really resonates with me. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot. Just watch it for yourself. I 100% recommend this film, especially on Blu-ray aa the anination, after 21 years is still breathtaking. 😁👍🏾",Hercules
80,C22Man,No James Woods = No Good!,3,14 October 2015,"If Disney were trying to keep their successful streak going then Hercules is a truly bizarre choice in trying to prolong that. On the surface a film based on Greek mythology could be very effective and if anybody could do an interesting take on it then it was probably Disney. However, the choices made in telling the story and shaping it are just so strange that I'm not sure what they were thinking. This very much feels like they were just throwing things at the wall and seeing what happened to stick. Almost everything clashes, from the animation to the music to comedy. This is one messy film and I don't think its good points are enough to redeem it.In a similar vein to Superman, Hercules is born to the Greek God Zeus on Mount Olympus and he happens to fall to Earth when a plan by Hades to dispose of him goes wrong. Hercules later discovers who he really is and sets out to earn his place back by being a hero, all while Hades tries to find out his weakness to complete a prophecy. This story has two big issues, the fact that we've seen this all before and that it is incredibly predictable. From the very beginning you know how the plot will develop, the motions that Hercules will go through and how it will all be resolved in the end. They try to add some different touches here and there, yet none of them really work and you're left with a tried plot line.The characters are pretty much cardboard cut-outs. Hercules (Tate Donovan) is the classic naive idiot who has a heart of gold and never gives up. Sadly he comes across as annoying instead of charming and he simply isn't interesting, he's a hero that you can't really get behind. His trainer Phil is the typical grumpy teacher, never satisfied and willing to give his student a hard time. Danny DeVito is a good fit, but he isn't given anything of note to do. Megara (Susan Egan) is enjoyably feisty and seems independent at first, but that is traded in so she becomes a damsel and the attempt to give her a solid backstory feels rushed. Hades' two servants Pain and Panic are much more irritating than they are funny too.The only thing that really works here is Hades with most of that coming from James Woods and his excellent delivery style. He talks like a salesman or a lawyer would, with very fluid snappy and frequently funny dialogue. He's enjoyably different from most Disney villains, mostly because he is a lot more charismatic and fast- talking. Not to mention he has a great design. On a similar point the rest of the animation, designed by Gerald Scarfe, is not that good. It all looks a little too soft and simplistic, with a lot of bright and rather in your face colours. I will say that some of the monster designs are quite creative, but I think they could have been even more imaginative. The action scenes weren't as good as they should have been either. There are a few moments of tension that are effective, but the fights are usually dull and not very engaging.I didn't enjoy the music at all. The main type of music used was Gospel and to me it didn't fit the film whatsoever. Seeing these images with a backdrop of Gospel was just so jarring, not to mention that the songs themselves were not very catchy. The Oscar-nominated 'Go the Distance' by Michael Bolton was weak too, the lyrics were rather clichéd and again it just didn't have a good tune. The comedy really didn't work. I found the 'muses' who interrupt from time to time to be annoying and all they did was slow the story down. I didn't care for the characters so the situational comedy wasn't that funny, there were very few humorous lines and the pop culture references felt like they were forced in. Once again Hades is the only one who is consistently amusing.For me Hercules is something of a failure. It feels like they were trying to capture the tone of Aladdin, but missed the fact that that film had engaging characters and much better jokes. Almost everything about Hercules doesn't work as it should or badly clashes. Hercules himself is just such a dull lead, the support he gets is equally as dull and the story has been seen so many times that it's become too familiar. Disney are usually great with music and animation, but both are weak here. I'd have to say that James Woods' Hades is probably the only shining light and does provide the best moments. Hercules is just a confused and boring effort.",Hercules
81,jordyntsmith,"Okay, but in a good way",7,22 March 2020,"It is certainly not the strongest movie of the Disney Renaissance (or of Disney movies in general. But what it lacks in story and a main character, it makes up for with a few very good songs and one of the best Disney villains! I do recommend it for Disney and animation fans, though, it is unlikely to become your favorite animated movie.",Hercules
82,SofiaHedge,Good; it's worth a watch,8,23 May 2020,This movie is pretty interesting. I like the idea of a zero who's an outcast train to become a famous hero. This movie is overall decent. I recommend this to anyone who's willing to give this a chance.,Hercules
83,maxmages,I have never really liked this movie but can understand why other people do it.,5,17 December 2018,"This movie tries to pack a lot of stuff.
However, for a proper parody of The Hercules story, the movie is not radical enough.
For a true divine comedy, this is simply not funny enough for a new staging of Greek mythology, it deviates too much from the original story and the world.
And for a real fantasy film adaptation, he has too many pop culture references and modernity inside. All this could not be a problem if they had gone completely out of the way like the Flintstones. Or if you pack a little more excitement but all the things that really made the movie are just a short cut.The visual drawing style is just not my taste, all look like background characters from other films and although I prefer the message, is very much the representation and the danger and the fights I used here are just wrong.
I would prefer Meg to hurt herself to give Hercules his powers back. If we had really seen Hercules solve his 12 chores and fight against the monsters, if we had seen Hercules try to fight without his powers and put more emphasis on his mind and his training ect.
And if the mix between fun and danger was more balanced.I like James Woods as Hades, but wonder how he could not know if Hercules is dead, I like the reinterpretation of the gods a lot but they do not do enough to take them seriously as powerful beings, I hardly remember the passages in the they have been singing since it distracts from the story narration every time and I liked the fight against the Hydra that was all.",Hercules
84,medrjel,Possibly the only Disney animated feature I HATE,1,14 December 2002,"This movie, IMHO, is AWFUL! I have been a huge Disney animation fan. I'm a huge Jazz and R&B fan (and in fact, love all music styles). I generally like how Disney tells a story. This fails in all 3 counts. The music is either dull or totally annoying. The Animation is what I can best describe as ""experimental New wave"", and is visually annoying (Pokemon has better animation). Lastly, the story is totally destroyed. Not one real toe-tapper you could walk away from the movie singing.I have been converting all of my Disney animated videos to DVD as they have come out. All videos, but one, and I'm thinking of dumping it anyway.",Hercules
85,just_in_case,Does not hold up so well,5,12 January 2020,"This is one of the few Disney 90s era movies I dont recall ever actually watching and having now seen it I dont feel like I missed out. Its just fine. The story feels very condensed, the acting is a mixed bag and the animation feels like they cut corners. The biggest offender is the musical numbers. Some of it is dull and some of it is pain inducing. Its very by-the-numbers told in short 5 minute periods accompanied by a song. hercules childhood is told in 5 minutes ""no one likes him because hes superhumanly strong"" eehh ok. Then he finds out hes has to earn being a god so he finds a satyr played by danny devito who feels like hes phoning it in. They then go on adventures to prove hes a hero. This is where the writing falls apart because its kind of aimless and he doesnt fight anyone or anything interesting. I think the movie could have been vastly improved by him actually doing the 12 tasks etc. For each of the yadda yadda scenes they have a song but its just them descrbing what theyre doing, its very stilted. Theres no oo-de-lally or hakuna matata to make hercules memorable. The highlight of the film is Meg and Hades played by susan egan and james woods respectively. Their back and forth is entertaining and lively as snidely villain and reluctant hench woman. The rest of the movie unfortunately is ugly and forgettable. Sadly my review points went down as Im writing because everything I look back on in this film feels like yet another misfire. A real missed opportunity in this one.",Hercules
86,scarletminded,Fast forwarded through most of the songs and battles...,1,24 March 2005,"Hercules is hands down, the worst of the Disney animated films, and I have seen most of them. There is too much bad here for me to recommend it to anyone.The songs weren't very good. Hercules' main song sounds like ""Eye of the Tiger"" or worse, a South Park parody, which I am sure wasn't their intent, but it was laughable. The Muses' gospel song clashed with the whole Greek myth idea and I have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea. The animation itself seemed flat as compared to other features. Even the plot line wasn't that interesting, full of pop culture references until you burst, characters that weren't very intriguing and really the only suspense came from seeing how badly Disney could mangle Greek myth. I suppose kids are more sophisticated these days and need more adult acting cynical characters and modern culture references in order to keep their ADD in line, but I would like movies with good characters, good animation and a plot. I know it is a Disney film and it is for kids. But I remember at that age, I was reading the real Greek myths. Watching this could mess kids up when they read actual mythology. For example, Hera and Zeus were not a loving couple and Hera tried to kill Heracles with snakes not Hades. The reason? Because Hercules was born to a mortal woman and Zeus. Now, I know Disney thinks they are sly for changing Megera's name to Megara, so they could make her anything they wanted, but it comes off as confusing to anyone who knows myth. Hercules killed Megera later on in the story, but I suppose Disney can't have anything bad happen in their stories, even their fairy tales aren't so Grimm. Even giving them that, they could have done better than this. Even making something completely their own would be better than this. Why do a take on the Greek myths at all? Why not just do something modern?And the difference between features like Hercules and older ones like Snow White and Cinderella, is that the older movies have charm and you can see all the work and talent that went into them. The modern Disney fare, other than Beauty and the Beast, is produced a lot faster and the product looks rushed, without much soul. Like another reviewer, I didn't find myself excited by any of the songs in this one and I like a lot of the Disney soundtracks. It's just a dud on too many level to make it watchable except by very small children who don't know better and Disney fanatics.",Hercules
87,datautisticgamer-74853,An exciting journey from zero to hero (not to be confused with one of the most obscure Disney sequels),7,5 May 2016,"Hercules is just another Disney movie where generally the positives edge out the negatives. While plenty of moments seemed dull to me, the music was killer (as is expected from almost anything composed by the formidable team of Disney and Alan Menken), plenty of the characters are likable or sufferable, the humor is good, the action is present and stimulating, and it offers new insight to little children about Heracles himself. It is one that I re-watched before considering the challenge of watching all animated Disney movies (which got into theaters), and both times, I enjoyed the concept and execution of the story. I would most definitely say that this film is around 7.2, because there are a few dull moments and strange references that would more fit 1997 Greece than Ancient Greece (including a Scar pelt and two men who resemble John Musker and Ron Clements, who directed this film). See it if you covet the trio of Musker, Clements and Menken, because they can make some excellent stuff (including The Little Mermaid, from what I've heard, and Aladdin).",Hercules

89,drew_atreides,Very underrated Disney entry.,8,6 January 2013,"So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured ""eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it.""My daughter had worn the DVDs for ""SLEEPING BEAUTY"" and ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves ""HERCULES""! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all.I also have to say that ""I won't say I'm in Love"" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again.Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!",Hercules
90,smashattack,Despite the flaws...,7,19 May 2002,"Hercules is a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.  It has some groundbreaking animation (for its time), absolutely lovable characters, hilarious tie-ins with other movies, and great hidden meanings and wisecracks.First of all, I would like to say that Pegasus is a rare character, one of the best ever designed by Disney.  He is such a unique, funny, and playful character that one almost wishes he is real.  He truly brings the movie to life, for without him it would have been pretty dull.The animation I mentioned was the lighting effects.  This, I believe, was one of Disney's first true accomplishments in lighting effects, especially with the characters.  They can have normal, somewhat bright faces of a mortal, the shining aura of light that represents a god, and the pale skin of death.The characters are what one will remember after seeing this movie.  It is too hard to dislike the villain (""I must have gotten some brimstone in my ear""), his cronies Pain and Panic perform great comic antics (""Yeah, get the goods, sister!""), Pegasus has a mind of his own, Meg is sarcastically funny, and Phil is a little overbearing and too serious at times.  The whole group makes the movie.The tie-ins I mentioned are very small things.  Like, for instance, Phil has an uncanny resemblance of Aladdin's Genie.  Look at his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.  And when Hercules is posing for the vase painter, guess whose skin he's wearing.  It's a lion, with a Scar above the eye... (He'd make a very handsome throw rug)If you watch closely, you can see some really funny stuff happening to the characters while they're talking or doing other things.  For instance, Meg and Hercules are falling in love and Meg steps back, only to be poked in the back by a statue of Cupid.  There are lots of these things that happen in the movie... just little, nearly hidden jokes that are hilarious if you find them.The action is great, and the plot is well thought out.  There are some flaws with this movie, however, and some big mistakes.  I think the Muses are the biggest mistake.  Not only are the songs on this movie low for even Disney standards (besides ""I Can Go The Distance""), one will wish the Muses were shot before they could continue singing because their songs are the ABSOLUTE WORST!  And there are some goofs, such as Hercules puts his hands into the river of death one minute, then the next he has to dive down fifteen feet to reach it.  Just little things like that.  They don't really hurt the movie.This is a great movie.  If one overlooks the flaws, it is one of Disney's best, nearly getting as high as maybe The Emperor's New Groove or Aladdin. Watch it if you get the chance.",Hercules
91,Lily_hoho,No miss,8,1 May 2020,"The animation of that year missed how many years ah, now just watch carefully, universal pictures also introduced, I like the Greek mythology of the film and animation, unfortunately this series can not continue!",Hercules
92,stebird,"Herc is our hero, oh yeah he is!",10,16 August 2017,"Part of my later childhood and I'll never forget Disney's Hercules, I also liked the video game of Hercules, used to play it on the original PlayStation.Disney took a well known Ancient Greek tale and made it their own, Hercules never looked better than he does here in animation; the colour of the whole film is vibrant, striking and oh so pleasing..., perfect for kids and probably a secret pleasure for some adults too hehe! Tate Donovan isn't exactly the most well-known film star out there, but he does a marvellous job of voicing the titular hero, he brings an innocent, childlike quality to the Greek warrior, making him more realistic and relatable compared to other portrayals of the same character.Susan Egan has a wonderfully sweet voice making the character Meg seem vulnerable and generating an awful lot of empathy towards her, she is the ultimate damsel in distress and you just now she's going to end up with big Herc at the end of the film (well of course, durr...) James Woods, an acclaimed actor toned it down considerably for his portrayal of Hades, the God of the underworld and the film's antagonist, it's probably the most camp and least threatening version of the character ever, oh but again perfect for kids!My favourite though has to be Phil, voiced by the legendary Danny DeVito..., the little guy is like Herc's mentor, his guardian angel if you will, he provides a lot of comedy relief and elevates his portions of the film considerably. Hercules contains a brilliant musical score, typical of Disney films, evoking the correct emotions and tying into the action appropriately, Herc is a hero is the defining song and sheds a perfect amount of light on the Hercules character. The film was released during the period when Pixar was beginning to find its feet, Toy Story was released two years prior and A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2 released in the coming years, with classic animation in less of a demand and computer imagery starting to take over, Hercules did well to succeed and garner the critically great reception it did. Disney always knows what it's doing and you can always count on them, and Hercules is no different, a lovely film albeit tame and you shouldn't let it slip through your fingers.",Hercules
93,Cylex,"""Two words. I am retired!"" Phil steals the movie,not Hades.",5,27 July 2002,Phil is one of my favourite Disney characters and Danny is one of my favourite actors. He is a true friend to Hercules and deserves to have his dream come true. His irascibility conceals a kind heart but most of the time Herc deserves to be yelled at. Herc was cute as a baby and likeable as a teenager but dumb and arrogant after he got muscular. What's worse he fell in love with a really obnoxious woman. Phil and Peg treated her like she deserved until the unsatisfactory ending. (Apart from Phil's dream.) I hated Hades too and the rest of the gods. Hades got irritating lines and the other gods were made out to be good when in greek mythology they're vengeful and promiscuous. But enough has been said in previous comments. The only songs I liked were Go the Distance and One Last Hope. The Muses grated a little. Pain and Panic were the usual dumb henchmen. (Why don't villains employ anyone capable?) I liked Panic best. It's Hades who's annoying. And as for that woman! So as far as I'm concerned the true hero is Phil. 5/10,Hercules
94,joncheskin,Ultimately Confusing,5,25 February 2015,"Disney's Hercules is a curious movie that seeks to entertain but instead managed to provoke a lot of questions. I watched the movie on Netflix one night with my 6 and 12 year old sons, and got a reaction that was pretty typical for them with Disney movies--my 6 year old was scared of the violence and had to leave, and my 12 year old thought it was moderately entertaining. I was intrigued because the movie has gotten a lot of bad press for butchering the myths, but I got to wondering whether this had any effect on how you would judge the movie. Based on a lot of the online reviews I read, the answer seemed to be ""no"", but enough people were offended that it got me thinking. What is the real effect of this infidelity on how we should judge the movie?In the end, I concluded that the lack of faithfulness to the myths is a serious problem, but not for the reasons that everyone is raising. Most of the objectors are doing so out of a love of the myths--they appreciate the original stories, and believe Disney has no right to mess with them. On the other hand, I think the problem is more subtle. The fact is that Disney movies generally follow a formula, are targeted at a specific age, and perform a sort of cultural work that is very consistent. Specifically, they are made for late elementary or middle-schoolers (note that my 6-year-old was afraid) and they basically are designed to instruct the age in certain moral lessons that are necessary for a child's development. The lessons are generally the power of love, friendship, self-sacrifice, hard work, etc.Now, the problem with Disney's Hercules is not that it does not do this effectively; in fact, it has the usual menu of good animation, good songs, morally aligned characters, etc. The problem is that the original myth is actually rather potent in our culture, and a kids' movie based on Hercules is simply disconcerting. The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.",Hercules
95,AnnieLola,One person's myth is another person's miracle...,8,15 September 2021,"In the grand Disney tradition of making free with literature and history to create an irresistibly entertaining movie experience, we have the lively ""Hercules"". Rendering the Olympian pantheon in rainbow hues is certain to please children, where austere white draperies and beige complexions have long been the norm onscreen. The whole is set in modern terms easily absorbed by the contemporary American audience-- it's fun!One hopes that the younger set might be inspired to investigate the real mythology as recorded, and not assume they'd been adequately instructed in the subject by this highly revised version. Of course 'real' is relative, since any mythology deals with miraculous events that are not supported by the historic record. A good deal of Judeo-Christian biblical text falls under this designation; it must be taken on faith. But Judeo-Christian scriptures belong to active religions, and thus the events described are literally sacred. The religion of the ancient Greeks cannot be described as active, and thus is fair game for irreverent revisions that will offend very few beside Hellenist scholars.Animated and live-action films that illustrate current religions, however, must adhere to tradition. Only look at the wealth of Hindu devotional films, visualized scriptures that provide ample evidence of the present-day believer's faith in the miraculous. Animated versions make these treasured tales of the gods more accessible to children. This is a living religion, with about a billion followers worldwide, and the third largest faith today.But a 'dead' religion has virtually no one to protect its integrity, and so its miracles become myths, and its myths become infinitely flexible.I suppose it's best for the tender sensibilities of children to present Zeus as a nice monogamous papa-god, whose only son was borne by his wife Hera. Later on his many outrageous infidelities, committed in various interesting disguises, can be revealed. They're certainly entertaining! And so is the Disney ""Hercules"".",Hercules
96,bblack1-699-968577,"Thank You, James Woods!",2,16 June 2014,"Here is another Clements/Musker movie, and...I don't like this. When I first saw this last year, I felt completely underwhelmed. This isn't one of those films I scratch my head at, trying to figure out why people like it; but for me, this is a stupid film.ANIMATION: This is the first Disney film I do not have an appreciation for the animation. The design is way too weird. It doesn't look like a Walt Disney Animation Studios film, it looks like a Disney TV show. The only design I enjoy if Hades. He looks awesome. The shot of him glowing when he shakes Hercules' hand is amazing - I want that framed! Everything else is either bland or awkward and weird.SONGS/MUSIC: Movie...what did you do to Menken? These songs are terrible! Being that I grew up on the style of music of the songs and I love it, you'd think I'd enjoy these songs. But no, I don't! These songs are some of the most bland and forgettable songs I've ever heard! I watched the beginning of this film twice within 30 minutes, and I totally forgot the ""Gospel Truth"" number! Do you know how bland a song has to be for you to, not only forget it after you saw it once, but to forget it after it repeats itself twice in the first 10 minutes of the film?!? The only song I remember from this film is ""Zero to Hero,"" and that's only because of the ""Hercules"" preview I would see on the Disney videocassettes we watched growing up! These are bad songs!ROMANCE: I don't care about the romance. I don't remember the romance. It doesn't draw me at all.CHARACTERS: Again, most of these characters are just bland and forgettable. I'm not drawn to them, I don't care about them, and they're annoying. Give this movie some credit, though, it has the most annoying characters ever known to Disney: Pain and Panic. GOOD GRIEF, I can't stand them!! Their actions, their characters, their VOICES?!?! MAN!!! The only good character in this film is Hades, voiced by James Woods! He is very entertaining! I was hoping he'd win in the movie. His character, his mannerism, and his character are all wonderful! I just found out James Woods ad-libbed a lot in the recording session. He brought the only good moment in this movie! Thank you, James Woods!STORY: Again, it's bland and forgettable. I don't remember that much. Nothing really matters to me. I'm sorry, but nothing here grabs me in the least. It's boring, it's stupid, and I don't learn that much about Greek mythology. Give ""Pocahontas"" some credit, at least we learned a little about American history. The only thing I learn about Greek myth here is the names of the gods. I don't learn anything else.CONCLUSION: Aside from James Woods as Hades, this movie left me nothing but frustration. This is one of my least favorite Disney movies. Again, if you like it, there's nothing wrong with that. It's cool. Me, however, I would definitely give this film a pass. Check it out and judge for yourselves. BOOYIKA!",Hercules

98,csagne,"Among the best ""classical"" Disney",7,18 September 2007,"A few years before the computer days, Disney sang the swan's song with Hercules. Although loosely based on Greek mythology (in which Hercules is Zeus' illegitimate son with a human, which obviously had to be surgically removed), and while the story of Hercules 12 Tasks is far from respected, the Disney studios managed to deliver a funny and entertaining adaptation of the myth.Most importantly, songs and musical bits are really good, especially the opening sequence with Charlton Heston's voice and the muses, the duet Meg / the muses and guess what ""Zero to Hero"" sung by... the muses.What I also liked very much are the second level humour (spot the spice girls if you can), such as ""Air-cules"" ads and references to Greek myths in general.This double-level reading makes it a nice and entertaining cartoon for kids and grown-ups. Even more enjoyable now these paper and celluloid days are over.",Hercules
99,StartingAllOver14,Hercules - quirkyles,7,1 August 2007,"I shall confess that I was disappointed when I saw ""Hercules"" first time, maybe because of the expectations, especially when it was made from the creators of ""Aladdin"". Disney had shown progression with their previous films (of the 90's) and ""Hercules"" felt rather as a throwback, a really lame one. I didn't find the film magic and engaging enough and it had some darker visual moments, while the emotional moments were too sentimental. So, ""Hercules"" was on my blacklist for a long time.After nine months I got the movie from my aunt and seeing it again I were ashamed on my self for don't liking this movie. So, in other words, you must see ""Hercules"" several times before it can really be enjoyed.""Hercules"" is one of Disney's more quirky movies and there's a huge probability that kids won't understand the irony and the parody that's going on. Although the film is funny, it's like it's tries too hard to be hilarious all the time, so it feels rather importunate at times.Which is something to make ""Hercules"" unstable as an whole. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this film several years later, but it's not on my top list. It has some great moments, but the film itself wants to go many directions; being funny, emotional, exciting, etc. But comparing to previous Disney films, this mix doesn't goes well as a whole on this film. The unstableness also transmits some of the characters: Meg is an untypical Disney heroine and quite sarcastic, but at least she goes true a struggle that is identifiable and grows as a character. The same with our hero Hercules, but I didn't really connect with him emotionally. I liked him better when he was younger, though.You can easy tell that's the directors John Musker and Ron Clements put their hands of the script, cause it has the same structure than their previous scripts (""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin""). It's not necessarily a bad thing, but you know what to expect, right?OK, enough nonsense. It seems like I still hate this movie, which I don't. My favorite characters are Zeus (who looks like King Triton in ""The Little Mermaid""), Hades, the Muses, Hermes, Phil and Pegasus. I used to think that Pain and Panic were annoying, but not anymore.Liked mentioned before, the film is funny. The animation is most of the time good looking (even it's look kinda quirky too because of the Greek influence and Gerald Scarfe style). I liked the songs performed by the Muses (the lyrics are funny) and ""Go The Distance"", which I actually hated at the beginning, but now I find it a decent song. Alan Menken's score is more quirkier and unstable than his usual score, but when he hits you with the score, he hits you really deep and wonderfully.Despite it's quirkiness, there's a lot to enjoy with ""Hercules""",Hercules
100,andrewtisler,"Zany animation, scene-stealing characters, and catchy songs help ""Hercules"" become one of Disney's most fun animated features of all-time",10,24 September 2021,"From Walt Disney Animation Studios and directors Ron Clements and John Musker, creators of ""The Great Mouse Detective"", ""The Little Mermaid"", and ""Aladdin"", comes ""Hercules"", their newest animated feature, full of pop culture gags, colorful animation, scene-stealing characters, wacky humor, and catchy songs. This is honestly one of Disney's funniest animated movies in history.The story is about Hercules, the son of Zeus, as he attempts to reclaim his right as a god on Mount Olympus. During his journey, he becomes the student to a satyr named Phil, who has trained a lot of people like him, each one a disappointment. He manages to succeed in training Hercules to become a true hero, turning him into the man he always wanted to be. Along the way with the training, Hercules falls in love with a woman named Megara, who is working under the orders of Herc's evil uncle Hades, who plots to take over Mt. Olympus. The story is fast-paced and full of pop culture gags, but the story also has plenty of honest emotion, steady build-up, and great, wacky humor.Hercules is the son of Zeus, now a demigod after the evil Hades stripped him of his immortality. His journey can be the equivalent to young students trying to figure out their purpose in life, and are going through a series of steps to get to the top of their future. Phil is the grumpy, short, and wisecracking satyr mentor to Herc, who has trained a lot of people like him, each one a failure. Meg is Herc's love interest, a woman under the orders of Hades, who falls for Herc after he saves her life from an evil centaur. Hades is Hercules' evil uncle, who wants to destroy Mt. Olympus and talks like a car salesman. Pain and Panic are his dimwitted henchmen, whom he relies on frequently to help him with his plans. Zeus is Hercules' father who rules Olympus, and who sees the true hero in Hercules regardless of if he has his immortality or not.The animation of this movie is very well-done. It's got that old-fashioned Saturday morning cartoon vibe, but with a touch of Disney magic heavily inspired by Greek paintings, sculptures, and architecture. The colors are breathing with life in this picture.The soundtrack is also full of really catchy songs. Each one is as catchy as the last. This might be one of composer Alan Menken's most hilarious soundtracks ever written.Overall, ""Hercules"" is a fun, fast-paced animated feature made by Disney, and one of their most hilarious features to date. Highly recommend!",Hercules
101,pmcollectorboy,More cookie cutter than should be legally possible,5,26 September 2000,"Sometimes modern Disney and I don't get along. They're too musical, too hokey, and more often than not have cookie cutter formulas. Despite all this, many modern Disney movies are still quite good and have strong stories. Hercules is something different. While the characters are no more worse than usual, the story is Disney's most shallow and unsatisfying yet. It is occasionally funny, and it tries to be a comedy like Aladdin. Aladdin, however, was inspired, had a refreshing story, and was a technical marvel. Hercules just comes off as being no more than an extended Saturday morning cartoon. If all you want is comedy, by all means watch this and laugh your head off. But if you want comedy with a little something extra, there are other Disney movies out there that are better.",Hercules
102,chrisbishop5000,"Creative, action-packed, great colours and a pointless mission!",8,6 October 2007,"I believe that more people dislike this than those who do like it. Although HERCULES cannot stand against the previous Disney smash hits I see nothing wrong with it at all.The animation is still as good as the recent Disney hits and I think you'll find that the songs are memorable. A lot of thought went into all the gods, all the centaurs and all the mortals. It's full of heart-stopping action and adventure though I wouldn't recommend it for children aged 9 and under due to moderate gory violence, death images, peril and mild language. Certificate U seems wrong - either a PG or a 12+ would've been better. Hercules, a handsome, super-strong young man, learns that he was once a god and he dreams of having his life as a god restored. Though first he must fight off baddies such as big, tough centaurs, the dangerous Hydra (despite my 17 and three quarter years, he still absolutely petrifies me), the titans who were imprisoned for years, this movie's villain Hades and his henchmen Pain and Panic and even the girl he loves Meg, a devious young lady who has been forced for a long time to work for Hades, Hercules's enemy and, with this woman, it looks as if Herc's VERY hot-tempered trainer Phil has got a rival. Herc doesn't have to love just Him alone! He can love Meg if he wants to (even though he'll regret it) so as well as fighting off those villains he's caught in the centre of rivalry. Yet, after all this, when his dream of being a god again comes true, he makes a quick decision to stay on earth as a Mortal! WHAT?! After all he went through down on earth! What ""on earth"" (get it?) was the point of completing all that work, winning all those battles?! What was the point of him worrying about returning to Mount Olympus? Is he completely out of his BOX?!",Hercules
103,RoamingTigress,Wonder Boy!,10,30 May 2010,"This is another movie I went in with moderate expectations; expecting every day entertainment, but nothing more than that.I was wrong. So wrong.When I saw Hercules , I was taken aback by the animation style. It was so much different than the styles I was used to in Pocahontas, Lion King and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Subsequently, my family and I didn't give Hercules a go on our yearly Disney movie viewings.Today I decided to watch Hercules, and I was pleasantly surprised. The animation style really worked for this movie and I ended up really enjoying the Mowtown-esquire nature of the songs. Pay attention to the lion's skin that Herc is wearing while posting for a painting on a vase -- that's Lion King's Scar! All the characters were truly endearing, even Hades who was one of the most entertaining villains I have seen brought out by Disney. In many ways he reminds me of another favourite villain from the studio; Darkwing Duck's Steelbeak with his suave personality that can errupt into anger.Hands down, another personal favourite that I would recommend anyone to watch.",Hercules
104,Seller7862,One of Disney's best,10,8 June 2009,"Walt himself said: ""I believe the best learning happens when something is presented in an entertaining way."" Walt was right of course, and Hercules teaches a little while it entertains a lot. The opening gives kids a window into ancient Greece and it's fables designed to impart lessons to the masses.The movie itself has some A-list entertainers and is fun and well written. Obviously it's aimed at kids, but the grown-ups will find plenty of laughs and lots of tender smiles. The thing that has always captured the publics imagination regarding Disney classics is the power of the heart and the struggle between good and bad (or righteousness and evil in this case). I won't be redundant and share the plot with you. Quite frankly if you don't know the story of Hercules this movie is a pleasant primer. Maybe it will inspire you to go to the library and learn more about Hercules and Greek Tragedies in general. The Tragedies predate many spiritual works and probably provided much of the motivation for theological and philosophical works to follow.Just sit back with your kids or someone you luv and enjoy 90 plus minutes of light hearted fun with a timeless message. It's better than anything on TV or cable if you need a justification, but you wont.",Hercules
105,aizbennett,One hell of a good time,8,4 March 2021,"Hercules is just a great time inside and out. The songs are all awesome and the characters are all hilarious (everyone can dish out the shadiest burns like it's nobody's business). The CG used for the Hydra is extremely dated and the animation in general isn't on par with other movies around the same time, but the characters more than make up for it. It also explores the theme of self-identity, which is always important for kids to learn. It's not the most thought-provoking movie that Disney has made, but it doesn't need to be. It's thing is a hilarious and sweet coming-of-age story featuring greek gods and Danny Devito. It does it's thing and does it amazingly.",Hercules
106,whatever_123,Tons of fun!!,9,8 January 2010,"I had the privilege of watching this movie just a few hours ago, and I really wanted to watch it again!! This yet another great Disney which hasn't received as much recognition as it should have.I'm not a mythology fan; reading Greek mythology in school makes me gag. Disney's representation of the myths and gods was, while cartoony, highly entertaining. I liked the characters a lot. Hercules and Meg made an adorable couple and their chemistry was definitely there. Phil was funny and a really nice guy. Zeus was portrayed as a kind, fatherly character, though in mythology they make him sound like a bad-tempered jerk. Hades was entertaining, and one of my favorite Disney villains along with Maleficent and Shan-Yu. I loved the effect of him bursting into flames when he was angry. I also laughed at his two brainless minions, Pain and Panic. The animation was slightly cartoony, but at the same time it was incredible and it in a way individualized the movie. The landscapes, Mount Olympus, and the Underworld were truly breath-taking. What particularly wowed me was the Underworld. I looked a lot like what I imagine the Underworld to look like, with it's towering, spiky stalactites and stalagmites, greenish smoke, and terrifying pit of dead souls swirling around endlessly. A chilling yet detailed masterpiece. In addition, I noticed in the scene when Hercules fights the Hydra, it was animated in an almost 3D style. It looked really cool!This movie has a whole lot of action in it, possibly more than any other Disney movie. I loved to watching Hercules battle the Hydra, or the Titans try to take over Mount Olympus, or Hades send out horrible monsters to defeat Hercules. Every moment is a thrill!The music is very interesting. The five or six girls who sing all throughout the movie sing in a weird gospel style, which is an interesting choice of theme for this particular movie. I don't have a problem with it though, I thought it was creative. I also enjoyed Hercules' song about ""going the distance"" and finding where he really belongs in the world. I found it quite inspiring. Hercules is a great movie. Mythology fan or not, this movie will entertain you and help you discover what a true hero really is. Watch it! You will enjoy it.",Hercules
107,theblackscythe,A weird and highly mixed Disney film.,5,18 August 2014,"In light of the two recent Hercules films, I have decided to revisit this little Klein bottle of confusion. I have always been baffled by this film, and I feel the need to talk about it here.For a start, the animation (a microcosm for the entire film) is highly mixed, and confusing. The art direction was headed by Gerald Scarfe.... why was he chosen? He is known for his surrealist, political satirical work. Greek legend and Disney animation do not come to mind when he is mentioned. As such, the art design of the film (whilst creative and unique) feels very confused, baring little resemblance to the iconic imagery of ancient Greece. The only real exception to this is in the landscapes, and the underworld, these both look very pretty and, in the case of the underworld, interestingly surreal. Overall, whilst colourful and distinct, the animation seems out of place and it mostly falls flat.The voice cast is mostly forgettable and range between average to slightly sub-par . The only real exceptions are James Woods and Danny DeVito, both of whom are highly entertaining and get the best lines. They also voice the most interesting characters, Hades and Phil, in a similar sea of mediocrity. Hades, whilst hardly a standout classic, is a strong villain, both in terms of design and humour. Phil is a likable mentor, who actually has a more entertaining ac than the hero (a bad sign). These glimmers of hope a few in the dim void of the other characters, I truly cannot stress how little impact the other ""characters"" leave.The music......is probably the most forgettable in Disney's history. The plot is weird and jumbled, the pacing is broken. It sometimes skips large pieces (for example the majority of Herc's training) and is often rather slow (the intro is shockingly lengthy). This adds to the choppiness of the whole film.Overall, it's surprising that the illustrious studio made something this....amateurish. It isn't bad per-se, as the good elements are entertaining enough, however I wouldn't really recommend it either. It's a mixed bag.",Hercules

111,moviecritichank-7,A Familiar Greek Hero Gets a Hilarious 90's Twist from Disney,10,19 April 2016,"Hercules is a 1997 animated feature film and the 35th full-length animated feature in the Walt Disney Animation Studios Canon. The film stars James Woods, Charlton Heston, Danny Devito, Tate Donovan, Rip Torn, Matt Frewer, and Bobcat Goldthwait. Loosely adapted from the Grecian legend Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene and great-grandson/half-brother of Perseus, this incarnation of the Greek hero is given a hip, modern-day, 90s Disney vibe to it! The plot of the film starts on Mount Olympus, where all of the legendary Greek gods live. Hercules (voiced by Joshua Keaton/Tate Donovan), the son of Zeus and Herra, is born possessing god-like strength as a young toddler. In fact, he is so strong that when Hades (voiced by James Woods from ""Any Given Sunday""), lord of the Underworld visits Olympus bearing a gift, he gets his finger crushed by Hercules. This infuriates Hades so much that he, along with his hilarious and loyal henchmen Pain and Panic (voiced by stand-up comic Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer from ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids""), devise a plan to kill the immortal Hercules by turning him into a mortal human being after Hades gets insight from three bizarre and grotesque characters known as the Fates who can reveal the past, present, and future that Hercules could prove to be a threat to Hades taking over Mount Olympus in the future. While they were successful in turning him mortal, they didn't kill him as Hades wanted so as he was planning his uprising, Hercules lived his life on earth after being rescued and taken in by two humans, where he would grow up. After various circumstances caused Hercules to realize that he was different than everyone he was around, he, along with his trusty friend and sidekick since birth Pegasus, seek out Zeus, who then tells him to find Phil (voiced by Danny Devito from ""Batman Returns""), the trainer of a lot of ""would-be"" heroes so he can prove himself to be a true hero and rejoin Zeus on Olympus. Once he does this, he then goes out to prove to Zeus and everyone else that he has what it takes to become a true hero. Along the way, he meets the snarky, sarcastic, and free-spirited Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), who goes on to become Hercules' eventual love interest and will later cause our hero to have to make a critical decision and prove that a ""true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart."" From the opening narration by the legendary Charlton Heston to the rapid fire comedy delivered by James Woods' portrayal of Hades to the gospel-like numbers written by Academy-Award Winning Composer Alan Menken (""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"") and David Zippel and sung by the Muses, this movie is a worthy addition to the Disney Renaissance and a more light-hearted themed departure from the dark and grim themes seen in The Hunchback of Notre Dame the previous year. I honestly don't see why this movie gets so much flack for being the weakest film of the Disney Renaissance when personally I think that Pocahontas was the weakest film of the Disney Renaissance because of the lack of a strong story and strong antagonist (which are two things that Hercules has). The characters are great (my favorite is Hades) and the animation, story, and music done in a way that can only be done in the grand tradition and innovation of Walt Disney. If you haven't seen this movie and you're looking for a good movie to watch for family movie night, go to your local movie store or Netflix and watch it! You won't be disappointed! This was released during Disney's most profitable era to date and I still pop this in the VCR every once in a while! My rating: Two thumbs way, way up!!! 10/10!!!",Hercules

It really teaches people that they need control and guidance and to learn how to be patient. Because if you do then good things will happen. Later on in this movie he meets a girls named Meg. He rescues this girl from a monster or so he thinks. Later on in the movie it is revealed that Meg sold her soul and now works for the Greek god of the underworld ""Hades.""

117,avsroxbronxfan,"Could've been one of Disney's best, but ends up problematic",5,1 February 2013,"I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic.First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as ""The Muses"". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. ""Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!"" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic.I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here.This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the ""Zero to Hero"" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like ""Herculade"" and ""Air-Herc"". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the ""Friend Like Me"" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't.But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny.Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.",Hercules
118,oscarhopkins,Clash of the Cartoons,8,2 October 2005,"There's very little you can do to influence Disney artists. Or Disney fans. They're always going to harp on horrid failures that they praise as innovations (Hunchback, Pocohontas, Mulan). And they will never admit that the light-hearted, comedic Hercules was the big step in Disney's revolution concerning style and storyboarding in the past twenty years.Big deal; it's true.Herc was the first time Disney decided to run on fast, colorful frenzy and coy shots at the material instead of cutesy sidekicks alone for comedy. A direct predecessor to Emporor's New Groove? You better believe it.With a ""grecian"" style and a gospel swing, this film comes on strong with guns blazing and hardly stops for air. A little strong is the Oscar-winning song, ""Go the Distance,"" but I guess Micheal Bolton was flavor of the week then. What can't be ignored is how repeatedly watchable this film is, and that's important with kiddie fare, since parents must endure multiple viewings.This film does butcher its subject matter in a way nothing short of savage, it's true. No myth remains intact as the storyboard scrambles to include every monster ancient Greece had to offer, and it's sad to see Medusa, the minotaur and other greats fly by without so much as a by-line.Still in all, the mainstay of the film is the wry humor, and some very fun wordplay. If you want the myths straight, never go to Hollywood; even Harryhausen (otherwise known as The Man) cut-and-pasted mythology to suit his films.If there are spots where Herc lacks polish it's probably because the artists were rushing to finish it and work on Mulan, which is unthinkable when you see the products. Still that's the word I get directly from a former member of Disney. I met him in 2001, when he was working for dreamworks on ""Ice Age."" He explained that Disney artists were awed by the ""deep, original ideas in Mulan,"" and considered Herc ""just another cartoon."" Well, what can you say? He was all excited about ""Ice Age"" too.",Hercules

122,Primate84,"Not Disney's best, but still a wonderful film.",8,4 November 2005,"Although it's not as good as ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I'd say ""Hercules"" is still an excellent film, probably the last great Disney film that didn't involve Pixar. I'm just sorry I didn't see it while it was in theaters. There's so much to love about this movie, I don't know where to begin. OK, first, the story. The writers did a great job with Hercules. Most of the past movies about Hercules made him a macho, invincible brute, but Disney's ""Hercules"" actually injects some soul into the character, and makes him a very deep, rather insecure, unlikely hero. The story of his quest to become a true hero is really moving and well- done. Next, I'll certainly need to discuss the equally great supporting characters. Danny DeVito is funny and likable as the grumpy Phil. Megara, played excellently by Susan Egan, is a very good female lead. She could have easily been just a flaky love interest for Hercules, but instead, they made her a strong, independent character. However, the character who really steals the show has to be Hades. He is one of the best Disney villains I've ever seen. He is unmistakeably evil, yet rather calm about it (Other than the few occasions when he loses his temper), and also very funny. The character design for him was quite well- done (Though my mom said he reminded her too much of Ursula from ""The Little Mermaid""), and James Woods is incredible at doing his voice, going from calm to menacing to completely enraged effortlessly. Next, I must talk about the songs. I loved all of the songs in it. The Muses add a sweet, Gospel feel to their songs, and my favorite song, ""Go the Distance,"" is really beautiful. It should have won an Oscar. My favorite scene in the film would probably be when Hercules fights the Hydra. The computer animation for the Hydra works very well, it looks great. The fight itself is really exciting, too. Please, go see ""Hercules."" You won't be sorry that you did.",Hercules
123,discoroux,Odysseus must be rolling in his grave.,1,20 October 2001,"This was not exactly the best movie ever made. It is a complete insult to the people of ancient Greece. It is very insulting to Christianize Greek mythology, and if you don't know what I mean, think about why gospel singers constantly appear throught the film & why Hercules & Meg appear in Disney Christmas ads. Yes, Greek mythology isn't greatly practiced anymore, but Disney should still show a little respect.",Hercules
124,tiyusufaly,"Below Musker and Clements standards, but still one of Disney's best.",10,10 April 2003,"Ah, Ron Clements and John Musker...Their 1989 flick The Little Mermaid saved Disney's motion picture franchise, and it was no surprise: the film boasted delightful characters, a feel-good story, gorgeous art, catchy tunes, and a heart to shame everything Disney had done since 1967. Surely they couldn't top Mermaid, could they? Wrong, they could! And they did, in 1992, with Aladdin, a film that I still consider the greatest, most perfect motion picture ever created, animated or otherwise.
Musker's and Clements' next film for Disney didn't come till five years later, when they put a spin on Greek Mythology with this film, Hercules. While Hercules doesn't quite measure up to The Little Mermaid, and certainly won't challenge Aladdin, it is still my favorite of the modern Disney films save Aladdin, Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.The film is one of the funniest and most energetic that Disney has ever done. Phil is a riot, but the real showstopper is Hades, who ranks as one of my top 5 Disney villains in history. There are gags, wisecracks, and all sorts of comical scenes. Arguably the cleverest script of Disney.The story isn't the hottest of modern Disney, but that's okay because it's merely an excuse to put together one gigantic laughfest after another.The music isn't too shabby. I like the score and the songs (especially The Gospel Truth) are catchy enough. It deserves more respect than what it's getting.Unfortunately, since the film is on a caffiene spurge the first 2/3rds of the film, the character development that made Mermaid, Beauty, and Aladdin outstanding films is severely hindered. You really don't know too much about the personalities of the characters. Nevertheless, the characters are great fun.Certainly not Disney's best, but definitely one of the best and maybe the most entertaining.10/10",Hercules
125,omeralaa,A classic Disney animaited movie,8,28 July 2020,"If there's a recipe of how to make a great animation movie that adults and kids can have fun from it, Hercules would be one of the best representative for this recipe.
It's a really good movie and everyone can enjoy it.For me the main theme of the movie was finding home, as the movie journey was how to back home after he cursed living with the people.
Also there's a lot of sub themes like (Good vs. Evil) and our villain was great and he was a terrifying villain unlike the villains of other Disney movies such as (Frozen,Beauty and the beast,Zootopia) as their villains were not a big threat for our main character.
And of course there was the theme of love.I got the superhero movies vibes in the second act as Hercules is a kind of a superhero.",Hercules
126,myrddyn,"Thin acting, inconsistent plot, good animation",5,24 May 1999,"The animation is up to full Disney standards, but the writers and director need to be upbraided for not following through.  The plot departs critically from Greek legend in most respects, but assumes that the viewer knows the legend in enough detail to recognize the Seven Labours.  The music and the one-liners were excellent, but they merely made the flick worth watching -- they couldn't make up for the criminal lack of central action.  James Woods did an excellent job as Hades, and Danny DeVito did credit to Phil, but the other voices needed more motivation from the director.  Hercules came off as a clone of Aladdin between scenes.When a writer violates The World As We Know It (real or legendary), the audience has reason to expect proper remuneration for our suspension of belief.  This is true with Science Fiction, superheroes, or slapstick.  In this coin, ""Hercules"" returns about ten cents on the dollar.  There is rarely later justification for most of the changes.  The Fates, for instance, could have been left complex and ominous instead of a frivolous interjection.Finally, I was personally and generally offended by the rotten parent-child development in the movie.  A ""family movie"" shouldn't show such frivolous disregard for any sort of family stability.  I can hear someone crying ""But we're dealing with Greek Gods here, by Jupiter!"".  No, we aren't: Herc's biological parents are shown as a stable couple in Olympus.  Once Herc discovers he's not a regular mortal, he drops his adoptive parents out of the movie (except for a walk-on appearance in the final scene), and goes ladder-climbing after the parents who give him little to no guidance.  I am a Disney fan, a step-child, and an adoptive parent myself -- and I was offended by the lack of treatment in the name of entertaining my kids.",Hercules
127,askewglasses,Disney's try at Weightlifting,9,23 August 2012,"Now looking back I believe this is the Disney movie I had watched the most when I was younger. And to be honest I still really like it. It takes an angle to the character which is new but also the same. He is treated like a superhero which is where superhero origins tend to get inspiration from. But it got down one of the parts of superhero's often ignored, that heroes are no longer just heroes but they are icons. With taking the superhero angle to Hercules it goes with it great. Next up is the animation. It's a very different style for Disney and it works and looks great sometimes, but then other times it doesn't fit the story at all. Like when he fights the CG Hydra, alone the hydra doesn't look that great or fits in, but all the different angles and creative turns it makes looks quite good. The comedy still works good but in say 10 years it will probably wear off. And finally the songs. This is where the movie works and doesn't work. I think the songs sung by the characters are alright nothing great in the end though. But the whole gospel song style that the goddesses sing to tell the story, well I enjoy the type of music but it does not belong in a story about Hercules, and leads all in all a disappointing soundtrack. Now I've read some other opinions on this movie and they were all pretty negative. And I must say I think for me this movie is a guilty pleasure and the my nostalgia blocks out most of the problems. But looking at this movie with a clean slate, I must say Disney could have done a better job in the end.",Hercules
128,Dark_liquid,"Get real, people!",7,5 April 2011,"Wow. What a spiteful bunch of comments to read. There is WAY TOO MUCH hate in this world, eh? This movie is one of the few i clearly and joyfully remember as a childhood favorite. I even remember i had a computer game with Herc that i absolutely loved. So, watched it again today (thats a HUGE time gap), no intentions, random selection. I was less impressed, of course, the magic feeling i had then could not be repeated, but i still enjoyed it a lot. From today's point of view, the aesthetics are almost worthless, but i don't see why such a thing should cloud the viewer's judgment. The world has changed!As a kid who grew up with this particular movie and all of other Disneys adaptations, i am here to say WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS ENCHANTED WITH THIS MOVIE. So were all of the other kids i knew. Therefore, all of the 'concerned parents' commenting here, i can't believe you. People like YOU will find something treatening and offensive in anything! The world was such a better place when parents in general weren't paranoid freaks! No wonder your kids don't enjoy it today, they are used to all the modern crap the media feeds them.It is true that the facts aren't true. But who really cares? It is for children, right? For me, this was just enough to make me fall in love with Greek myths, and learn as much as i can about them as i grew up. That was the point. Everyone who wants to know the real story, can look up for it. This is a positive distortion of it, and it is the best way to present things in a kid's mind. You got the villain, the hero, the pretty girl, the helpers. You can't give children complex drama and bloody plot twists....i mean really?!I really don't think that this movie deserves all of this negative criticsm. A) It is FOR KIDS. Sc**w the facts, if they are a bit too much! B) We, the kids of that era, LOVED it. C) You cannot make a parallel between technology now and the one used 10+ ago.

SIGH The story is nice.  The acting, adequate.  The music, fun.  But the film stands as an example of Disney's decline in animation quality.  It is one of the first crossings of animation and computer animations from Disney the latter standing so far out in superiority from the already bad artwork that it makes the rest of the imagery look out of place.  Disney films since have only refined on this ludicrous art of crossing breath-taking imagery with almost lampoonish artwork.It is clear that the artist's intent was to produce a film which attempted to reproduce and modernize the ancient Greecian style seen on ""vahzes"" (GRIN), frescoes, etc.,  This would have worked had they not chose to cross this with a pseudo-realistic computer generated hydra which almost looks like something from a sci-fi flick.  Briefly we witness, ""Hercules Meets The Hydra From Mars.""Furthermore, if you're of a Paganistic path you might be offended by the interpretations of the Olympians which look completely ridiculous and exaggerated.",Hercules

It seems the people that disliked this movie are the people who are too uptight about Greek mythology and how this film was wrong in that base. They wrote how this was wrong or how this Greek never did this, never did that, but seriously people....THIS IS A MOVIE!!! Movies aren't real! None the less do they have to make sense! Not to mention this is a children's movie! I also read a comment by a parent on how their little girl cried during this movie or something? Well, do you think it's because of the movie or it's just her? Millions of kids saw this and didn't cry, there's just something wrong with THAT kid. Anyways, this movie is one of the best Disney films out there. It's one of my personal favorites of all time and is a true Disney classic. I guarantee you, your child has a very little chance of actually crying during this movie and wanting to turn it off. The songs are good, the plot of wonderful, it's a great ending, and the bad guy kicks much butt. Seriously, out of all the Disney bad guys Hades takes the cake. That is all. :)",Hercules

There isn't a Disney movie out there with wit as sharp as this one's with much of it probably lost on the audience guessing by the rating given to this movie. 
""Meg"" definitely emerges as my all-time favorite female Disney role. Breaking from tradition, her character is not all that lady-like in her biting wit and sarcasm, but it works, serving to make the movie funny and her character lovable despite working with questionable motives. 
The set-up and plot is typical for the movie but the script, animation, and music are most original AND good.  IF I had to register a complaint, I would say that it's perpetual humor kept the movie from being emotionally wrenching.

John Musker & Ron Clements make a great team and as for 2009's Princess and the Frog, It's romantic and funny to see such good people of Disney get away with fun Greek Excitement for young children, it's a sophisticating classic and i eagerly hope there'll be a diamond edition on this in a few years or so...",Hercules

Nevertheless, due to his superhuman strength, Hercules eventually rises to become the greatest of Greek heroes. I will admit I thought this was how the story of Hercules occurred before reading the original myth. But even after that disappointment, it still is another Disney classic in the right places. The animation is solid, especially with the Titans, through a brilliant combination of CG and traditional animation. James Woods as Hades is also another huge highlight for me, making him one of my all time favorite villains in the Disney catalog. The music is also pretty solid too, best song done by Danny DeVito.

135,Ironwarrior86,"Great film, not a good adaption of the original myths.",8,12 November 2009,Then again what did you expect from Disney? At the end of the day what happened in the original myths this was based on would not be appropriate for young children and naturally enough Disney would have to tone it down because there was no way they could include Hercules being conceived out of Zeus raping a mortal woman named Alcmene. When you watch it don't expect it to be a faithful adaption of the Hercules Myths as it's not directly based on them and has major changes such as Hades being a Villain as well as Pegasus meeting Hercules (whereas he didn't in the original Myths). At the end of the day this was made to appeal to Children too and let's not forget while The Black Cauldron was good it would barely appeal to any Children at all because of it's dark story and if this film had followed every last detail in the original Myths; it would only cause a large amount of controversy because Disney Films are expected to be suitable for young viewers as well as older viewers. Like most Disney films such as the lion king which is based on Hamlet; this is not by any means an original story but nevertheless it turned out great and does have a solid story that's suitable for older and younger viewers; give it a chance and if you can't tolerate it not being faithful to the original Myths do not watch it because it won't appeal to you. The music score in this film is great and it doesn't get much more epic than Hercules regaining his Godhood; the music at that point gave me chills; personally I don't really care for Disney Songs but the songs in this did prove to be quite enjoyable especially Go The Distance; another job well done by Disney.8/10,Hercules

But then one day, around my 14th birthday in September of 2009, my autistic twin brother bought this movie on a DVD and I decided to let him watch it in our bedroom one night. At first the movie didn't keep my attention, because I was thinking a Disney movie would hardly grab my attention, and I was sort of tired that night. Until the amazing song ""Zero to Hero"" played and the movie instantly grabbed my attention, since I thought the song was so cool and fun. After watching the whole movie, I thought to myself 'What have I done?! I actually was trying to avoid these songs for all these years?! I should watch more of the classic Disney movies as soon as possible!' I did watch most of the great Disney movies on Youtube, and I saw that this movie had some songs that made it to the Top 100 Disney songs of all time (I Can Go the Distance, Zero to Hero, I Won't Say I'm In Love, and A Star Is Born).

138,njdimic,One of the last Disney's great movies,7,7 August 2007,"I think that no one wants to admit that this is a good movie because of it's unseriousness, and because of the fact that Hercules here is depicted more as a super-hero rather then a classic mythical hero.Don't listen to those who curse the movie because it doesn't stick to original myths. Does anyone really want to see Zeus as he is depicted in myths - as a horny geezer who f***ed everyone BUT Hera? Who really cares about the accuracy? The movie is fun, hilarious, and has a nice love story. Megara (or Meg if you want) is a great character. Nice change after all those fair princesses like Jasmin and Pocahontas (don't get me wrong, I like them). Hades is also a great villain (thanks to James Woods), and I also liked his two stooges (""Thirsty?"" -best scene).The movie's downfall was the music. I expected more from Menken. None of the songs are memorable like ''A Whole New World'' or ''Colors of The Wind''. While the songs sung by the Muses sound nice thanks to the singing voices and the song ''Go the distance'' has a catchy tune, the words are a crying shame. Lyrics in ''Go the distance'' are so shallow, obvious and soulless, and repetitive. It makes the song boring after certain time of listening. The only song I liked was Meg's ""I won't say I'm in love"".And to wrap it up - one of Disney's different projects, but fun nonetheless. It's got nice story, good humor all the way, and a teensy weensy bit of a tearful ending. So there's something for everyone.Oh, yeah! And watch it at least three times, to see it's full quality.",Hercules
139,SevenStitches,"Great Entertainment, but not by Disney's standards.",6,21 May 2006,"""Hercules"" was a return by the Disney directing team of Ron Clements and John Musker (of ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" fame) to the animated feature after two very sombre entries in the Disney canon, ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", and they pretty much continued from where they left off with the aforementioned ""Aladdin"". Both of these films share common traits; both are extremely loose adaptations of established legend; they have an obvious contemporary feel, peppered with pop references (not saturated like Dreamwork's, or for that matter, many resent animated movies); both have an aspiring male protagonist and finally, both films have at least one immaculate, albeit hilarious voice acting performance. Plus the animation is given a stylish and very caricaturist form to it.Similarities aside then, ""Hercules"" was the first venture for Disney into Greek myth, providing a retelling of the story about the titular hero of how he was born a God, stolen and turned mortal by Hades Lord of the Underworld (to get him out of the way for a hostile take over of Mount Olympus which Herc is destined to intervene with) and the hero, after been told by daddy Zeus that, to get back, he must prove himself a true hero on Earth.A far cry from what was established in the myths to a lot of you in the know on these things, although Disney's always had a gift for making this work despite. And as it turned out accuracy wasn't a problem here either (to some). The story's pretty standard, like ""Aladdin"", and the main protagonist, while a little more layered than the former with subtexts of discrimination for his clumsiness and strength, is still on the boring side. Once again though, it's the supporting roles, the animation and the music that steal the show. Alan Menken once again saddled up for the score and together with David Zippel produced the songs, which take on a Greek chorus delivered by the quintet of Muses in a Gospel choir style. This makes for a few rousing tunes and a good intro, plus it ties in with the whole soulful, hero story they got going down. The Oscar nominee this time was an aspiring hero ballad of hopes and dreams, typically sappy stuff and does the job. The score itself melds all these tunes together here and there, plus goes other places too, but overall is not up to the stellar work of the past. Still fun though.Animation is once again of the top draw sort. Gerald Scarfe was the artistic adviser on this one, a political cartoonist of the UK and he brings a unique style to the Disney art. It's still very colourful, using a lot of luminescent colours, but the characters are all very sharp edged and heavily caricatured to resemble Greek art. There's also a fantastic sense of scale at times in the settings, especially in the city of Thebes with its towering Marbelesque architecture and an abundance of other beautiful Greek art. It's a nice move and another example of Disney's ever curious endeavours in cultural variety at the time. CGI is used widely for one particularly great action sequence, plus for some intriguing morphing techniques utilised in Olympus.Voice acting is of uniform good quality here with all actors acquitting themselves well with their role, especially Danny De Vito as Herc's trainer satyr Phil and Susan Egan as a very curvaceous and very tough Damsel named Megara (friends call her Meg). But the aforementioned show stealer is James Woods' Hades, who comes across as the slimiest, most charismatic movie producer slash real estate salesman type you've ever seen, motoring his mouth all over the script with ad libs aplenty. Doesn't topple William's Genie for pure comic madness, but he makes it his own character and revels in it to our fortune.This movie is as much a comedy as ""Aladdin"" was, meaning that it's lighting fast with a sharp edge on the cultural references and on the Greek myths themselves. Most of the comedy comes courtesy of Hades and Phil, who get great lines, but also comes from some serious hits taken at Disney's own patented merchandising routine, used here for Herc's sake. It's well implemented and makes for good satire at times. But other than comedy, the film does the romantic angle too, plus the main moral of knowing what it really takes to be a true hero. Once again, like the former movie, it's the weaker element. Actually for most of the midsection of the film (the most entertaining part) the romance is quite touching, but eventually it gets rushed and doesn't feel as genuine. The main message isn't hammered into us and is a good one, but still isn't anything to swoon over. While comedy's a strong suite for both ""Hercules"" and ""Aladdin"", the latter had itself backed with a slightly more magical feel to it's dramatic subtext, leaving ""Hercules"" a little shallow.One final point before i clean up. While the movie is a mere shadow of the myth in terms of story, it has an abundance of homages to Greek myth, including Hercules himself. I counted references to about 7 of Hercules' 12 labours (one been very prominent), plus a twist of a similar situation Hercules had with a River Guardian Centaur and his girl. Actually, the more you know about Greek myth, the more you'll find and it actually turns out to be quite a nice touch, even though none of it coheres in the order originally wrote.""Hercules"" is fine entertainment for all ages, as in the good Disney tradition. But this time, away from that tradition, it lacks a little something that Disney seemed to have mastered before and almost reacquainted itself with a few times more afterwards before sinking below the depths. Just as well, this is better animated entertainment you'll get than most non-Disney, non-Pixar and non-anime companies produce regularly.",Hercules
140,BooChanan,Hercules - Zero or Hero,7,8 June 2012,"Hercules is a spectacular Disney Classic with a fun, action story mixed with a tale of love and betrayal. It has some great musical numbers such as, 'Go the Distance', 'Won't say I'm in Love' and 'Zero to Hero'. These things make it seem like a fantastic film that all Disney lovers must see. And that is how I see it but many people don't; they find the movie very inaccurate and dislike the pop culture references or think the score and story are poor. To be honest, I don't understand, much, why these people don't like this classic tale. Yes, the plot is not much like the real story of Hercules but this is a children's movie - it wasn't made to be historically correct or educational. I agree, the pop culture references (action figures, other modern day merchandise, erc.) are a bit annoying and don't fit in hugely but fantastic Disney Movies such as Aladdin were full of these references and nobody trashes them in reviews. I found the plot and score really good and they worked well together to make the overall outcome even better. The film has interesting characters that are humorous (Hades and Pain and Panic) and very heroic ( Hercules and Meg) who all have a back-story which is referred to, often rather subtly, somewhere in the movie. This makes you feel for the characters more. All in all, Hercules is a really good Disney movie that many children (especially boys) will want to see. It is no Beauty and the Beast or Lion King or Aladdin but it is absolutely splendid with its story, music and characters. Disney's Hercules is definitely a HERO not a zero!",Hercules

Pegasus and Heracles are never near each other in every Greek myth.  Heracles does date and eventually marry Megara.  He also kills her, too.  I've not seen it in a while, but I remember only four or five Titans. There were really between seven and twelve Titans.  Cronus, the oldest of these Titans, is the father of Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Hestin, and Demeter.  Having only a few Titans that represent fire, wind, earth, and water (ice) is being entirely too inconsistent.  Earth is the mother of the Sky and the Titans, anyway.

144,ar-thur,Disney's best,10,26 December 2007,"""Hercules"" is one more triumph from directors Clements and Musker. Perfectly reproducing ancient Greece's time and culture, they produce an uninterested animation and fill it with gags without being ridiculous. But they had another advantage, which was the team that they worked with. The mix with gospel music was great, and Alan Menken songs were even greater, giving you a smile in your face and all the gospel power, combined with David Zippel happy lyrics. Voice workers were just perfect for their roles, giving the film a special life. DeVitto is a natural Phil, Susan Egan is a sexy Meg, James Woods is a delicious Hades. Animators really made a great work, not beautiful as ""Beauty and the Beast"" but rich in movements and valuing the essential body lines. The story adaptation is another thing that they did very well. The muses are the best narrators and probably the best Disney characters ever. You don't need to care about those stupid commenters that complain about errors and disagreements with the original legend, because this film is just a new version of the legend, an even better version of the legend. The only complain I agree with is that the joker spirit of Clements and Musker is something that has to be careful. Sometimes in this movie there are moments of tension that are almost (i said almost) broken because of unnecessary jokes or interventions. But it does not destroy the movie's spirit.

Basically, this is just a Flintstones rip-off.Want to know why I believe that? Because of the nature of the film, the characters and the setting. Of course, it was meant to be funny, and I did find a couple of the jokes funny, but it just went too far. First of all, the film did not take place in Ancient Greece. It was just USA modelled after it. Second, the characters were too American to be considered Greek people. Third, the excessive American jokes, such as ""Jerkules""; ""Somebody call IX I I"" (9-1-1); calling a baby God a ""Sunspot""; seeing Narcissus (who wasn't even a God) kissing his own reflection in a mirror; Hades ""working himself to death"", in Zeus's words; calling Zeus ""Boltboy"" or ""Mr. Lightning Bolts""......YUCK!! Too American for my taste, especially with the Gods being like laid-back American snobs (except for Hera, who I thought was the only convincing character in the movie).Practically, this was either a Flintstones rip-off or a remake of ""Hercules in New York"". Personally, ""Hercules in New York"" was a better title for this movie.It had it's moments, but too unreal (too Americanised). 5/10 stars.",Hercules

148,SharpShooter5,Disney's Worst Animated Film of the 90's,5,9 October 2003,"Hercules, sounds like it would make a great idea for an animated adventure, its got everything, from adventure for the guys, to a love story for the girls, to monsters and magical gods for children, and adults , so how is it that Disney messed this one up?I don't have the answer, and I've never ran into anybody that does, part of the problem may lie in that Disney decided to mix up the Hercules' story we remember from high school, and instead give us a family friendly version (but hey this is Disney what did you expect)?  This new version almost works, but it's still not effective because rather then give us something new it mainly rips off aspects from the Superman films, as well as Empire strikes back.On the plus side, the animation is wonderful, and the voice talent is good. Tate Donovan is sub-par as Hercules, but Danny Devito and James Woods are excellent as Philoctetes and Hades, and Rip Torn is pretty funny as Zues.Now don't get me wrong, Hercules is not Disney's worst movie of all time, it just that with the studio's huge resurgence in the 1990's, with the likes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, hunchback of Notre Dame etc...

149,jcbaek,surprisingly witty,8,11 December 2016,"I first saw this as a child and didn't remember much. After I saw it for the second time with fellow college freshmen, I realized that Disney put so many puns and references in its version of the Greek myth we know as Hercules. Of course my mind screamed out at me all of the contradictions with the actual mythology -- like there were more than just 4 Titans and they weren't elemental creatures that could easily take down the Olympians. Anyways, the movie is very funny, I laughed a lot, like when some character says ""call IXII"" and you realize that it's 911 in Roman numerals. I feel like many Disney movies, in the same way, make modern references that are anachronistic with their settings; like especially for Hades, who does not talk like an ancient god of the underworld but is very sardonic and speaks like we modern folk. As a whole, Hercules is not a super well-made film, it's a cliché love at first sight story and a journey to find oneself. After all, so much of fiction is about finding one's identity. It's also about heroism. What does it mean to be a hero? If you've read the Percy Jackson series, which by the way is a great way to learn about the Greek myths, then most likely you'll see so many flaws in this movie but still, it's hilarious, the soundtrack (kudos to Alan Menken) is amazing and nice to sing along to if you know the words, and you leave with a nice warm feeling.

I do not look to Disney to teach my child morals or any life lessons (Mom's on the job) but I do expect fun entertainment. This was my daughter's first movie to see on the big screen. It taught me to go see Disney films first by myself. I was very disappointed with the sophistication of the Hydra scene. Did we really need the green goo spewing everywhere? This had my child covering her eyes and wanting to go home. You can certainly believe that this did not transfer to my burning up the wallet on Hercules merchandise.

I love Greek myths, I've read all the ones I could get my hands on and my favorite God happens to be Hades. That's why when I went back to watch this movie again I was appalled the way they portrayed him. Hades is not evil, he is not trying to take over his brother's throne. He rules the underworld. He is the lord of the dead but again that doesn't make him evil.This movie strayed so far from the original myth it's a travesty.

However, the real reason I like this movie is Hades, a perfect villain in my own opinion: evil but also very funny, especially when he argues with Pain and Panic, his two followers. As for the soundtrack (which is really an important part of Disney productions), I have to say that it's not the best one I know: if you take other movies, such as ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"" you will find better songs.

This one also has a male lead (no princesses). If you are looking for typical Disney fare, then you may not appreciate this one. We enjoyed it thoroughly--from 4 to 40 years of age, male and female.As for all the criticism regarding the liberties Disney took with Greek mythology, get a grip. I love Greek mythology too but hey, IT'S FICTION! It's not historical fact. Even the ancient tales themselves are not consistent, containing contradictions. There were many authors. But the characters are interesting, and Disney used some of them to create a good story for kids about an outcast looking for his place in life. It also explores what makes a hero a true hero (perhaps the more useful lesson of the movie). Yes, it's a shame they took so many liberties with this picture but it still encourages interest in Greek myth. Don't believe me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were not historically accurate either but they got kids interested in the Old Masters!8 / 10",Hercules
157,trojanmemory,"Entertaining for a free thinker, but the creators made me sick",5,20 December 2004,"Alright, I really really cannot help but bring up the reminder if respect for beliefs and cultures and religions of others. This Disney's Hercules movie is a total disrespect for the ancient religion. Sure, ancient, but religion and belief nonetheless and let us not forget that there are still some who follow and believe in it. They made Zeus, King of the Gods, act like a total fool and a clown and Hermes, the God of Messengers, act like a total dumb DJ who can't shut up. And they disrespect the other Greek heroes by giving all their credits to Hercules alone. Sure, to the kids and atheists, it is an entertaining movie worth watching again and laugh about. But the fact that the creators made the Greek Gods a laughing stock with this movie is simply disgusting and I really hope they're reading this. Why was The Prince of Egypt not distorted and taken so seriously? Why was that godly tree not dancing about making stupid noises trying to be funny? Why was Moses not falling on his head or get totally whacked by the enemy? And sticks which turn into snakes which can swallow two snakes its size whole at the same time and dividing an entire sea and turning a river into blood can be taken seriously but a child who becomes a God can't? Utterly despicable. And worst, they cast one of the Gods as the villain! Hades, though he is the God of the Underworld, is not evil. And the Underworld is not bad, depends on which part you go to: misty Asphodel, hellish Tartarus, or heavenly peaceful Elysium. Not only do these people distort the legend of a son of a God, they also disgrace the Gods themselves!

I have known Hercules all of my life, I knew the original myth, I played the PS1 game and I played Kingdom Hearts, but I had no interest in him, I will go as far as to say that I didn't like him at all, I found him obnoxious in KH. This changed after I watched his movie; it is true it doesn't have the greatest animation, story, character or themes, but it is great at all of them. The animation is supposed to be basic, it was a stylistic choice that I loved, it doesn't need the great amount of details of The Hunchback, it is unique in its own right. Here we have a young Hercules, not sure of who he is, not sure of his future and not sure of what he is supposed to do. He is lost, like all of us. The whole movie is about identity, it is a great shout-out to all adopted kids and want to find their roots, to all (adoptive) parents to let their children free to find their way, and to all people that is fine being lost and search for a place to belong. It also teaches that not always what you wanted is what you needed, that feeling different is fine, feeling lonely is normal even you apparently have no reason to be.However, Hercules is not a drama, it is a comedy, and its style is what I loved most. It has modern elements that make it hilarious, the song ""Zero to Hero"" is a good example, but the movie really shines with Hades and his fast-paced speech.",Hercules

163,willfmoviejudge,"After Almost 40 years of trial and error, there is FINALLY a GOOD Hercules Movie.",7,10 July 2018,"Rating: 71%. Let's start this review by giving you a little background information, but give you the abridged version. The mythology of Hercules started in Ancient Greece/Rome and has been told through generations and generations of people. Heracles to the Ancient Greeks (but were just going to call this hero Hercules for simplicity) is most known for his immense brute like strength; saving cities and wrestling very powerful animals like lions, as well as fighting other powerful god like villains like Hades (who were going to talk about a little later in this review) and emerging victorious. The original Hercules film adaptation was made back in 1958 starring American Bodybuilder Steve Reeves, which that movie spawned a sequel Hercules Unchained in 1959. Both of their main flaws was that it had very slow pacing although it was fairly accurate. Many more of these Hercules films kept spawning up over the years, especially Hercules (1983) starring Lou Ferrigno which was god awful, but I will get to that another day. Finally, Disney got their hands on this animated adaptation of Hercules in 1997. In my semi-professional well supported opinion, Disney was the one that understood the story right for the most part.Unlike the other films that I previously mentioned and then some, this film introduces Hercules as an infant living in this place called Mt. Olympus (it is best described as a gated community in the clouds, almost like an exclusive country club for the gods). Hercules is the son of Zeus voiced by Rip ""we're not hosting an intergalactic kegger"" Torn (most known for Zed from one of my all time favorite movies Men in Black (also from the same year)). The other gods give Hercules a vigorously powerful blue and white horse with an attitude problem named Pegasus as his mode of transportation. We are then introduced to our main villain Hades, who threatens to take over the world. Hades who is voiced by James Woods (who was known for mostly animated work, especially playing himself on the show Family Guy), and his cohorts kidnap Hercules and leave him in the human world. As far as his cohorts are concerned, how can I best describe Hades' two assistants. They are incredibly stupid and moronic miniature devils that are always screwing up the simplest of directions. For an example, they were supposed to make Hercules ""sleep with the fishes"" as requested by Hades, but they slip up and let people take him away. I'm just going to refer to those devils as Lenny and Squiggy, (both names referencing characters from the show Laverne and Shirley). The one I call Lenny is the blue devil that is taller and thin, the one I call Squiggy is the red devil that is shorter and fat.As Hercules grows up, although classified as a demigod, the townsfolk ridicule and dishonor him as a misunderstood outcast, instead of worshipping him as a cape-less hero for his god like talents and efforts. The Pot Maker (which is much better than how it sounds) who was voiced by Wayne Knight (thats right, he was in Jurassic Park as well as Newman from Seinfeld) threatens him for accidentally destroying his store and tells him to leave immediately. As he is far away from town, he encounters this irascible retired Satyr named Phil who was voiced by Danny DeVito (Batman Returns, Taxi, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, etc), who reluctantly trains Hercules to be the hero people see him today. After he completes his training, he goes down to the swamp to fight against a half horse half brute like animal just to rescue our damsel in distress named Meg. This dependent damsel in distress is what I would describe as a Spartan version of Jessica Rabbit (from Who Framed Roger Rabbit) as far as body structure and most importantly attitude go. This back stabber works for Hades to assists him to stop Hercules.Later on in the film, while Hercules is starting to have feelings for Meg, (although he does not realize that he is being betrayed on every twist and turn), Hades frees the world destroying Titans (NOT THE FOOTBALL TEAM FROM TENNESSEE!!!) from the prison held in by the gods, in order to assist him in (once again) taking over the world. Hercules does ultimately save the gods, especially Zeus and does destroy Hades by throwing him into a ""pool"" of the undead.I first saw this movie in theaters back in 1997 (I was 3 years old at the time). Approximately 20 years later I watched it again, this time on Netflix and had just as much enjoyment out of that experience as I did when I first saw it when it came out. With that being said, I honestly have to say that this film is good for both kids and young adults, but now that I am a young adult I can pick up flaws with this movie, (we will get to them later). I will list off some pros and cons with this movie.Pros: 1: This movie has a much bigger, as well as a more wisely spend budget compared to it's predecessors. The visuals and scenery look much more scenic than Hercules or Hercules Unchained. It has a bigger more talented cast and crew than most. Bigger budget USUALLY means more leeway to be able to execute your movie the way you want, this film here does not look cheap and quaint.
2: The Villian. Hades is considered to be one of the last great villains of Disney and he seriously was the one that really stole this movie. Besides Syndrome from The Incredibles, I have never smiled, laughed, or even respected the villain of any movie with the exception of Hades. Hades was supposed to talk very slow, have a demonic voice and sound more like Bane from The Dark Knight Rises (but it would be hard to understand every word said). Instead they filled that role with James Woods who is a very fast talker who can deliver lines with much more enthusiasm than most of the cast, and was also able to improvise a percentage of his lines.
3: The Pace. This film actually kept me interested and awake, in contrast to the Hercules films from the 1950s which were very boring and always put me to sleep. The fight scenes were much faster and designed better, than in the older films where their fight choreography was subpar next to a high school play production. The Hydra does not look silly, stupid and laughable; but instead looks intimidating and threatening... UNLIKE THOSE OTHER FILMS!!!Cons: 1: The music. I'm sorry to say this, but when I think Hercules, I do not think of the word musical. I never thought to myself ""I want to watch a really good musical, I'll choose Hercules"". Hercules is most definitely an animated action film. I have always fast forwarded and or muted through the musical bits and pieces. Honestly, for the singers at the very beginning of the movie, they could have chosen James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Barry White etc.
2: The Role of Hercules: Honestly, Tate Donovan is not bad, but if I was going to fill in the voice of one of the most powerful heroes of all time, it has to be an original tough guy. Better choices would have been... Chuck Norris, Charles Bronson, Charlton Heston, Clint Eastwood, James Coburn, or hell maybe bring Steve Reeves who was the original Hercules back, he was still alive in 1997.
3: Those Devils: They were supposed to carry some comic relief but they failed miserably. They are very stupid and wacky, but not in a fun and interesting way, but rather in a loathsome and irritating way. These cretins were the equivalent of running nails on a chalkboard. Despicable little creatures that serve no purpose and more importantly no humor LIKE THEY WERE DESIGNED TO.Anyway overall very good movie, and I recommend it to people that like to watch a good Hercules movie, to the Hercules fan out there, this is definitely their cup of tea.",Hercules
164,lahjakori,Skippable,6,21 October 2018,"When I think about Disney films, Hercules doesn't come to my mind right away. Hercules is the one odd guy among the memorable classics of 90's Disney movies. I'm not really sure why, I mean, the film made well over 100 million USD and I saw it as a kid. Maybe it just misses that one feeling of nostalgia.There are things in Hercules that I like though; it has witty humor, the characters are imaginative and the animation is... well, something you could imagine for a 90's Disney classic (by that I mean amazing). Megara also serves as a great female lead alongside to the developing character of Hercules.I didn't really enjoy the long singing prologues sung by the muses, but I still think it was a better choice than some narrator telling about the Greek mythology for minutes. Otherwise, I think everything's just decent and good in this movie.Hercules is a great movie I'd love to love more. It just misses the unforgettable charm that makes it a classic for me.",Hercules

168,LeonStyloroy,An Olympian achievement,10,10 January 2008,"This is possibly my favorite Disney movie ever. With a razor-sharp wit, perfect comic timing and a fresh plot that transcends most other Disney fairy tales, this one's definitely a keeper.You'll be enchanted right from the first number, in which the five Muses (from Greek mythology) set the stage of ancient Greece in a powerhouse gospel number which gives a whole new meaning to a Greek chorus. Recalling the three ladies in Little Shop of Horrors or Motown groups like the Supremes, the Muses appear randomly throughout the movie to narrate the story of Hercules with jazzy musical numbers that you'll be humming for days. The songs (by Alan Menken) are certainly a twist from the classic Disney musical, but there's enough variety to create a great, well-rounded musical. The writing is the wittiest in any Disney movie ever, with constant in-jokes and hilarious references to Greek mythology to reward the amateur scholar. The lyrics, too, are witty and full of tricky rhyme schemes that must have been a doozy to write but play out perfectly on screen. (You'll be flat-out awed by how many things rhyme with the phrase ""gospel truth"".) Another of the highlights is the heroine, Megara or Meg. She's in no way a typical Disney princess. She's sassy, sexy, cynical and dangerous - and more winning by far than any warbling Cinderella or whiny little mermaid. The villain, Hades, is also a fun, witty character, although plenty dangerous in his own right.Of course liberties have been taken with Greek mythology. The dysfunctional Olympian family has been cleaned up (No more Zeus having affairs or Hera trying to kill people) and the story has little in it of the original Greek legend. Instead, it's really an archetype, a modern retelling of all the Greek legends at once. Appearances are made by the Muses, the Hydra, satyrs, the Fates, Pegasus, the Titans, Narcissus, and of course all of the Olympian gods. Scholars may take offense, but since legends evolve and are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway, I didn't have a problem with it.Yes, it's cheesy, just like other Disneys. But when nobody else is around, there's no resisting the corn. The third act is absolutely heart-wrenching, and even if it's over-the-top, it never truly goes over the top, and the constant bombarding of wit keeps things from getting too touchy-feely. Besides, tied together with a golden Disney score, who couldn't resist a dose of adventure, heartache, redeeming love, and most of all, heroism? Just let yourself be carried away to ancient Greece and you'll forget the movie's problems in a Pelyponnesian minute. As the Muses would say, that's the gospel truth.",Hercules
169,MrKittyAlcex,Nothing to do with Heracles (Hercules),1,13 August 2013,"Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.",Hercules

But as for the people who say that it's not important that it be true to the mythology, that's not what us myth-lovers are complaining about. At least for me. I don't know about the rest of them. I am complaining that with this movie Disney took a great story and Christianized it. They corrupted it, they took all of the decency out of it. This movie is to the myth what saccharine is to sugar. And I say that not only because artificial sweetener will never be better than the real thing, but because this movie is in fact nauseatingly saccharine in its ""adaptation"". Just a few ways in which this movie was Christianized and had all of the punch taken out of the real story: for one, Hera is NOT Hercules' mother, she is the one trying to kill him. But of course, in a Disney movie we have to have the happy family, right? And since we need a new villain, hm, let's see...why not just pin it on the lord of the underworld? Who, I might add, has no demonic connotations in Greek myth and whose only appearance in the Hercules story is when Hercules is tasked to bring Cerberus from Hades and back to the king alive. In the end of the real story, Hercules is driven mad by Hera and kills his wife, ""Meg"", and his entire family. This kind of interpretation makes me sick because it's just another example of society thinking that children can't handle anything remotely serious.

175,Tomukas,All rubbish,1,9 August 2002,"This animation is a big mockery of great Greek mythology. Even when I was about 10 years old, seems I knew about Greek mythology A LOT more than creators of this film. Almost every fact they give us is fake. Like - Musas were nine, not five, none of them was fat, Hercules died BEFORE Achilles, his mother was HUMAN woman, not god, so he born Human, not God and etc and etc without ending. They could have spent at least a weak reading Greek mythology before creating this rubbish. At least if they had added True ending of this myth - when Megera killed Hercules with poison - it would have been at least little bit more interesting, but now... I believe it was possible to create story, which one was not far away from myth and would be as interesting as this one had to be. I don't likes stories, which tells lie, and pretends they are telling truth.",Hercules
176,Cutiepuffle,It Was Lucky that An Extremely Goofy Movie existed....,1,6 June 2014,"otherwise it would be the worst in my opinion. Let's talk about the problems:First, the accuracy.This movie had nothing to do with its source, and while this is common in Disney, this was just insulting.-Hades wasn't the villain, heck, he even helped Hercules. Hera was. This is a problem because we were denied the possibility of a less clichéd villain fighting for a less clichéd cause. Um, why is there gospel music in Greek Mythology.Hercules killed Megara. You probably should've mentioned that.But that's understandable, Disney does that a lot. And also it's a kids movie, I get it. So this is forgivable. Now the worst part: The Clichés.-Hercules is a dorky awkward bully victim. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD HE'S HERCULES. WHO WOULD BULLY HIM.-Everybody hates him because he's different and calls him a freak. Seriously. This is getting old. Once again, WHY WOULD YOU INSULT HERCULES.-Hades wants to... that's right... take over the world. -Hades has two minions, a fat guy and a skinny guy. -Hercules is your typical idiot hero after he grows up.Hercules is the chosen one.Hades reveals his plan in front of Phil.Next, the pop culture references. Air Hercs, really? On top of that one of Hades' minions own these.It was unfunny, clichéd, and horrible.",Hercules

179,SarahSMorris,A Great Adult Disney Cartoon,10,23 September 2005,"I've been a Disney fan my whole life and I like many of the cartoon movies that have been made. This movie, however, is one of my favorites. It is a cartoon for adults. The jokes in it, my 3 year old doesn't get yet (""Somebody call IXII!"" or Hercules saying that ""I'm an action figure!"" in an obvious attempt to make fun of the Disney Store), but he loves the action and the songs. It's nice that there's a Disney movie that entertains us both. Hades and Meg make the film though. Without those characters and the incredible depth given to them by the voice talents of James Woods and Susan Egan, the film would be too fluffy. Wouldn't it be cool to have Cinderella be as sarcastic as Meg? The sad part about it is that she will never be included in the Disney marketing scheme. Seems to me young girls could use a sassy, sarcastic, strong-willed role model. The only part about the movie I never understood is doing gospel singers for a mythological theme. The two seem to clash, but who wants to over-analyze a Disney flick? Megs song stands out anyways as one of the best ""love songs"" of Disney movies, so I'm fine with the conflict.",Hercules

But I was surprised when I watched Hercules. It is one of the best movies Disney has put out. It has a lot of laughs that adults can enjoy as well as kids. Even the songs are good, which doesn't happen too often.There are a lot of likable characters, such as Zeus, Phil, Hercules (obviously), and even Hades. Both Phil, (the personal trainer of Hercules) and Hades produce a lot of laughs from young and old alike. And besides the movie being extraordinarily funny, it actually has a plot, and is fun to watch. Hercules was definitely one of my favourite Disney movies.",Hercules

The music is incredible and will leave you singing along in further viewings.The cast is filled with memorable actors such as James Woods, Tate Donovan, Danny Devito and Bobcat Goldthwait.With a film like Hercules, it doesn't matter what age you are, you are sure to enjoy and love this Disney Classic.",Hercules

But other that that, this movie was fantastic. I'd like to say something. Someone made a comment about this movie saying they didn't understand why Hercules was given the potion to be mortal instead of Zeus. REWATCH THE MOVIE STUPID!! THE WHOLE PLOT IS THAT HERCULES- NOT ZEUS- HERCULES IS GOING TO RUIN HADES'S PLAN! now that i have that off my chest, this was a wonderful movie. I think it was well done, well thought out, and very interesting. I have a new favorite Disney movie! I also think the voice's for the characters were well matched. As for the plot? As most of us know, Hercules is a god. He gets turned mortal by Hades, the lord of the underworld, in the event that he is to spoil his plans to rule the world. Hades thinks him dead, and goes through life joyously trying to recruit people for his take over. Hercules grows to be a strong hero, trained by Phil, and falls in love with Meg, Hades's minion, and Meg falls in love with him. What else happens? WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!",Hercules
185,baggiebirdkate,Superb Disney Classic - A True Heros Tale!,10,26 May 2006,"I thought this film was fantastic, even though I may be slightly biased because I am a big fan of Disney films in general! This is by far my favourite however, I loved the fact that the kid who was bullied at school for being different was strong enough to become a true hero, and fall in love all at the same time. The humour of Phil (and even Hades), the comic slapstick of Pain and Panic, the naivety and courage of Hercules and the romance with Meg all add together to make a classic. The songs will be stuck in your head for days to come, and the heartwarming ending to ""A Star Is Born"" (especially when Phils dream is realised of Hercules becoming a constellation) is enough to bring a tear to your eye! Superb film which I'll definitely watch again!",Hercules
186,nishakittens,Absolutely fantastic,10,27 October 2006,"This is by far one of the best Disney films of the bunch. What can you expect from a film created by the same geniuses who did The Little Mermaid and Aladdin? Although there are a few errors in terms of the mythology it's based on, it's a fantastic watch. The comedy is flawless for all ages- I saw it for the first time when I was 9 years old and nine years later I'm still finding the jokes hilarious and discovering more gags that I hadn't spotted before. The songs are brilliant- the composer is a complete genius. I watched Hercules on DVD two days ago and I'm still singing the songs at random. They're catchy and just... wow. I love ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" (Megara's solo). I'm still impressed with Susan Egan's singing voice to this day. The Muses... wow. I love the choral touch they add to the songs. And the fact that they're actually telling the story is really unique- it's kind of an advance from Aladdin where the stall owner is telling the story, except the Muses appear throughout the film whereas the stall owner only appears at the beginning of the first film and the end of the third. My favourite character is definitely Megara- what's not to love about her? She's tough, she's funny, she's sarcastic and she has a heart of gold. A classic Disney girl. If you haven't seen Hercules yet, I strongly recommend that you do- you shan't regret it.",Hercules

So if you have any info or pictures or anything like that plz email it 2 me! Now more about the movie! I loved the music especially the song that Meg sings with the muses. The way that adventure, drama, music, animation and comedy can be compiled into an amazing hour and a half movie is spectacular! If you are thinking about getting any video out of the video store you've got your movie. The voices suit the characters very well and the actors that do the voices put 100% of their expression into it. The actors doing the voices are very well known and experienced. The animation is very cartoony but realistic as well with each character drawn the best it could possibly be drawn. The script is another amazing part of the movie! Even though the story-line was not created by Disney themselves the script had many emotional and humorous parts to it. In conclusion I would just like to say that this is one of the finest films that Disney has ever done and that the way that everything fitted in together made the movie a much more delightful experience than most of the other movies I have ever seen!",Hercules

I liked the movie then and absolutely love it now.I love the songs and even though it is not true to mythology, so what?? It's a movie so get over it!! Shesh!! This movie has got heaps of bad reviews but has anybody looked at the good ones?? The characters in this movie are great. Hercules is great and Phil adds some laughs. The villains in this story add soo much humor. Hades, Pain and Panic add soo many laughs and James Woods is perfect for Hades who is one of the best villains yet!! Megara (or Meg) has to be the best heroine from all the Disney movies. For one she is not looking for love, is independent (she can tie her own sandals and everything) and can stand up to her boss. She doesn't let anyone push her around. I think that Susan Egan did Meg's voice perfectly.Honestly I just want to say that this movie is great for both adults and children and the songs are unforgettable.If you haven't seen go to the video shop and rent it!

190,saudya1206,The trials and tribulations of Greek hero Hercules,9,3 December 2006,"This movie was awesome! Definitely one of the better Disney movies. Hercules was quite a different take on the Greek mythology story of Hercules. Although the story doesn't quite go along with the actual G Hercules story, it still implies them in the story including some of the monsters Hercules had to fight in his twelve trials. What the story lacks in tradition it makes up in songs and laughs. The songs from this movie are up there with the songs from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. Phil is definitely competition to the Genie and Sebastion. The lovely Meg plays starts a new type of Disney girl in that she is sarcastic and clever.",Hercules

The music is also great and fun to listen to. The story line is fast-paced and exciting, with a great moral lesson behind it. This movie is also very ""quotable."" I grew up watching this movie and loved it. But now that I am older I see that this movie has more to offer than just good songs and funny characters. Hercules gives a simple, yet informative version of a Greek classic. It provides information about Greek culture and Gods/Goddesses. Because of this movie, I was able to recognize the Greek Gods/Goddesses in school. I think that this movie is great for all ages and everyone can benefit from watching it.",Hercules
192,stevekaye2,A great movie; One of the best from Disney,10,21 September 2002,"While breezy, and obviously not following EVERY detail of the classic mythos, it does a nice job of humanizing a rather cold and often cruel character.  It's made for kids.  That said, it's a wonderful film about trust, love, faith, and the true nature of being a hero as opposed to being popular and rich.  Add to that, there are these great Broadway-style songs that really help expression the emotions of the characters.  Megara is brash and modern, as are the Muses who add class and beat to the story.  Danny DeVito is at his slimy best.  And the guy playing Hercules sounds and delivers the kind of innocence that Christopher Reeve portrayed in Superman. No Disney film is going to deal with the adult themes that take place in the various legends they portray.  This one uses that legend well, though, and builds an enjoyable and unique story for the whole family.",Hercules
193,mattwilhelm48,The perfect example of superhero storytelling,8,15 May 2014,"The idea has been buzzing around in my head for quite a while, and I have finally realized- This movie is still, and probably always will be the greatest Superman movie since Superman (1978). The basic story of an unlikely child raised by honest people. He learns he has extraordinary capabilities and starts a quest to discover himself and where he belongs in the world. He is noble and arrogant to a degree but learns to develop his abilities because he truly wants to help people in need. This simple story is so compelling and fantastic that I couldn't understand why we can't find it in modern films. There is so much more to offer your imagination than mindless non-stop violence. So instead of distorting your children's intelligence by showing them The Man of Steel. Show them Hercules, and I guarantee they will get so much more out of it.",Hercules
194,trioux4,Totally Underrated,9,23 October 2012,"As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it",Hercules
195,chadamycallaghan2003,Disney's Hercules,10,28 January 2006,"Well, I first when to see Hercules when it was released in theaters. I liked it but didn't think it was up to par like other Disney classics such as Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc... But I've been trying to collect most of the Disney DVD's for my two children Tristan 4½ and Shea who is almost 3. So I asked my mother to buy me Hercules, Pocahontas, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame for my birthday. On Jan. 24th, so she picked up all three, so that I could sit down and enjoy them with my children. Well my kids love Hercules. They laugh, clap, and cheer along with the movie. Which makes me feel good. My son Tristan loves it, he loves Hercules. Since we are Florida residents with seasonal passes, I promised him that we would go to MGM Studios soon to try and look for Hercules & Megara. My children love to meet and have their pictures taken with all of the characters. My point is because a movie may be a little different from the standard Disney classic. To give it a chance, you may find you'll enjoy it. I know I did. Tristan also loves Aladdin too! Shea's favorite is Beauty and the Beast. :)",Hercules
196,ikyi,"One of the best, but underrated.",8,30 August 2012,"I just had to sign in to write up a review. And after a year or so, I had to come back and edit it after another thought.Overall: I find it great! It's a fun watch and you shouldn't toss too many thoughts into it or it'll make everything go sour. This is the same for a lot of shows and movies. And that's the same for The Walking Dead, which I analyzed in details and found lots of parts that didn't make a whole lot of sense either. So details are not important.Originality/Creativity: It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Artwork: I really don't know. When I was a kid, I found it gorgeous with those random swirlies. Looking at it now, it's a little weird but I don't dislike it. The artwork is very fantasy-like, which really works for this. Music: I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really ""fit in"". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid.Parts that doesn't make a lot of sense: I think there are a few around but I just want to point out like three. At the beginning Zeus says that Hercules got his strength. So Zeus should be pretty should too. But when the Titans fought with Zeus, he acted like he has no strength and only got thunderbolts. So he threw thunderbolts one at a time and did nothing to the mountain/rock titan. As a result, Zeus lost his part of the fight. When Hercules came, he basically flew around in circles to annoy Hades and then release Zeus. And this time, by throwing two-three thunderbolts at the same time, it blasted the mountain/rock titan's head off and scared them off. The tornado titan also did nothing during the whole fight other than helping Hercules kill the other titans. In conclusion, to make this whole scenario make any sense, Hercules' role in this whole battle is only for morale purposes and using the tornado titan to kill the rest is just extra to fulfill the part where he wins the battle. When Hercules lost his strength, apparently he still kept his God-like durability. He was flung half way across the city within a second and smacked into a concrete wall. I don't know about you, but I'll be pretty dead. But let's just say that he did retain his God-like durability. Then Meg's sacrifice was for nothing other than getting Hercules' strength back since Hercules wouldn't even felt that pillar dropping on him. And isn't the deal that Meg will be safe from any harm? So even self inflicted harm like stabbing her own leg would be just fine. For some reason, both Hades, Meg, and Hercules thought it had to be lethal. Third point, when Hercules saves Meg by jumping into the river of death, we can clearly see that the 'river' part is fairly far down from the ledge, where Hercules jumped off from. But for some reason, he was able to reach all the way to almost touch Meg, when he first arrived. Okay, let's just say that was an illusion created by the angles. But when he stuck his hands into the river, it virtually instantly 'dried up'. However, for some reason, he was able to maintain his body's health and fluid while swimming towards Meg. Somehow, he prolonged his death. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: I basically threw a random low score that makes me ""feel"" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The ""step-mother"" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or ""trials"", which is ""sort of"" what Hercules in this movie did to become the ""true hero"". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for ""Reviewers"": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done with a kid's perspective in mind.",Hercules
197,NPT-Flea,Fabulous and Unappreciated,10,27 March 2007,"Disney's Hercules is one of the best Disney movies of all times. It really is one of the most diverse films Disney has produced in terms of Genre. It has comedy, drama, action, Fantasy...you name it, it has it. Yet is was, and remains to be one of the most under rated Disney movies ever released. The characters are fabulous. The Heroine of the story, Megara, is the first Disney Princess with a past. Hercules, the Hero, is always striving for good, no matter what the cost, and Hades is HILARIOUS, while still being evil to the core. Not to mention all of the smaller characters. They totally balance out the film to perfection. I will never understand why this movie is so unpopular in the world of Disney, because in my opinion, it should be one of the most hailed of it's films.

And CHIRON trained him not PHIL!So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS.All in all this movie is funny and cute.

It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

Which has been executed in away that doesn't actually confuse the younger audience. Instead it allows them to become quite involved with the story line and join in with the action as the story progresses as well as the finger clapping, toe tapping songs!

205,austinsmith-07032,Has some plot holes,3,14 October 2015,"The animated movie Hercules, overall is a good movie for children. But if you actually pay attention you'll notice a couple major plot holes. The first one is when hades wants to kill baby Hercules. This part is when the baby Hercules turns mortal. Hades has Pain and Panic(his minions) make Hercules drink a potion that turns him mortal so they can kill him. If you don't already know this, Hades is the God of death, so he would know if Pain and Panic killed Hercules right? In this case no. Yes, it is a kids movie but if they didn't include the part of killing Hercules and made it so pain and panic only had to make him mortal. If Hercules was mortal, he wouldn't be able to foil Hades' plan. Also, why would hades trust Pain and Panic when he could do it himself and know that the deed was done. From the first time Pain and Panic come into the story, you can tell that they can't do anything right. Which includes making a baby drink a potion and then kill it.Another plot hole is the fact that hades could've had the fates kill Hercules. He obviously can charm them enough to learn why he can do to take over the world. Hades could've just had the fates kill Hercules. Hercules was a good children's movie but if you are watching it and have to review it for an assignment you'll notice more things wrong with the movie.",Hercules

Hers is not Heracles's mom in the myth, his mom is a mortal making him a demigod. Because Zeus cheated on Hera Hera gets mad and punishes Heracles. In the movie Hera is trying to protect Heracles from Hades. While the myth isn't about love, this movie is about the relationship between Heracles and Megan. In the myth, Heracles kills his wife.

210,animaljamrocksandshouldntleave,Out of the 8 minutes of watching this movie....,3,23 June 2018,"I know it isn't long that I watched it for, but it already annoyed me. 
If you want to watch this to increase your Greek mythology knowledge, please... Don't. There are actually 9 muses, not 5. They think that Hades is a ""villian"" when in Greek mythology, he is just... the god of the Underworld. He is a nice guy from what I have read. The muses say that Hades is someone you don't want to get angry. Of course, for the story, no you might not want to. I say that you don't want to get onto Zeus' or Ares' bad side.The Underworld has souls in the ""ocean"" in the Underworld. They actually roam around on the lands. -While on the topic of the Underworld, they think of it as an evil place which is completely wrong. It's a place for the dead to go, and for sadness. Cerebrus is not an evil dog, he jsut guards the Underworld. 
-The 3 fates aren't evil either. They just decided on how long your life is going to be. 
-They sum up everything that is associated with death is evil. From what I have seen from other reviews, I can see it being a good, funny movie. But the Greek infomation isn't true (or some of it). I would love to have been true, because I was really looking forward to it.",Hercules
