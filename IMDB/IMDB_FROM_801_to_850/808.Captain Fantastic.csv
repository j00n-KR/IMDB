0,Leofwine_draca,Engaging character comedy with plenty of quirky humour,7,27 April 2017,"CAPTAIN FANTASTIC is a quirky little modern-day comedy about a rural hermit-like family getting to grips with modern society when trauma grips their lives. The cast is headed by Viggo Mortensen, who is quite excellent in a quirky part that's full of depth and character, but it's the kids who really shine in this one. They fully convey the mixture of emotions that their characters feel as they undergo the film's journey and it also helps that they're very funny too. The film is by parts dramatic, tragic, and humorous, and it also has a strong philosophical angle which I enjoyed. In fact, I can think of no other film quite like it, and that has to count for something.",Captain Fantastic
1,SnoopyStyle,outsider lifestyle,8,11 February 2017,"Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and Leslie Cash raised their children in the woods in an alternative, survivalist, leftist, anti-modern, anti-capitalist environment. The kids have unique names; Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai. Ben is brutally honest to his kids even when their mother killed herself in the hospital after long-suffering of bipolar disorder. He tries to assert her wish to be cremated. Her rich father Jack (Frank Langella) refuses and insists on a traditional funeral. Ben drives their bus with his kids to the funeral.Mortensen has great presence and commitment. His commitment generates both awe and hesitation. His charismatic obsession leads one to follow him but also to call child's services. The kids are just as terrific. Each one delivers a unique and complete performance. Their characters are each compelling in their own right. There are moments of comedy and there are some surprisingly powerful moments of family drama. There are some uncertain turns but it all wraps up in the end. It's a compelling unique movie family.",Captain Fantastic
2,Horst_In_Translation,Pretty convincing for the most part,6,30 September 2016,"""Captain Fantastic"" is a new 2016 movie from the United States and the writer and director here is Matt Ross, who was mostly known for acting so far. This may not be his rookie work as a filmmaker, but it is still one of not too many directorial works from him and as such, it is fairly impressive. Awards bodies (including Cannes) agreed and this 2-hour film here received a great deal of recognition. This is the story of a man who raises his children in the wilderness. But it's not like they are bush people or anything. They learn more than most other children learn at school. They are extremely healthy physically and they are capable of providing medical assistance in the event of injury. The protagonist is played by Oscar nominee Viggo Mortensen (""Lord of the Rings"") and he gives a performance that deserves awards recognition too I believe, so I find it a bit shocking to see he hasn't gotten any so far, but maybe he can get in at the Golden Globes or so. All the child actors who play his children in this film are pretty decent too I must say. It's generally a very strong ensemble cast. Movie buffs will find a couple familiar names here I guess, also in terms of the grown-up actors, and the biggest is probably Frank Langella, also an Oscar nominee, who is a bit of an antagonist here.I believe that Ross did really well with the mix of serious and entertaining moments. I would say that the core of the film is a family drama, but there is an occasionally funny scene too. After the death of his wife, the main character needs to question his methods of bringing up his children in a way he never imagined. But the crucial moment is actually when one of the kids gets seriously injured. This is not the moment he thinks that it is thanks to him and his training that nothing serious happened, but when he realizes he is a danger to his kids. I like that Ross depicts the best of both worlds. There is not 100% right or wrong to either style of living, but the perfect scenario is finding the balance. Sadly, there were also moments that I did not like too much, like the ashes reference towards the mother or how Langella's character was really so blind about what his daughter really wanted. These did not do too much for and didn't make that much sense to me. I also felt that Ross missed the right moment for a perfect ending, which would have been the father driving away with tears in his eyes. Instead, like so many other times, they go for the happy, more positive ending, which is somewhat the easy way out. But I personally prefer realism over trying by all means to keep the audience happy. Anyway, with a film that runs for over 120 minutes, there is basically always something to criticize. I have no doubts that the film has much more positive than negative and, despite the criticisms, I also think it gets better in the second half. I would not say this film is one of my very favorite films of the year, but it's still a nice watch that almost never drags (quite an achievement for this runtime) and Mortensen is among the best 2016 performances I have seen so far. Thumbs up. Go see it!",Captain Fantastic
3,Prismark10,The film takes the easy way out,6,3 May 2019,"Captain Fantastic has similarities with the 1986 movie , The Mosquito Coast.Both films feature obsessed father wanting to go off the grid and live a simple life with the natural world.Viggo Mortensen gives a sincere and earnest performance. He plays Ben who lives in a log cabin in the pacific northwest woodlands with his six children. It is a back to basics life away from the modern commercial world. His kids read books, hunt and co-exit with nature. Whereas their cousins play violent video games and watch television.When Ben's wife and the kids mother Leslie commits suicide due to her bi-polar condition. The family travel to her funeral arranged by her conservative and wealthy parents.Ben's father in law Jack immensely dislikes him and his way of life. He rues that day that his daughter fell for him.Ben and the kids sort of gatecrash the Christian funeral. Leslie left instructions behind of the kind of funeral she wanted and she was a Buddhist.Writer/director loves the offbeat lifestyle of Ben's family values. Jack is the antagonist here. As one of the grand kid's mention, he has so much land around his house, it is unethical.Yet I had a touch of sympathy with Jack. I did find Ben a bit of a jerk, a know it all, someone who insists the old way of living in the past is the best and if you do not like his way it is the highway. I think the audience could feel confused as to what Leslie really wanted. After all she was mentally ill and she helped her eldest son Bodevan to gain admittance to prestigious colleges.Ben loses his rag when he finds out that his eldest son applied behind his back to these colleges. Such an elitist act was an affront to Ben's ethos. So much for free thinking and as Bodevan retorts, he knows nothing about the real world as he grew up in a forest in some kind of hippy commune where he was home schooled and had little contact with outsiders.I think Captain Fantastic goes for an easy ride, it wants to avoid difficult issues. Ben is made to look like a quirky anti establishment hero. He is just another type of bully, not alt right, just alternative lifestyle. Jack was right, Ben did come into Leslie's funeral looking like a clown.",Captain Fantastic
4,claudio_carvalho,Awesome Film,8,26 February 2017,"The anti-capitalist Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) lives in the wilderness with his six children: Bo (George MacKay), Kielyr (Samantha Isler), Vespyr (Annalise Basso), Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), Zaja (Shree Crooks) and Nai (Charlie Shotwell). His wife Leslie (Trin Miller) is hospitalized for bipolar disorder and they have educated their children in the forest teaching them how to survive and a high-level of homeschooling including politics and philosophy. Inclusive Bo has been accepted to the major American universities. When Leslie commits suicide, Ben decides to travel to the funeral with his children to fulfill her will of being cremated, instead of the traditional burial that he father Jack (Frank Langella) wants for his daughter. However his father-in-law promises to call the police and arrest Ben if he attends the funeral. Along the journey of Ben and his children, Bo meets the teenager Claire (Erin Moriarty) and her mother Ellen (Missi Pyle) and he falls in love with her. They spend one troubled night with Ben's sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn), her husband Dave (Steve Zahn) and nephews Justin (Elijah Stevenson) and Jackson (Teddy Van Ee). When they arrive at the church, Jack and his wife Abigail (Ann Dowd) are surprised to see them. Ben makes a speech and discloses Leslie's will to the guest and is expelled from the ceremony. Now Jack wants the custody of his children. What will Ben do?""Captain Fantastic"" is an awesome film about a father that does not believe in the American Dream and decides to create his children with his wife in the wilderness. Viggo Mortensen has a wonderful performance in the role of a loving father with radical values that learns that his children cannot live isolated in his Utopian world without contact with the real world. The conclusion of the journey of the Cash family is perfect. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Capitão Fantástico"" (""Captain Fantastic"")",Captain Fantastic
5,nogodnomasters,Happy Noam Chomsky Day!,10,3 September 2017,"Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his family live off the land in the wilderness. He teaches his children how to hunt, fight, navigate, and start a fire with a rock. He has the healthiest, smartest, self reliant, responsible, free-thinking kids on the planet in his Plato's Utopia. You love them all. The children have a Marxist/Chomsky view of the world with a disdain for capitalism and waste. They celebrate Noam Chomsky's birthday with gifts of hunting knives and not Christmas.When their hospitalized mother commits suicide, they travel to attend her funeral, one where they are not welcomed by grandfather Frank Langella.Being a Chomsky reader, I instantly loved the film. The film is about choices as to which poison do you want. You can live in society where we all fed poison both mentally and physically or you can live apart and become socially dysfunctional, depriving yourself of all the pop cultural references I make in my reviews. Thanks for choosing the former. The performances were great.The film is against obesity, capitalism, and Christianity. If they had any real guts, they would have titled the film, ""Steal this Movie."" Guide: F-word. Nudity (Viggo Mortensen). No sex.",Captain Fantastic
6,kosmasp,Growing up,9,29 December 2016,"I have to admit, because of the title I was expecting this to be more of a comedy. It isn't really, although it does have it's funny scenes, it does bathe more in Drama. But that does not make this a lesser movie, on the contrary as my rating should already confirm. The drama may be a bit too much for some, but exactly right for others.Talking about too much. Honesty is a tough one to pull off. Especially when kids are involved. Viggos character actually explains sexual intercourse to his young boy. If you think this is bad and should be forbidden, this movie obviously was not made for you. It was made to challenge the viewer and you have to be prepared for that. And that was just one example. Growing up like that, having to evolve but being outside the society and the norm ... Challenge accepted (?)",Captain Fantastic
7,classicsoncall,"""No one will magically appear and save you in the end.""",5,10 April 2017,"In my review of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", I stated that suggesting twelve year olds in the film were having sex in a tent was one of the ways modern day film makers were contributing to the moral decay of society. I then pondered when one of them might lower the bar even further by taking it down to the level of eleven or ten year olds. Well, writer and director Matt Ross jumped the shark here when he had his protagonist Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) give eight year old daughter a copy of 'The Joy of Sex' following a discussion of penises and vaginas, and how they go together during intercourse. So now I have my answer; anyone going for seven year olds? Just like political figures on the far left, it appears that liberal film makers no longer attempt to disguise the biases in their work. Along with the irresponsible message on sex (Ben later advises son Bo to be tender with a girl he makes love to, even if he doesn't like her), there's an outright slam on Christians as a constituency you can safely make fun of. Don't even get me started on role model Dad faking a heart attack in a grocery store scam so the kids could fulfill their mission of 'freeing the food'. Noam Chomsky's defense of unconditional freedom of speech even gets a workout here, and at the dinner table no less, when the death of Ben's wife is referenced by stating that she killed herself. Pass the dessert please.There's only one thing of merit I got out of the story, and that was Ben's advice and interpretation of the word 'STOP' on the cliff face - 'Stay calm, Think, Observe and Plan'. Nowhere in there did I get the idea that that might have applied to grave robbing and flushing one's cremated ashes down a public toilet, but hey, I must have missed something. And please, if you're going to have one of your leads sing at a memorial service for dead Mom, find out if she has a voice ahead of time. Then again, I imagine she was supposed to sound terrible in keeping with the ambiance of the rest of the picture.One last thing - try getting that image of full frontal Viggo out of your head once it's seared into your subconscious. Seriously, I dare you.",Captain Fantastic
8,lee_eisenberg,power to the off-the-grid lifestyle,10,30 October 2016,"Matt Ross's ""Captain Fantastic"" casts Viggo Mortensen as a man raising his children off the grid until his wife's death forces him to bring the children into civilization. One of my favorite scenes is when they're in a restaurant and one of the children comments on another patron. And then there's also the part about the Bill of Rights. Basically, Mortensen's character is the sort of person who wants to make sure that his offspring know their rights and resist commercialism. They even have a Noam Chomsky Day! (not on Chomsky's birthday, however) There are a few intense scenes, like when the family confronts the in-laws. But mostly, it's fun to watch as the dad reminds his children to stick it to the man (especially what they do when the cop boards the bus). I also liked seeing the filming locations in the Pacific Northwest. I recommend the movie.",Captain Fantastic
9,jboothmillard,Captain Fantastic,6,26 March 2017,"During Awards Season I always make it a sort of mission to watch every single film nominated in the three big award ceremonies, even those only nominated one award, that was the case with this film. Basically Ben Cash (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller) live in the wilderness of Washington, with their six children: Bodevan ""Bo"" (George MacKay), Kielyr (Samantha Isler), Vespyr (Annalise Basso), Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), Zaja (Shree Crooks) and Nai (Charlie Shotwell). They are disillusioned with capitalism and American life, choosing to inject survivalist skills, left wing politics, and philosophy in their children, they have been educated to think critically; trained to be self-reliant, physically fit and athletic; and guided without technology, demonstrating the beauty of coexisting with nature. Leslie is hospitalised for bipolar disorder, she eventually commits suicide, Ben is blunt and tells this to his children, Leslie wishes to be cremated, despite this her father Jack (Frank Langella) plans to hold a traditional funeral and burial. Ben and Jack argue about this over the phone, Jack threatens to have Ben arrested if he attends the funeral, he initially decides not to do so, also preventing his children from going, but he changes his mind. This leads Ben and the children on a road trip out of the wilderness, where they are both fascinated and confused by all the modern day things in the places they go. The family briefly stay at the house of Ben's sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn), she and her husband suggest Ben's children should attend school for traditional education, he argues that his children are better educated than her children, including his youngest giving her knowledge of the bill of rights. Ben and his children arrive at the funeral, Ben reads out Leslie's last will and testament, which instructed her family to cremate her, and flush her ashes down the toilet, Jack angered has Ben and the children forcibly removed. Ben's children start to doubt his parenting skills, his son Rellian accusing him of failing to treat Leslie's mental health, his son Bodevan accusing him of failing to equip them for the real world. Rellian wants to live with his grandparents, Vespyr climbs out of a window trying to ""help"" him, she falls off the roof and narrowly avoids breaking her neck, Ben is shocked and allows Jack to take custody of his children. The children begin to bond with their grandparents, but decide to follow Ben again when he departs, in the end Ben and children honour Leslie's wishes, burning her corpse and flushing her ashes down an airport toilet, Bodevan leaves the family to travel and find his place in the world, while Ben and the rest settle on a farm, and they ready themselves to go to school. Also starring Erin Moriarty as Claire, Missi Pyle as Ellen and Steve Zahn as Dave. Mortensen gives a terrific performance as the left-wing dad who is not afraid to tell the truth to his children, no matter what the subject, it is not just a road trip movie, it satirises many commercial, consumerist and corporate things, including the family shunning Christmas, it is well written and it works well as a funny feel-good film, but with the necessary serious subjects as well, a worthwhile comedy drama. Good!",Captain Fantastic
10,LeonLouisRicci,"""There is no actual food on this Menu.""...Excellent Provocative Powerhouse",9,20 December 2016,"Actor and sometime Director Matt Ross Delivers a Controversial, Thought Provoking, Emotional, Heady, Earthy, Contemplation on Life in 21st Century America.It Wears its Counter-Cultural, Communal Existence, Artistically and Intellectually pinned on its Sleeve and is Not Afraid to Question the Flaws in an Isolated Upbringing of Children that will Require for Their ""Survival"" a more well Rounded ""Education"".Of Course the Answer is Compromise.

Mortensen gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the paterfamilias of a decidedly dysfunctional family he has raised with '60s hippie values that comes to the head when his wife dies and sends the brood into a major turnaround with some life lessons along the way proving blood is thicker than water in this well-conceived drama. Written and directed by actor Matt Ross the film falls on the capable shoulders of Mortensen whose deeply soulful and effective low-key performance anchors the story with gravitas, heart and solidity with a remarkable cast of newcomers as his children facing off his estranged father-in-law (Langella who thankfully shades his character as an all-too-easy-to label a villain). Funny, poignant and one of the best films of the year; a must see.",Captain Fantastic
13,evanston_dad,Movie with an Initial Intriguing Premise Becomes Too Stupid to Bear,3,13 January 2017,"There are compelling and relevant ideas swirling around the periphery of ""Captain Fantastic,"" but they are undermined by a terrible screenplay that gets more and more preposterous as the movie wears on.We are introduced to an absolutely unbearable family being raised by dad Viggo Mortensen as a bunch of sort of hippie survivalists. They live self-sufficiently out in the middle of nowhere, are forced to undergo family exercise regimens every day, and are taught by their father to be judgemental and morally superior to everyone who doesn't think and live exactly like them. Consumerist and capitalist America is the biggest target of their vitriol, and every a**hole remark they make or act they carry out is justified by the ambiguous belief that they are ""sticking it to the man,"" whatever that means. Then a series of events that forces the family to interact with the real world wakes Mortensen up to the fact that he may be doing some harm in raising his children in such a fashion.I liked that the movie acknowledges the hypocrisy that this particular family peddles in. For example, they celebrate Noam Chomsky day and honor him for what a great humanitarian he is and how good he was to his fellow man, but then they create a ruse involving Mortensen pretending to have a heart attack so that they can steal from a grocery store. This is surely o.k. in their eyes because, hey, the grocery store is part of ""the Man"" and only fat people with bad diets buy food from there -- forget that those same people showed real human kindness in coming to Mortensen's aid when they thought he was having a medical emergency. Another example -- Mortensen is proud of his children for knowing nothing about popular culture, yet has them reading books like ""Middlemarch"" and ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" which were, guess what, part of the popular culture when they were written. I guess he thinks nothing contemporary can be worth reading.The film ends in a place I could live with, with Mortensen's character recognizing that he needs to compromise, and that one need not abandon all of one's ideals because he's willing to participate in the culture around him. But before we get there, we go through the most awful series of plot developments that strain credibility beyond the breaking point.Like....the family digging up its freshly-buried mother so that they can honor her wishes to be cremated. I've been a pall bearer at more than one funeral, and caskets with dead bodies in them are HEAVY for six grown men to carry, yet this family consisting mostly of children manages to pull an entire coffin out of a six-foot grave with no equipment.Or....burning their mother's body on a bonfire while breaking into an impromptu musical number, and asking us to believe this would be a beautiful and natural moment for the family instead of the grisly nightmare that it would actually be in real life. This movie is all about one man not dealing with the reality of the world the way it is, and then the screenplay itself chooses to ignore the reality of how things would actually be just because it's more convenient and gives the director the scene he wants when he wants it. By the time the family was decorating their mother's corpse with flowers on the ride back to the wilderness (a corpse that looks beautiful, by the way), this film had lost me and I no longer cared how it ended.Movies about topics like the ones explored in ""Captain Fantastic"" should be made more often, but they need to be much better than this. Viggo Mortensen is receiving all sorts of praise for his performance. Maybe he was good, but who would be able to tell when the movie around him is so stupid?Grade: D",Captain Fantastic
14,ferguson-6,a clash of philosophies,8,15 July 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. There seems to be no end to the theories on how to be an effective parent and raise kids who are productive, well-adjusted and successful. Writer/director Matt Ross offers up a creative, entertaining and thought-provoking story of one family's unconventional approach in a world that seems to expect and accept only the conventional.We are first introduced to Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six kids as they are stalking a deer while deep in the Pacific Northwest forest  only this isn't your buddy's weekend deer hunting trip. Each family member is covered head-to-toe in mud and other means of camouflage, and the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) takes the lead with his knife in what is presented as a rite of passage into manhood.The family carries out a daily ritual that includes extreme physical conditioning, lessons on survival and living off the land, and advanced education that includes reading such diverse material as Dostoevsky and Lolita. Each evening is capped off with an impromptu musical jam. It's evident that self-sufficiency, intelligence and family loyalty are crucial to Ben's approach  an approach that is challenged when circumstances require the family board their Partridge Family bus (named Steve) and take a cross-country road trip into a civilization that doesn't know what to make of them (and vice-versa).The film is jam-packed with social commentary on education, parenting, societal norms, societal influences, and even grief. Who gets to decide what is best for a family or what's the best method for education? Sometimes the dysfunctional family isn't so easy to identify. Director Ross proves this in a gem of a dinner table scene as Ben and the kids visit Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn and their two sons in suburbia.In addition to the terrific performance by up-and-comer George MacKay, the other actors playing the kids are all very strong and believable: Samantha Isler as Kieyler, Annalise Basso as Vespyr, Nicholas Hamilton as Rellian, Shree Crooks as Zaja, and Charlie Shotwell as Nai. Screen vets Frank Langella and Ann Dowd bring presence to the role of their grandparents and provide the greatest contrast to the off-the-grid existence of the kids.Viggo Mortensen truly shines here and gives a performance full of grace and depth as he displays many emotions (some of which aren't so pleasant). He even goes full-Viggo for one of the film's many humorous moments  though the comedy is balanced by plenty of full scale drama. His best work comes in the scenes when he begins to question that there may be some flaws in his plan  the moments of self-realization are stunning.Many will note some similarities between this film and Little Miss Sunshine (2006), though this one carries quite a bit more heft. It's beautifully photographed by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine (A Prophet, Rust and Bone) and captures the danger and solitude of the forest, while also capturing the more personal family dynamics. It's a film that should generate plenty of discussion, and one of the questions is  will Noam Chomsky Day ever match Festivus in popularity?",Captain Fantastic
15,deloudelouvain,Inspiring movie,8,20 January 2017,"Living of the grid. Living day to day without any obligations. One with nature and enjoying every single moment of life. It seems all so far away in these modern ages. But it could be doable for everybody who can say no to modern society. Captain Fantastic is a nice movie about that spirit of life. Forced to return to the modern life because of a funeral makes the isolated kids discover how they are supposed to live. Live by rules, rules that no one approves unless you're in the system. The movie is very entertaining to watch with nice scenery's and good actors. Even all the kids play their roles with much conviction. You could imagine them living like that in real life. I like those kind of movies, where you question modern day life, where you know people are just following the norm and just continue contributing to the rat race without them knowing anything else.

16,siderite,"Thought provoking social commentary, but falls a little flat at the end",7,30 December 2016,"Why is the name of the movie Captain Fantastic? We will never know, as there are no mentions of captains or fantasy in the film at all. The plot, however, revolves around a hippie family that is forced to face generally accepted reality by the death of their matriarch. The ending is less forceful than the premise, though.What I liked about the film was that it made me think a lot about what is right, what is normal and how education should be implemented. I found it impossible to find a right answer. I find that secluding your entire family of many children somewhere in order to educate them in your value system is both abusive and permissible. I find that being forced to be part of the accepted system is both abusive and permissible. The world is more comfortable when people think and are educated in the same way, but poorer for the many variations on family and life that there could be.Bottom line: the film doesn't answer anything, it just presents a situation that makes the viewer think for themselves. No one in the movie is actually a hero or blameless or authoritative in any meaningful way. In the end the experience says more about yourself than about what the writer wanted to express.",Captain Fantastic

But when this man decides to act, there's hardly anyone like him. Need proof of what I just said? Watch 'Captain Fantastic'.Mortensen is a scene-stealing monster in this heartfelt & genuinely enjoyable Dramedy, where he plays a parent with an unorthodox approach towards life & his kids' lifestyle. Its a joy watching Mortensen deliver in a role, that understands his capacity & throws him into the jungle to explore it more. 'Captain Fantastic' Synopsis: In the forests of the Pacific Northwest, a father devoted to raising his six kids with a rigorous physical and intellectual education is forced to leave his paradise and enter the world, challenging his idea of what it means to be a parent.'Captain Fantastic' is a tale of parenthood & bond. We watch the protagonist bring his kids up in the wilderness & teach them a way of life that's based on pure thick-skinned flesh. But when his wife dies, he has to take them out to the real-world as we call it now & is later questioned for his unorthodox beliefs. 'Captain Fantastic' is a self-aware & self-absorbing film, that doesn't forget to make you laugh or even make you drop a tear, with honest feeling.Matt Ross's Screenplay is unique, but wonderful. The Writing makes very good use of its concept & makes full-fledged story out of it. Ross's Direction, on the other-hand (awarded at this Cannes's Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard Section), is realistic to the core. You forget you're watching a film, as you just transport into this world of people living in isolation. Stéphane Fontaine's Cinematography is tops. Joseph Krings's Editing is perfect. Alex Somers's Score is soothing.And while this is an out and out Mortensen show, I'd like to make specials mentions for ALL the actors who portray Mortensen's kids, as they are exceptional. And of course, Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn, Ann Dowd & The Legendary Frank Langella, who don't miss a single beat.On the whole, 'Captain Fantastic' proves yet again how Fantastic Mortensen is & can be, given the opportunity.

19,lasttimeisaw,a savvy indie you cannot help but mulling over it afterwards and getting inspirations in afterthought,8,27 October 2016,"Actor-turned-writer-director Matt Ross's second feature, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC is an indie dramedy that has garnered raving reviews since its debut in Sundance and won BEST DIRECTOR honor in Cannes' UN CERTAIN REGARD section.The story surrounds a middle-aged man Ben (Mortensen), who lives in the forests of the Pacific Northwest with his wife Leslie (Miller) and their children, a household of 8, the couple firmly adopts their home-school parenting precept to raise the six young children, inculcating them with rarefied philosophy and instructing them survival skills in the wild, in a completely off-the-grid style. But in the stunning opening sequences where audience witnesses their eldest son Bodevan's (MacKay), rite-of-passage slaughtering of a deer which officiates his entrance into adulthood, yes, each kid is coined with a sui generis name to symbolize their uniqueness, there is no sight of Leslie, it transpires that she has been hospitalized for bipolar disorder, and would soon opt to end her life- of-suffering, thus leave Ben and their children bereft.In Ben's extreme ideology, parents should never tell lies to their children, so he has no qualm to announce the bad news to the kids, and in fact, a running trope is whenever the youngest kiddie Nai (Shotwell) bluntly asks a question about certain children-improper terms, which unerringly begets an often too-honest reply and explanation from Ben, yet, that kind of extreme can only be compartmentalized as a minor disagreement with the more orthodox modern-day parenting guidelines. When Ben takes his entire family embarking on a road-trip to attend Leslie's funeral, that's when the huge rift starts to come into conflict with the outside world and disintegrate the family from within, especially between Ben and Rellian (Hamilton), the rebellious son who overheard an unpleasant conversion between Ben and Leslie and willfully attributes the latter's death to the former.That's the nexus which strongly coalesces audience with Ben's ideology, is he really (partially) responsible for Leslie's suicide? Because despite that his children-rearing principle is far too radical to be impeccable, he is a loving father foremost, who obviously tries his best to protect his offspring from the capitalistic and pseudo-religious toxicity besetting our communal society in his own way, that is an enterprise requires huge responsibility and commitment. It seems Ross himself is also waffling to leave a concrete conclusion to the said question, at one point we are informed that Leslie might want to go back to society, but a letter received by her mother (Dowd) might suggest otherwise, so there is this telling ambiguity of ""their choice flowing amidst the diametrical dissension between Ben and Leslie's father Jack (Langella, a stern and inscrutable force of composure and toughness), which is heightened to allow viewers to switch sides throughout the process.Rendered with tenderness, mutual understanding and an inextricable blood bond, the story unwinds and accords with one's expectation, interpolated with an awkward meet-cute, an accident (a mission goes awry), a well-intended twist (a well-earned reunion), and a morbid but enlightening escapade, which consummates in a fulfilling ode to death, life, family, growing up and finding a right way to face the reality, with the accompaniment of a dulcet SWEET CHILD O'MINE sung by Kielyr (Isler). It is always gratifying to watch a film sending the golden message of accepting each other's differences and taking a middle road in lieu of being too egoistic and mired in one's stubbornness, no one is perfect, we live and learn, the learning curve from Ben and his children can be universally transcribed to every individual's own life, we all have our blind spot, to embrace the unfamiliar territory and be inspired, it is a wholesome and horizon-broaden shortcut to one's ephemeral life span.Viggo Mortensen is such a gas in this fittingly enlightening character, affectively soul-stirring when he has to accept defeat for the sake of the children's well-being, and utterly congenital and sympathetic in other occasions, which means a lot, since Ben is a role predisposed to be saddled with megalomania and braggadocio as his dark side because of the extreme nature of his belief, but Mortensen never for one second let go of Ben's human side, squarely his performance transcends the subject itself in the end. And the film has an ace young cast too, under the tutelage of Ross (maybe by reason of this actor background), there is no overt affectation or line-reading play-acting usually can simply blemish the works of those less experienced youngsters, both MacKay and Annalise Basso (as the dauntless Vespyr) show great range with their rather unusual miens.CAPTAIN FANTASTIC is exactly those savvy and unpretentious indies you cannot help but mulling over it again and again afterwards and getting inspirations in afterthought, that is why it is worth movie critic's endless vaunting, because they can be so easily swamped by the surfeit of the available offerings churned out on a daily base. So apart from critics themselves, why on earth would anyone be willing to waste their time in watching a bad movie? Life is too fleeting for this kind of indulgence, Ben certainly would not compromise on that ground!",Captain Fantastic
20,KineticSeoul,Fantastic journey,9,10 December 2016,"I like films that has messages that touches upon both sides of the equation instead of it being biased and one sided. And that is what I enjoyed about ""Captain Fantastic"". It's a story about about a father trying to raise his kids to be King Philosophers. By trying to get them to not conform to the commercial society and way of life. And he tries to do this by educating his kids about philosophy, politics and survival skills. By Rock climbing, martial arts, skinning animals and etc. All while being secluded in the wilderness by choice. However to a certain extent the kids start to have aspirations about the outside world. So sometimes you think the father character played by Viggo Mortensen is a cool father and sometimes I thought he took it too far and is a bit of a nut case. Which I think the director was aiming for in order to show both sides, the positives and negatives of both sides of life. This film does have touching moments. Even though it can come off awkwardly or even a bit messed up at time. But still finds a way to make it endearing and whole. It's a journey that gets cerebral and despite the simpleness of it all it's still a well written story.9/10",Captain Fantastic
21,Hellmant,A great examination of extremism verses conformity!,9,17 August 2016,"'CAPTAIN FANTASTIC': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)  Indie drama flick; about a family, that has lived in isolation in the  Pacific Northwest forests (for a decade), that's forced to reenter  society when tragedy strikes. It was written and directed by actor,  turned filmmaker, Matt Ross. The film stars Viggo Mortensen; and it  features small supporting turns from Frank Langella, Steve Zahn,  Kathryn Hahn and Ann Dowd. It's been a small hit at the indie theaters,  and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans  alike. I went into the movie knowing very little about it (having not  seen a single trailer), and I really enjoyed it.  Ben and Leslie Cash (Mortensen and Trin Miller) had been living 'off  the grid', in the Washington state mountains with their six children,  for close to ten years. They taught their kids very strict survival  skills, as well as the benefits of a socialist society. When Leslie  suffers from severe bipolar disorder, and kills herself because of it,  Ben decides to take his family to her funeral, in New Mexico, despite  Leslie's father (Langella) strongly discouraging him against it. The  family's new experiences, in the conventional world, challenges all of  their staunch views on life (especially Ben's).   The movie is a great examination of extremism verses conformity; it  does a very fair job of weighing the pros and cons of each. It's also  an excellent character study, that's filled with involving  performances; especially from Viggo, but the child actors are all good  as well. It's equally funny, heart breaking and thought provoking. It's  definitely a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I  wouldn't mind revisiting it, at some point in the future. I look  forward to seeing more from Matt Ross.",Captain Fantastic
22,thesar-2,"Fantastic! But, Now I Feel Stupider",9,28 March 2017,"Oh, you Caseyhad you waited one more year and Viggo would've surely won.Funny thing about this movie: it basically told us how to feel about this movie about halfway through. If you've seen this, you know which scene I am talking about. If you paid attention.And you should've. This movie is brilliantly written, shot and wonderfully acted. Viggo Mortensen who equally deserved an Academy Award alongside Casey Affleck for Manchester By the Sea, can take a lot of credit for the incredible job he did, but damn, those kids. If you absolutely didn't believe who they portrayed they were, you've never once seen a movie.I truly went into this movie blind. Well, fine, I knew Viggo was nominated and I knew the title, but I knew nothing else. Wow, what a pleasure it is to go in completely in the dark. I had seen no trailer, nor read the synopsis. And I urge you to do the same.Sure, I told you there is a dad. Some kids. But, go into this as cold as I did and come back thinking in many different directions. Right/wrong. Smart/Smart phone. Real world/REAL world. There is gray everywhere here and the lines are gloriously blurred. I LOVED this movie. I started my review stating how I felt ""stupider."" Well, that's because I grew up in the system and not having such an influence as the kids did. But, now I do feel smarter after seeing this movie. My eyes have been opened. My thoughts expanded. This needs to be seen and absorbed by all. See it now. You will see it as fantastic as I dideven if you don't agree.***Final thoughts: This made the disagree, agree.

23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Refreshingly honest and heartfelt; a touching, beautiful and wonderfully eccentric film.",8,2 March 2018,"'Captain Fantastic (2016)' is a refreshingly honest and heartfelt feature which manages to be surprisingly emotional, almost making me tear up on a couple of occasions, and isn't simply signified by its intrinsic eccentricity (so often used as a marketing trick) but rather infinitely enhanced by it. The narrative never becomes clichéd or rote and the excellent performances always keep the sometimes outlandish happenings both grounded and wonderful. Once it reaches its apparently promised conclusion, however, it slows down and starts to head in a slightly generic, if necessary, direction. Thankfully, though, the emotional core still remains and it isn't long before the film is back to its own off-kilter brand of heart-felt shenanigans as it moves towards an off-base finale which, though it could be somewhat morbid in lesser hands, is here truly touching and a beautiful note on which to end. 8/10",Captain Fantastic
24,bowmanblue,Not to be confused with Steve Rogers,7,18 July 2017,"'Captain Fantastic' is a film that I've had on my radar for quite some time. I'd heard all good things about it before I sat down to watch it, so this normally meant that I find myself totally let down with what I got. And, what I got was not what I expected. I'll admit to enjoying it and being glad that I have seen it, however, despite my good feelings towards it, I'm not sure it's the sort of film that would inspire a repeat viewing any time soon. Viggo Mortensen (always worth a watch) plays a single father who looks after his children 'on the land' as you could call it. They live together deep in a forest and have little to know contact with what we would describe as 'civilisation.' Here, Viggo teaches his brood how to survive using only nature and basic survival techniques that you wouldn't get in your average comprehensive. And they're thriving – sort of. They all agree with this way of life, but largely because it's all they've ever known. And, no matter how cool, Viggo is, he didn't raise them on his own. Early on we find that the children's mother is in hospital and, sadly, she doesn't come out again. This is the catalyst which launches the family on a road trip to her home town (and awaiting parents who really don't agree with their daughter's lifestyle) for her funeral. So, what you end up with is a real clash of cultures. Obviously the father once lived among us 'norms' and most likely owned a mobile phone, mortgage and worked 9-5. However, his children haven't and we see how they react to this alien world.I wonder whether people see this film differently if they have or haven't got children. Personally, as a parent, I understood the father's desire to want to shelter his children from all the 'horrors' of the modern world. No one wants to see their children exposed to dull, soulless 9-5 jobs, rubbish girlfriend/boyfriends and generally people who want to do them down at every turn. However, as much as we want to wrap our children up and shield them from everything negative, we have to allow them the freedom to make their own mistakes. This is the lesson of the film. Not to mention how different people react to different ideals. It's fair to say that Viggo's father-ion-law is not particularly happy with his son-in-law showing up and insisting that the funeral is held according to wishes of a dead person who can no longer confirm how she wanted to be mourned.It's all quite deep and high drama and I can see why such praise was heaped on it. It asks questions about the way we live and the pros and cons of various lifestyles. However, as I said at the beginning, despite liking it, I just found it's not something I could watch again anytime soon. In a few years time if I see that it's on the telly and nothing else is on, I'll definitely watch it again. Just not worth buying on Blu-ray at full price.",Captain Fantastic
25,ThomasDrufke,"Power to the People, Stick it to the Man",9,14 December 2016,"I feel like I should be writing this review in pencil on a sheet of paper considering the subject matter of Captain Fantastic. It challenges social norms, provides thought provoking solutions, and boasts one of the most impressive ensembles of the year. Captain Fantastic gives the 'awakening' story a new setting in what is definitely the most unique film of 2016.Viggo Mortensen doesn't do blockbusters films anymore. I think we all miss his days in Middle Earth, but I consistently find his projects to be fascinating. And there's one thing you can always say about him, he commits. Luckily, he has an entire family worth of committed actors at his fingertips here. Mortensen plays a father of 6, whose view on parenting comes into questioning when his wife kills herself. That's a general premise for Captain Fantastic, but it's far from telling the whole story. It's really a family's adventure to awakening.Although I don't believe there's any way I could live the way the kids do in this film; essentially living in a forest with merely a sharp knife at their behest. There's something to be said about a more simplistic lifestyle and one that involves more learning from print than our screens. I'm no angel when it comes to the overuse of social media or other electronic-related items, but I do enjoy a day outdoors. And really, who's to say that a life without all the technologically advanced items wouldn't be a better life? I loved the way this film tackled these issues. What truly is a sheltered life vs a non- sheltered life really mean? Is it better to be sheltered from the truth or lies told to us to keep us safer?It's no wonder this film is getting recognition for its tremendous cast. This film is built around the cast's strengths. Mortensen and company made sure that this doesn't feel like a movie at all, but a journey you're going on with this family. I think that's one of the greatest compliments a film and its cast can receive, that they feel like real people experiencing real things. It's a truly remarkable tale of a father who's ways of parenting are challenged, and the lengths a family will go to secure what they believe in isn't tarnished by those who believe differently. Aside from some clichéd dialogue in the midst of conflicts, Captain Fantastic is a flawless film.+Refreshingly original+Ensemble cast is great together+Emotional journey of awakening+Social commentary9.3/10",Captain Fantastic

Stick it to the man!""The life shown out in the wilderness is beautiful but heavily idealized, which was a detractor for me at first, but I loved how we gradually see just how flawed the father is. As much as I loved his worldview and his blunt honesty with his children, we can clearly find truth in some of his loathsome, affluent father-in-law's points, which is to the film's credit. The film gets a little cheesy in how it plays out, but it was really nice to compare the authenticity of the cremation scene with the phoniness of the earlier church service, and hear the father's final words of advice to his eldest son (starting with ""When you have sex with a woman, be gentle and listen to her."") The anti-religion, anti-corporation, anti-materialism type themes were all wonderful, even if the film lacked a little in its artistry. Fine performances from the kids in the cast too, led by George MacKay (the eldest son) and Samantha Isler (""Sweet Child O' Mine"").",Captain Fantastic

This is probably the first movie in my lifetime after of which the credits started to roll over and i said to myself - WOW, but didn't voted it 10/10. As a pure film experience, this is perfect 10/10 - i was glued to my screen for all almost 2 hours, i was highly involved into the story, loved the acting, writing, directing and it didn't dragged for a moment and i wasn't expected for this movie to be this great. This is a great film.But then, the inconsistencies of this movie, more to say the story itself or what it wanted to show kept my away from a perfect score. The story itself isn't unique, but its a great one - reminded my of ""Into the Wild"" sort of. While i saw the trailer of this film back in a movie theater, i really found this movie to much, much more great then the trailer showed us. This is a much more deep story then it looks like from a first view, and it is a one that it should be discussed, should be remembered more then once after witnessing this movie. Overall, ""Captain Fantastic"" is an amazing film that will no matter what your favorite genre is will keep you glued to the screen. Isn't this is all of what it takes for movie great?

She is gone and will not come back, but she is in agreement with the fact that he has to bring them up alone. They have left society and live freely in the realm of nature, he training his children to survive in wilderness and manage their lives in social independence and freedom, also educating them freely and teaching them to read any books and languages - they know french and German among other languages. They manage all right although shut out of society, his father-in-law promising to have him arrested if he tries to come to his wife's funeral with his children. She visits him in his dreams and calls him Captain Fantastic, entirely endorsing his and his family's way of life. Yet this is no hippy narrative but rather an interesting experiment of existentialism, their guru being Noam Chomsky.
Viggo Mortensen makes a fantastic performance as the father, but also the others act marvellously, especially the children and Frank Langella as the grandfather, who plays a very important role. Above all, it's an immensely beautiful and endearing film with all the lovliest landscapes of Washington and New Mexico, and it gradually develops into a drama of a funeral. There is much philosophy as well, as the deceased was a Buddhist wih very determined views, which have consequences. The music is also quite interesting, as their favourite music actually is Bach, but there are other tunes as well. I guess you could ultimately after all call it something of a modern hippie tale, but it is very serious and philosophical which must result in considerable afterthoughts and discussions.

32,Reno-Rangan,"Surviving isn't just a good education, but needs the physical training.",8,4 November 2016,"This is from a supporting actor turned a director who is just one film old before this. So he wrote and directed this beautiful film. One of the best films of the years that should be in must see list. It was just like the film 'Alabama Moon', only the initial plot that extended for over the hundred minutes. The first thing is the cast, it was the best combination. Lots of future stars are here. It was more like a road movie, except in the opening few minutes.I did not like the entire film, I found a couple of things uncomfortable. Like the killing a deer in the opening scene and the end part. The conclusion was good, I thought it was the best solution for such a story, not for the theme. But then the final shot gave me an impression that they had got compromised. After all these years hard work, I felt they had given up. That did not stop me from enjoying it and recommending it to the others. Still, it is a very unique film that tried its best to avoid the usual cliché.This is the story of a father of six kids, raising them by his own outside the society in the wilderness. But the children are not left behind on the knowledge of the world, especially the philosophies theirs favourite topic. They are bright, as well as tough and can survive in any condition. One day when they get a message that their mother died, the journey begins to attend the funeral and during their way all the adventures are what we're going to witness.Due to the copyright issue the birthday song was altered. Surprisingly, the film was not based on any book. So my utmost appreciation goes to the creator of this wonderful product. Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts.At some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective. I mean having lots of main characters as children, the film is not good for their watch. Though the adults should not miss it, even though you are a religious person or any other kind.

33,sol-,Captains Courageous,6,22 January 2017,"Having chosen to raise his six children ""off the grid"", an avid survivalist gradually realises how unprepared his kids are for the real world when they visit the city to attend a funeral in this comedy starring Viggo Mortensen. Early on, one of Mortensen's daughters provides an astute analysis of Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita', citing that the book is disturbing because you are positioned to sympathise with and care for a man whose actions are wrong. The same could curiously be said for this film and its 'hero'. Mortensen's Ben is motivated by all the right ideas regarding nonconformity, regular exercise, literature and so on, however, at the same time, he also encourages antisocial behaviour (stealing) and almost gets one of his daughters killed in a 'rescue mission'. Most tellingly, the kids cannot interact properly with others their own age, unaware of social conventions and oblivious to popular culture. Compelling as all this is, the film unfortunately only ever explores Ben's two oldest sons in any depth. The two eldest sisters are completely interchangeable, while his youngest son and daughter are only characterised by their own offbeat 'cute' habits: he likes to prance around naked; she likes to wear a gas mask. That said, George MacKay and Nicholas Hamilton are both solid as the two sons with well written characters, both of whom stand up to their father. Solid supporting performances from the likes of Frank Langella and Steven Zahn further ensure that the film has a solid dramatic backbone even if the way the film shies over the other four kids never quite feels right.",Captain Fantastic
34,tomgillespie2002,One of the most touching films of the year,8,20 November 2016,"At first glance, Matt Ross' Captain Fantastic appears to be yet another low-budget independent, festival-friendly effort from a former actor that employs a 'quirky' sensibility and approach to humour, as well as roughing up a popular actor and having them play against type. Yet this tale of a family raised as survivalists by their liberal father who is attempting to shield them from the consumerist society he loathes is one of the most touching films of the year, and one that is careful not to over-simplify the difficult subject matter of how to raise your kids. While it seems at first to be leaning heavily towards a purer existence of hunting and learning, it also ponders the dangers of inexperience.Somewhere deep in the forests of the Pacific Northwest live the Cash clan. Father Ben (Viggo Mortensen) runs a right ship, teaching his six children (three boys and three girls) how to survive off the grid, hunting what they need to eat and reading everything from Chomsky to Dostoyevsky, having become tired and disillusioned with the materialism of capitalist American life. When the film begins, Ben wife's Leslie (Trin Miller) is suffering from bipolar disorder, hospitalised miles away near her wealthy father-in-law Jack (Frank Langella). When she kills herself, Ben is told by Jack to stay away from the funeral or else he will be arrested, Believing his children should not be shielded from the harsh truths of life, Ben informs his brood bluntly of how their mother died. All of Ben's children accept their way of life except for Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), who openly rebels against his father. It's here that Ross highlights the hypocrisy of Ben's regime, as for a father who so smugly encourages free-thinking and open-mindedness, he rules the roost with an iron fist, with any undermining of his authority quickly stamped out. Seeing his children are grieving, Ben goes against Jack's wishes and embarks on a road trip in order to give his wife the burial she wanted, and it's on this journey that we see just how detached these children have become. While the youngest daughter can make a mockery of their older cousins' education with a word-for-word rendition of the Bill of Rights from memory, eldest son Bodevine (George MacKay) cannot speak to girls, proposing to one he meets a couple of hours after meeting her.Captain Fantastic is also very funny, with the biggest laughs coming from a no-nonsense sex education lesson and the sight of Mortensen's todger. It also features some fantastic performances all-round from a group of youngsters who are surely destined for bigger things in the future, as well as Mortensen's career-best. Stubborn and arguably selfish, yet resilient and a genuinely loving father, his character is thrown through the emotional ringer as this survivalist superman undergoes a powerful awakening when the real world starts to creep in. At just shy of 2 hours, it's too long, with the energy of the first three-quarters clearly running low as it slogs along to the ambiguous final scene. Still, this is thought-provoking drama and laugh-out- loud comedy for the majority, with a film-maker to watch at the helm.",Captain Fantastic
35,howard.schumann,Does not promote any serious reflection,6,5 December 2016,"In Matt Ross' Captain Fantastic a family has opted for a simple life in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, turning their backs on what they consider to be a corrupt system that supports an inauthentic way of being in the world. The children, Bodevan (George MacKay), Kieyler (Samantha Isler), Vespyr (Annalise Basso), Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), Zaja (Shree Crooks), and Nai (Charlie Shotwell) are united in their disdain for consumer culture and the quest for status. They are well versed in philosophy, history and quantum theory, and can hunt for food and show impressive physical skills. Their politics are decidedly outside of the mainstream. Instead of celebrating Christmas, they pay homage to progressive author Noam Chomsky on his birthday, while 18-year-old Bo, the oldest son, proclaims he is neither a Trotsky-ist or a Trotsky-ite but a Maoist. The superhero Captain Fantastic in this scenario is father Ben (Viggo Mortensen) who assists the family in developing survival skills, leading the children in exercises worthy of marine boot camp. At night, to their credit, they sit around the campfire at night reading classic literature and discuss weighty topics such as capitalism and how they see the world. Apparently they have little use for religion, especially Christians and Christianity, but do have a fondness for Buddhism, a religion in vogue right now. The clan is shaken to its core when Ben tells the family without sugar coating it that their mother Leslie, a victim of bipolar disease, has committed suicide. Though she has been hospitalized for three months, nothing is said about anyone in the family visiting her in the hospital, not an example of Buddhist compassion. According to Leslie's will, she requested to be cremated and Ben intends to carry out her wishes in spite of strong opposition from Leslie's wealthy father (Frank Langella) who organizes a Christian funeral service for his daughter. Ben and the children pile into their rickety school bus and head to New Mexico determined to rescue their mother from the grave and the film suddenly becomes a high energy road trip with a few challenging adventures along the way. Mortensen is impressive in the role of Ben as are the actors who play his children and, as usual, Langella is convincing in his role as a wealthy man who is seemingly the epitome of unrestrained capitalist excess. While Ben is a loving father who eventually entertains the strange notion of compromise, he is basically little more than a caricature, an idealized fantasy figure who creates what the director must think a sixties commune must have been like. Ben is raising his children to be independent thinkers but does not create any space for them to question his authority, and the semi-robotic kids mouth their father's ideas rather than their own thoughts (Lolita notwithstanding).What is unfortunate is that these ideas do have meaning. In the proper context, ""Power to the people"" is much more than a mindless slogan. While the children are home schooled and appear to be very well educated, they do not seem to have the skills to engage in the world outside of their enclave. Bodevan, for example, accepted in some of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer singlehandedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without immediately proposing to her. While the ideals that the film espouses are important, here they are trivialized to the point of seeming shallow and phony and there is no discussion of what the word integrity means. Killing an animal is a pathway to manhood? Robbing a supermarket is ""sticking it to the man?"" Tolerance is another casualty. ""We don't laugh at people"" Ben tells the children during the road trip ""except Christians."" While there is a legitimate discussion about conventional and unconventional ways to raise children, Captain Fantastic does not promote any serious reflection. Perhaps if this holier than thou family would come out of the wilderness and participate in making a difference in the real world we could be getting someplace.",Captain Fantastic

Where problems exist is when other people believe there is one way to achieve this and that one way is theirs.For me this was the crux of this movie, what rights do others have to interfere in the environment you create for your children?There are strong arguments to mount from all sides, particularly in terms of child welfare.Personally however I tend to believe if you can't build your family how you want to then you have no freedoms at all.The movie is amazing, the cast delivers with such passion for the story that you easily get swept up in it.",Captain Fantastic
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Thought-provoking in ways both artistic and heavy-handed, enhanced by Viggo Mortensen",8,10 May 2017,"Plenty of movies satirize or poke holes in the way we live our lives, but filmmaker Matt Ross takes the slightly unconventional approach by telling a story not from within modern living, but from well beyond its walls.""Captain Fantastic"" takes us instead into the Washington state wilderness where Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) raises his family of six oddly named children whose mother is sick in the hospital. The children receive rigorous physical conditioning and survival skill- building during most of the day and are also fed a diet of textbooks and literature, making them stronger and smarter than anyone their age. They do things like celebrate ""Noam Chomsky Day"" instead of Christmas and have all their father's beliefs and platitudes about the outside world permanently etched into their brains.The family – and Ben – is forced to reconcile with society when Ben gets news that the mother has died. His in-laws (Frank Langhella and Ann Dowd), blaming Ben's influence on their daughter for her death, threaten him if he should come to New Mexico for the funeral, so Ben and the family take Steve (the family bus) on a road trip to ""save mom,"" who was philosophically Buddhist and wished to be cremated, not buried following a ""proper"" Christian ceremony.In the way he tells this story, Ross paints a rather ""pros and cons"" portrait of this alternative parenting style. When the family visits their cousins en route to the funeral, Ross juxtaposes these kids with their electronics-addicted cousins and it becomes clear the ways in which Ben's parenting is superior. Later in the movie, the pendulum swings to the other side and we see how Ben's decisions have clearly adverse effects. It's a bit of a stiff, methodical approach to what is otherwise an idea very worth exploring.Helping to break down the lines of these ""Exhibit A,"" ""Exhibit B"" types of scenes is Mortensen's performance. Nothing about his performance is dictated by moments in which he is meant to look like a great parent and moments he's meant to look like a selfish one. He is all those things in every scene and the way the story forces him to reconcile with his parenting choices gives him lots of room to work with and convey the movie's most important questions. Ross ends up serving his main character answers to those questions on a perfect platter, but Mortensen makes the journey worthwhile.Ross' approach is far more mainstream than an indie titled ""Captain Fantastic"" (no idea why it's called that) would lead you to believe, which means it can be recommended to audiences with broader tastes. Although it can't quite be recommended for family viewing due to the mature themes, swearing and full-frontal male nudity, the film's humor and drama are both very accessible and its themes far from esoteric. For example, a scene in which the family stays at a trailer park and the oldest child (George MacKay) becomes taken with a young woman (Erin Moriarty) plays out in a way you might expect for a teenager who has never been in a romantic situation before. The humor and endearing nature of this sequence would make sense to anyone, as do many of the other jokes positioned around these sheltered children's exposure to standard societal living. There are even a few amusing ways that the family makes standard societal people extremely uncomfortable, which will make viewers think more deeply about why certain things are considered taboo and why the rules are the rules.At the heart of ""Captain Fantastic,"" even in its most two- dimensional moments, is an understanding that there is no right or wrong way to live, and there is no right or wrong way to be a parent. And frankly, your kids will resent you no matter how you raise them, though ideally they'll love you in equal measure. Ross wraps this up in a little too neat of a bow, but the story is relevant, genuinely thought- provoking and Mortensen's crystallizes all of it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

38,Vartiainen,Excellent film about the pros and cons of detaching yourself from modern society,8,17 September 2020,"Captain Fantastic is a film about Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six children who are living in the wilderness, almost completely detached from modern society. The children have been taught to hunt, forage and live off the land, but also to read, debate and think way above their years. In the words of the children's mother, Leslie (Trin Miller), they are growing up to be philosopher kings. But then this idyllic paradise of theirs gets shattered when Leslie dies and they have to leave in order to attend her funeral in her once hometown.The film's views on modern Western way of life is rather critical, but it also softens this argument by presenting Ben's solution as problematic. The children are all precocious and well-read, with the physical capabilities of Olympic athletes, but they're also naive and ill-suited to make it outside their woodland home. This is most prevalent in Bo (George MacKay), the eldest of the children, who's on the cusp of manhood and most ready to leave and spread his wings. The only problem being that he has very little idea about how to socialize with someone who cannot discuss university level social philosophies with him.The family's journey into modern society has its ups and downs, its laughs and sorrows. It is very humorous when it needs to be, mostly at the expense of modern society and its foibles, but it's also a poignant look into the problems of modern day consumerism.That being said, the film's last third is problematic. Or at least not told as well as the first two thirds. It's almost like the film ran out of time and suddenly rushed into a happy ending, while completely forgetting, sidelining or outright ignoring many of the problems and conflicts introduced earlier in the film. Ben's personal journey into realizing that he may have gone just a teeny tiny overboard with his escapism is also tied off a bit too neatly for it to feel realistic.Still, it is a fine film to watch. Its premise and ideas are rather extreme, but they're also thought-provoking and interesting to watch. The ending could have been better, a lot better if we're being honest, but even then I'd recommend it.",Captain Fantastic

40,paul-allaer,One of the best movies of the year so far,9,30 July 2016,"""Captain Fantastic"" (2016 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Ben and his 6 kids. As the movie opens, we are looking onto the breath-taking landscapes of western Washington. The camera then zooms in on a deer, and before we know it, the deer is killed by a brutal knifing (with audible gasps in the theater audience). It turns out to be Ben's oldest son. Ben exclaims proudly ""today a boy is dead, in his place is a man!"". We get to know Ben and the 6 kids, ranging from 17 to about 7 or 8 in age, as they live completely off the grid. As we wonder ""where is Ben's wife/the mom?"", we learn that Leslie is in the hospital due to bipolar disorder. One day Ben drives into town to call the hospital to see how Leslie is doing... At this point we're not event 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature length from actor/writer/director Matt Ross, who previously directed the under the radar ""28 Hotel Rooms"". Here he brings something completely different, and a social experiment at that: what if you raise a family completely off the grid, in a utopian but clear anti-capitalistic setting, without any interaction with the ""real"" world, and what would happen if at one point those children are forced to confront the ""real"" world. Fascinating idea, and one that Ross examines quite nicely. The movie excels even more due to the performance of Viggo Mortensen, which is out of this world, but truth be told: the six kids are quite outstanding as well. The movie is pretty much perfect for the first 90 min., but then struggles to come to a reasonable conclusion, regretfully. There is also an outstanding score for this movie, courtesy of Alex Somers and performed by Somers and Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Apart from the score, there are a number of other good song placements throughout the movie (but not Elton John's ""Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy"", if you were wondering). Can't wait to check out the soundtrack.""Captain Fantastic"" won Matt Ross the best director award in the ""Un Certain Regard"" showing at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I am happy to say. It seems that, other than the gasps in the opening scene of the movie, the audience really enjoyed the movie. I know I did. If you are interested in a very solid family drama with a unique social experiment, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Captain Fantastic"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Captain Fantastic
41,subxerogravity,Captain Fantastic is a very amusing look at trying to find a balance between two different worlds.,8,10 July 2016,"Mortensen plays Ben, A father of six children, whose wife suffers from  mental illness and Ben thought it would be good for her and the kids to  live out in the wild, living off the land and tossing the rules of our  society out the window. However, Ben's wife did not get better.  Captain Fantastic mostly focuses on the children. On a road trip  towards their mother's funeral, they get a culture clash with the rest  of the world. It lays out all the info for the question of weather  these kids were raised right or raise wrong.  Captain Fantastic starts off showing you the children's lifestyle, were  organic met growing and hunting your own food and made their own  clothes and were home schooled.  Then they come into society where everyone looks at them as if they are  freaks, but why is it weird that these kids don't know the name brand  of sneakers? The look on their faces when they experienced Street  Fighter for the first time makes sense when your not use to such  things. Besides, it's a shame on our Society that an 8 year old can  comprehend the Bill of Rights better than those older than her.  Watching these kids tackle the woods than watching them adapt to  society was a bit of an eye opener. Some times the movie punches you in  the gut, like when the talk about religious ""organizations"" and how Fat  everyone in the city seems to be, but the blow is softer cause it's  coming from children.  But Captain Fantastic is not all one sided, detailing some down  qualities of living in the wild , like the eldest son's overzealous  first encounter with the opposite sex or the fact that It was the  parents choice to live out in the woods, not the child's.  Mortensen played the part well of a man who sometimes got too clouded  by his beliefs of doing the right thing by his family and who sometimes  went to far to prove a point.  Also like Frank Langella's character, the father who just lost his  daughter and blames his son-in-law. It's was good cause you really know  people like the character he plays.  Steve Zahn and Kathryn Hahn were also terrific in the movie playing yin  to Ben's yang, as parents who don't fully see eye to eye with what he's  doing.  Overall, everyone has a upbringing different from everyone else and  Captain Fantastic takes that statement to a different level, but at  it's core, he's just a parent who loves his children and is trying to  do the best he can in a difficult time. This theme radiates from  Mortensen and the rest of the cast, which is what makes it so  Fantastic.",Captain Fantastic
42,jtindahouse,A beautiful and powerful film,10,6 February 2017,"I really wasn't too sure what to expect going into 'Captain Fantastic'. I had managed to avoid all trailers for it and decided not to even read the synopsis before watching it. Basically the poster was all I had to go by, which didn't offer a tremendous amount as you'd expect. Then the film began and I got a little worried. These were not the type of people I could easily relate to, and that can sometimes make for a hard viewing experience. However, it turned out that there in lied the film's biggest strength. You don't have to be able to be able to relate to them, because you can understand them. Once I realised this, it turned into quite a truly beautiful film.Viggo Mortensen has been nominated for Best Actor in a Lead Role at the Academy Awards and it couldn't be more deserved. He absolutely sold me. The type of character he was playing could so very easily come across as unlikable, and yet Mortensen never allows that to happen. Instead, the audience is always on his side and he is a huge part in them being able to understand the characters motivations and actions. The entire cast was absolutely fantastic it would have to be said. With this many young/child actors and actresses, how they avoided any weak link is beyond me, but it is a fantastic effort.'Captain Fantastic' is a very powerful film. The subject matter is heavy and it is handled absolutely perfectly by writer/director Matt Ross. It never feels like his sole motivation is to effect us an audience, and yet he manages to with a combination of some quite beautifully done scenes and some tremendous character interaction. I was absolutely sold by this film and I suspect most people who watch it will be too. One not to be missed.",Captain Fantastic
43,Turfseer,Mortensen shines as survivalist parent despite awkward but forgivable denouement,7,13 January 2017,"A few minutes into Captain Fantastic, you're beginning to believe this a true story. Actually it's not! According to writer/director Matt Ross, it's based on his experiences being raised by a mother whom he describes not as a hippie but more like an artisan, in rural areas way off the beaten path. And then there's Ross's experience as a parent himself. He melds both together and voila!—out emerges an indie ""dramedy"" wholly original in content and delivery.Viggo Mortensen, in a dynamic, award-winning performance, plays Ben Cash (aka Captain Fantastic), a survivalist parent who is committed to raising a brood of kids out in the wilderness in Washington State. Ben is an odd blend of a crazy Ted Nugent hunter-type who ""initiates"" his eldest son Bodevan into manhood by killing a deer and having him eat its heart and admirer of Noam Chomsky, who he honors with a ""Noam Chomsky Day"" in place of Christmas.The first third of the film reveals Ben to be scrupulously honest with his kids and never embarrassed to talk openly with them about such things as sexuality and issues of morality. His Achilles heel is that he pushes the kids too far on a physical level, and at one point his younger son, Rellian, seriously injures his hand during a rock climbing exercise.The break into the Second Act occurs when Ben learns that his estranged wife--hospitalized for bipolar illness and possible post-partum depression--commits suicide. Scrupulously honest Ben bluntly tells the children that their mother is dead and everyone naturally is quite broken up. The clan decides to attend their mother's funeral despite Ben being banned from showing up by grandfather Jack (sharply played by one of the stage and screen's most gifted actors, Frank Langella).The decision to leave the wilderness and mix with the denizens of the ""civilized"" world leads the children into a state of cognitive dissonance—just as they have contempt for many of the values of ""capitalist society,"" they also are attracted to the positive things that such a society has to offer. This especially holds true for Bodevan, whose sexual instincts are suddenly awakened, when he meets an attractive teenager from a trailer park who's enamored with his odd style of ""intellectual communication.""Unlike many indies today with their underdeveloped plots, Captain Fantastic actually has a narrative that features a suspenseful buildup to the dark moment at the end of the second Act. That occurs after Ben and family disrupt their mother's funeral and Ben orders daughter Vespyr to climb up Jack's roof in an effort to ""save"" Rellian, who has now sworn allegiance to his grandparents and rejected Ben for his purported lousy treatment of their mother. Vespyr falls off the roof and thankfully only sustains a concussion—the doctor at the hospital informs Ben that she was one inch from being killed or paralyzed.This incident causes Ben to realize that he was molding the kids in his own image and not allowing them to develop their potential naturally. He agrees to leave the kids with Jack and drives off believing he'll no longer be involved in raising them.Unfortunately Ross fails to tie up all the loose ends and we're left with a convoluted Act 3. It's all very awkward but somehow the kids change their mind about staying with grandpa and ensconce themselves under the floorboards of the family bus (including Vespyr, still in a cast!) And what about Jack? For some reason he doesn't bother notifying the police in order to try and regain custody of the children.Next the kids insist on traipsing over to the cemetery where they dig up their mother's body and cremate her according to the desires spelled out in her last will and testament (there's a real ""kumbaya"" moment as the children sing while their mother's corpse burns on their makeshift funeral pyre!). The ashes are also flushed down the toilet at an airport, also according to the mother's wishes. The family ends up still in ""Woodstock"" heaven, raising organic vegetables on a regular farm but now attending a school, no longer being home-schooled by Ben.It's sort of the too ""happy"", sentimental ending you'd expect from a film like this, but the rest of Ross's hippie narrative is so wonderfully original and quite a bit of it believable, that the awkward wrap-up hardly detracts from the film's overall rating, deserving of fairly high ratings in the Indie dramedy pantheon.",Captain Fantastic
44,billcr12,Super Dad,8,6 November 2016,"Viggo Mortensen is the hippy, left wing, Noam Chomsky worshiping father of six children, ranging from about eight to eighteen. His unorthodox methods of child rearing are unusual to say the least. They live in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, growing their own food and surviving with the skills of 18th century native Americans. The opening scene shows a deer foraging in the forest, seemingly at peace in its beautiful and serene surroundings. This changes quickly as the buck is tackled with the efficiency of an NFL linebacker and killed with a large knife by a adolescent boy in war paint. Viggo congratulates the boy and tells him that he is now a man. More exercises in mountain climbing, hand to hand combat and medical care follow. They are home schooled, with an emphasis on classic literature with oral book reports expected by their demanding dad. Mom is away at a hospital for what later turns out to be a mental illness(surprise, surprise). More bizarre adventures occur, leading up to one of strangest finale I have ever seen. I will not spoil it by giving it away, but it left me shaking my head in disbelief. Mortensen is great, as usual, and the kids are also well cast. The only other recognizable actor on screen is Frank Langella near the end. This is an extremely political film, and so one's personal views will affect the viewers opinion of it. Mortensen campaigned for Ralph Nader for president during the Gore- Bush election, and so his character is in alignment with his real life views. Overall, a well written and thought provoking movie.",Captain Fantastic

It's the kind of movie in which you find yourself planning a re-watch during the first viewing. It's not that its plot is complicated, or hard to understand. It's that the little details glimpsed in the movie are intriguing and interesting.Viggo Mortensen plays a dad who has home-schooled his kids and raised them off the grid. They travel in an old bus and live in the wilderness where they learn all kinds of survival skills, as well as more academic stuff. The youngest kid is only about seven, and yet is shown to have superior knowledge of US politics than mainstream educated kids twice her age.The seemingly idyllic setting is challenged when Mortensen's wife has to be hospitalised for bipolar disorder and later takes her own life. The family wish to give her the Buddhist send-off she wanted, and butt heads with her father, played by Frank Langella, who thinks the kids should be raised in a mainstream institution.The movie is an intriguing, involving study of a family who lives entirely outside the norm, and it feels entirely believable.",Captain Fantastic
46,meeza,Viggo was (what's the word?)... FAAAAANTASTIC!!!!,8,27 December 2016,"Look at him, look at him, he is the Captain now. I am referring to Viggo Mortensen's character nature-dad Ben Cash (i.e. Captain Fantastic) in the film ""Captain Fantastic"". Cash is a father of six, who raises his 6 children in an unorthodox naturistic method with intense physical & intellectual education in the Pacific Northwest. When tragedy occurs, Cash has to hit the road with his six, and then consequently must make some tough decisions on continuing his nature daddy ways. Mortensen was nothing short of fantastic and deserves a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his natural performance. The actors that play the six kids were phenomenal also; most notably George MacKay as the eldest son Bo. Frank Langella puts in another frankly fine performance as Cash's father-in-law. Writer-Director Matt Ross might have gone a tad too fantastical, but still delivers the filmmaking nature goods with his steady orchestration and scribe of the picture. So go natuuurale, and check in with ""Captain Fantastic"". **** Good",Captain Fantastic

It made me think though.The story follows Viggo Mortenson as a devoted father raising his six kids off the grid in a forest in the Pacific Northwest. Their training is physically rigorous and highly intellectual, they often live off the land. After a tragedy the family embarks on a road trip to New Mexico where the kids are forced to interact with the outside world for the first time, challenging Dad's ideas of what it means to be a parent. As always Viggo does a great job, shows his penis randomly -I saw enough of that in Eastern Promises.The bus trip is interesting and entertaining, watching the kids fascination with the world. What's wrong with the people why are they all so fat? haha and then the cousins with their violent video games and lazy smart ass attitude. I felt sorry for Dad, he is so torn when Frank Langella (the father in law) wants to take the kids.

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Makes you think, feel and then some",10,13 September 2016,"Somewhere deep in the rugged mountainsides of the Pacific Northwest, a mother and father have chosen to raise their five children off the grid, away from society and by a completely different set of rules and customs than anyone in our day and age is used to. Viggo Mortensen doesn't take on just any film, and in fact since his breakout role in Lord of The Rings which allowed him some clout, he's done nothing but carefully thought out, worthwhile cinema, Captain Fantastic being probably one of the best. He is intense and caring as Ben, an intellectual renaissance man who has been bitterly put off of capitalism and commercialism. His wife (Trin Miller, angelic in flashbacks) is mentally ill and eventually passes away, leaving him on his own with the brood. He does what he knows best, sticking to the rigid physical and academic education plan in place for them. They learn to hunt wild game with homemade tools, read from classics like Lolita and Brothers Karamazov every evening, grow all their own grains and vegetation, practice complex defense, combat and survival skills, and live a life of elemental potency, far from the lemming's march of consumerism just beyond their verdant and very isolated homeland. Trouble has a way of finding paradise though, however well it hides, and here it arrives in the simplest form of all: the absence of a mother. Things aren't the same following her death, and they all take up arms and head south to New Mexico for her funeral, in a big old repurpoused school bus. They're the most eccentric family you've ever met, and the ironic part is they're the closest thing to what we were meant to live like in this world you'll find. The real absurdity is the technicolor strip mall fast food fever dream we inhabit today, far removed from our earthy origins. It's just because it's become so commonplace that it seems normal to us. The family clashes spectacularly with an unprepared outside world, who react to their behaviour in many different ways. The children all have the physique of of a professional athlete and the scholarly abilities of six college professors, but somewhere along the way Ben forgot to teach them about what matters most: How to interact with one another, how to care for and love another human, and the simple social cues one aquires from growing up around a large number of people. His jaded father in law (knockout work from Frank Langella) sees Ben as a loose cannon, a danger to his grandchildren and the cause of his daughter's death. At one point the film levels out and let's us see things in a completely objective way: yes, there are extreme benefits to a method of raising children like this, an experience that no one else could have and an implementation of their human potential that goes several degrees farther than what most of us get. But how far is too far? Is there a dangerous element to their training and conditioning that goes beyond what they're capable of and poses a threat? Mortensen is a picture of conflict, his undying love for his children tested when he's thrown out of the comfort cocoon he has forged for them. Suddenly he is not the all knowing protector they've gotten used to, and the world outside is just as much a cause of fear for him as it is for them. They are a family though, which is achingly, evidently clear in each performance. George Mackay is the eldest and bears the brunt of realization when it comes time to meet other people. The others, including Annaliese Basso, Shree Crooks, Nicholas Hamilton and Samantha Isler are all sensational and have a lived in, well worn and often quite hilarious dynamic. It's essentially a fish out of water story, that begs us to question both the water and the land, and how going from one environment to the other, both worlds apart but in the same realm, can affect a human being. This is the best film I have seen so far this year, one that challenges us to ponder what we see unfold, urges us to be more than just another fish in the school, but to laugh, be crazy, think for ourselves and pitch in an effort to find the scattered pieces of the puzzle we call the human condition. Fantastic is the word indeed.",Captain Fantastic

In the wilderness the kids undergo a severe physical and mental training but they seem to enjoy life until tragedy strikes.Promoted as a movie that offers fair criticism both of the American way of life and of its opposite, ""Captain Fantastic"" is quite a disappointment. Its core message seems that Americans are fat and ignorant - which may be the case - but their opponents are brainwashed survivalists who can only exploit the society they despise so much.Ben's character, played by a remarkable Mortensen, is a bit of a bully and very arrogant. He completely disregards the fact that people live in societies, or at least in social groups and his kids are a bunch of socially inept intellectuals.The two elderly daughters and the two young kids are superfluous characters. The plot could have made with only one teenage daughter and one young kid. The others are just duplicates. I guess a little crowd was needed to give the impression of a wider social network.Only the two elderly boys have some relevance in the plot. Bo, the eldest, wants to break out and shows some interest in sex, while Rellian blames his father for mum's death - but only slightly. However, if Ben lived in the forest with only that couple of boys, it would look creepier and more lonely.Ben's lifestyle is sustainable only for the young and the fit - and the asexual. The two girls, although in full teenage bloom seem completely disinterested in sex. One can foresee their future as the Bronte sisters, fully isolated and caring for an elderly father.No member of the family shows any real grief for the death of mum. A few tears are shed, but then they are ready to sing and dance and dispose of the body in the most disrespectful way (I would not do that to my cat)Although accepted by all the most prestigious universities, Bo leaves for an obscure African country picked randomly - definitely a wise move for somebody highly intellectual and socially ineptIt is OK to mock Christianity and their rites, because other religions are way cooler... but why?

All for the sake of the children.Bo (George MacKay)Bo is the oldest of Leslie and Ben's kids and has turned into a fine young man. A bit weird, definitely socially awkward around attractive girls, but he is proof that Ben's methods aren't completely bat-poo crazy. But now he desires to leave the nest, be with people his own age. Something he fears Ben's reaction to.Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton)The one who perhaps lit the flame. He knows what his dad did and exposes his upbringing to Jack. Thus putting into motion perhaps Ben's greatest fear – losing his kids. All of which wasn't done in spite, but because there is so much they all are missing out on to live by Ben's philosophy, you can tell sometimes they want a taste of this high life they are denied of. Not to live in full-time, but a taste.HighlightsA Complex FamilyUsually, when a family, especially a big family like Ben's, is in a movie, it is about soap opera-esque secrets and drama. This movie though takes a different approach, a refreshing approach. One in which the issue is simply Ben's parenting methods and how they verge away from the traditional. Not just because he is raising his children in the wilderness, as if they will really need to learn to hunt and kill to survive, but because he doesn't coddle them. He explains to his youngest Zaja (Shree Crooks) and Nai (Charlie Shotwell) about what rape and sex are, about what happened to their mother, and sometimes at the dinner table. On top of that, he really teaches them the type of survival skills and routine which has made them stronger than the average person.Yet, with that comes a lack of familiarity to what most consider the norm. Brand names are unfamiliar, they are so isolated to each other's company that arguably they don't know how to adapt to someone who didn't have their upbringing, and with that comes the constant threat of separation. A topic which makes you feel torn for you can see Ben is definitely off his rocker. Within the first ten minutes, we see him have Bo kill a deer, eat some piece of it, and wipe the blood on his forehead in some coming of age ritual. However, at the same time you see how protective and dedicated he is to these kids being proper adults and not simply children until they're 18 and then realizing that there is so much they were never taught.With that said, it makes it easy to understand Jack and Harper's position for these kids are all Jack has now and they are Harper's family. They are what will remain if they survive Jack's upbringing. Which is the main problem. These kids use weapons, hunt animals, mountain climb, and train to fight by sparring against each other. Yes, Ben is training them to survive, but what apocalypse scenario is he making them ready for?The Performances & WritingAll of this, be it the parenting philosophy, the kids themselves, or the adults against Ben's methods, much less Ben himself, you can't have a weak link for then it would make this a weird movie. Thankfully, though, there isn't one actor amongst the cast, even those with small parts like Kielyr (Samantha Isler) and Vespyr (Annalise Basso), who don't deliver. Ben is polarizing yet as much as you think he may be crazy; you also want to support him. Yet, at the same time, you can understand and support the positions of Jack and Harper. On top of that, the kids aren't just there, they aren't simply something to fight over. They have lives, they have personalities. They have hopes, fears, and emotions. The type few juvenile actors get to express consistently through a movie, much less for more than one scene. I mean, usually kid actors are a dime a dozen but each and everyone in this movie seems like the type you should keep an eye on.On The FenceLack of ExplanationThough it is clear that a rebellion against the system is why Ben raises his kids like he does, you have to wonder when it comes to him, and Leslie, what made them decide to have this lifestyle? How did they meet, and little things of that nature. Outside of that, there doesn't seem to be any big issue to dwell on here and I don't think I'm saying that purely due to the elation of just finishing the film.Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing)I think I've said more than enough. Do yourself a favor and check this movie out.",Captain Fantastic

57,jadepietro,We Are Family,9,4 January 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.The roles between parent and child can be difficult and demanding yet ultimately rewarding. Writer / Director Matt Ross masterfully shows the dysfunctional dynamics of the family unit in his engrossing drama, Captain Fantastic, a drama which boasts a truly fantastic performance by Viggo Mortensen as the title character.￼Mr. Mortensen plays Ben Cash, a survivalist father and New Age philosopher who takes his tough love to dramatic extremes in raising his sextet of impressionable children. Their world is all inclusive, free of technology, one with the natural environment sans the capitalistic or pop culture trappings. Home schooled, his family's average itinerary includes hunting for their own food, practicing self defense techniques with real weapons, reading up on all the literary classics and doing a dissertation on any heady topic. They can spout Nietzsche or their patron saint, Noah Chomsky. on request. As their father, Jack treats his brood as young soldiers equipped to handle any emergency...until one does come along and threatens to destroy his happy family.The film is disturbing, in its words and pictures, and presents a questionable viewpoint about this patriarch and the strict regime he inflicts upon his children. Rightfully so, Jack's parenting skills comes into question and Mr. Mortensen is not afraid to show the vulnerable and ugly side to his character. His ends do not always justify his means. It is a daring unsentimental tour-de-force performance and Mr. Mortensen takes this unlikable gruff man whose passions often clouds his reason and makes him human.￼The young actors playing his tribe are wonderful and create a nice chemistry together. They deserve mention as they give the film its pathos: Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks, Charlie Shotwell, and especially George MacKay as Bodevan, the eldest child who begins to doubt his his father and his existence from the real world. Adding strong turns in other supporting parts are Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn, Frank Langella and Anne Dowd as Jack's concerned in-laws. (There is a particularly telling scene comparing the intellectual Cash misfits and today's typical teenage generation that reflects the societal contrasts extremely well.)Captain Fantastic is a thought-provoking film about family. Sometimes the screenplay glosses over some logical gaps that never really add up such as the lack of financial hardship that seems to elude them or the confused sexual education of the adolescents in this clan. Some plot devices seem unexplained and a tad far-fetched like the sketchy details of the family's final mission or the sudden forgiving nature of the children toward their father.￼All in all, Captain Fantastic is a remarkable film, filled with an insightful look at the unique diversity found in our children and the undeniable power that parents can have over their loved ones. Careful the things you do, children will listen. GRADE: B+NOTE: There is a very graphic opening scene that is not for the faint of heart. so be forewarned.",Captain Fantastic

59,eric262003,Mortensen Brought His A-Game With Him,9,28 May 2019,"Even though Viggo Mortensen will eternally be etched as Aragorn from ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise, movie fans will know that he is much more than a one trick pony. From making a name of himself as an Amish guy named Moses from the movie ""Witness"" to playing Leatherface in the 1990 third installment of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" he can tackle all kinds of roles be it big or small (like in ""Carlito's Way"" , ""Crimson Tide"" and Sean Penn's directorial debut ""The Indian Runner""). He is very capable of challenging himself in films under the direction of David Cronenberg (""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"") and being in a couple of Westerns (""Hidalgo"" and ""Appaloosa"") and finally put us to tears in John Hillcoat's post-apocalyptic tearjerker ""The Road"".A resume like that will surely get your attention but now after three and a half decades in the Hollywood industry, Mortensen's hard work has paid off here as he gives a performance of a lifetime in his Oscar-nominated performance in writer/director Matt Ross' ""Captain Fantastic"" which truly brings out the best in Mortensen.Ben Cash (Mortensen) has kept his family secluded in the Pacific Northwest away in the deep wilderness and away from technological outlets and society, but still has the knowledge in all important aspects in life like government, philosophy, literature and staying in shape. He and his six kids are very intelligent and his child nurturing has had a positive effect on them and are capable of engaging in debates and can solve advanced mathematical formula better than the engineers at MIT. When not trying to outsmart the intellectuals, the kids succeed to stay fit, like jogging, push-ups and hunting for game with more useful tactics than with a knife.The Cash Clan are in for an unpleasant surprise when they get the news that their mother, Leslie (Trin Miller) who has been hospitalized for many months after being treated for bipolar has committed suicide. Leslie's father Jack (Frank Langella) who wasn't fanatical about their free-spirited lifestyle goes against his daughter's last wishes by burying her instead of being cremated like she wanted. The Cash Clan hit the road to stop the funeral and along the way, they have their taste to the outside world but still manage to adjust to this new surroundings.The comical and the tragedy genres are both well equally proportioned. We laugh when the family try to cope with the ""real world"" and the efforts to adjust. And then we are in tears when Ben has to break the news about their mother's death. The film succeeds in keeping our interests as how the family is able to adapt to the newer surroundings and how they go about it. Mortensen is wonderful as a loving, caring and grief-striken father who cares about his children, though he never taught them about the world outside their settings. Their was a scene where Ben teaches Bo (George Mackay) how to hunt for deer only to realize later that there's a diner nearby selling hot dogs and milkshakes.The movie in a comical sense lampoons the weaknesses of society norms like the educational system and it choosiness towards those who are deemed eligible, while at the same time doesn't go far as to viciously attack it. And though Ben might have the supreme intelligence, it's not fully praised. There are still awkward scenes where Bo tries to acquaint himself towards a pretty girl named Clare (Erin Moriarty) around the campfire. The way the film has you thinking makes it all the more spectacular.With the wonderful performances from Mortensen and company (especially the Cash kids) and the wonderful direction from Matt Ross this is truly one of the best films of 2016.",Captain Fantastic
60,bkrauser-81-311064,Struggles to Make Its Point,7,3 August 2016,"Late in the film, our protagonist Ben (Mortensen) grief stricken and woebegone, reads a letter from his belated wife Leslie (Miller). By this revelation we're at the lowest point of the hero's journey; the point something inside Ben is supposed to ignite, something is supposed to change, something is supposed to happen. ""We are raising philosopher kings out here,"" she writes in a moment of clarity. A few scenes later he sulks further; hanging his regret and loss in a Jesse Jackson '88 t-shirt.Years before this moment, Ben, his wife, and his half-dozen kids found paradise in the rural isolation of the Pacific Northwest. They live as subsistence hunter/gatherers and keep a tight ship training their bodies and minds with intense physical exercise and fireside reading. When we first meet their oldest Bodevan (MacKay) he's covered head-to-toe in mud and just stalked and killed his first deer. Their youngest son Rellian (Hamilton) can understand theoretical physics and their eldest daughter Kielyr (Isler) can analyze the themes of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. Yet despite their accomplishments, they've rarely ventured outside their insulated existence and are growing concerned over their mother's absence. Leslie dies in a mental hospital in New Mexico, forcing the rest of the family to take a cross-country road trip to say their goodbyes. What's worse, the in-laws are threatening legal action if Ben shows his face at the funeral.Captain Fantastic is supposed to be about grief and largely succeeds in creating moments of genuine pathos and honesty. Viggo Mortensen's natural charisma lends itself to a never-ending sea of emotion while still holding to the stoic gruffness that the character requires. The illusion is topped by a somber but good-natured rictus, a Walt Whitman-esque beard and a life's philosophy of ""action not words."" The children fair just as well, playing their one-note like their little hearts depended on it with Hamilton being the standout as the familial Judas whose grief has taken a self-destructive dimension.Yet the film doesn't get passed second gear largely due to it's sanctimonious utopian proselytizing. The film spends and awful lot of time humanizing Ben and his ""alternative"" lifestyle to the detriment of any respectful and authentic ruminations on death and grief the film is trying to highlight. The children helpfully parrot his thoughts on proto-fascistic-capitalism, Maoist-Trotskyist dialectic, Noam Chomsky, beret-wearing, cigarette puffing existentialism etc., making their little commune seem like a harmless byproduct of their quirk. Outsiders such as Ben's sister- in-law (Hahn) and grandpa Jack (Langella) look like intolerant a**holes by comparison because they don't let their kids have wine at dinner and are agog that their nephews and nieces don't know what a pair of Nike's is.Liberals will likely be consumed and delighted by Captain Fantastic's positive feedback loop of self-reliant leftism; as if Ben's land of milk and honey could be the reality of only we had a Bernie Sanders presidency and we all ""stuck it to the man."" Yet I ask, would a film like this be as readily accepted if it were a gaggle of fundamentalist Christians? How about a Warren Jeffs-type cult? Take away the pseudo-Partridge Family, father-knows-best noise and replace Frank Langella's disapproving mug with the Federal Government and you got yourself an ultra-left version of Waco.Thankfully I think director Matt Ross knows this and tempers Ben's absolutism with a dollop of compromise by the time the film reaches its final coda. Additionally the thematic crux of the film does reach a conclusion, the satisfaction of which is sure to divide some audiences. Bolstered by great acting across the board, Captain Fantastic could have lived up to its comparisons to Little Miss Sunshine (2006) but settles with being a neo-hippie version of Swiss Family Robinson (1960).",Captain Fantastic
61,bandw,Captain fantasy,1,8 December 2016,"(major spoilers) To borrow a line from Roger Ebert, ""I hated hated hated this movie."" The story is of a severe disciplinarian, Ben, who has retreated to the backwoods of Washington State to raise his six kids (who range in age from about six to eighteen). At the beginning Ben's wife is in the hospital fighting serious depression; she eventually commits suicide.The thing that bothered me most was Ben's overbearing self-assurance. Everything was so damned harmonious in his little off-the-grid Eden. Did this man ever have doubts?The first scene has the oldest boy, Bodevan, tackle a deer and slit its throat. The whole family is dressed up in a full-body mud crust for this escapade; the desire being to appear as Australian bushmen I guess. After the kill there is a solemn ceremony between Ben and Bodevan (all of the kids have screwed up names) where Ben tells him that he has now passed from boyhood to manhood, whereupon Bodevan eats an internal organ from the deer. I guess his act of killing marks the end of Bodevan's walkabout. After a joyful bath in a local stream to get the mud off we are back at home and one of the daughters is wondering where the boning knife is--well, the youngest daughter has it up in her tree-house where she is cutting into a mountain beaver. When Ben sees that he gives a smile of satisfaction.A typical day consists of: serious physical exercise in the morning, a meditation circle, a communal dinner (where Ben and Bodevan play guitars), ecstatic dancing, and settling in to reading by lantern. The reading matter consists of ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" ""Middlemarch,"" and ""Guns, Germs, and Steel."" A middle daughter has been reading ""The World on a String"" and Ben grills her on her knowledge of quantum entanglement, Planck light vs. Planck time, and M-theory. Give me a break. At random times the youngest son wears a WWI-style gas mask, for no reason that I could ever determine.On a morning run up a steep hill Ben counsels his kids to run to the top. Since this appears to be a common activity I would think that the kids would know to run to the top or suffer humiliation. One exercise has the whole family climbing a sheer rock face. One of the boys has an accident where Ben offers no help: ""No one to save you."" When the boy does recover he gets a ""Good boy"" from his dad. I wonder where they got all of that expensive climbing equipment?They were wearing commercially produced clothing. I had expected to see them sitting around spinning wheels dressed in loincloths.When Ben asks one of the daughters to pontificate on her reading of ""Lolita"" she starts out by saying that she finds it interesting, whereby the entire gang screams that ""interesting"" is a forbidden word, indicating a lack of any deep thought. Fortunately a deeper analysis of ""Lolita"" is given and Ben again gives off his approving smile.After the death of Ben's wife he takes his freak show on the road to New Mexico for the funeral, in a gas guzzling bus named ""Steve."" You can imagine some of what transpires on that trip: amazement at so many fat people; inability to find any ""real"" food in a restaurant that has hamburgers, hot-dogs, and pancakes; mocking of shopping. In a grocery store Ben fakes a heart attack for distraction so that his kids can steal food. Is this his idea of being a good role model? There *are* good times like having a raucous celebration of Noam Chomsky's birthday. Really. At an RV park Ben emerges into the daylight fully naked. It is *so* good to see that he is that comfortable with his body that he has no shame in doing this (even though he has a rather remarkably small penis). Ben relishes flouting what he perceives as small-minded social conventions.We are treated with some pearls of wisdom: hospitals are good places to go if you are a healthy person and want to die, Americans are undereducated and over-medicated, the AMA are avaricious whores who too willingly spread their fat legs for big pharma, Marxists can be just as genocidal as capitalists, the Citizen's United Supreme Court decision has resulted in corporate ownership of America.Bodevan says some of his favorite pieces of music are the Bach Goldberg Variations and cello suites. I wonder were he listens to these, given that there is no electricity at home to support such an activity. When some relatives mention Nike shoes, Ben's kids want to know if they are talking about the Greek goddess. It was mentioned that the family had lived in Boulder, Colorado at one time, so it is hard to believe that the kids had never heard of the Nike shoe brand.The end of the movie has Bodevan ignoring all of a dozen offers to attend the most prestigious U.S. universities and heading off to Namibia, to help save the world I assume.When parting with Bodevan Ben has these words: When you have sex with a woman, be gentle and listen to her; Always tell the truth; Always take the high road; live each day like it could be your last; be adventurous, be bold, but savor it, it goes fast. And he criticizes his kids for lack of depth?I think a more common family dynamic than what we see here would be that as portrayed in ""This Boy's Life"" where Leonard DiCaprio dukes it out with Robert De Niro to get free from De Niro's repressive personality. What constitutes a big conflict here is Bodevan's confronting Ben for his not understanding the difference between ""Trotskyist"" and ""Trotskyite.""The movie is accompanied by a sappy score.",Captain Fantastic
62,Takethispunch,Superb,10,25 February 2017,"Ben Cash, his wife Leslie and their six children live in the Washington wilderness. Ben and Leslie are disillusioned with capitalism and American life, and chose to instill survivalist skills, left wing politics, and philosophy in their children – educating them to think critically, training them to be self-reliant, physically fit and athletic, guiding them without technology, demonstrating the beauty of coexisting with nature and celebrating ""Noam Chomsky Day"" instead of Christmas.Leslie is hospitalized for bipolar disorder and eventually commits suicide. Ben learns that his father-in-law Jack plans to hold a traditional funeral and burial, even though Leslie wished to be cremated. They argue over the phone and Jack threatens to have Ben arrested if he attends the funeral. He initially decides not to go and prevents his children from doing so, but then changes his mind, leading his children to a road trip with life outside the wilderness.The family briefly stays at his sister Harper's house. She and her husband try to convince Ben that his children should attend school to receive a traditional education; Ben argues that his children are better educated than Harper's own children. Ben and his children arrive at Leslie's funeral and reads her will, which instructs her family to cremate her and flush her ashes down the toilet. In response, Jack has Ben forcibly removed.Ben's children also start doubting their father and his parenting skills. His son Rellian accuses Ben of failing to treat Leslie's mental health. His son Bodevan accuses his father of failing to equip them for the real world and shows him college acceptance letters from Ivy League schools that Leslie had helped him apply for. Rellian wants to live with his grandparents, who want to take custody of them. When Vespyr tries to climb into a window to ""free"" Rellian from his grandparents, she falls from the roof and narrowly avoids breaking her neck.

66,maurice_yacowar,Family escapes from reality but learns to prepare for it,9,10 September 2016,"Nothing seems to be happening in the last scene of Captain Fantastic. Ben and his last five kids seem to be sitting around the breakfast table. Nobody says, nobody does, very much.This is a very quiet conclusion to a film in which we watched the family's high-stress discussions, high-risk training sessions, emotional eruptions over the mother's death, their staged supermarket theft, Ben's disputes with his sister-in-law and father-in-law and his public explosion at his wife's funeral, one daughter's nearly fatal attempt to retrieve a brother, the grandfather's ""adopting"" of the kids, their escape to dig up their mother's corpse and give her the cremation she wanted, including her ashes being flushed down the toilet, and of course Ben shaving off his hippie wild man beard. After all that drama the last scene is a welcome but surprisingly quiet end.But look at all that's happening there. Reunited, the family is continuing the parents' experiment to live in the wilds, in isolation, to ensure the children's superior education and self- reliance. In each lesson they advance from rote learning into independent analysis and judgment, sin the daughter's movement from plot to theme in Lolita. The kids have opted to stay with their father instead of enjoying life on their wealthy grandfather's estate. There are only five kids there now, the oldest having with Ben's agreement left for the outside world. Instead of going to one of the five top level universities (Harvard, etc.) who have accepted him, he has opted to go out on his own, having randomly chosen Namibia. He's leaving the family's retreat but for an open-ended adventure. He may or may not go to college, but for now he's content to test his forest education lessons on his own in the outside, i.e., real, world. Ben has accepted his kids' need to leave the nest. The other kids have the oldest's example for themselves to follow when their time comes. If the film begins with one rite of passage, the killing of an animal, it ends with another: the journey. The boy loses his hair to make the trek, as in Ben's shaving casting off the primitive face-paint and wildness that marked the opening rite. Both men have internalized the strength they had worn as a front.Ben's next oldest son is serving him breakfast. This is the kid who most openly revolted against Ben, blaming his insensitivity and stubbornness for their mother's death and running away to live with their grandfather. Having seen Ben accept responsibility and complete ""the mission"" of their mothers' cremation request, the boy embraces his father again, forgives him his extremism and brings their relationship a new warmth. There is a new mutual respect. Ben says they have fifteen minutes before the school bus comes. This is radical. However excellent the kids' home education has been, Ben has acknowledged their need to experience the outside world, to go to a real school and learn how to deal with other children and their culture. From Adidas to sex, in the trailer camp flirtation scene and the scenes with the sister- in-law's two brats, we've sampled the estrangement these isolated children have to learn to overcome. Book larnin' ain't enough.But where's the usual rush for the school bus? Instead the kids are sitting calmly reading and writing. This catches the family's real virtue — discipline. The family may have compromised their initial objective of living isolated from the outside world, but they are bringing into their new life their old rigour, dedication and self-control. And that's the film's central value. While we watch Ben's various lessons for his children we see his most valuable discovery — the dangers of extremism. He learns that his hippie idealism can be as dangerous, destructive and delimiting as his father-in-law's capitalism. His wife was driven to escape both. She helped the oldest apply for university as his way out. Suicide was hers. Ben's adult treatment of his children's questions are clearly more enabling and constructive than the shelter his sister-in-law purports to give hers. Their shelter shades into ignorance on the Bill of Rights quiz. Their callousness is exposed when their computer games shock Ben's children and when the boys give the departing family the raised third finger. Ben's kids are getting the better education. But at the same time, their isolation will only impede and endanger them when they venture — as they must — into the outside world. The growth implicit in Ben's change and in that last scene brings a new force to their favourite quote from Noam Chomsky, whom they celebrate instead of the fictional elf of Christmas: ""If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world.""Of course, Chomsky himself is an extremist, whose idealism — like the early Ben's — ignores the exigencies and compromises necessary to survive in government, politics and business. This passage argues against extremism especially in any removal from the world. It's more mature and constructive than the kids' favourite exchange:Nai: Power to the people!Bo: Stick it to the man! Slogans do not a fruitful approach to life make. The last scene shows Ben as well as his children accepting the need to realize their values in the real world rather than in retreat from it.",Captain Fantastic

69,educallejero,Sweet story with positive social commentary,6,4 January 2020,"The best thing about the movie is the performances. Viggo Mortensen nails the role of the father in grief (for his wife), but trying to stay strong to keep giving his 6 kids the ""anti-system"" education he established with the late mother.The young performers sold me on them being different kind of kids, with alternative education, more inclined to critical thinking and enjoying knowledge in a way impossibly different than what the classical claustrophobic institutions achieve, and far from pop modern culture and typical city vices.The technical aspects like score and cinematography were fine, but they weren't the focus, like the story and the family emotions.The movie tackles the story from positivity, filled with sweet moments. But with this premise (""anti system""), modern society was going to take some hits (all deserved ones). Obesity, the poor educational system, empty consumerism and who owns the authority and why, are targets. After a while, the story starts commenting on the natural problems this different ideology creates in the kids too. And this is the part that it would've benefited the most with a more malicious, forceful direction, with more pronounced and strong denouncements of the system we so numbingly accept. Of course, that would make the movie much more harsh (and unwatchable for more conservative audiences).But this is the reason why I think the movie is not great. Too serious (and positive) to be a full on comedy that mocks ideologies, but not serious enough to be a movie with unforgettable social commentary either.",Captain Fantastic

The acting was as good as you're going to get with such a difficult script and artsy plot - kind of wacko. Do I recommend this? I do! Only if you enjoy original artsy movies poised to misinform.

71,aciessi,Father Knows Best,8,22 October 2016,"Captain Fantastic is the most unconventional Dad movie I've ever seen. Viggo Mortensen plays a scraggly hippy, raising six children, off-the-grid, deep within the forrests of Washington state. He teaches his children survival skills, improvisational jam sessions, works of classical literature, and a heaping helping of socialist philosophy. In one scene, they celebrate Noam Chomsky's birthday by going into town and stealing consumer goods from a grocery store. Way to stick it to the man. But their flower-power lifestyle comes to a halt when their estranged mother commits suicide, and they need to attend the funeral in the civilized world. It's a fish-out-of water story that calls into question what it truly means to be a father, and what is truly the acceptable way to raise children in America. The film supplies no definitive answer, but it makes roughing it in the wilderness seem a lot of fun. This is a beautiful film. Viggo Mortensen and the ensemble family absolutely blew me away. I felt so warm to be around these people. This is a fairly long film, yet it was so much fun that it flew right by. This film will grow on you, guaranteed. I really like the film now, but I'm sure within a week, I'll begin to love it. I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up somewhere on my top ten list this year.",Captain Fantastic

Outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially the young kids are a highlight. Hopefully it will be remembered in award season.The movie drags a bit. You know it is going to drag as the opening scene of the forest from a helicopter is too long. Get past the deer killing and things settle down. There are a few to many shots of the star staring into space that could have been cut to tighten things up.Even with it's flaws, it is a good story told well. There are plenty of close-ups that are too close for the big theater screen. The movie is in limited release but will stick around with positive word of mouth. It will be equally enjoyable on a home platform.",Captain Fantastic
73,bankofmarquis,It made me think - and that's a good thing,7,12 February 2017,"I had an interesting struggle while watching CAPTAIN FANTASTIC.  My head wanted to reject this film, particularly the methods the father (Viggio Mortensen in an Oscar nominated performance) uses to raise his children.  My heart pushed back hard, telling my head to ""release pre-conceived thoughts and ideas and accept the film - and methods - on the terms that the filmmakers intended"".  And when I did that, a funny thing happened...I enjoyed the film.Directed and Written by Matt Ross, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC tells the story of Ben Cash, who chooses to raise his 6 children ""off the grid"" away from the trappings of Modern Society.  When his wife passes away, Ben must bring his children ""in"" and, in the process, re-examines the choices he has made and the effects it has had on his kids.Viggio Mortensen is nominated for an Academy Award for his lead performance as Ben - and it is a deserving nomination.  This is not a ""showy"" role.  It is sincere, thoughtful and deep - you can see there is much, much more going on inside of Ben under his skin - even though he is calmly secure in the lifestyle decisions he has made.  When, however, that security is tested (shaken?), you see a subtle shift in Mortensen's performance that is pitched exactly as it should, not too much and not too little.  He delivers a fine, subtle performance that works.A key to this film is the casting of the 6 young actors as Ben's children - and they are cast well.  These 6 look like they could be brothers and sisters, without looking like clones of each other or as if they came straight out of central casting.  They all have separate and distinct personalities while also showing the bond that, necessarily, has formed between these 6 throughout the years.Where this film falls short is in the writing of the others (like Ben's sister and her family and Ben's Father in Law) that Ben's family encounters when they leave their mountain sanctuary for their mother's funeral.  These characters are written 2 dimensionally with little to no understanding or curiosity of Ben's choices.  Thankfully, the sister is played by the underrated Katherine Hahn while the Father-In-Law was saved from being a Darth Vader-type villain by Frank Langella's natural strength and compassion, even though he was asked to ""twirl his mustache"" most of the time.  Only Annie Ross as Ben's mother-in-law comes off as a three dimensional character.And that is often a concern when a film is written and directed by the same person.  It is clear that Ross LOVES his main character and his family, so everyone else is put on the screen as antagonists or to give the main family a chance to shine.  This also results in some long, slow scenes of the family thinking or slowly discussing an issue, to such an extent that I started fidgeting in my seat.But, when that happened, I would just focus on Mortensen and the kids performances and I was entertained, indeed.  This movie made me think, and that is rare and welcome.Letter Grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Captain Fantastic
74,bob-the-movie-man,Dysfunctionally Functional,9,18 March 2017,"""Captain Fantastic"" starts with a dramatic hunting expedition introducing us to the unusual Cash family. Dad Ben (Viggo Mortensen) is bringing up his six kids – Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai – in the wilds of Washington state. Ben takes home-schooling to a completely new level, with intense study and examinations in quantum physics, philosophy and politics matched with a militaristic approach to weapons-training and physical fitness. Ben also teaches extreme self-sufficiency, most evident during a dramatic rock- climbing sequence.Where is their mum in all of this? That would be a spoiler (so don't watch the trailer either) but is central to the plot as the family board their old camper van – ""Steve"" – on a road trip back to the 'real world' and the children's grandparents – the crusty and assertive Jack (a marvellous Frank Langella) and Abigail (Ann Dowd). What follows is filled with black humour, tragedy, not just one but two amazing funeral services and one of the most extraordinarily black and comic laying-to-rests ever seen on the big screen. Viggo Mortensen is well fantastic in his portrayal, getting to run the full gamut of joy, grief, self-doubt, guilt and despair during the movie's run-time. He's clearly not going to win the Oscar on Sunday – surely Casey Affleck must be a slam-dunk for that – but this is a well-judged nomination by the Academy. While the focus is on Mortensen, this shouldn't overshadow the performances of some of the rest of the young cast, and I would specifically call out those of George MacKay and young Shree Crooks as the youngest of the kids. MacKay has been building up an impressive run of UK-based films with ""Sunshine on Leith"" and ""Pride"" but with this (and his key role in the recent TV mini-series ""11.22.63"") he should see a break-through to more mainstream feature roles. In ""Captain Fantastic"" his socially-inept proposal to the delectable Claire (Erin Moriaty) is one of the high-points of the film. He is a name to watch, for sure.And young Ms Crooks should be given a special honorary Oscar for the ability to learn such dense portions of script and deliver them so faultlessly! The whole cast in fact was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture – one of my favourite award categories, but beaten by ""Hidden Figures"". And it is that sort of film: a really great ensemble effort.The film is written and directed by Matt Ross, only his second feature since 2012's ""28 Hotel Rooms"" (which I was not aware of, but would now like to seek out). I thought it was terrific; deeply comedic; riveting from beginning to end; a roller-coaster of emotion and ultimately a feelgood classic on the value of family that I will remember fondly for a long time. Once again, the second film this week, that would have made me reconsider my ""top films of 2016"" list. I strongly recommend that you seek this out on download or DVD and give it a try.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",Captain Fantastic
75,bryank-04844,Everything is FANTASTIC about 'Captain Fantastic'!,10,23 January 2017,"'Captain Fantastic' is not a super-hero movie, despite the title, but again, then maybe it is as we follow the journey of a big family, both emotionally and physically, as they stick together through some tough obstacles. Directed by Matt Ross, who is most known these days as Gavin Belson on HBO's 'Silicon Valley', 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare films that has just about everything you'd want in an emotional drama- comedy, which is all led by the amazing talent of Viggo Mortensen. The film is a refreshing mix of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' and 'Little Miss Sunshine' and plays to both of those films strengths, while still managing to be original, entertaining, and heart-warming. 'Captain Fantastic' sure has quickly become one of my favorite films of the year.Matt Ross sure has created a Utopian reality with this film when it comes to raising a family in an unconventional way. If all kids were raised more or less in the way depicted here in this film, things would be better, or at least that's what Ross wants you to think. In a perfect world maybe, but unfortunately this film is quite the fantasy, which is really the only minor gripe I have with the film. 'Captain Fantastic' follows a big family led by Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller), along with their six kids in rural Washington State. They home-school all of their kids in the forest, teaching them everything from deer hunting with a knife, canning vegetables and fruits, to all of the social and economic issues from the past and present.The kids know several languages fluently and can even play instruments. However, their mother has been in the city to get ""help"" for her bi-polar disorder, which ends unfortunately. This has Ben and his six kids on a road trip in a decked out hippie bus across country to attend their mother's funeral, despite Ben's father-in-law (Frank Langella) threatening to call the police if Ben and the kids show up, as he blames Ben for his daughter's death. On the road trip the family sticks together when others think they're weird for their intelligent yet awkward ways, including celebrating Noam Chomsky's birthday as their version of Christmas, stealing food from the grocery store, having the youngest kid (7 years old) recite the bill of rights and explain what it all means, and being up front and honest with people and each other when it comes to sensitive subjects that includes topics such a rape and death.It sounds rough, but Ross captures this family and a very innocent and charming light. Even though the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) can tell you about any literary classic in detail or talk astrophysics, he has no idea how to socialize with anyone his age on a normal level, even though he has applied to all the ivy league schools and has been accepted each of them. Things get a bit serious when an accident happens that makes Ben think twice on how he is raising his kids and must make a compromise with their way of life and living in the real world for everyone's safety.This journey is not only a physical one, but an emotional one as well, as each kid and Ben struggles with who they are and how they were raised. It's a very satisfying story to tell and to see on screen, as you grow more attached to each character with each passing minute, despite their quirks. One obstacle after another, this family really stays loyal and proves their worth to one another and society, even if it's so far- fetched that it is almost borderline fantasy. The music in the film by Alex Somers is captivating and Matt Ross captures the rugged countryside beautifully.Viggo Mortensen along with the six kids turn in phenomenal performances, but Viggo truly shines as a realistic portrayal of a father who is trying his best, given his choices and circumstances. If only we all had a part of Ben in all of us in life. 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare beautiful films that is pretty much flawless.MUST SEE!",Captain Fantastic
76,Marwan-Bob,"Keep fighting the ""normal"" way of living!",9,10 February 2017,"Captain Fantastic is a story of a father who raises his 6 kids in a forest isolated from society. He teaches them survival skills, as well as analytical and critical thinking skills. What he doesn't teach them is how to survive in the ""real world."" When the family is forced to enter society, it tests the strength and resolve of a family that seems to have an unbreakable bond. This movie invokes memories of film greats like ""Into the Wild,"" as well as ""Boyhood."" It's one of those films that flows so easily, and made me wonder why there aren't more great movies like this released throughout the year. Viggo Mortenson should get a best actor nod for his fantastic performance in Mr. Fantastic. The child actors' performances were also impressive. The casting, directing and music were spot on. This film gave me that feeling of ""what if?"" It challenges societal norms of raising a family and living in America. It made me laugh, and it also made me cry. Watch Captain Fantastic.",Captain Fantastic
77,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,6 August 2017,"Captain Fantastic definitely caught me by surprise. It wasn't on my initial list of ""movies to watch"" of 2016, but when it came out it got so many positive reviews that I had to add it to my watch list.The cast is brilliant: Mortensen makes his run for an Oscar, he's so compelling and captivating, I was totally into his character. Ben is able to make me cry and laugh at the same time, as well as most of this film ... It's either super funny or terribly sad with its constant twists. Once again, the cast is absolutely pitch-perfect, but besides Viggo Mortensen I have to congratulate Shree Crooks (Zaja) and Charlie Shotwell (Nai). These are the youngest of the children and they are at the same amazing level that Millie Bobby Brown is at Stranger Things. I still can't believe how realistic they are in their appearances, even if only for brief moments. Everyone else is great as well and each of the kids gets their own scene to shine!The story is so thought-provoking that challenges the audience to understand everyone's perspective on life. Who we think are the bad guys, actually might be the good ones and vice-versa. Ben and his children have a very different life because of all the society's stereotypes and overall problems that they don't have while living isolated in a forest ... However, the civilization's point of view is that a bunch of hippies decided to quit life and live on their own with no social interaction whatsoever, which doesn't exactly prepare his kids for their future. It's a brave and massively interesting plot that keeps our eyes and ears glued to the screen.My only issue with this movie is the ending. Without spoiling anything, it felt a little disappointing having in mind everything that I experienced with the film and the family. I think Matt Ross was trying to follow this one path, but near the end, decided to change it drastically.Still, Captain Fantastic is one of my favorite movies of 2016! It delivers a beautiful message, it has a delightful cast, with Viggo Mortensen stepping up his game and an adventure-full story that still manages to end on a very bright note.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Captain Fantastic
78,Andres-Camara,A special film to create leftist and right-wing nationalists,6,14 February 2017,"Watching this movie I have been astonished. Not because parents want to educate their children in their own way, no, that seems great, but because of the things that are said in the movie to children of that age.I have to say that as a movie, it is credible. You believe everything, that's the bad. It's not a bad movie, but I'm terrified that there are people like that, that will lead your child to do that sort of thing.I do not like Viggo Mortensen, but he's an actor who does not like anything, if someone bothers me, I beg your pardon. The kids however are great.I think the film defends some things, but at the same time it falls on themselves, it is very incoherent.Photography, nothing special. It is simple and does not count anything.The address is simple. Do not bore, the planes are simple.I hope not to disturb anyone with my comments, they are just that, comments.Spoiler:The sequence when he asks the child in front of the uncles to show that the child knows a lot of culture, seems to me unfortunate. The bad thing is that in the movie, the aunt is right. And as a counterpoint, the children of the uncles are the typical video games, who know nothing, all clichés. Is it really what people want their children to learn at that age?Telling the child, what the brother tells him when he is going to take the plane, it seems to me as much as training the masses, which is precisely what I believe denounces the film.",Captain Fantastic

80,SquigglyCrunch,A Movie that Needed to be Made,10,13 October 2016,"Captain Fantastic follows a family as they travel from their life in the forest to attend a family event that they have otherwise been told not to, and how they try to understand city life. Meanwhile, Ben, the father of the children, receives judgement from all his city acquaintances. The performances are all pretty good. Viggo Mortensen is great as Ben, and the rest of the actors are good as well, even the children. They bring both realism and humor to their characters. The characters themselves are stellar. They're well rounded, well- developed, compelling, realistic, and just plain fun. Sometimes they're perfect goody-two-shoes characters, but they still have a level of depth to them that goes deeper than that and shows that that's simply not the case. Personally I found Ben's character to be the most compelling, but I'll get into that later.The soundtrack is pretty great too. I really enjoyed listening to it, and I can't wait until I'm able to do so without having to watch it. Every song was well-placed in the movie and very good. The biggest reason why I love this movie is because of the statement it makes about society in this day and age. It shows, in a somewhat exaggerated but still realistic way, how people can be so unaccepting. (Potential rant incoming). It shows how so many people are so stuck up in their own opinions that they're unable to see and respect the fact that other people are different, and it does a great job of showing the injustice in that. We have a family coming into the city from living in the forest for most of their lives, and everyone tells them to change and often refuses to accept and respect their differences simply because it's different. This idea stood out and spoke to me personally and I was very happy that the movie decided to do this. Going back to Viggo Mortensen's character, he plays a big role in this, and that's why I loved him. Overall Captain Fantastic is, as the title suggest, quite simply fantastic. The performances are great, the characters are stellar, the soundtrack is great, and the statement it makes is invaluable. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie. It is quite possibly the best movie of 2016, and is most definitely a must watch.",Captain Fantastic
81,hotwheelerd-61843,Captain Fantastic,10,8 June 2020,"Ok, I watched this film a few times. I give it a 10 out of 10.
The reason why I give it a 10 is because of what is going on in this world today. If you really think about it and watch these kids. How the father raised them. They are much stronger than the world today. These kids are smart, strong, healthy. Then 90 percent of the kids today and Adults. They don't even know in a RESTAURANT what a Hotdog is. That might sound funny or stupid. But just think about how healthy that is. They don't even have cell phones. Or T.Vs they all read books ever night. Plus they all play music. It is one heck of a story if you ask me.

82,garethcrook,Lives up to its name.,8,16 May 2020,"I thought I'd seen this. I hadn't. I'm not sure how I was mistaken, I can't imagine what I'd mix this up with. Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his large family live off grid, seriously off grid. Out in the wilderness, catching food, learning to fight. Slightly odd to our eyes, or mine at least. Throw in Ben's insistence on the children's education, reading books about quantum mechanics and we've clearly got an usual family dynamic. They're like liberal arts intellectuals that can skin a deer. A happy bunch, it's hard not to admire them. They seem self sufficient, but you know a spanner is coming. As we join them, Mum has been gone 3 months and counting and trips into the nearby town to collect post, offer up disruptions that can't be washed away in a waterfall... pretty cool way to have a shower though. One such trip into town brings utter devastation, both hidden and obvious and threatens to change their world forever. It's news of their mothers death that kick starts a chain of events that forces them to interact with a society they've grown up to despise. The loss of their mother adds an obvious strain and some the tough love reality gets a bit tough to watch at times, as Ben is very direct in his explanations of the world to his children. This is compounded too be distant in the ranks. Young Rellian is becoming disillusioned with his enforced slightly hippy exhistence. He's questioning. Wiser than he first appears and his added disruption will fuel the fire, but ultimately quench it too. There's a definite thread of who is really teaching who. It's funny too though, with Ben's matter of fact explanation of the birds and the bees and the child's observations regarding fat Americans. The children are well behaved through, ""We don't make fun of people... except Christians"". It takes on a road movie feel as they travel for the funeral. This throws up multiple interactions that test their family bond and the children's understanding of the world. It's not just the children at odds with the world though, they're open, excepting, adaptable. It's Ben who struggles, prejudiced against society and his father-in-law, the excellent Frank Langella and his plan for his daughters burial, against her Buddhist wishes. Here is where the wheels come off. As Ben, used to being in control, finds himself powerless as events transpire against him. There's a rather brutal twist I wasn't expecting, as Ben admits defeat. For all the right reasons, but it grates, even with the gorgeous Sigur Ros soundtrack. If I have a reservation, it's this, but that's really nit picking as there's very little here to dislike. Not all the children get centre stage, in fact I forgot to do a head count as to how many there are, let's say half a dozen, that's close enough. George MacKay as Bodevan (they all have unique names) is front and centre through. The eldest son, he finds himself courted by some of the top universities in the country, but for all his intelligence and free thinking, is he suited for the transition to structured society. It's the ticking bomb for much of the film as he hides his academic success from his father, knowing he would disapprove of such institutions. A film like this I guess demands a finale and it indulges, with some inevitable graveyard liberation and a touching goodbye to their wife and mother. Complete with the most bizarre rendition of Sweet Child O'Mine I've ever heard. It's a satisfying end to an unusual film. A film that's gentle and severe in equal measure. Intriguing and entertaining. Maybe even fantastic.",Captain Fantastic
83,MikeyB1793,Total BS,2,22 August 2016,"Admittedly I am not the best audience for this film about a family that subsists independently on the land in the Pacific Northwest (Washington State?), which is why I boosted my rating up to 2 stars. I have never gone for the type of communal existence that lives off the land and which shuns and despises civilization. I like my espressos too much and enjoy the cinema...The father (played by Viggo Mortensen) and his five or six kids live and hunt and exercise in the rain forest. He is a really despicable father with an extreme ego and extreme distaste for any whose opinion differs from his. He plays God to his children who simply adore Daddy – and have hardly the backbone to confront Daddy Dearest. Does that make any sense? Hardly! I raised two children and there were confrontations and arguments on a daily basis. These kids are not normal. I could never buy into this phony family with their contrived sappy dialogue.There were many other irritations. Noam Chomsky, Karl Marx are quoted – as if these could help one in living in the rough outdoors. This all became so pretentious and tiresome – and then boring – it was like Daddy and his children were script reading and promoting an agenda. And where was the money coming from – when father and children set off in a cross-country gas-guzzling jalopy bus which must consume tremendous quantities of fuel? So much for not leaving a carbon imprint on the environment! Where was the money coming from for these rock climbing ventures? This was also a form of child abuse.I really became tired of whatever message it was that this film was spewing out.",Captain Fantastic
84,diane-34,A movie old beyond its time,7,14 September 2016,"Diane and I viewed this, stick in your mind, film yesterday at the theater on Essex in Fremantle. Diane and I leave a movie, and our impressions are much the same but with Captain Fantastic it is different; our perceptions of what we just watched were based on her background in studying literature and mine were mere opinions of a movie attendee. We both, probably because of our ages, have seen the theme worked a few times before and earlier to the germination of the entire idea of ""dropping out."" This film version at the beginning, when they were still in the forest, pressed too many buttons, ""we've seen this done before and better because it was closer to the source."" These scenes with the father acting like ""army drill sergeant."" didn't ring true. We were also skeptical of the placidness of the children; only the one boy rebelled and the other five just absorbed all of the direction. I was happier with the movie during the last two-thirds when they left the forest and confronted the world as it is not as their father would like it to be.",Captain Fantastic
85,bbewnylorac,Really lovely film,8,9 September 2016,"I really enjoyed this film. It was visually beautiful and it didn't treat viewers like idiots. There's a chance many viewers didn't know who Noam Chomsky is but hey, they can Google him! The cinematography by Stephane Fontaine was spectacularly good, with gorgeous use of light and different perspectives. The script by writer-director Matt Ross was tightly written and edited and mostly ticked along at a good pace, except for a saggy patch about three- quarters through. The acting was first class. Special mention to Viggo Mortensen as patriarch Ben, who is suitably charismatic and physical to play an outdoorsy alternative father who keeps a tight rein, mentally and physically, on his brood. The child actors deserve special mention - and are beautifully directed - for all being naturalistic yet sparky and full of personality. They react well to stuff, and say their lines as though they just popped into their heads, The two smallest kids are outstanding in their expression and focus They have some complex scenes, but carry them off effortlessly. They're gems. And George MacKay, as the eldest boy Bo, is unexpectedly sensitive and wide eyed, and just a very likable character, for example in some touching scenes with Claire (Erin Moriarty), a much more worldly yet lovely girl he meets at a caravan park. There were a few awkward and rushed plot points towards the end of the movie, but it was ultimately very inventive, such as the visually stunning cremation scene, and the scene where the family sits contentedly at breakfast, in complete silence. Captain Fantastic was ultimately lovingly made. Definitely one of the best films this year.",Captain Fantastic
86,CineMuseFilms,an engaging offbeat fable about conformity and difference,7,5 September 2016,"Subversive films are often camouflaged behind genre or movie titles. Many are promoted as action thrillers, dramas and even comedy but in reality carry dystopian themes about the breakdown of modern civilisation. Some recent examples of subversive films are High Rise (2016), Money Monster (2015) and 99 Holmes (2015). The film Captain Fantastic (2016) is also subversion in camouflage, with a clever title that evokes a mythical super-hero but in reality is about someone who trains his offspring military-style to prepare for the moral decay of modern civilisation.Enlightened counter-culturalist Matt Ross (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife have raised six children in a utopian paradise buried deep in the Washington forests. His wife has been absent for months, hospitalised with mental illness, while Matt continues to home-school and train the kids in survival, combat and hunting. They are well-versed in philosophy, political theory and literature, are all musical and know how to live with nature. Matt sneers at religion so Christmas is ignored and they celebrate Noam Chomsky Day as rebellion against Christian society. Matt is a firm, loving father and expects the children to live by his offbeat moral code, but they know nothing of how town-folk live or of the technological world outside. They expect the unfiltered truth about everything so when the eight year-old asks about sexual intercourse the factual reply would shock modern parents. None has ever seen a video game, they have no idea of what Coke tastes like and ogle in amazement at the size of people eating in McDonalds. When they head to the city for their mother's funeral the encounter with the 'real world' is both hilarious and confronting.On some levels, this story is so fanciful that it could be regarded as simply an eccentric family comedy. When we hear the eight-year old analyse the American Bill of Rights, or the ten-year old quote from Karl Marx, or see all six kids engaged in elite athlete training including extreme rock- climbing in dangerous weather, it is clear we are not meant to take the whole story seriously. At another level however, this is one of the most refreshing, heart-warming and thought-provoking films in quite a while. It is especially endearing in depicting the many small moments where natural honesty confronts civilised artifice. Mortensen has a dominant presence, the acting and personalities of the six children are delightful, and the wilderness photography is beautiful. But believability is so over-stretched that what could have been a brilliant film settles instead for being a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable fable about conformity and difference.",Captain Fantastic
87,socrates99,Noam Chomsky mentioned in a movie? Made me smile all night!,9,3 December 2016,"I picked up the DVD at my library and as usual checked the new DVD for scratches. I live in a fairly conservative area and I'm used to having lenders mistreat the DVDs. (After all, they've had their viewing.) Sure enough, it was badly scratched, but it was the only copy and so I watched it thereby missing about 15 minutes of it all told.I will get a hold of a good copy, but I've seen enough to know that I love this movie. It's essentially a beautifully rendered criticism of modern life. Viggo Mortensen is, as usual, quite good, but just as impressive are the children ranged around him as his family. I kept thinking the mere fact they were able to gather such a convincing group is heartening in itself.But the heroic core of this movie is its conception, direction and script. People don't understand the attraction of socialism. They only think of the loss of freedom, by which they usually mean having to support slackers. This movie is a well-conceived dream of a response to those criticisms. It even includes references to Noam Chomsky who most conservatives haven't heard of. It plays on so many of the ideas that motivated the counter culture in the 60s that it seemed almost nostalgic. But most laudably it's guaranteed to make the stars of Fox's Outnumbered nauseous, and they richly deserve it for comments they've made about 'stinking hippies', which made me nauseous.",Captain Fantastic
88,gsygsy,Very entertaining,7,23 December 2016,"A movie debating the priorities of social integration must have been quite a difficult pitch for writer/director Matt Ross to make. It couldn't have made it any easier that his other subject is how a family copes with mental illness and death. Given all that, it's amazing that he got CAPTAIN FANTASTIC funded, but somehow he did, and I'm very glad he was given the opportunity: this is a very entertaining piece of work.Ross was wise in seeking out Viggo Mortensen to play the head of the family. Over the years this actor has acquired a huge emotional range to add to his riveting screen presence. It's a pleasure to see him in whatever he's in.He presides over a terrific ensemble of young actors playing his children, and finds a worthy antagonist in the great Frank Langella.Ross paces his film confidently.

89,emekmax,good time,7,11 January 2021,"I found this movie to be well intended but filled with a bunch of conflicting views. Yes, homeschooling is awesome, however, it was also portrayed as letting the children end up with poor socialization skills, and they were left thinking that they don't know anything if it wasn't taught in a textbook. The characters were against fascist totalitarianism yet the oldest son (Bo) was a Maoist. How is Mao not the epitome of ""the man"" they so often talked about sticking it to throughout the movie? That the grandfather didn't do anything about the children going missing? But they all made it fine to fly out of an airport? There are way too many inconsistencies in the movie as far as political philosophy and ideologies. But I suppose if you are able to look past that (why they hell would you since it's core to the movie?) then I guess you will enjoy this. Positive was acting, the idea of the plot, and execution otherwise, but I'd be lying if it didn't irk me to no end that these fundamentals w",Captain Fantastic

Genius story telling combined with perfect social timing.With grunge-era people now in full family mode or just escaping it, it fits that there should not only be a film set in a grunge utopia but complete with the filthy, tragic, painful aspects of life that grunge art is in large part dedicated to portraying.One of the few drawbacks was its placement of Bikini Girl's ""Rebel Girl"". It's a great song that should be in the soundtrack, but they missed a few more ideal places for it. Otherwise, the soundtrack is a key part of keeping the film moving along.",Captain Fantastic
92,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,10 December 2016,"After being forced to leave the forests of the Pacific Northwest, where Ben (Viggo Mortensen), a devoted father, who raises his six children with a rigorous physical and intellectual education away from the society they respect but deem corrupt, the whole family is confronted with the world, which brings in each of them a different change in their perspective.""Captain Fantastic"" is a film that reminded me of why people make movies, why we go to the cinema and why we love to be carried away with beautiful stories, this feature is great, it is gut-wrenchingly emotional, immensely morally complicated and touchingly inspiring.Vigor Mortensen shows us once again why he is simply one of the greatest actors ever to live by taking on this gargantuan role and keeping the whole film on his shoulders by doing so. The ways in which all of this could fall apart immediately are infinite, but there is something in Mortensen's method that makes it come alive as vivid as possible. You believe in everyone of these characters. They are distinguishable, they are alive, they feel so realistic it is overwhelming.This is one of those films where I simply did not want to leave these characters behind, I only wanted to keep spending time in their company. The dynamic that is established with this family is so well realized in everyone of its aspects you are simply absorbed by it. The liveliness of the characters takes you over and their motivations are ever so clear. The empathy you get to have with each one of these people is moving and thanks to some smart decisions by Ross early on that might not convince you immediately, the pay offs you get to have by the end hit you with a train of emotions that had me definitely teary in the theater.The immense moral complexity the film faces is key to the success of each character dynamic that is developed, the reason you care so much is because the film is making bold and valid statements and then challenging them. It is so successful exactly because it does not go easy on any of the issues faced, it wants to raise every point of view and give everyone ups and downs and that is something that manages to take the audience through an emotional journey that touches upon the widest array possible. There are big, genuine laughs from the film and incredible tough dramatic moments and they all fade into one another seamlessly because of the rich and unique characters we go along with in this journey.There are touches of brilliance scattered around every scene in the film, subtle things that aren't necessarily there to be picked up , but that enrich this world with some real depth and give it believability. Furthermore, there are real flaws to all of these people and whilst some may have more than others the film analyzes all of them and thanks to that both we and the characters manage to grow in the most complete and touching way. Then, thanks exactly because of the moral complexity of the situation we manage also to get moments of explosive excitement on the other spectrum, where we are rooting for the characters so hard to succeed in their intent it becomes an edge-of-your-seat experience.The cast is stunning in this film, everyone is playing their role brilliantly, from Frank Lagella who manages to give a unpleasant old granddad the depth to be a sympathetic character, to Annalise Basso who has been a great up and coming actress and graces us with yet another majestic performance, making her a stand out in a cast of youngsters that still deserves a standing ovation for their dynamic, lively and touching work. Each one of the kids manages to have a beautiful arch and the collection of all of them with Mortensen's character made for what is an emotional journey that was as moving and reflective as anything I've seen this year.There are a couple of little flaws in the film: I have to admit that whilst for the vast majority the style does not eclipse the substance and actually elevates it in its own beautiful ways, there were times where the classic indie-feel of the documentary hand-held style camera combined with the slightly clichéd score got on the way of the story. Moreover, towards the resolution of the film, in the third act, whilst as beautiful as they are and as poetic as they are, there were a couple of narrative leaps, which I won't spoil, that rushed some emotional beats just a little too quickly.Take that away and what you are left with is a profoundly moving picture that inspired me deeply and made me think as much as feel.",Captain Fantastic
93,eagandersongil,The wild family union,7,1 March 2017,"""Fantastic Captain"" is one of those movies that are fun to watch, it's fun, it's funny, it's almost an adventure, and even then, it's complex and it deals with controversial themes and taboos, all sarcastic and half-hearted. The film is about a subject that documentary channels love to explore, a family that prefers to live in the jungle, away from the pleasures or not of the city, but cool, is the way the script approaches the film, the family in question is The one of Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and its 6 children, that after receiving the news of the death of the mother, decide to go to the funeral of the same, and in the mean time, diverse questions are put, twists, dramas and comedies they happen. It is a simple but beautifully crafted script that explores the contemplation of images to form its background. The film is placed in an ideological position, and it rests on it, I will not talk about this part because it does not attract me, your message to me is about the union of the family, and the power that it acquires by being together, battling and overcoming challenges, And of course, we have a criticism of the traditional teaching method, because Well proves that the education given at home can overcome that of a school because it treats the individuality of each student. With a clean photograph and a strong color palette, camera angles that in moments explore contemplation, a beautiful costumes and a great rhythm, ""Fantastic Captain"" is not a technically exquisite, but very good. In terms of acting the film presents us with Viggo Mortensen who does a first class performance, he is loving and brutal, violent and worried, Viggo conveys spectacularly all the doubts and questions about whether what his character is doing. Another highlight is for George Mackay who is quite stunning as Bem's eldest son, and deserved at the very least to be among the preselected Oscar as a supporting actor. Matt Ross, who has always been a serial actor, and has never been featured as an actor, now gets his spotlight on his first job as a director, let's keep an eye on what's coming from Matt. Finally, ""Fantastic Captain"" is not a prime, but it is a film that manages to entertain and pass on a message, like a good script and great performances.",Captain Fantastic
94,fciocca,"An emotional rollercoaster, a critique to modern society and to capitalism. A phenomenal cast composed by skillful actors",8,10 November 2020,"Captain Fantastic is one of those rare movies that got me emotional and made me think. It is one of those small gems that more people should watch and appreciate. There are many topics and elements that are perfectly mixed together, conveying an important message in the end. It is a slow burner, especially at the beginning, but this give the opportunity to the audience to really understand the context and to know protagonists of this story. Characters are deepen in every aspect: we get to know how they think, which is their psychology and their life philosophy. Viggo Mortensen nailed as a leading character. He plays the father of six, he decided to live with his family far away from the modern society, in a forest, he home school them, he trains them and even if he is clearly inconsiderate and maybe even a little bit naïve, he clearly loves them. Their small universe crumble when they discover that their mother died after months of suffering due to a mental illness, and this is the exact moment when an emotional rollercoaster begins. The family decide to go to the funeral, leaving the bubble that this father built for them, and confront the real world. Adversities will rise and the relationship between them will change.The movie wants to be partially a critique to modern society, and bad habits that we inherited, such as the excessive usage of technology that deteriorated human relationships, the consumerism that pushed to always buy new stuff, even if we don't really need them. Yes, most of us live the good life, by having all the comforts, but at what cost? Maybe we lost real human connections, we forgot what it means to really immerse ourselves in the nature and appreciate what surround us. But from the other side the movie clearly show that living in our own bubble, without understanding the world around us, can be actually dangerous, because we don't know how to approach it. This concept is very well expressed by Bodevan, the older brother.These are just a few stuff that hit me the most, but there are so many valuable lessons here. I cannot thank enough the colleague that suggested me this, and of course I suggest to everyone to watch this little masterpiece.",Captain Fantastic
95,christian94,Matt Ross' Sophomore Effort Elevates Education,10,30 September 2020,"Viggo Mortensens shines here before his seminal role in Green Book. It is his second Academy Award lead actor nomination. All the actors, young and old are very good as an ensemble cast. The real star however is Matt Ross who writes and direct a complex tale of exploring the limits and merits of thinking and actually living differently. His views on education, religion, death, humour, honesty, consumerism, entertainment, sex and nudity are very interesting and challenge the accepted social norms.The film explores a father's quest to elevate the lives of his children with love, knowledge and deep awareness, yet who is confronted with the clash of this idyllic utopia with the harsh realities of the cold world.Filled with humour, sweet and smart moments, the movie shines and reminds me of some of Little Miss Sunshine (2006) with much deeper and relevant themes. The scene where ""Noam Chomsky Day"" is put against the attractive fairytale of Christmas as a child's point of you is poignant not only in the screenplays powerful points and messages but even more so in the family dynamic of openness and truth-seeking instead of accepting half-baked perpetuated ideas or stroking egos.Another unforgettable scene is when the dad storms the church during a ceremony and makes an epic, no BS and relevant speech that rings true and ""sticks it to the man"".

To dispute several Oscars re 2016 was an obvious prank from the activist Academy that decided to combat the ""trumpamaro chaos"" that now prevails in the US. But the film serves to lift & renew some real emotions - of disgust, basically - as well as to uplift that old, picturesque discussion on what would be a right-wing, a center or a left-wing film. The ""author's message"" says that the anti-hero proves social Darwinism as he proves to be a fittest survivor who trains the family to survive ""savage capitalism."" In fact, I do not condemn, on the contrary I do approve homeschooling. However, how to promote homeschooling without resources like labs and computers in order to properly prepare the offspring for a future where high technology will be ubiquitous? An all-knowing, adult educated daddy who encourages and trains his children to steal would hardly qualify as civilized. The production, of course, can be labeled far-left (it's nihilist, trotskyist, anarchist, anti-Christian, libertarian, etc.) but one must always distinguish between leftward and simply sinister films...

It is made in such a way that evokes a sense of wonder and discovery as we follow Viggo Mortensen's Ben as he attempts to raise his 6 kids in his so called paradise. It challenges his character on what it means to be a parent but also challenges social viewpoints and what education is about. It is wonderfully thought provoking as the film follows a lighthearted and playful beat, asking audience the questions of whether such a mindset that Ben has is truly hindering or forward thinking. It is the outsider's tale as these children attempt to blend and adapt to the modern day society with a hint of childhood innocence. Indeed it is all of these themes tied up into a tale of a father's love to his children, perhaps a simple premise but told in a fascinating and almost magical way that just has some kind of a draw to it.",Captain Fantastic
100,gregeichelberger,Slanted liberal claptrap loved by pompous critics,1,31 January 2017,"**Some major spoiler action**While a liberal fantasy about a father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen, ""Far From Men,"" ""Lord Of the Rings"" trilogy), with no filter, raising his eclectic brood of six in the North woods may cause a great majority of film critics to go into hysterics, it's as a pompous and pretentious an exhibition ever put on film. Self-styled intellectual movie reviewers (many of whom probably feel the same way about the general movie-going public as Mortensen's character feels about everyone) are falling all over themselves to honor a man whose mentally ill wife commits suicide-partially because of Ben's isolationist, environmental, elitist lifestyle. Let's face it, Ben is an overbearing douche-bag with no redeeming qualities, whatsoever, and we the audience have to sit through and digest a film which concludes with the theft of a dead body and a terrible rendition of Guns N Roses' ""Sweet Child Of Mine."" This was truly one of THE worst movies of 2016, with no exceptions. We are introduced to the family when the oldest of six bizarrely-named children, Bodevan (George MacKay, ""Private Peaceful""), kills a deer with his bare hands, while Ben makes him eat the heart to become a man. The movie then proceeds to go downhill from there, if that's even anywhere conceivable. Since he says what on his mind and seemingly does not care what comes out of his mouth (diplomacy and tact are definitely NOT in his vocabulary), we have to listen to him pontificate on how America is an evil corporate entity and hear his robotic children echo the same left-wing claptrap over and over again. In addition, he forces them to run through the forest, climbs rock faces and glaciers, steal food, insult people, talk back to their elders, disrespect people who do not agree with their bohemian lifestyle and to just be obnoxious brats. They then find out that their mother committed suicide after being institutionalized, but Ben is told by his angry father-in-law (the eternally angry Frank Langella (Academy Award- nominated for ""Frost-Nixon"") not to show up. But of course, since it's in the script and we need to see the family outside of their mountainside hermitage, the troupe makes the trek to New Mexico in a school bus stolen from the ""Partridge Family"" TV show. En route, they rip off a grocery store (while dad fakes a heart attack); go into a restaurant, sit down, receive menus and the abruptly leave when they discover that food is served there; outwit a redneck policeman and show Ben stepping off the bus totally naked (although he later sports an equally offensive ""Jesse Jackson 88"" shirt - who helped co-write this nonsense, Al Gore?) There is also no shame in this guy as he tells a 6-year old girl about intercourse (even giving her the book, ""Joy Of Sex"") and lectures his nephews on how smart his children are compared to them and their dopey parents (if I wanted to be condescended to by leftist morons, I'd simply watch CNN or MSNBC or any of the major networks' newscasts). He also forces his offspring to celebrate the birthday of liberal socialist writer, Noam Chomsky. Few children have ANY idea WHO Chomsky is, but to prove the leftist leanings of the film's writer/director, Matt Ross (""28 Hotel Rooms""), it's a major part of the film. The kids are even given dangerous knives and other weapons to ""celebrate"" the occasion. Then, when one of the children questions this stupidity, the father shames him into arguing intellectually against ""Noam Chomsky Day"" (hey, Matt, I could give you about 50 reasons, but no one asked my opinion). None of these ludicrous activities evidently seem to cause ANYONE to blink an eye, but the crazed Ben finally goes overboard when he crashes the funeral, stands up and does a comedy routine (left-leaning comedians are NOT funny and neither is this blather) and tells everyone that his late wife was a Buddhist and wanted to be cremated (instead of buried).Finally, the father-in-law (as well as all of us) has had enough and calls security. Told in no uncertain terms that he will NOT be welcome to the interment ceremony. In the meantime, Bodevan has been accepted to every Ivy League college in existence, yet cannot even make simple conversation with anyone outside of his family and Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton, ""Strangerland""), who breaks his hand while rock climbing in the rain, tells his father he hates him and wants to live with his wealthy, stable grandparents (finally, one of the children sees the light). Motivated by this, the grandfather files for custody of the children so they might have a safe, normal life. Unfortunately, one of the non-descript teenage daughters tries to ""rescue"" the boy, falls off the roof and sustains serious injury, but once again, there are absolutely no consequences for this addled, horrible, neglectful parent. Worst yet, the children run away with this jerk and then they break into a cemetery, steal their mother's corpse and roasting it on a pile of logs. OK, I know I am writing WAY too much into this, but the logistics of a group of children digging up a body and removing it are staggering. Graves are dug with backhoes and most caskets are buried in concrete vaults to keep water and other material out. It takes these morons about two minutes to complete a task which would literally take hours. Much will also be made of the fact that Mortensen earned his second Academy Award nomination (his first was for ""Eastern Promises"" in 2007) for playing Ben. If pure hatred of a character is motivation for such an honor, then he deserves the statuette hands down. Grade: F",Captain Fantastic
101,Eddie_weinbauer,Interesting piece of film,10,15 October 2016,"I find the film to be quite interesting in many ways. The dilemma it causes, when you take people from the wild,and gonna put em into the modern society, is one of them. It raises a lot of philosophical questions in me. I like the fathers way of being brutally honest, and not sugar coating life's up's and downs, for his kids.On the other hand they didn't know how to socially interact with other people,outside of their little family/ tribe. Which I also found a bit weird.Cause they must have been running into people at the gas station,where they collected their mail,and got money for what they sold ,so I felt some of that was a bit over the top.Made to set a point how ill equipped for the modern society they were.There was very little interaction between the kids and others,only on a few occasions,and than,mostly to show how smart they were, or how ill equipped they were socially. They didn't really adapt all that well.There was no curiosity on how others did stuff,they them self didn't do.Or never had done.I think the moral of the movie was to show that everything,can be taken to the extreme if you are not self aware.And that it's easy to loose your self in both worlds. Personally I think they were better off in the backwoods of Boulder,but at the same time,they would sooner or later need to break out of the backwoods and find their own way of life.Either that, or start inbreeding.All in all I think their dads biggest mistake,was he never thought of preparing them for life outside of the woods",Captain Fantastic

All of them were there and they had their notebooks form school and now everything changed but the knowledge and experience that their father provided them is unique. There were some scenes that were maybe too much and some that are not well explained but nothing that can't stop you from saying that movie showed something else to all of us.

The combination of name and Poster was enough to catch my attention. Captain fantastic tells the story of a dad who travels on a bus with his kids while living a very unique life of survival away from the modern world. The kids are trained to hunt, to fight, to survive under any circumstances on top of receiving top notch education from their father. The thing is that the kids are not that young anymore, and they start to understand that the way they are living is turning them into freaks more than unique individuals. The most grown-ups start to put up to their father although they respect the way he has raised them. Their slow integration into the reality of society results in some funny conversations and situations but that remain quite serious at the same time. I have to say I have really loved Captain Fantastic as it is not very often that you come across a movie that feels that little bit different from the rest.

105,ctowyi,A gem of a film. Great feels,8,20 July 2016,"Captain Fantastic begins with the death of a boy and the birth of a man. What a gem of a film! We had to sit at the front row because of a full-house screening, but the punishing ordeal was but a breeze as 2 hours whizzed by. Viggo Mortensen plays a Renaissance man Ben who is out of this world, but never out of his depth. He is a father to six children and they live off the grid in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, eating off the land. Every day he home-schools his children in jungle survival skills, hand-to-hand combat, vertical rock-face climbing and pushes their fitness levels to way off the charts. The children, ranging from an 8-year-old to a 17-year-old, are fluent in philosophy, history, literature, foreign languages (including mandarin!), music and even quantum theory! Their mother's death forces the family of 7 to board the family bus named Steve for modern society. Ben and his posse of 6 aren't quite ready for the cruel world and the world aren't quite ready for Ben, Bolevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai - all original names lovingly created by their parents because they feel their names should reflect the fact that each one of them is unique. OMG I want one too!The film is superbly written, acted, musically scored, shot and directed. It is suffused with social commentary on the education system, parenting techniques, societal norms and the handling of grief. Writer-director Matt Ross never pushes one agenda over another, allowing a scene to play out nicely. It takes a lot of restraint to present both sides of the argument without screaming in your face what you should do. In so doing I start to question the different ways of upbringing and which side of the fence I will sit on. Watch out for a pivotal scene at the dinner table where two families gather. You know a WWIII is about to happen as the youngest girl asks to taste wine and the man of the house is trying very hard to explain how did Aunt Harper, Ben's wife, die. The scene is hilarious and thought provoking as two schools of thought on parenting come into loggerheads with one another. There is another scene that rings emphatically true for me. Being an educator for the longest time, I have always felt teachers in classrooms predominantly emphasise the ""how"" and ""what"" in lessons. The ""why"" is usually treated as a cursory by-line because the ""how-s"" and the ""what-s"" will get a student through the huddles of exams and tests. Ben notices Vespyr is reading Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, a book way ahead of her Literature curve, and proceeds to ask her what she thinks of it. An ubiquitous ""it is interesting"" comment rings out and in Ben's family mantra ""interesting"" is a non-word. He coaxes out more depth and analysis from her and her reply will put pride in any parent or an educator. The film rests on Viggo Mortensen's shoulders and he is perfectly cast. He embodies all the attributes of a father - authoritarian, hardheadedness, arrogant, eccentric, kind, warm, understanding and respectful. All through it, his grace, love and adoration for his children shine out like a beacon in a dark place. This is flat-out effortlessly one of the best performances I have seen this year. The rest of the kids are also captivatingly natural and raw. I read in an interview that Ross would linger the camera on the kids to capture them in a natural state so as to bring out the best in them. If their antics and love for learning don't hit a raw nerve in you, it probably means you have already been molded and indoctrinated by the society. The last act feels a little too neat and tidy for my liking but it doesn't take away the fact that this is one of those rare movies that truly engages your intellectual mind, endeavours to question societal norms and dares to ""stick it to the man"". How it does all this without being high-handedly preachy is FANTASTIC! I particularly love the last sendoff scene. To me it means our lives don't have to be someone else's idea of what we should be. We can be what we choose. And if anyone is ever in a position to take our lives away from us? We should do something about that.",Captain Fantastic
106,Slarkshark,We Should All be a Little More Fantastic,9,19 November 2020,"I am so thrilled to have come across this movie. Viggo is one of my favourites, and he is so good in this as he is with all his roles.What a deep look into perspectives and philosophies. Ben (Viggo Mortensen) firmly believes life should be lived a certain way. I respect and admire that. In so many ways I am envious of him. The first third of the movie it would seem the children are destined for greatness with how smart and physically fit they are. Though, the remainder of the movie exposes that they may not be entirely prepared for how the ""real"" world is, as unfortunate as that is. Ben's idea of an ideal life for his children is not quite so picture perfect. Corporate America, and the everyday life of an average American has it's flaws, which Ben likes to point out, but not necessarily make fun of. He just doesn't want that for his children, though his own philosophies are proven to be somewhat flawed at their core as well. That's why I don't think it's a good idea to go to the extremes as Ben and his family go to at the beginning, but find a sort of middle ground as it would appear they do at the end.This most definitely deserves a high rating merely for its thought provoking ideas, but it is also wildly entertaining. There are several things that I don't necessarily agree with Ben in this film, however after watching, I also feel a desire to be much more Ben like. It gives a feeling of wanting to live a better and fuller life. That's why I think everyone should take the time to watch this film, especially if you're a parent.",Captain Fantastic
107,ccorral419,Fantastic!,10,12 August 2016,"Matt Ross (""Silicon Valley's"" - Galvin Belson) steps into the director/writer chair here, presenting a unique look at off the grid and home school living. Viggo Mortensen (""The Road"") graciously and cautiously leads his family of six (George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell) in the wildness, away from the confines of all things materialistic. In good times, the family is self-sufficient and happy. However, when forced back into the real world, the stark differences of their way of life become more apparent. Mortensen is great in these type of raw roles, as the camera eats up his casual approach. The kids are great across the board, with Mackay and Hamilton giving that little something extra that keeps one glued to their characters. ""The American's"" Frank Langella and Ann Dowd, team up again as the parent in- laws, and it's easy to see why they work so well together, and Steven Zahn and Kathryn Hahn make a great couple who have very different way of raising their child, and thus walk a fine line when interacting with Mortensen's character. Helping Ross's excellent direction and storyline along is the excellent soothing music by Alez Somers (""We Bought a Zoo""). There are no explosions, gun battles, ships from outer space or funny animated creators here. However, ""Captain Fantastic"" is filled with family appreciation and the struggle/desire to do the best one can do with a given situations and for the betterment of the children.

108,PCT1970,Fantastic Viggo,8,6 May 2019,"Ross' second feature film which he also penned is a virtuous dramedy. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, editing and acting. The entire cast deliver superlative performances with Mortensen leading the way. It is by far the best performance of his versatile career. The plot revolves around the Cash family that are removed from society and live deep in the Washington state wilderness due to the parent's, Ben and Leslie, beliefs. There the children are schooled in all aspects of life including education, physical fitness, survival without technology and being one with nature to name a few. After the sudden death of Leslie who suffers from bi-polar disorder, Ben makes the difficult choice of introducing the family to society and civilization due to Leslie's father Jack insisting on a traditional funeral for his daughter. Ben wants to honor Leslie's wishes to be creamated, but eventually bends to Jack's threats and demands. This is what ignites a road trip to life. It is an incredible and difficult journey for all the characters involved as many secrets and desires are revealed. After the children are introduced to their grandparents, Jack and Abigail, they have to make the decision to stay with them or choose to continue life with their father. The ending is wonderful, surprising, heartwrenching and cathartic. This film is an outstanding examination of family dynamics and the willingness to change. It is unique, insightful, clever, funny, and memorable. It is an ingenious dramedy and an all around work of art.",Captain Fantastic

Anyway though I thought some parts of the movie were way too PC and unrealistic, but an ok watch nonetheless, and a very good idea.",Captain Fantastic
110,Semisonic,"Potency is power, but what is happiness?",8,21 January 2017,"A man lives with his six children, age from 8 to around 18, in the woods, where he trains them as some utopian superhumans. But all goes sideways when the mother of the children and the man's wife kills herself...Do we like the world we live in? Do we wanna change it to the better, or there's no other way but to bend down and adapt? Well, Captain Fantastic is a story about people who had no illusions about the modern society surrounding them, so instead of letting it crook their lives and the lives of their children they decided to create their own small paradise, the triumphant kingdom of both physical and mental superiority. But it would be too simplistic to paint the story in just black and white, so to make our superkids a little more human the filmmakers gave them a flaw of being absolutely incapacitated socially. The whole movie then progresses by using that striking contrast as its driver until, eventually, it settles things to a seemingly reasonable consensus between the perfect ideas and the imperfect world those ideas have to be implemented in....There's a moment in this film when Viggo Mortensen's character asks his daughter to give her analysis of Nabokov's Lolita. She at first struggles to find the right words, saying ""it's interesting"". ""Be more specific"", he replies, because he tries to teach his kids to do more than just scratching the surface and being satisfied with simple answers.Well, finding the right words for this film might be an equally challenging task. And it's definitely a mixed bag of emotions and impressions. I like and admire the film for how beautifully it's made. The chemistry between the kids, more bound to each other now that they have nobody else to turn to, and their father, who's both an upholding pillar of their lives and a subject of their angst and frustration, is a never-ending source of wonder. Now that Viggo Mortensen's gradually ending his career as an action figure, seeing him go for the emotional complexity - and succeed at it - is quite a pleasure.What I don't find the pleasure in, however, is a typical loophole of giving the otherwise flawless characters a defect both huge and unlikely, using that trick to create something resembling a conflict the movie would be so desperately lacking otherwise. Why do children who can master quantum physics or military-grade physical training have to be so blatantly ignorant when it comes to the regular people's lives? Why would a kid know about the Supreme Court cases but have no idea what Nike or Coca Cola is? Why would a guy be speaking six languages but have no idea how to talk to a girl? It's not like the only books in this world are for nerds, we have social studies and psychological literature as well. Of course, if Ben's kids were reading those books too they would be Hanna-like complete (for those unaware who I refer to, please watch the 2011 film of the same name, it's really awesome in its own right). But that kind of perfection assumes a sense of purpose, something that we regular flawed people are entitled not to have or to struggle searching for, and something that turns a perfect human into something not entirely human but rather like a tool or a weapon. And the thing Ben's kids definitely don't have is a knowledge of what to do with such fantastically special selves.Maybe I'm over-analyzing and it's just my wishful thinking, but it really seems that behind the story of Captain Fantastic is a story of us all and the question we all seek the answer for: what is happiness and what's the way to achieve it? It's clear that the ""superkids"" in this film are superior to the most of us in terms of mental and physical development. But what's the point of all that potency? Does it make them happy? Do they feel better than the regular typical us simply because they are healthier, stronger or more educated? Or do they feel lonely and cast away from the society which finds unity in its common flaws and mistakes? Because those fat/lazy/shortsighted and basically ignorant people don't seem to suffer too much from their imperfections. Maybe they don't even realize their existence. Ignorance may be a real bliss sometimes.The only problem is that once you've gotten yourself above that bliss and saw the ugliness it grows from, no matter how much you try to go back you won't be able to get it back, you've come undone already. So the seemingly blissful finale of the film's story is nothing more than just a question: you have traded in your consistency, but have you gotten what you wanted, have you become happy for real? And come think of it, ignorance might not only be a source of bliss but the very single chance to achieve it...",Captain Fantastic
111,daniellawson-14-787057,"It's made well, but very uncomfortable",6,28 May 2020,"POSITIVES:1) Viggo Mortensen and George Mackay are both fantastic
2) I liked the fact that the kids were all stronger and smarter than other kids their age
3) The emotional conflict and turmoil, especially within Mortensen and Mackay, is portrayed very well and emotionallyNEGATIVES:1) This might be a personal thing, but for me it was really hard to feel a great attachment to the lead family because their views are so wrong. The film opens with them slitting an innocent deer's throat, instantly making them unlikable, and there are plenty of other moments in the film where they do terrible things and just seem very unlikable and even insane
2) When the lead family meet their other relatives in 'normal society', those characters are all very unlikable too! Also, there are 3 teenage boy characters in the film and they are all insanely annoying
3) Without spoiling it, the film's ending seems like it has gone in a certain direction, and you feel the emotion of that direction, and then with 10-15 minutes left the direction completely reverses and I wasn't at all pleased with the reversal",Captain Fantastic
112,ilovesaturdays,Fantastic but has a few flaws,8,3 January 2021,"This is a movie about a father who is raising 6 children in the wild and the various parenting choices that he has to make along the way. At some point, every parent has to make certain difficult parenting decisions, but our protagonist here has clearly taken this to the next level. He trains his kids really well but realizes, like every parent on the planet, that he may not have all the answers after all.
It is hinted that the reason behind this alternative lifestyle was the fact that his wife had bipolar disorder and they decided that perhaps going back to nature might serve her very well. However, after the birth of their last child, she developed post-partum depression, which made things worse. The suicide of his wife is an eye-opener for him, so is the fact that his children are questioning his beliefs and are low on social quotient. When his daughter gets hurt while on one of their missions, he starts to reevaluate everything.
The movie has a great premise and there are many superb moments in the movie. The cinematography and acting are both first rate.
This is exactly my kind of movie, but what kept me from giving it all 10 stars was the fact that while trying to shun the normal conventions, this film takes a very extremist viewpoint and ends up being equally intolerant of other ideas. Teaching kids to steal can never be justified even of you were trying to 'stick it to the man'! I can live with the fact that they somehow had enough money to buy the forest land and were all practically multi-talented geniuses, but I still feel that the ending could've been a bit stronger. Now, I realize that in real life also, we hardly know what's right or wrong, but once the gauntlet had been thrown, I wanted the film to rise up to the challenge. However, even though it did fall short, it didn't do so by a huge margin and is therefore, a funny and thought provoking film. Makes me very glad that I watched this!",Captain Fantastic
113,spencergrande6,Outrageously unbelievable but the message is fine,6,24 February 2017,"I never bought into this film's world of a delusional isolationist utopia and the obese capitalist automatons filling the outside world they fled from. It's used as a joke (how dumb this country is!) and as a way of courting empathy through the shared sense of superiority the audience has following this family as the protagonist. It's also outrageously unbelievable -- the kids all know like 6 languages, have read all great works of literature, play instruments, are up to date on all monthly periodicals and science magazines, oh right and outrageously fit and well-fed and know how to hunt and farm and THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY! And the hypocrisy of their lifestyle going mostly unchallenged...But that's not really what this film is about. It's about dealing with grief in the best way you can, however that may be, other people's beliefs and their customs be damned. You're allowed to feel how you want and deal with it as you please. Viggo is great as usual. Taken on those merits, the film works a little more than it doesn't.",Captain Fantastic
114,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Refreshing, brave and brutally honest.",9,14 September 2016,"Actor Matt Ross, who is possibly recognisable from Face/Off, Aviator or American Psycho, writes and directs his second main feature about an isolated family living in the forests of the Pacific Northwest with Viggo Mortensen playing Dad, Ben, a free-spirited man who educated and trains his six children that might appear harsh and brutal at times. As many might assume, the children would be neglected, malnourished and uneducated but the complete opposite comes clear as the story goes on. There's so many home truths from this movie, it made me feel like a hypocrite, and rightly so, in fact the brutal honesty that is displayed by Ben and his children is astonishing and inspiring. Yes, at times quite awkward but certainly makes you question society's way of life and thinking. Their mother has sadly passed away and so they begin a quest to rescue her from those against her will, venturing into the 'real' world with Ben as their forever-sarcastic tour-guide and teacher. It's the conflicts with the rest of the family that really makes this ground-breaking and thought provoking. Is it really the right thing? What does it mean to actually be free? And what is today's society teaching our future? The complete cast of children are amazing, each with their own characteristics, we quickly learn who's who and which direction they possibly want to go in. Passionate, rebellious, inquisitive, brave and loving are just a few of the attributes the children flair off. Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn and Frank Langella play their parts brilliantly even if only brief when compared to the children and Viggo, but seeing the disapproval yet contradictory opinions is spell-binding. Viggo appears to be one of those actors that chooses his roles very carefully and takes them personally, he makes them personal which is evident in his acting. I've been familiar with Viggo (doesn't seem right saying Mortensen) since Carlito's Way and his short but epic portrayal of Lucifer in The Prophesy, but I'm sure it's fair to say it was his Aragorn from Lord of the Rings that put his name up in lights, following with films such as Eastern Promises, The Road and A History Of Violence, all being amazing movies with thanks to him. This is no exception. The music and score that accompany the film is on point, especially when the family sing and play together, giving a great sense of union and love that's heart-warming and touching. This being Alex Somers second main feature as composer, he delivers an ambient, dreamy score that's uplifting and peaceful. It's beautifully filmed, well paced and quite unpredictable, loaded with shocking revelations and an incredibly script. A perfect drama for current times, an amazing piece of cinema from Matt Ross.

115,gcsman,"A really, really interesting film. See it!",9,25 August 2018,"A movie like this gives you a deep level of interest and satisfaction that no action flick, rom-com, horror movie, or other genre effort no matter how good can do. Captain Fantastic is not easily categorized as a comedy, or a tragedy, or any other single thing really. The themes are life, family, parents and children, education, society, and personal character all expertly interwoven into a thoroughly absorbing story. Too bad more people didn't see this.(First off, I have no idea what the film title means. It's got no relation to any kind of fantasy or superhero themes.) Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, who along with his wife Leslie (Trin Miller) has raised a family of five kids totally by themselves in remote Washington state wilderness. Ben and Leslie are late-era hippies: dropouts, yes, but dropouts with a mission that in many senses is harder to do than just staying within society. They are adamantly dedicated to staying away from the ""real world"" that is dominated by shallow pursuits and corporate greed; their kids are home-schooled and given the best mental and physical education they can make for them.But then Leslie falls terminally ill and Ben and their kids travel south to attend her funeral and meet the relatives they have never seen before. At this point, the story becomes a road movie, with some predictable happenings but much that is surprising too. Some of it is sad, some of it delightful. Frank Langella has the rather thankless task of playing Leslie's father Jack, a rich businessman with conventional attitudes who eventually wants to take the kids away from Ben and 'normalize' them. Jack does, in a way, care about his grandkids but his ethos and his methods are bull-headed. And at this point, the road movie becomes a heist whose outcome you don't see coming. To put it briefly, the five brothers and sisters go through some bumps in the road, but in the end they show a deep loyalty to themselves and the ideals given to them by their parents that isn't shaken by encounters with the outside world, and they act accordingly, all together. When they meet their worldly cousins, it's the cousins who end up looking like fools.Viggo Mortensen is the headliner, and he's great, but the kids end up being functionally the stars of the story. They are gems, all five of them -- beautiful in mind, body, and spirit. The dialogs among them and their father are endlessly fascinating; none of them know what's supposed to be ""appropriate learning"" for their ages, so they learn everything with their parents' happy encouragement, and if they have questions about anything at all (sex, politics, physics, economics ... you name it), those questions get asked, and their father answers them straight-on. The kids have an inbuilt self-esteem that is the result of hard-earned competence and widespread knowledge, not the superficial betrayal of constantly being told that they're 'special'. What impresses you most is their simplicity (not the same as naivete), openness, and honesty of character, and a kind of deep-seated calmness that we see all the way to the end. And there are books around, all the time. Lots of books, of every kind; aside from wilderness survival skills, those are the only things that Ben and Leslie thought were worth keeping from the ""real"" world.At the end, Ben and his family have reached a new accommodation among themselves and the outside world and the conclusion is very satisfying. Ben won't be seeing them all day long any more, but there are no doubts that the kids will be all right.",Captain Fantastic

Ben Cash with his long hair and bearded face appears uneducated but has a wealth of knowledge and has earned respect and trust from all his kids. Wife is mentioned in the movie several times but because of a mental breakdown not in the picture of parenting. Frank Langella as Jack plays the role of a wealthy father in law who has a very condescending attitude towards son in law but loves the grand kids. When Ben and six kids visit Ben's sister Harper ( Kathryn Hahn nice even in bad moms) and husband Dave ( Steve Zahn) , the differences between their 2 kids who go to regular schools and Ben's 6 kids who are home schooled are vast and fascinating. i enjoyed the movie and agree with the concept of parents, who bring in kids into their world, when totally involved in their upbringing have great results.

122,athena24,"Original, funny, well crafted, idealistic, exaggerated.",8,28 October 2018,"Despite that I can't relate much to Ben's character or to the overall family's lifestyle, I found 'Captain Fantastic' to be entertaining. Original story, combined with good performances and beautiful cinematography makes it a pleasant watch.The majority of negative reviews I read here berate the father (Ben) and his ideology towards tutoring his kids and life in general. And while I do agree with the majority of these claims, It didn't deteriorate much the overall experience watching the film.Yes, Ben's character is an ultra idealistic father, despising the society and raising his kids to be superhuman. However, his (and his children's) skills are so exaggerated that I couldn't take it too seriously. Moreover, although the movie bears ideological line that it might want to pass to the viewer (and this sparks a lot of controversy), it is quite superficial.To sum this short review up, if one won't focus on the ideological side or the characters' rightness / wrongness, one will enjoy all the merits the movie has to offer: Solidly constructed plot, acting, cinematography, scenery, characters and all the funny situations and encounters they have.",Captain Fantastic
123,stonedraim,Wonderful. Important. Watch and think.,8,6 November 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Once in a while, a movie comes forward that has an very innovative (almost strange) script that is produced and fabricated in an solid and splendid way. A kind of motion picture that creates something that has seemed to be boring, yet grows the fascinating sides of both the story and the telling. Captain Fantastic is on of those productions. An family living out in the wild, blended with modern tools and facilities to a certain limit. A father creating maybe a deranged reality for his children when trying to give love in an disciplined and structured way. A situation where the mother is drawn into sickness and crushes the ""illusion"" of the bad and over explicit society that only exists to consume; she is deadly ill and suddenly the arranged living out in the woods is threatened in is own purpose.Captain Fantastic raises so many questions and tries at the same time to get around and clear up some of our times most discussed matters; where is Mother Earth going? Is it the best way of saving the planet in getting back to the wild far from the awareness from the modern society? Is the possible dystopian future a blend of a world devastated from it's population (the humans) and a strong sense of the nature as it once was? Or is all this only psychological and philosophic thoughts that only thrives from peoples own energy? Is it right for anyone to convince, convey and force a certain lifestyle on and to another human being from the perspective of trying to do something good? Can the human be absolute in objectivity and absolute in being neutral? Is there dangerous things everywhere for children, or can adults and dependants explain and deliver awareness in such way that the ""dangerous things"" fades away.... as of giving children real hunting knifes? Is it true and/or right to give children a ""world"" of logic (in a way) and intelligence, and make the emotional and social environments and developments some kind of obsolete?The environments and atmosphere in this movie is beautiful and sad simultaneously. A vast movie that contemplates and deliver. A motion picture to reflect around... and cherish, if so. A movie that really reaches out there and works its way through the screen to spell some kind of message, that is for the viewer to read. I thought this were important to watch.A metaphor that is to the spot. Around 43 minutes. The father (Viggo Mortensen) is having trouble with the fact that his wife has committed suicide and tries to hold the family intact. In the store, he is having a heart attack (or did he... or was it?), and at the same time a song is played in the stores PA system... ""My heart will go on"". The dialogue within the whole concept, both verbally and visually, is outstanding. Well written and well displayed. You have to see and listen for yourself. About 33 minutes into this one. A great and truthful dialogue about both explaining sexuality to a child and at the same time being straight forward in a very informed matter and way. When the understanding comes forward and the truth and transparency of the communication between human beings flourishes, love and understanding is letting us feel and become more of ourselves.As an pedagogue in real life, I have had several discussions around where (if there is a where) the line goes of telling children the exact truth and being calm and straight forward in a loving way at the same time. This movie, ""Captain Fantastic"" digs right into this matter, and I love it. With total truth, love, calm, harmony, peace and a display of details, children almost always understand and grasp the exact situation and information. I adore this film in that way.An example of dialogue: Girl: ""Claire."" Bodevan: ""Bodevan."" Girl: ""Bodevan....? What kind of name is that?"" Bodevan: ""My parents made it up."" Girl: ""They made it up...?"" Bodevan: ""Yes. It is unique. There is only one of me in the entire world."" This kind of dialogue would make this film be nominated for an Academy Award.Again....and again....and again.... everybodys name's Jack (Frank Langella).....Last and maybe most important: ""The real world"". What is that.............? At the end of the movie, I found myself clap my hands for the great picture and story.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid! Splendid! I think I got the point out there now... - The actors : Viggo Mortensen is very stable and sound in his character. He delivers a firm man that believes in something very passionate. Wherever Viggo is, there is quality. So in here. Amazing actors and amazing director: Matt Ross, thank you for this extraordinary piece. - Entertainment : You have to see this to believe it yourself. A movie can be this good, yes. And raise so much at the same time. Still.... I think this movie divides people into two; total ignorance or total love. - Age : A very hard thing to grasp and say. Probably is 11 a fair age, despite the fact that things is hidden and hold from children... for their own safety and sake?8,1 out of 10.

Proper entertainment.)",Captain Fantastic

125,domtaylor,This outstanding family drama is one of the best in years.,9,10 July 2018,"Captain Fantastic' is an emotionally charged family drama with excellent characters and performances that truly elevate the picture. The film feels very naturalistic, thanks to the handheld camera and realistic nature of the screenplay and acting. The film is heavily politically charged, however writer/director Matt Ross does a good job at allowing the audience to make up their own political viewpoints. While the film is told from the 'Cash' family's perspective, the character of 'Jack', who would traditionally be seen as the film's antagonist, isn't portrayed as evil but simply another man with different attitudes to life. This is where the film really excels. It opens a window to the lives of a wide variety of characters and never tells us how to feel, instead simply showing us what they think and feel and allowing us to decide how we react to that. At times, the film is genuinely funny too and that is another aspect of this film that I love. It has the perfect blend of drama and comedy and, as such, feels very much like a slice-of-life. It can be dead serious and genuinely emotionally affecting one minute, and then funny and feel-good the next. Viggo Mortensen delivers an outstanding performance as a father who just wants the best for his children, and this is another great aspect of the film. It is about the importance of family, and explores what 'family' means to different people and social groups. The contrasts between how different groups perceive Ben's parenthood sets the film apart and allows audiences to choose how they personally feel. In conclusion 'Captain Fantastic' is not only one of the most genuinely emotional and heartwarming films of recent years, but also one of the best. 9/10",Captain Fantastic

134,El-Ak,Another great movie by Viggo!,8,15 July 2019,"Viggo has become one of my favorite actors recently, and I just can't get enough of his charm and excellence at every role he does smoothly and easily like that with such great performance. The movie is great with shocking scenes as the story requires some of it. The comedy part almost didn't exist in the film that's why it's rating decreased for me. The story and some parts near the ending that I couldn't get convinced with or feel that they were a bit too quickly for someone raising his children like that for more than a decade and a half. Also hate to see lots of actors that you know ill not fit any other film which his children in this movie is, they don't act they act normal but it feels new cause they are new faces only. The music of the film is also extraordinary with a few awesome shots of the beautiful cinematography. Don't miss this ride 8.5/10",Captain Fantastic
135,midas-jacobs,Fantastic film,10,27 November 2016,"""Captain Fantastic"" is about a family, who's mother has passed away. Now the dad, played by Viggo Mortensen, has to bring his kids into our modern-day society to attend the funeral of their mom. The movie was directed and written by Matt Ross. This was his second time directing. Matt Ross did a very good job at directing the movie. He was able to create a realistic feel, to an uncommon event: The kids being hyper intelligent and living in the woods, etc. Matt Ross also was able to create a pretty looking movie. The scenery looked gorgeous and the framing used by Matt Ross was done very well. The backgrounds didn't look like they were created by green screen or by the help of some special effects. Ross also has his own little style, which was notable at times, but it didn't take over the movie. The editing was at times very fast paced, but this wasn't an issue for me, because Ross integrated it very well into the movie, that it fitted perfectly. Something that the man did good as well, were the transactions between the sad parts and the uplifting/happy parts. These two things will also be mentioned in my second to last paragraph. The last thing I want to mention in this paragraph is the soundtrack. It was very well done. They used already existing songs, but also newly created songs like El Hilo De Ariadna, this one was written by Viggo Mortensen and his co-star George MacKay. The instrumentals that they chose to do these songs were unconventional, but fitted with the theme of the movie very well. The cover of ""Sweet Child 'O Mine"", was one of my favorites, because it was sung very well and had some good guitar to back it up. The song does fit with the situation they were in at that time.The acting was very good. Viggo Mortensen plays the dad of the family. He once again gives a fantastic performance. I really hope that he get's an Oscar nomination for his role, but I doubt this will happen, because this was just a small movie, that has gone under the radar for a lot of your average movie goers. Viggo gives an emotional performance in which he delivers very well. He looks like a damaged man and he could show his emotions, without saying he felt sad. That's a problem with a lot of actors these days. The words coming out of their mouth insinuate that they are sad and there is a tear rolling down their cheek, but their acting is just flat. They do what they are told and don't show any real emotion and that's something Viggo Mortensen did, and that's why he deserves a nomination. Another reason I doubt this, is because of the competition this year. There were a lot of kid actors in the movie, so I'm not going to go over every one of them, I'm just going to select a few of them. Let's start of with Nicholas Hamilton. He played the more rebellious son of them all. He really was against everything his dad did. This actor was the one I disliked the most of them all. He wasn't bad, but certainly not good. He did get the hardest part to play from all of the other kid actors. He sometimes had a bit of a grin on his face even when he had to do some dramatic scenes, but at times he really nailed those as well. There were just some parts, where he didn't really live up to being good. George McKay was good as well. He played the older son, who has problems integrating into our modern-day society. He was very convincing in his part.The writing was also very good. The screenplay was funny at times, but also sad at times. The funny parts were subtle and creative. There weren't any poo jokes like in almost every comedy these days. The sad parts were mostly commentary on the world we live in today. The movie brings up a lot of topics to think about, which I very much liked. It also doesn't give a one sided view on our reality. You'd think that we only get to see how Ben sees the world and why he went to live in the forest. This is true for the most part. And for that part you agree with Ben on a lot of topics, but when they are in the ""real world"" we get to know that his kids are not ready for it. They only got to study via books and not via real experiences. They only learned the words, without knowing what they really were. And that's what I really like about the movie. The characters were also very well developed. I was expecting the movie to start immediately by saying: ""your mother is dead"", but the movie takes its time to first set up its characters and the main premise of the movie. The characters had some arcs, which is always a good thing. The screenplay did contain some dull moments, like the part where they are stealing the body of their mom, this just felt very unrealistic to me.In the end ""Captain Fantastic"" was a well acted and written movie. It was funny at times, but knew when to be dramatic. The movie will probably be under looked by the average movie goer, which is a shame, because this is one of the better movies of the year. That's why this one is getting a 9.5/10 from me.",Captain Fantastic
136,jonnithomas,This is a genuinely lovely film,8,18 November 2016,The characters are all very solid and well directed and the storyline is good.There are other reviews which go into the details of the storyline so I won't. It's basically about trying to live life right and be self sufficient as an individual and a family. That may sound boring but it really really isn't The acting of all the characters including the children is first rate and the story is captivating.It ends on a genuinely feel good factor despite the basic storyline being quite sad. well at least it should be sad but it's not. it's somehow uplifting and satisfying at the end.it's well worth watching.,Captain Fantastic
137,texshelters,Interesting themes and great acting make for an interesting if not great film.,7,29 August 2016,"Captain Fantastic: Not Fantastic, but Pretty GoodCaptain Fantastic, starring Vigo Mortensen, taught me a few things. However, it wasn't the revelatory, ground breaking film it could have been. Nor was it advertised as such. Its advertising makes the film seem like a custody battle film like Kramer versus Kramer but with step son and granddad fighting over the kids. However, that wasn't the main point of the film. The main conflict in the film was between the human past and the present, human utopian society versus the human dystopian present. The film shows us the downside of modern society, something they could have done more of to bring the idea home and to help us understand protagonist Ben's anti-capitalist, anti-modernist perspective. Sure, they show us shots of a Walmart and various big box and big chain stores. But those are shot from a moving vehicle at a distance. Why not have some shots of people entrapped in the shopping experience, buying ridiculous items they don't need. There was also the opportunity to show conspicuous consumption and the damage it does in various locales, grandpas house, grocery store, a diner. Speaking of things we don't see: where are all the minorities that we know live in California? The family goes to a diner, a church, a housing complex, a grocery store, a trailer park, and in none of these places was a non-white person seen. In SoCal? I haven't seen a film this white since seeing Boyhood. But unlike Boyhood, this film dealt with important themes such as consumerism, capitalism, greed, entitlement, a persons desires after death, mental illness, personal autonomy versus group and societal responsibility and so on. The problem is that when the film makers had the chance to bring these home, they dropped the ball. The family, because of their status and background were not actually on the brink as they appeared at first. They have a network of well off people who can rescue them. I don't mind that, but in a family that is so aware of philosophy and the political economy of Marx and others, educated in historical materialism, should have also known something about race. It would have added a lot to the film if the racial differences in class opportunity had been dealt with. What these portrayal ended succeeded at was highlighting the myopia of the American left. Since the family is so fond of quotes, why not use a quote from Malcolm X, Frederick Douglas, Black Lives Matter, Medgar Evers or use this one from Angela Davis to point out that race affects economic status and is a tool capitalists use for domination: ""Racism, in the first place, is a weapon used by the wealthy to increase the profits they bring in by paying Black workers less for their work."" Then Ben could have pointed out, This has been true of Mexicans and other cultures, look at Cesar Chavez's struggle. And what of the stolen land and the Native Americans. In fact, there are several moments when the family could have honored Native Americans and shown respect. The director and writer didn't go far enough. Not only would these quotes and acknowledgements have been in the spirit of the film, but it would have helped to break down the race barrier the film creates. That, and showing some non-white people in the film would have been great. For example, if Ben's oldest son had fallen for an African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian girl in the film instead of a the whitest girl in the state, race would have come to the forefront and the race/class quotes could have been utilized when people outside Ben's family overreacted to his son's attraction. So utopia and socialism is presented as an only white concern. But don't we have enough of that already in film, pure white views of life? On the plus side, the film shows many views on the consumerism versus collectivism scale, it's not boring or drawn out, and the end works well. Unlike ""Swiss Army Man"", the director didn't run away from the challenging ending. The acting is stellar from the youngest child to Vigo Mortensen and the scene vacuuming Frank Langella as well as Ann Dowd playing grandma. The shots are adequate and the editing works fine. The use of wide shots and close ups, the variety of framing, helps us learn about the characters and the family. For example, as tensions rise between family members as well as Ben and his step father, we see the characters in close up. As the tension wanes, the shots become wider. The music was okay, and I especially like the use of a classic heavy metal song. Only now do I realize how well written it is. What I learned was Vigo Mortensen is good looking with or without a beard, but more importantly, he's a great actor. I had not fully appreciated his talent before. I also learned that the issue of Hollywood so white is much deeper than I had known. If a film addressing progressive themes can be so blatantly white, what hope do we have for racial equality in the media, let alone the nation. The nation is racially segregated; there is no reason to make films that are even MORE segregated than society as a whole. Rating: Matinée. I recommend the film for the acting and themes. It is well paced and doesn't draw out the ending. And the ending works. However, the film for all its introspection only touches the surface of theses issues. Peace, Tex Shelters",Captain Fantastic
138,LiquidPoetry1921,Beautiful story of a father's love!,8,1 April 2017,"Captain Fantastic is the story of a father Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen), his wife Leslie, and their six children who live off the grid in the Pacific Northwest. Completely disillusioned by Capitalism and the American way of life, they have chosen to teach their kids left-wing politics and survivalist skills instead of a traditional education.When Leslie (who is bipolar) commits suicide while hospitalized, Ben and the children are forced to re-enter society to deal with her final wishes ~ her parents want a traditional burial, she wanted to be cremated and flushed down a public toilet!On their journey there, they visit Ben's sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn), a married mom with three boys. Although she is dismissive of the way Ben rears his children, that they are lacking a formal education, Ben is validated when one of his children can recite the Bill of Rights while Harper's son doesn't even know what that is.

141,Mobithailand,"A rare film that will make you laugh, cry, feel good and even think a little.",9,7 January 2017,"Some reviewers love it and a few hate it, but the 'love-its' have it by a country mile.As for this reviewer, well, yes I did enjoy it very much, but maybe the first hour a soupçon more than the second hour – but I'm splitting hairs.Are you tired of formulaic, franchise hi-tech rubbish that the Hollywood factories churn out these days?Do you sometimes wonder if there are any films being made anymore that can make you laugh, make you cry, make you wonder, make you think, and make you leave with a good feeling in your belly?If so, then Captain Fantastic may well be the movie for you.The story is quite simple. An American couple, Ben and Leslie, decide to uproot from so-called civilized America with their six kids and go and live in a cabin located deep in the mountains of Washington State. There's no electricity or water, no TV, no radio, no smartphones (or any phones) and none of the luxuries - and most might say necessities - of modern day living.The children are 'home schooled', are taught to hunt and forage for their food, and they live the life of backwoodsmen. They are obliged to follow a strict and sometimes dangerous fitness regime and are trained to deal with any emergency that may arise.They are all apparently happy with their lives in the wilderness, and their intelligent and well-educated parents imbue them with the precepts of socialism and teach them the evils of capitalism, corporate America, and the outside world.But Mum, (Leslie), has fallen ill. She has a serious mental disorder - paranoid and bipolar – a condition that has possibly been exacerbated by her chosen lifestyle. We don't see Leslie, except in very brief flashbacks, as when the film opens, she has already been shipped to a hospital where her estranged parents can watch over her.Soon after the movie starts, the family learn that Leslie has killed herself and the remainder of the film is devoted to the family's efforts to attend her funeral and what happens in its aftermath.Leslie's father, a very wealthy and influential man, blames Ben for the death of his daughter and warns him that if he tries to attend the funeral, he will have him arrested.At first, Ben accepts that he cannot go, but the six kids want to see their Mom one last time, so in the end, they load up their converted school bus and head back to civilization.The next part of the movie is really a road trip, and there some amusing incidents along the way. One with a cop who stops them for having a faulty tail light, and an embarrassing episode with the eldest son who has his first kiss with a strange girl, and in particular, a planned raid of a supermarket. Here they succeed in stealing hundreds of dollars worth of groceries under the noses of the shop owners.There follows a mix of both amusing and serious confrontations with the in-laws. Leslie's father succeeds in extricating the six kids from Ben's custody for a while, but it all works out pretty well in the end.The first part of the film was totally captivating in every possible way, but once they embark on their journey back to the real world, some of the plot holes were a little hard to stomach. In particular, the robbery of the food mart didn't sit well with this reviewer. Would a father who despised capitalism and wanted his kids to understand the true meaning of right and wrong embark on such a criminal venture?But apart from the moral issues of the robbery, what about the high risks of getting caught? If they were arrested it would be all over for family life in the mountains. Would he really take such a risk?Okay, I appreciate it was all done in a spirit of good humor, and it was genuinely funny – but at the expense of the good-natured and well- meaning citizens who become innocent dupes in their felonious act.One of the most amazing parts of the film was the kids. From the very start, I completely forgot that I was watching a team of child actors. For me, nearly all films containing child actors, no matter how good they are supposed to be, usually make me squirm a little when the 'little dears' say their lines. I am always painfully aware that the kids are actors acting parts.Yet never once throughout the whole movie did I once think to myself, ""Hey! these are just kids acting."" I was truly in their world from the very first frame of film to the last. All six kids were truly outstanding, and I was transported to their world. As indeed was Viggo Mortenson who played Ben, their father, to say nothing of the remaining ensemble cast. Not a dud between the lot of them. I particularly liked Frank Langella as the grieving, angry father.So apart from a couple of plot holes, (which only people like me are mean-spirited enough to take issue with), it is difficult to find fault with this very enjoyable film.The cinematography, screenplay, and direction were masterful and I hope we will see much more from the pen and undoubted directing talents of Matt Ross.We need more writers and directors like Matt Ross to bring us back to a time when filmmaking isn't just another rehash of yet another comic-book hero or a prequel, sequel, spin-off of Star Wars/Star Trek/West world/Frozen/ Finding Doryand God only knows what franchise.",Captain Fantastic

In short, it is aboutbthis family who rejects civilized society, so they decide tomlive in the wilderness where the father indoctrinates his children to worship communist dictators like Pol Pot and Mao Zedong, because America and Western Civilization are bad. They have some income by selling crafts in a local stores, and probably those buters are the same working class Americans they detest.In the movie, the villain is the grandfather. His crime is being rich and Christian (in the movie, the characters show disrepect only to Christianity, not to any other faith). So they prove that being a communist in a Capitalist country is wonderful (I wonder why don't they prefer being communists in a Communist country?).Those kids are so brainwashed, that even when the father tries to show how free thinking they are (like when quoting the Bill of Rights), all they know is parroting the father's bias. There is no space or freedom for dissent in that family.I think this movie exist just to encourage people to be refolutionaries while enjoying all privileges that their parents credit card can provide.

146,dhainline1,This is a Parody of Life off the Grid Of a Family Cult,4,25 August 2017,"""Captain Fantastic"" should be treated like a parody of living life off the grid. I didn't enjoy it and I can't relate to these characters except for their love of books. Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) is the titular Captain Fantastic with three sons and three daughters. The kids range in ages of 6 to 18 years or so. All of these kids have weird names many celebrities would love! Bodevan aka Bo (George MacKay) is the oldest brother. The teenage girl twins are Kielyr (Samantha Isler) and Vespyr (Annalise Basso). The preteen brother is Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton). Charlie Shotwell is little brother Nai and Shree Crooks is the youngest girl named Zaja. The Cash family lives in the woods in a big tent like structure with no electricity and other modern day trappings. When we first meet the Cash clan they are hunting a deer with knives. Ben cuts out an organ from the deer and Bo eats it. Now he is a man, according to his father! The Cash kids have a very regimented life. They do hard exercises, hand-to-hand combat, kill their own game to eat, and have to listen to Ben talk trash about America, doctors, and anything else their old man doesn't agree with! The kids and Ben read communist and socialist writings around the campfire at night. Then it's music time courtesy of Bo and Ben. These family members know many languages, how to navigate by the stars, and they know how to make their own clothes. Little Zaja is an aspiring taxidermist who has a shrine built to honor Pol Pot and other atrocities. Little Nai is a nudist who is told by Ben to put clothes on when the family eats dinner. A tragedy happens in the insular life the family leads. Ben's wife and the mother of the children is bipolar Leslie (Trin Miller) who has been in the hospital for 3 months. She kills herself and Ben receives the news from his sister Harper (Kathryn Hahn) on the phone. Ben also is told by Leslie's father Jack (Frank Langella) not to come to the funeral. Ben says Leslie was a Buddhist and she wouldn't want to be buried in a Christian ceremony because the family makes fun of Christians. Leslie wants cremation and then a celebration of her life. Jack is upset with Ben and hangs up. The children are all upset about their mom and Rellian stabs the wall with a knife. The kids want to attend their mom's funeral and their father relents and takes them to New Mexico on their old bus, Steve. Along the way, the kids get their dad out of a ticket for a missing light by singing religious hymns to the cop. He lets them go. The twins speak Esperanto and refuse to kill a sheep to feed the family. Ben takes them to a restaurant and then leaves with them because in his mind, the menu has no food on it. He fakes a heart attack in the store while the kids take food. Then instead of Christmas, it's Noam Chompsky Day! The kids get knives from Ben. Rellian wants to have Christmas and Ben refuses. Ben doesn't want his family celebrating a magic elf. Everyone in the family swears a blue streak when they aren't reading. They also talk about rape openly when the subject is about the book ""Lolita."". Ben also finds time to walk around nude in front of his kids. In the meantime, Bo gets acceptance letters from Ivy League colleges his mother helped him apply to and he proposes marriage to a girl he just met. All hell breaks loose when Ben finds out the letters because he has no idea what a college can teach a person who can speak 6 languages and all like Bo can! Harper and husband Dave (Steve Zahn) have a different life than Ben with 2 grumpy teen boys who have trouble with the Bill of Rights when Ben asks them about it. Zaja can name all the amendments, though! The funeral is a disaster with Ben taking over and being a sight in his ugly red suit! Jack has him escorted out. The children are thrilled to see their grandparents and Rellian forms a bond with Jack. He wants to live with his grandparents Jack and Abigail (Ann Dowd). The grandparents want custody of their daughter's children. The family goes on a mission to rescue Rellian and Vespyr breaks her leg while trying to break her brother out of Jack and Abigail's house. She is taken to the hospital and put in a cast. What happens is kind of gross and ridiculous! This family steals Leslie's body from her grave and the body looks more like a mannequin than a human being! They take her to the woods and burn her on a funeral pyre. The only thing I liked about the scene was Vespyr singing ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" while the family plays their instruments in time and dance around. They take her ashes to a public place and flush them down the toilet as per her instructions. In the end, Ben doesn't get in trouble for being a menace and Jack gives the family a farm house to live in. The kids attend normal school and Bo goes to Africa. The acting was very good from all involved and I thought they looked like a real family! I hate how isolated and intolerant this family is, though! It won't be pretty when the kids meet Christians or Cambodians who lost their families in the Killing Fields.

This is so unbelievable, that I switched of my brain after 15 minutes. Exaggerated acting, too. And at the end capitalism wins. So nothing new.

It's clear that the director and/or producer has a political agenda in mind, casting the ideology of the family portrayed as good. Versus the dark affluent and ambivalent lifestyle of the grandparents as well, not so good. Sadly, Christian based dramas are attacked, and this one being the opposite of Christian is...not. That being said, the story is very good. Though the lack of punishment at the end for the obvious crime committed, is a little unrealistic.

153,archiecm,Worth watching even with its flaws,7,7 August 2016,"This is not a review per se, but a discussion of certain aspects of the film. As a teacher I was curious to see if Ben had discovered new ways to excite his kids about life and themselves. The jury was still out when Ben takes them into civilization and teaches them to steal food from a supermarket. What great life lesson was gleaned from that act I wonder? It didn't fit into any other principle or idea they were learning. It's OK to take things from others if you need them without paying. I didn't look at the movie the same after that. And then he sends his daughter on a Ninja mission that almost cripples her . . . . one that was bound to fail anyway since her goal of capturing her brother was unrealistic since he didn't want to be captured. After that the kids come to realize how valuable their father is to them and they sneak away with him. OK, I'll buy that. Question: Won't the grandfather come after them? So are they hiding out? Using aliases? ""What the Flick's"" Matt and Alonso praise the movie for not painting either ""side"" as having all the right answers . . . . for being brave. I can see that point of view but I was hoping for one side to be the clear winner. That just didn't happen. Enjoyed the ride anyway.",Captain Fantastic
154,lhunt-9,Not what you could possibly have expected --- prepare yourself to be refreshed!,10,19 March 2017,"Captain Fantastic is certainly a unique and deeply refreshing movie. Throw away the Hollywood formula books. It's not in any of them. It is about choosing to live an examined life – moment by moment, and, more than that, about how one might raise children to join with you in examining their lives as well. Toss in a very rocky landscape of plot devices and near-insurmountable obstacles (symbolized at one point by the sheer rock face that the family climb together as a unit --- great scene, by the way, and one of many). As the story unfolds, the family fall under the microscope while undergoing what for them is the ultimate stress test --- a journey to their mother's parents' home in New Mexico. Join Captain Fantastic and his six children on their quirky and tragic, yet ultimately illuminating and liberating road trip across the consciousness of America (as it were). I think I could not have been anything but endeared to a family who discuss string theory as a home school assignment around the campfire at night and celebrate Noam Chomsky Day as an alternative to Christmas, and as an occasion for the exchange of paleo-lifestyle themed gifts.

157,LordJiggy,"""Father Knows Best"" for the aging Hippie Generation",1,1 January 2017,"If you're in the mood for some hippie porn, this is the movie for you. (Unavoidable spoilers to follow.) Hunky Viggo Mortensen plays another superhero, this time the uber-sensitive dad raising his six kids (ages ranging from about 8 to 18 years old) out in the woods in a blissful natural state. Not only does he home school them into reading the classics (Dostoevsky), books on Quantum physics and string theory (even quizzing them), but they jam on guitars around the campfire. But wait, there's more! Superdad is also so awesome, he's a master of the wild, teaching the kids to camouflage themselves and move so quietly they can take down a full grown deer with just a knife, before they go home to discuss ""Power to the people"" and ""Stick it to the man"" (no exaggeration, a trite term used twice in the movie).There is some alleged drama, when bipolar mom commits suicide and her strait-laced parents don't want Superdad at the funeral. Then there follows that most-beloved Indie-film trope, ""the road trip"" because Hippie Father Knows Best, the desires of other people be damned. Of course, there's no explanation about how he learned to speak six languages, be the forest-master, and know about music and string theory? Nope, no need to explain it, because in Hippie Porn, just being against the Man and the System is enough. No logical story required and you certainly won't find one here.",Captain Fantastic

However, this is a serious movie, and the central themes of learning, growth, and what is important in life resonate throughout the movie. I cannot possibly recommend this for everyone, but for some people the film will really connect. In some ways it also reminded me of ""Into the Wild,"" which is one of my favorite films of all time.

159,jchano123,The most leftist film I've ever seen,5,16 February 2017,"**Watched for the 2017 OscarsHad a lot of problems with this. I really didn't identify with any of the main characters in this, instead they just flat out annoyed me, especially when they referred to Christmas as ""celebrating a magical fictitious elf""-which made me roll my eyes pretty hard. I actually ended up identifying/agreeing with the antagonist the most.This is probably the most leftist movie I've ever seen. A lot of it felt like it was shaming American culture because it's a trendy thing to do and never really gave much of an actual reason for these characters hating society. I think it was trying to say something about society but it never seemed to actually end up making its point. At one point it suggested that 13 year olds don't know what the bill of rights is, which is incredibly false. I learned about the constitution at 11, much like every other American kid. The whole thing felt a bit too long as well and could have been condensed into an hour and a half instead of two.The movie did make me laugh, whether it was intentional or not. The conversation between the older brother and the girl at the trailer park was incredibly contrived and pathetic I couldn't stop laughing.

160,benjaminburt,Excellence Undercut by Ending,8,5 March 2017,"I don't need to repeat what most other people say. The movie is profound, thought-provoking, beautifully shot, and well-acted. What I would comment is that the biting social commentary is somewhat undermined by its ending. SPOILERS AHEAD, the father has a very different world-view than mainstream society, and mocks the institution for brainwashing society into their paradigm of 'right and wrong,' but one of the nuanced ironies of the film is that he himself did that with his kids, and his sons discover this towards the end of the movie. That was such a powerful moment, and when he drives away without his kids, and shaves his face, that would have been such a powerful ending, but the movie decides for a cop-out happy ending, where the kids forgive him, he learns his lesson, and his world-view changes. The unearthing and burning of the mother's body was not triumphant, it was hokey. When the eldest son decides to go to Namibia, he says he just ""put his finger on the map,"" which is fairly ridiculous, considering he obviously has learned about every country and should know that in such a place he could make a difference. Cutting back to the father, seeing that he has found balance in his life totally contradicted his world-view, which was that consumer society is completely rotten and has nothing of value. Now, I may be saying a lot about the ending, but the movie itself is spectacular. Like I said, it has thought-provoking social commentary, and has the power to inspire a generation of new parents to end some of our societal hypocrisy and teach valuable life-skills and lessons to our children. What made this so much more memorable is the fact that it's set against the stark backdrop of Mortensen's character's extremist ideals. The movie was genius, while the ending was disappointing.",Captain Fantastic
161,artmania90,One of the more original films of the year.,9,16 January 2017,"It's hard to keep up with movies throughout the year, but based on the consistent and steady buzz I have heard about CAPTAIN Fantastic ever since it's early summer release, I'm sure glad I finally got around to seeing it. It's a magical experience from beginning to end, full of surprises and wonder.The trailer certainly gives away some of the main plot points that move the story along. Our setup is quirky to say the least: a husband and wife decide to raise their 6 children in the woods away from the constant barrage of modern society and all it's vices. Here, they will be honest, will teach their children everything they are curious about, never say ""no"" and always strive for excellence. We meet the family just as word comes of the wife's death from an apparent suicide. Did I mention the story is equal parts heartwarming and heartbreaking?Ben (Viggo Mortensen) breaks the news to his children. It's a devastating loss of course, but the rift created between Ben and his in-laws forbids him from attending the funeral. Even though his children are fluent in 6 languages and know the Constitution of the United States by heart (including a thorough understanding of the text, no less), Ben's actions are seen as being harmful to his children. There is a threat that they will be taken away should they return to civilization.What works so well with the film is the cast of children. In any other movie, just one of these 6 performances would be hailed as a breakthrough of the year. Each child is unique, whip-smart, learned, and scene-stealers moment after moment. Yes the movie is a vehicle for Viggo Mortensen, but without the tact and skill of these actors around him he would be nothing. That's hard to say especially considering how fine of a performance he gives, maybe his best yet. Mortensen seems tailor-made for this role, expanding on a personality that is both understanding and at times a bit mad. There is a delicate balance between our understanding of this family dynamic and the possibility that he is perhaps committing child abuse after all. I think the last 30 or so minutes of the film demonstrate some of the strongest acting you will likely see all year, and I expect an Oscar nomination to follow.The other lead of the film is the character of Ben's oldest son, Bo (George MacKay). He's a leader like his father, no more than 18, but finds our more about his place in the world throughout the film. The family takes a large school bus named 'Steve' to rendezvous with the funeral, and the journey exposes Bo to the realities that his father have shielded them from. As smart as he is (and having been accepted to every Ivy League school in the country), he has no skills with talking to girls or talking to strangers. We sympathize with him wholeheartedly. Not everything can be found in a book.The screenplay is one of so many twists and turns. Matt Ross, the writer and director, has only made a handful of films and yet the skill on display is surely some of the most natural I have seen all year. It's a beyond clever story of hardened children who work to find a balance between two worlds. Not only did it move me to tears on more than one occasion, I also found myself amazed at how close this film comes to being a total farce. Think of the final scene where the family sings ""Sweet Child O Mine"" around a burning funeral pyre. How absurd it sounds out of context, and yet how marvelous it was to take a journey where that moment can be such a fulfilling climax. You would be hard-pressed to find a more original movie this year that is so overflowing with heart.",Captain Fantastic

Sure, the screenplay takes some questionable turns at some singular moments. But it is damn energetic and absolutely unapologetic!In other words - I loved it! It seems that last year was a really god year for films after all. I am surprised by the variety of movies which surprised me, evoking the whole spectrum of emotions from the inner and outer cosmos. And ""Captain Fantastic"" is the newest addition to this list of special experiences which make our lives richer. The film from Matt Ross is a beautiful nod both to a long gone social movement and to our newly found 21st Century new age way of life. I am really, really impressed by the cast. Wonderful performances from Viggo Mortensen and the whole ensemble of his ""children"" (watch out in the future again for: George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell). This ""family"" invigorates the viewer with fresh voices speaking of freedom, change and at the same time of social and family values which we all tend to forget on a daily basis. Mortensen's character is both arrogant and loving to everybody around him which makes him really a nicely developed controversial person. It is refreshing for every viewer see such qualities together. I myself felt questioning many of the choices which I make as a parent. Which is a wise nod from the director to us all. Close community living and modern life technologies clash in front of the hippie background. The emotional connection is beautifully shot, using the metaphor of travel as the ultimate vessel for overpowering oneself. Any back to nature spirit will find something for itself in this movie. I think that this film is a carefully polished heartfelt jewel giving us a glimpse of what an emotional crisis looks like from a more subtle and graceful point of view. What touches us in this comedic drama is the thought-provoking youth performance which resonates with our every day struggle to find all the right answers to the question: What it really means to be a parent...",Captain Fantastic
165,TigerHeron,Silly Script Ruins Good Idea,6,22 October 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie. It has an interesting premise and raises worthwhile questions. It also has exceptional acting by Viggo Mortensen and Frank Langella. But the many absurdities in the script ruined any credibility the movie could have had. The movie is about a man who is raising his six children on a piece of forest land he and his wife had bought 10 years previously. They have little contact with others and the children spend their days learning survivalist skills and being homeschooled. Their mother is in a psychiatric hospital after her bipolar disorder worsens. Then, a crisis reunites them with family living more typical American lives. The plot is full of inaccuracies and holes. A living will is a legal document and I believe that willfully ignoring it could be considered a crime. When a conflict erupts between the man and his father-in-law, serious questions are raised, but the script magically makes them disappear. There's a major loose thread left hanging at the end of the film. The character of the oldest son made no sense. At times he behaved as if mentally ill, and I think the idea was that he didn't understand normal social relations due to being raised in the woods. However, since the children read novels, they would have had a pretty good idea of how most people act towards each other. Lots of the dialogue was forced and many situations were exaggerated.",Captain Fantastic

It's the same formula as The Royal Tenenbaums or Little Miss Sunshine; We're The Millers or Wanderlust, and can only be described as productions that think they are off-the-wall, cheeky, kookie or funny in some way, when they are actually ordeals that test the endurance of otherwise considerate and intelligent individuals. Inevitably, there are young children actors and actresses unable to shake their San Fernando Valley accents and come across as the spoiled brats they truly are, no matter what role they might be attempting to play; completely lacking in character and obviously irritated when a scene needs to be shot more than twice.

170,ken558,Mainly Hits The Mark - Both as a Compelling Drama of an Unusual Family & a Social Commentary,8,14 July 2016,"As an almost first time director (his second), Matt Ross, did a fantastic job with Captain Fantastic, appropriately nuanced without being cloying, anti-establishment without being absurdist, interesting multi-dimensional characters without caricatures, and different yet being sufficiently mainstream, skillfully steering the difficult edges between realism, satire, and drama. In lesser hands, it could have become another Jason Bateman or Robin Williams type of one-dimensional comedy or pretentious drama - which unfortunately the likes of The Family Fang (acted and directed by Jason Bateman, whom I like as an actor, but doesn't yet have the director's chop) fell into despite its initial promise of being a Wes Anderson type black comedy.Matt Ross is also an accomplished actor - I remember him as the shallow conniving yet cowardly Alby Grant from Big Love some years back. So effective was he in that TV series, that I find it hard to accept that such a low-down 'character' could bring such warmth and empathy towards Captain Fantastic as a director - which could have in lesser directorial hands become affected and pretentiously clever rather than the effective portrayal of an unusual non-mainstream family.The casting is excellent, including the mother who we only see in brief flashbacks or as a dead body - but everything about her face and the way the others interacted and talked about her fits in like hand and glove, providing the believability that is required to carry the movie forward given the unusual premise the family is in. The children and of course the father (Viggo Mortensen) played their roles very realistically without under or over-playing it, which they could easily have done, which would then change the whole tone of the movie to something plain, loud, crass and boringly overly showy and dramatized or 'comedied'.Kudos too to the director's sensitivity in not turning the grandfather into another one- dimensional white selfish righteous rich buffoon. It almost went there, but pulled back just in time.There are of course some inconsistencies (e.g. how did the girls have nicely coiffed tresses, or the kids ever learning things just sitting down and reading 'deep' books, etc) and un-explained fast forwards (e.g. how could all the children hide beneath the bus floor for so many hours, and why the grandparents did not alert the police of their absence, or why digging up a grave by the whole family did not raise any alarm, etc) - but at the end of the day, they mattered somewhat, but not enough to mar the flow, impact and enjoyability of the movie.Go see it!",Captain Fantastic

172,organicsocial,Human Spirit and Modern Education Don't Sit Well Together. The argument is set.,7,22 October 2016,"An Airport is probably the best place where you can see human diversity trying to cope up with the need to conform. Although flying is like just another transport akin to buses and trains, airports maintain a certain air of exclusivity. The passengers are fed through an elaborate web of security checks and protocols usually not found in case of other modes of transport. You may have any ideology or dressing sense but airports demand you to be sophisticated, airports demand you to act in certain way. If you don't then you risk getting stared at, ostracised and even thrown out. You all may have experienced a subtle classist judgement yourself. Well, the reason for me to write all this is because firstly I am writing it at an airport. Secondly, I find this immensely relevant to the characters of Captain Fantastic. Ben played by Viggo Mortensen introduces the modern world to his 6 kids whom he and his 'hippy' wife Leslie literally raised in the wild. Ben rants about corporate America and criticizes it for the subversive and mindless consumerist culture it has given rise to. The kids despite their inexperience with the outside world, are not uneducated albeit socially inept. Ben and Leslie have raised their kids well and they have all the philosophical and ideological lessons they would ever need in life. It may not seem to be too practical but in a way they are more able than most kids of their age. Only issue is that these kids don't have the common pop culture sensibilities and are forced to expose themselves to the world under some unfortunate circumstances.The movie is a treat to watch as we see the oddly named kids and their unnervingly honest father navigate the devious and uncompromising modern civilization. The ensuing road trip has many funny moments worth cherishing. The conversations are enthralling and the bonding between the father and his kids seem to be authentic. It's been reported that the kids in the cast started calling Mortensen as their ""Summer Dad"". There are references to socialism and its many forms but it does self explain the failure of the socialistic ideologies. People are it's weakest link. The Kinks might sing ""we take what we want and give the rest away"" but in reality people are neither that considerate nor generous. The gatherer in us always wants to hoard more so that we don't have to hunt all the time. Processed meat will always be more viable than wild game. The children's socialistic as well as survivalist upbringing do have some benefits. They are strong and idealistic, in touch with the nature and probably capable of experiencing genuine emotions unlike most kids around them. They are definitely more physically and mentally fit. Their honesty however could appear disarming and even disturbing at times. Most people would not know how to respond to that. The movie depicts these things very carefully and beautifully.It is a fantastical plot and the outcome is definitely in the spirit of the story. If you don't think its worth an Oscar nod then I don't know what's good film-making. Well, maybe due to its indie feel it might be skipped by academy juries. There may very well be some flaws to Captain Fantastic. The entire movie rants about how the world has engorged itself on capitalist ideals. Like every survivalist, it fails to see the inevitability of civilization's expansion and the resulting changes. Like all great socialist leaders who were never followed to the book, this movie may fail to drive it's message. Quite fascinatingly there was a recent news article about a girl from India who got through to MIT on full scholarship. She was home-schooled for the entirety of her childhood. You'll find such achievements as evidences agreeing with the ideas in the movie but most people will find it hard to balance between Ben's parenting style and modern schooling. So I recommend you to watch this movie for all its great thoughts but don't mistake it for a ""kids"" movie. It's more targeted to the parents. There is a bit of nudity as well so take your kids on your own discretion.",Captain Fantastic

177,madbeast,Homage to a Cult,2,20 November 2016,"I saw this movie three days ago. I hated it when I was watching it and it has continued plaguing me in the days since.The story revolves around a father who shuns modern society by bringing his family deep into the woods to establish a cult with himself as the leader and his six children as his blind followers. There, the story would have us believe, he raises a team of physical and intellectual supermen who can effortlessly analyze the bill of rights as 8-year olds and are able to speak at least six languages and are enthusiastically accepted by every major university in the country when they are on the cusp of adulthood. They are also fearless survivalists who run marathons on a daily basis and must submit to their coming of age by killing a deer armed with nothing but a knife.The story begins when the father learns that his wife has killed herself and must rescue her body from the clutches of her evil father, who has arranged for her hospitalization for severe depression because the cult's perfect world can't support things like basic medical care since they live in dire poverty. Thus begins a meandering saga whose few interesting moments - such as when the oldest boy shows himself completely unequipped to communicate with girls of his own age or when the younger son displays resentment at the cult's insular lifestyle - are either entirely unresolved or are unrealistically glossed over. A scene (which I imagine was designed to show how cool and self-reliant they are) has the father feigning a heart attack while the children steal food from a grocery store because they are unable to pay for it would be regarded as child abuse in real life. But because we are in the fantasy of the movie, they get away with the scam and when the grandfather (very reasonably) offers it up later in the film as an example of the cult leader's manifest irresponsibility as a parent, I felt like I was supposed to be on the cult's side despite the fact that the objections were absolutely spot-on and justifiable.Unfortunately, just as the movie starts to become engaging and based in reality - when the cult leader is forced to admit how ill-considered his lifestyle is and is on the verge of leaving the children with responsible caregivers - it lapses into maudlin sentimentality when it is revealed that the children (including those who have expressed outright hostility towards the cult) have actually hidden themselves in the father's bus when he leaves to strike out on his own and they make a beeline to the cemetery where the mother's body has been buried to unearth it and hold a hippie ceremony on the beach where they sing folk songs and perform a do-it-yourself cremation. But as the credits role, none of the primary conflicts have been resolved or even addressed in an adult fashion.I am perplexed at the many great reviews this irritating piece of silliness has received because from my perspective, it was a waste of time from start to finish. It was well made with uniformly solid acting, but the underlying story was so lacking in sense or reality and the primary character so self-righteous and unsympathetic that I found nothing good to say about it.",Captain Fantastic

However, whereas LNT's taciturn, melancholy forest dweller is driven by fear and is desperately protecting the remnants of his PTSD-ravaged mind, Captain Fantastic (pink suit and all) extravagantly embraces the forest-dweller lifestyle for himself and his family, as a philosophical choice.In both movies, it is inevitable that growing children will become curious about the modern world from which their father is excluding them. In LNT this leads inexorably to a heartbreaking conclusion. Captain Fantastic seems to be treading the same path until, well, let's just say that the deus ex machina is pure Hollywood!Captain Fantastic is entertaining but, really, see Leave No Trace!",Captain Fantastic

180,Humphreywashere,Fantasy indeed- pathology being exhibited here,1,4 February 2017,"What a disappointment. Depicts disturbed parenting and whilst the movie questions this about midway, it starts to believe it's own rhetoric at the end. Rather shocking portrayal of child abuse and damaged children. The depiction of joyful children and teenage siblings happy to live with each other in a remote location. with no contact with other children is a fantasy indeed, and if it were true, would represent pathological behaviour. This movie is a good candidate for those funny recut movies- you know, the recut that turned Mrs Doubtfire into a horror movie? I don't think it will take someone long to add a horror music score on top of the final ""blissful family"" scene at the end, to portray the truth. Hilarious! Would be good fun to analyse the adolescent psychopathology and the powerlessness of the children as depicted in this movie in lectures. Would also be good for sociologists to discuss how no human society or culture or animals have ever survived like this. Very silly movie.",Captain Fantastic

182,savethecloudsfoundation,Just because you don't agree with society doesn't mean you have to live outside of society,7,14 December 2020,Captain Fantastic is a movie that shows that not everything is binary. Not everything is black or white.The movie opens with typical anti capitalists benefiting directly from capitalism. We know this from 2 main examples. 1. At one point they go to a bank and withdraw money meaning the father has a bank account. 2. Later in the movie the father explains how he ended up living in the woods. We learn he and his family were living on a farm that they sold to purchase land in a forest. So anyone who has ever bought land especially desirable land knows that it is quite expensive. Which means he has money. You could argue that his wife has a rich father and maybe that is how they were able to afford the land. Either way they are still directly benefiting from capitalism all while talking about how evil capitalism is. This is very typical of anti capitalists. The fact is that capitalism allows them to live their lifestyle.And I believe that they learn this in the end as it shows him sending his kids to school. In other words he kind of accepts that in order to function you need to follow at least some of the rules.There is a reason we do the things we do in this society. There is a reason we have organized religion and government education and shopping malls where you can buy anything you could ever want. To completely remove yourself from all of these things is a mistake. But at the same time to blindly follow everyone else is also a mistake. You need to balance your life and make decisions based on what you believe to be true. Because everyone says their way is best but only you can decide what's best for you.,Captain Fantastic
183,Akash_Menon,A Perfect 10!,10,16 June 2020,"Rating: 10I absolutely love this movie. It is so beautifully written. A fun fact the movie received a 10 minute standing ovation at Cannes. I came across this movie as it was listed in the Comedy-Drama genre but the comedic bits in this movie make up only 20 percent of the film. The rest is just heartfelt and emotional. I couldn't help but just bring a teary smile while watching this movie as it is so brilliantly written.The Good - The soundtrack, the cinematography, the storyline and the cast of the movie is fantastic. They each portrayed a different personality while being connected at the same time. I like the concept of the film which heavily relies on raising a child via experiences and not textual knowledge. Although this might be frowned by a lot of parents it's just a different way of raising a kid. I like how the movie portrays the negative of being secluded too, like you are missing out on daily life. The movie is quirky and slips away from the mainstream.The Bad - If I had a bad for this movie I wouldn't rate it 10. The movie is beyond what I expected, I am so glad I came across this movie by luck. I guess that is the only bad. I would want this movie to be promoted to a broader audience.Viggo Mortensen and the rest of the young upcoming stars make this movie a must watch.",Captain Fantastic
184,scandinavianmail,Almost what you expect it to be,6,5 June 2017,"Captain Fantastic is decently executed, and Viggo Mortensen does a fine job in the title role. The plot goes exactly where you thought it would go, offering the conflicts and doubts and laughs and awkward situations that would be expected to arise from its premise. Each scene is slightly spiced up and peppered with more insightful details so that they won't feel utterly predictable.Towards the end the movie falters and gets a bit lost in the poorly grounded feel-good territory that intends to offer something for everyone, especially to those in the audience who don't want the Captain and his team to be reminders about any real alternatives to the life as we know it. The final scene comes across almost as a betrayal of everything that came before it, pulling the carpet under its message and making it easier to forget.",Captain Fantastic
185,Anaslair,Please watch this. Now.,10,26 February 2017,"Well, I have to say this one blew me away.Other than the opening scene where the CGI seemed fake and one scene where what happened was logistically impossible, there isn't much I can point out that was wrong with this movie. I am still unsure whether the kids, apart from Bo who still lived the first years of his life in society, were even registered but maybe I missed that or it just wasn't important to the story.When I first read the blurb for some reason I figured this was a movie featuring wild children who pretty much only knew how to survive and whose parents maybe taught them how to read. Instead, I am presented to a father who does his best to, yes, teach them how to survive in the wild, but also educate them and get them to think for themselves. These children are cunning and some of their conversations left me dumbfounded.The movie evolves with a series of emotionally packed scenes, particularly following their mother's illness and subsequent death. Some events are full of teenage angst and you can definitely see the dynamics changing, with Ben keeping to his beliefs while being open to to something different as long as it is properly argumented.Everyone is just plain brilliant in their performances, both main and supporting actors. Viggo Mortensen is amazing. You can clearly see this father's struggle to come to terms with the fact that what he believed was best for his children may not actually be so.Whoever cast these children – kudos. I was particularly awestruck with the eldest and the two youngest, but in general everyone was so darn expressive. I cannot even conceive how such young children could possibly memorize such lines while maintaining natural facial and body expressions. My chin actually dropped during some scenes.I cannot really say much more without spoiling the movie for you. Captain Fantastic is simply amazing. It is shocking, at times even macabre, enthralling, thought-provoking and beautiful. You really need to watch it as soon as possible, don't let this one slip by!",Captain Fantastic

188,oldvinyl,"""Shameless"" meets ""Huckleberry Finn""",1,15 October 2016,"I forced myself to watch this. It felt as if I was wasting my life and it still feels that way. However, I must admit, this movie did raise some real emotions in me: emotions of disgust and anger. I was raised by my parents to not steal or lie. I grew up understanding that these two things are what make us societal outcasts. If we lie to others then they come to understand that they cannot rely on what we say and therefore that our opinion is of no value. If we steal from others we not only demonstrate our contempt for them but we also damage their psychological well-being. One opinion says that the antihero is showing his resourcefulness by training his family to survive in the wilderness; indeed, this aspect can't be criticised, nor can his apparent success in homeschooling his kids. Yet even there, how can it be argued that homeschooling, without resources such as labs and computers, can adequately prepare kids for a high tech future? It was when the film moved into its second half that things really began to grate on me. An adult who encourages and trains his kids in theft is so far beyond what I regard as a civilised human being that I had a strong desire to cease watching, combined with anger and disgust. Overall: slow, tedious, smug, highly irritating",Captain Fantastic
189,lazyaceuk,A film with heart,8,9 December 2019,"I have often been told that a critic's view is the critic's view, make up your own mind. This can be difficult when films are limited on distribution and you rely on the word of one who is paid and has the opportunity to attend these films.Captain Fantastic was for me one of those films. Thankfully, the reviewer was one I trust and I am grateful for his guiding hand.For many - including my wife - Viggo Mortensen will always be Aragorn. Therefore watching a film which involves him being a hipster father of six kids, of broad age range, extolling a wilderness lifestyle can be a challenge. The film itself does not start easily. The reason for the family's isolation is not immediately explained nor is Viggo's fixation on readying his kids, through 'training' for a Marine type existence. Their father's home tutoring is also dictated to by their father and although free to think their educational base very much appears to be centred towards the left politically.All of this changes when there is a family death which once it happened seems to surprise nobody other than Viggo. And once he does come to terms with it finds reasons which at odds with the majority.The death leads to a road trip as the wilderness family head to the funeral. The kids become exposed to things that had previously been contained in books or completely hidden from their sight; love, capitalism, greed and most amusingly, family, but in a form that seems at odds with their own close knit nature.As the pot gets mixed and Viggo's grip on the family dynamic begins to loosen previously hidden truths come to the surface and even his own hidden guilt reveals itself as his realisation that what didn't appear broken was actually invisibly cracked in quite a bad way.If there is a message in the film it is that there are many paths that can be chosen in life, and if that path is shared by all whom you love that path does not always have to be the commonest of paths.Well worth a watch if you want to experience something not of the norm.",Captain Fantastic

191,christian-larson,Captain Fantastic was fantastic,8,11 December 2016,"Captain Fantastic stars Viggo Mortensen and its the story of this family in which they live in the wilderness. But when they are interrupted by a bad situation and they are forced into going out to the world, a problem ensues. This movie floured me, I loved Captain Fantastic. Viggo Mortensen as a father of a big family was excellent in the role, he really did gave a heartfelt performance that improved me, in which I think its Oscar-worthy. His character is very subdued, he has a very troubled past with his wife, so this serves us as a way to care about this character, he can relate to him. The family had a lot of great chemistry throughout the film, the kids really did surprised me, their performance was so great, that I forgot that they were just little kids acting, but they pulled it off. The direction is outstanding, I have never seen a film like this. It is so original and unique that its really rare to see a film like this nowadays. The style the movie has is so great since the family is drastically different from any other movie family, there are a lot of great lines of dialogue the family members say in the film that its hard to think of another movie family that has said something similar. The cinematography is breathtaking, all of the actors are on their A game, there is no actor who is doing a lousy job. This film reminded me of the greatness of screen writing, that there isn't a big villain in the film, the plot is easy to follow and very simple, the characters are memorable and it is consistently entertaining. There are some issues with the film. There are some audio inconsistencies and in the 2d act the film slowed down a lot and the main theme of the film is lost, but other than that, I had a great time with Captain Fantastic and it is one of the best films of the year. 9/10",Captain Fantastic

193,marsanobill,Into the Woods and Off the Grid,8,17 July 2016,"Ixnay on the title, which makes it this sound like the tale of some hippy-dippy nonsense. Actually it's the tale—a fairytale--about a rigorous, home-schooling, off-the-grid family: two gorgeous parents and a passel of gorgeous kids, all of them whip-smart and wonderfully fit (one attains manhood by killing a deer single-handed with a knife); all can skin and cook game and harvest edible plants; and none knows anything of the 'outside' until the sudden death of the mother forces them out of their home deep in Oregon's forests and into the strip-mall-supermarket-superhighway world of the southwest, where manifold conflicts arise. Yes, it's a fairytale, but remarkable in several ways. There's little caricature and no smarminess or gooey sentimentality, and even the 'villains' are decent people who have some right on their side, not to mention a wider view of parenting. There are leaps of faith (how do people who live primitive lives with no modern conveniences managed to look so clean and coiffed ALL the time, except when they apply mud camouflage as an aid to assassinating deer?), but you just have to accept them (even the utterly incredible ending).

That's where the good idea ends and all the bad ideas in the script begin. The story centers around the suicide of Ben's wife (the kids' mother) It tap dances around and insinuates but never makes any connection between her suicide and the family lifestyle. A weird letter written by the deceased doesn't give many clues. Instead of focusing on the differences between living on the grid and off the grid, this focuses on the loss of a woman who we never see alive. The male children seem to take issue with the lifestyle more than the female. The script delves into very bad taste. From inappropriate behavior at a wake, to theft (not just of food) and a truly disgusting act I don't think any civilized person could perform on someone they hate much less a wife and mother they claim to love. Watching the portrayal of a home-schooled 8 year old expose the pathetic state of public school was mildly amusing. The writer should have run with that. This movie is tasteless.",Captain Fantastic

196,Dccra1,A pseudo intellectual Marxist fairy-tale,3,3 February 2019,"Captain Fantastic is nothing more than hypocritical pretentious closed-minded absolutist drivel primarily designed to demean Christians, and anyone else who doesn't buy into their Utopian Marxist/individualist mindset.The movie spends a lot of time mocking ""Christian fairy-tales"" while actually being a concocted fable about how a schophantly devoted Noam Chomsky hippie and his mentally ill wife somehow managing to raise a super race of physically fit brainiac children who speak multiple languages without the hindrances of evil ""capitalistic"" technology or any help from the outside world. Talk about suspension of disbelief!There are many things that perturbed me about this film, but the dad's practice of brutal honesty (from his perspective), even when it came down to his wife's suicide or a child asking about sex/rape, was quickly exposed as contradictional hooey when he fakes a heart attack in grocery store while his brood of super rugrats exponentially lied with him in order to rob the place. One could say, that in his world view, lies are only bad from within the cult, but near the end of the movie, he tells his oldest son not to lie to anyone. So... Maybe it's a Mao thing?I almost sympathized with the part about ""rescuing mom"" from a burial against her wishes... but told my wife while we were watching it, ""If they flush her ashes down the toilet I'm gonna kick the TV in."" Needless to say, they flushed her down the toilet! With all of these amazing intellects, no one thought to say, ""Hey, is it wrong to flush mom where fat Christians pee and poop?"" Nope. One super brat said, ""Bye mom,"" as she swirled away.In the end, I gave this over-hyped tripe a 4 for good acting and cinematography... Oh wait! I almost forget.

201,slofstra,An introduction to Captain Fantastic,9,12 September 2016,"In this short review, I won't summarize the content of the movie. If you're unfamiliar with the content, please watch a preview or read some of the fine reviews that provide a precis of the plot and characters.It's perhaps easier to say what the movie is not, than what it is. The movie is not trying to convince you that a left-leaning, off the grid, back-to-nature lifestyle is necessarily ideal or even desirable as a child rearing strategy. Some points are made in favour of such a lifestyle, and some against, but I don't believe that this movie has an agenda. So don't worry that Ben drives a gas guzzler, or that he takes his kids on a shop-lifting excursion.The movie is a study of a family that is trying to do something better than what is conventional; that's not going to drift with the tide. As an older parent, and now, a grandparent, I identified strongly with the basic idea of giving your kids more than what school, society and the previous generation offered. What parent doesn't. Most of us aren't as driven or idealistic as Ben Cash, the father played convincingly by Viggo Mortensen. But like many parents, we have in common with him, to do ""X"" when church, school, business associates, and especially, our own parents, seem to be doing ""Y"". In parenting our own children, we didn't live in the woods, live off the grid, or go rock climbing. We did camp a lot, and read some of the classics of literature seen in the movie. My political views have a little in common with Ben Cash, but like most viewers, I'm much more acquiescent than Ben Cash. But here were our touch-points with the movie, and this is true for all or most parents: we face resistance, and we make mistakes. In this movie all the cares and caveats of parenting children in the face of a corrosive background culture are raised to another level from what we experienced, and probably from your experience. The dynamics and tensions presented by Cash's moral and cultural framework within culture at large are an object lesson in social psychology, not to mention, fascinating and compelling drama, and a rip-roaring good tale. If you are reading this review and you're not a parent, then my perspective may well be different from yours. But parent or not, we all have ideas on child-rearing and how it is best done, and what's wrong and what's right with our country and how life is generally lived. Yes, the movie touches on all of that, or aspires to do so. Here's a chance to consider and think about what is done, what can be done, and what you're doing now.Again, this is not a heavy message movie, but a deeply thought provoking one. If there is a message, it is only this, from Noam Chomsky, as spoken by Rellian. (Rellian is at the very centre of the movie, I believe.) ""If you assume that there is no hope, you guarantee that there will be no hope. If you assume that there is an instinct for freedom, that there are opportunities to change things, then there is a possibility that you can contribute to making a better world."" And that's really what the movie is about.Other notes: great script, every line and scene counts. Super, superb acting performances, the characters jump off the screen. My only caveat is that I was so worried about the outcome of the movie I couldn't laugh as much as I wanted at the funny stuff. I'll have to see this one again. Without spoiling anything for you, if you go, know that things work out okay, and just roll with it.9 out of 10, which is my maximum on first viewing.",Captain Fantastic
202,summerloud,"way too over the top to be a drama, not funny enough to be a comedy",5,8 June 2017,"Ben is a single dad, living with his 6 kids in the forest. If they are not busy rock climbing, learning a 7th foreign language, discussing mMrxism, or making presentations to each other about quantum theory, they are working out, killing deer with their bare hands, or generally doing everything necessary to self-sustain on their own in the woods.Do they ever sleep? Does anyone see a problem with realism here? I don't really know what this movie wants of me. It is far too unrealistic to take it seriously, yet not funny enough to make me laugh more than once or twice. The whole ""super-scientist- survivalist-left-wing-hippie-fantastic-dad"" is just cramming too many things into one character, most of which don't even make that much sense. Apart from a shallow pseudo-conflict between Fantastic Dad and one of his sons, there is no conflict whatsoever in this family, and no flaws or downsides to any characters to make them resemble actually believable real-life human beings.What makes this movie watchable is the great acting, the good music, and the two or three geunuinely funny scenes.

203,Fiurilli,Solid across the board,7,3 November 2016,"With 'Captain Fantastic' writer/director Matt Ross tells the tale of what one might consider a dysfunctional family. Viggo Mortensen stars as Ben Cash a father of six children, together they live in their own paradise in a forest somewhere in North America. For the most part the Cash family has to fend for themselves, they gather their own food, built their own tools and the children are all homeschooled. When they hear the news that their mother has committed suicide they are forced to return from their paradise. What follows is a journey in which the lifestyle of the Cash family is put to the test. Matt Ross has done a terrific job at bringing this family alive. The story is very well centered around the family and more so the manner in which their upbringing has influenced their lives. The family itself is presented in a very eccentric fashion however it is never pushed to an extreme that would make one stop suspending their disbelief. For the most part the story progressed in a very natural fashion aside from just a few moments where certain events or character progression felt extremely forced. The minor plot holes are also few and far in between and for the most part Matt Ross's storytelling is very solid. That does not mean it is without flaw though. For instance the movie is filled to the brim with examples of what effect this abnormal lifestyle had. While a few of these examples were important there are simply so many of them that it takes away from the main storyline. This combined with some unnecessary slow moments led to a few minor pacing issues. Furthermore when the movie reaches its logical endpoint it just did not feel as satisfying as it could and should have been. The journey itself was still fun to experience and in the end presented some great food for thought about how one should go about raising their children. The lifestyle of the Cash family was not only well presented in the writing side of things, but also in the way it was brought to the screen. When a scene featured an environment well known to the family it was always presented in a different way in comparison to environments where the contrary holds true. This contrast was ever present throughout the film however the effects were only minor and in my opinion underutilized. What was very well implemented was the pacing of most shots as they were carefully framed to represent the family's slower way of living. On top of that all were some beautiful environmental shots and all of this paired with a well fitting soundtrack led to a movie that was both visually and audibly quite appealing.Viggo Mortensen fits his character like a glove and his performance as Ben Cash was very convincing. For the most part the same holds for the rest of the cast, they all seemed to be having a lot of fun which helped cement the feeling that they were all one big happy family. The only child actor this does not apply to is Nicholas Hamilton who stars as the middle child. His performance felt a bit off and unconvincing while his character plays an important role in the main story. Furthermore the movies script has the children often talk about big concepts however the child actors never gave off the impression that they themselves understood what they were talking about.

205,altugozhan,Close but not able touch heart,7,2 December 2016,"First of all I am impressed by the acting quality of Viggo Mortensen once again. But this time he is not all alone by himself. Everyone in the cast was brilliant even the youngest ones.I was excited about this movie since I saw the trailer 6 or 7 months before the title was published. A family life in the wild is interesting but also much more challenging than many people would imagine. I always wondered what it would be like if I had to try. Seeing Mortensen in the cast and the trailer increased my expectations for this movie.Unfortunately it didn't reach to my expectations. The movie is good undoubtedly but it was far away from being great. You always feel something is missing from the start. You just see the family life after mother passed away so you have no idea what it was before and how it changed dramatically. You just know it changed. Viggo is somehow shown as a madman. If they had shown us some brief moments with their mother the base for the movie would be more solid. The quarrels with the children would be more understandable and would make a better story.Pros:Acting is greatVisualsCons : Story (I expected a better one) Exaggerations ( the proposal scene and the questions at the dinner table doesn't fit to those brilliant kids and some more)I recommend that you watch Captain Fantastic. You will like it.For a more successful version of a father&children relations I would recommend ""The Descendants (2011) with George Clooney.",Captain Fantastic
206,pux420,Eye Opening,10,21 February 2017,The first family movie ever that tells the truth with blunt force.Viggo plays the first honest father in the history of time. He is not afraid to swear or sugar coat the truth for any of his children in a way that i wish my parents would have. my parents did teach my anything and i was still essentially blind until my later 20's until i realized everyone on earth is a moron who's full of crap.I also love this movie because hes raised his family reminding them that the world is unfair and people are scum. as specially Christian's.use this movie to raise your children.,Captain Fantastic
207,mtbgtown,Progressive Leftwing Hollywood Utopia Story,7,27 July 2016,"Should we dispense with analyzing performances? I was impressed, as you were, by all the child-actors, including Viggo, who is always good with whatever script he's handed. It's not that hard, is it? You stand there and recite lines painstakingly written over 10-year period, in some cases, and play them off like they were your character's immediate reactions.Maybe that's what I should focus on, the writing. What is the story? It is a Progressive's wet dream. A masturbatory turn at experimental utopia in the beautiful American wilderness, where all the best of America is at once enjoyed and cursed. Noam Chomsky is ""god"" and his ""bible"" quoted frequently by a man who has created an enmeshed existence in a lush PNW forest. But if they need it, a giant coach-like bus named Steve is always dieseled up and ready to drive the family around so they can criticize free market capitalism. In this Progressive Utopia, all Progressive theories about child rearing, religion, government and life, are auto-proved true through the magic of film making. Profanity, discussion of sex, the painful truth about everything, and nudity, are general among the children of varying ages. Never mind that the same Left crucified The Duggars when their son molested his sisters in a similar enmeshed situation. Progressive Utopian siblings coexist nudely without issue, because humans are animals, and all the rote. Conveniently, Man's desire for spiritual connection outside of himself is tossed aside. Everything works perfectly in Progressive Utopia. That is, until outsiders introduce Christianity.Where other films show the truth of such experiments, that Man's efforts to create a world unto his own ego will implode; that his offspring will depart from his ways which he never successfully passes on; that it ""takes a village"" to socialize children; this film disagrees. Yes, the man's world did collapse, but only with the help of Christians who blindly follow superstition and send children to mind-dulling public school, the two magically combined, though traditionally Christian families prefer home or private school.Progressive Utopia doesn't work anymore than Christian Utopia, which I gladly concede, and neither one needs help failing as long as they have human ego, pride, and a measure of dysfunction.",Captain Fantastic

210,BNester,Hippies Encounter Outside World,7,12 July 2016,"Ben and his large brood are living the hippie dream: they have totally withdrawn from the consumer ratrace, and are living on their own in the mountains of Western USA, sleeping in a teepee, hunting and gathering their own organic food. The children are homeschooled to a very high level, can chat in many languages, and are as fit as athletes. There is no TV, nor TV dinner here.But there is trouble in paradise: it's driven the mother crazy. We never see her: she is away in a mental hospital. Ben explains that post-partum depression has led to bipolar disorder, owing to low serotonin levels. It's a mark of the children's education that they can all understand this.The idyll comes to clash with American civilization when a family funeral forces the kids to encounter 'normal' America. They are fascinated and horrified, and the dream begins to give way....This is a very interesting film which raises lots of questions. But it has flaws. Winters in the Montana mountains are long and harsh. What do they eat? We see them hunting, but not farming, so where do they get crops to preserve?The eldest has been accepted by all the top US universities. They would be fighting with each other to give him scholarships. So Ben would have no need to seek help with tuition.Ben's training regime reminds me of the Trapp Family at the beginning of'The Sound of Music'. But no Maria comes to teach these kids the 'Do-Re-Mi' song.The photography is good, but the shots are held overlong, which seems to be a universal flaw in modern films.

211,bachi_2805,Someday you'll get it (to low critics),9,4 July 2019,"I believe no one else could have played the lead, Viggo Mortensen is incredible in this film. Kathryn Hahn is an amazing actress (even if she mostly does comedies) and overall acting is on another level (including secondary characters). Sometimes, the actors save the movie. In this case, I think they shine pushed by the hand of a smart director.What low critics don't get is that the movie is like a picture. A picture of something unique.
Any work of art should try to show something new to the world (otherwise why do it?).
Is it a unique story? I think so.
Also, imagine there's a picture of Hitler, you shouldn't judge the photographer or the quality of the shot simply by who or what the model is. A picture of a knife is not an apology of stabbing.
I bring this on the table because I think Ben, aka Captain Fantastic (a wink to the endless Captain America amount of movies) is also being heavily criticized in the script itself, in fact, if it ain't were for the colors used, you'd say it's an apology of 'follow the law word by word until you die'.I liked it because it is true to life. To those who disliked it, I say 'Someday you'll get it. Until then, keep shooting monsters on your TV set.'",Captain Fantastic
212,jen-lynx,How far is too far when raising children? A wonderful perspective on alternative child raising.,9,23 August 2016,"Captain Fantastic was fantastic (sorry, had to be said). It was no the movie I intended to see today, but on a whim, I decided it was the movie I should see today. So glad I did. The film really resonated with me as a parent, an intellectual, and a Socialist!Viggo Mortensen played the father, Ben Cash, of six children, whose mother had recently take absent for reasons which are disclosed later in the film. He and his wife decided to raise their family in the Pacific Northwest mountains of Washington, completely forgoing all conveniences and entirely off the grid. Far from being ignorant hippies, the entire family, is extremely well versed in a wide variety of subjects and skills from philosophy and quantum physics, to language and music, to first aid and hunting. What they lack is socialization in the world that most of us inhabit, which they discover quite abruptly when they find themselves immersed in it unexpectedly. True to form, dad tries to make it into a learning experience, but it is he who does the learning in the end.""Captain Fantastic"" might have gotten bogged down in overbearing preachiness, but thanks to its frank dialogue and charming wit, it remained a pleasure to watch; eliciting both hearty laughs and heartfelt tears in equal measure. Not all of the details are particularly plausible, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, it is a film that will leave you with more than a little to ponder.

216,hond-92064,A failed movie that could have been,4,18 October 2016,"If this script had gone through three more reworkings, it may well have been a great movie. But it did not. The basic foundation of the movie is exciting (some spoiling coming) - the Swiss Family Robinson in the USA of today. A family that lives - by choice - outside of the modern US society and then for reasons that has to do with the rest of the story, is forced to venture back into that society after a long enough time in the romantic wild to become ""noble savages"". So an anthropological journey into the strangeness and flaws of the modern US (or part of it) society is set up. And set up well enough to make one look forward to the rest of the movie. Forgiving the quaint idea that nature is peaceful and good. It is this looking forward that makes one forgive the unbelievable premise of the story - a family living in the wild like it is a suburb, kids that get an education that most people only dream of by sitting in the wild reading books. (At the end of the movie one returns to this and gets a bit irritated for having allowed oneself to be taken on this ride - according to the makers of the movie all a family of two parents and four kids needs to construct an idyllic house in pure nature, is a saw and and an ax. They must go try it sometime. And killing a deer by sneaking up to it and jumping on its back and cutting the throat all in one easy movement? ) This journey has some moments of complete associating with the family and it does offer an insight or two but it soon crumbles in sentiment and ends bewilderingly... One was led into this tale by the supreme outsider family.... who strangely ends up the epitome of all they started to ""show up"". Give it a miss.

The issues it did deal with it did so superficially and with little new. The option of homeschooling was an obvious theme which was largely ignored (although if it gives rise to pretentious prats I'd avoid it). Issues of how to live a moral life in an immoral society was also available and ignored.The landscapes were beautiful. The acting was satisfactory. However, the cast were all stereotypes and caricatures and none had any depth.The story was implausible with enough holes to make it look as if an ice- pick had been at it. Where did they get money, how did the father train in quantum physics and the arts, how can all the children of various ages do the same physical feats, how did they mesh their carnivorous fun with Bhuddism, how did they deal with sexual awakening, where did all the shop bought clothes come from, the list is endless ? ? ?

220,CallEmLikeISeeEm,A Fantastic Lesson on Compromise,10,16 August 2016,"This is one of those 'wow' films I see once every blue moon. I walked into this film with no idea of the plot, and it was money well spent. The story centres around a married couple who decide to have, raise and school their children in the wilderness far from the consumerist Culture of modern times. When the mother (who was very ill and seeking help in her parents' hometown) commits suicide, this drives the husband and children out of their comfort zone and into modern America to attend her funeral, and to make sure her dying wishes were fulfilled to the letter.The children find themselves often out of place and slightly alien in this new environment, despite being incredibly knowledgeable and critical thinkers. This movie is extremely touching. What amazed me is the number of issues they managed to work into this beautiful story line, including how to raise your kids, honesty to children, children leaving the nest, compromise, achieving a balance between your own belief system and the real world, interpersonal vs logical intelligence, and coping with grief. Despite the emotional tsunami, the movie is light and funny at times, and it achieves that delicate balance so that it doesn't veer into either dismal depressive drama or callous careless comedy. There isn't one single actor in this movie who did not do their job to absolute perfection. Viggo Mortensen should get an Oscar for his role as Ben, and I think this will probably be one of his most remembered roles alongside Aragorn. The dialogue is down-to-earth yet excellent with some very memorable scenes. The soundtrack is very carefully chosen with some very fitting numbers and a surprisingly good folk cover of a heavy rock classic. I won't tell you which. This definitely ranks as one of my best cinema outings. A big chapeau to the makers, cast and crew behind this gem.",Captain Fantastic

Every single solitary moment was as good as or better than the next. So many emotions. The lifestyle the kids led took me back to my childhood. Viggo was every bit my father excluding the physical aspect of how he raised the kids. The juxtaposition of his children to the typical kid (especially American kid) was on full display once they arrived at the relatives (?) house. The scene where he asked his 8 year old about the Bill of Rights was magnificent. Oh, about 30 minutes in, the precocious kid on the bus that kept asking all the questions...was my friends daughter through and through and the ease in which he responded to the (inappropriate in the eyes of most) was pretty much my friend, explaining everything. I'm not even finished watching the movie, I have about 45 minutes to go (they just left the funeral) but I had to stop and write this. I've laughed, I've smiled uncontrollably and I've had to dry my juicy eyeballs and all three seemingly happens every 15 or so minutes during the film.I have to finish up now...I Love this movie.

222,jasha89,Society? Good or bad?,9,19 November 2016,"Let me start off by saying that I love this movie. I love the idea, I love the actors, I love the story. We are following a father that raises his six children completely outside of society, in a forest, while his wife struggles with mental illness while hospitalized in the city. The family is forced to start a journey and reconnect with society while facing challenges that have not been present in the past. This movie poses ever so present question - Is society good or bad for you and your children? While home schooled, those charming kids learn several languages, they listen to classical music and celebrate Noam Chomsky Day. Children ranging from 5 to 18 years can discuss with you any relevant philosophical question, and outsmart you in process. Their physical abilities are way above average as well. But does that come with a cost? They are separated from society, so their social skills are not natural. They don't know how to interact with people on a regular basis. Not everything in life consists of philosophical discussions, some things in life consist of just having small talk. Is it too big of a price to pay? I love how we are not spoon fed the answers to these questions. Instead, we are left to decide for ourselves if we feel that one way, or the other is right? or maybe neither? maybe the answer is in balancing between the two worlds and just making sure that you help your kids differentiate between what's good and what's bad in our modern day lifestyle.

223,moritzmeyerautor,"A satirical, Utopian mind experiment about how to raise kids in our consumerist world",8,6 January 2017,"Captain Fantastic is a great and thought provoking movie, especially for parents of today (a group I happen to be a part of). From their first day, kids of today are effected by mass media and consumerist behaviour in a way, we couldn't have imagined only 20 years back. Overprotective parents keep children away from making their own experiences and interacting with nature and their environment. Strangely enough, most parents romanticize their own childhood, when ""we just played outside for hours with nobody looking after us"". So wouldn't it be great to withdraw from the capitalistic society, the industrial food and the self-destructing 24/7-worklife? Can we not just return to a naturalistic, rural way of life in line with the nature around us, in which we just aim for knowledge and self-fulfillment? Well, can we?Captain Fantastic seeks for answers to these questions. It does so by conducting a mind-experiment. What, if a family just did that? Return to the wilderness, live in the woods with and from the things, nature has to offer, while teaching your kids everything about humanism, literature and philosophy. And how would that work out, if they are forced to return into ""the real world"" with all its shopping-malls, video games and fast food? Of course, this clash of cultures makes for some very funny and comedic moments, giving this movie a very satirical edge. When Viggo Mortensen's character, the hippie-father Ben, visits his sister and her family with his six children, he basically sits for dinner with all of us, showing us the mirror image of our very own family life. Very often, the movie stretches the credibility of it's own convictions. We only see them living in the woods during summer, for example and I wondered, how their life would be during a harsh winter. But I don't think, we as viewers should make the reality- check here. It is a Utopian world, the family lives in, that is supposed to contrast the ""modern world"". I will say one thing, though: I have no doubt, that kids are absolutely capable of the things, we see them doing in this movie, like hunting and dissecting wild animals properly, dealing responsible with knives and open fire, understanding complex political and philosophical concepts at a very young age and so on. That is probably the most important message of this movie: Our kids are all smart. What they make of their abilities, just depends on the environment, we create around them. So, there is an important discussion going on in this movie. Thankfully, this is supported by some great acting, especially from Viggo Mortensen and Frank Langella. But also the child actors do a very good job. This movie has a 12-certificate in most countries, most likely for a scene, in which we see Viggo Mortensen in all his glory, and some very open talks about ""sexual intercourse"". But in the spirit of the movie, I would say, that it is absolutely fine to see this with younger viewers, too. I'm pretty sure, it will make for some interesting family discussions at diner table :)",Captain Fantastic

The fact that this is discussed/argued very openly (often more dictated to Viggo Mortensen's main protagonist, Ben, by disgruntled family members et al.) on-screen provides a fantastic – excuse the pun – philosophical debate around the issues of raising children; and perhaps more importantly, how we live our lives. But Captain Fantastic is by no means ham-fisted in its approach; rather opting to present moments of genuine conflict with its central argument, as opposed to bludgeoning the audience to death with stern finger wagging (it is hard not to grin though when 'home-schooled', nearly-8-year-old Zaja relentlessly tortures her aunt – played by Katherine Hahn – on her stance on public schooling; through first reciting, then providing detailed analysis of the Bill of Rights).

225,sugarmack,A brilliant exploration of American libertarianism,10,22 September 2016,"It's hard for me to review a movie that was so clearly made for me! Captain Fantastic explores the parallel libertarianisms of the USA, from the liberal, atomised strip malls and tax avoiding conglomerates, to the communitarians who, in this case, must abandon society for it having abandoned too many within it. Brilliantly, it does this by exploring a father's love for his wife and children. By exploring the family, both immediate and extended, the film manages to avoid dealing exclusively in stereotypes. For me, the filmic aspects were all top notch. The cinematography was sublime and underscored the film's themes subtly, but powerfully. The performances were absolutely brilliant, from the youngest child, to Viggo Mortensen's touching role as Ben. The direction and editing were seamless. The music and sound design sparkled.

But when the slap of reality was finally felt but good, Ben woke up to the realization that life on planet Earth, in America, moving forward at the clip it is, would have left his loving children - despite the knowledge and history he taught them - far behind.This is a tale of multiple redemptions and awakenings for a father and his children. And not to be lost in it is also a stark reminder of the myriad egregious shortcomings and ignorances of typical America. Ie most kids do NOT know what exactly the Bill Of Rights is, let alone be able to quote a single phrase within it. How many could fill in the names of most states on a US map? Yet Ben's kids knew M Theory...It's a presentation of great lack on both sides. Ben's kids, despite their survival prowess and exemplary knowledge, are hopelessly non-worldly in the world beyond the forest they know, and their cousins, typical American kids, know all the fashions and memes of the day but little actual knowledge, and would last not nearly a ""fortnite"" in Mother Nature on their own.Reconciliation, redemption, resignation to the inevitable; all lessons learned in a world where true health of any kind - mental and emotional as well - is not possible without compromise.

I believe it was inferred that they essentially went back to home school with the exception of Bodevan. I suppose this is a believable ending but the problem is is that so much of the movie was pointing us toward change, change and more change. And then for it to go back to the same old, it was sort of disappointing for me. Take the rebellious son who got injured on the cliff. There were some pretty big dramatic moments where things should have lead into some kind of separation and character growth. But unfortunately it was never explored fully. I admire the Dad's effort and determination to raise his kids in a different way. They all had brilliant minds. However they needed social skills which public school or college would provide. When I look back at my youth I think of the great friends I had. And the fun times we had. If all I had was my family...that would be a shame. I love my family but we need more than that. Bodevan was probably my favorite character and personally if they made a sequel just about him I would see it for sure. The scene at the campground with him and the girl was hysterical. The dialogue and their acting was superb. That moment that he lies about knowing the show Star Trek was funny but also very telling as well. For a second he was putting aside how he had been raised and realized that this is real life. I was kind of upset they just abruptly ended their interaction.

240,kraljevic411,Different perspective of living,10,1 February 2017,"This is a story of an exceptional father Ben that has an alternative approach in parenting and living. He is persuaded to do that job by himself because he suddenly loses his wife and remains with his six children.What really amazed me was that a man can do such a good job as a parent. It is delightful seeing such obedience, respect, trust and love between a father and children. Even though the conditions in which the kids are growing up are, let's just say, alternative, it is unavoidable to notice such a wonderful harmony.I agree this topic can cause controversies. Law is conservative and sensitive when it comes to parenting because the first assumption is a downgrading result of children's perspectives and it is quite difficult to prove the opposite. We disapprove choices the individuals make while raising children, instantly presuming that those choices are wrong and doing damage to them. The truth is that those children grow up stronger and smarter than most of their peers nowadays.The main question opens up: Did we do ourselves a disservice when we developed high technology and exposed it to children, making it the only source of fun? Has the commercialization strongly pressured our lives that we don't even know what's essential? Is a human evolution in general going backwards? The fact is the kids are miserable going to school and see it as a painful obligation, not as an opportunity to broaden their potential young minds. It is definitely something the world needs to work on.Anyway, the movie deserved a 10/10 from me and certainly made my top 10 of all time movies, maybe even top 5. I would also like Viggo gaining an Oscar award since he definitely deserves it for an extraordinary acting he has presented.",Captain Fantastic
241,TheDome81,"Not a superhero movie, just a super movie!",10,11 August 2021,"Based on its title, you'd think this was a movie from the Marvel Comic universe you'd never heard of. It's far from it. Viggo Mortensen plays a middle-age hippie who's raising his family off the grid. Somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. He's training them survival techniques while giving them a home education that's light years ahead of anything they'd get in a conventional school system. When he learns that his institutionalized wife has committed suicide, he has to decide whether to attend her funeral in New Mexico or not. After he's warned by his father-in-law, (Frank Langella), that he's not welcome, he opts to make the trek. This film is much more than a fun road trip adventure. It's about relationships, redemption, being true to one's self, and much more. As an aging hippie myself, I could totally relate to the lead character. And I enjoyed it so much, when it ended, I was tempted to start it over again. As a bonus, much of the soundtrack featured music from one of my favorite groups, Sigur Ros. My only beef is with the title. But after ruminating on it for a while I decided, what else could it be called?!",Captain Fantastic
242,Veteransson,"Funny, with some great social commentary and an even better Viggo Mortensen",9,7 January 2017,"Sundance has offered us a lot in 2016. Manchester By the Sea gets a lot of Oscar buzz, Sing Street was simply terrific, and now Captain Fantastic hits it home with an extremely original, funny, beautiful drama, written and directed by Matt Ross. Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, the father of a big family with a disparate lifestyle. They live in a forest, hunt their own food, learn survival skills, are incredibly and surprisingly well educated, they are completely self-relient, independent from society. When one of Ben's daughters complains about being hungry, he hilariously replies with 'Then you should've shot the f*cking sheep!'. The mother of the family is sick and is staying at a hospital, which makes the task of Ben to keep the family together and strong more challenging than he might be able to handle.Viggo Mortensen continues to commit himself to great projects and is brilliant in the movie. His oldest son Bo is played by George MacKay and he delivers as well. Bo looks up to his dad and throughout the movie this leads to some enjoying scenes between the two of them. The family counts six kids and unfortunately, not all six of them were able to keep their head above water. Also, sometimes Matt Ross went a bit too far in showing how alternative these children are. We got it the first couple of times one of the children said something no kid would ever say, no need to rub It in. At times this made some of the children look robotic. The family bond however is depicted perfectly by both the actors and Matt Ross, leading to some funny and heartfelt moments. The movie touches on some of the Western values, which leads to some interesting views. Actually, I can't use the word 'interesting' according to the alternative family, so I'll expand more on this. The family lives in an extreme, far away from society. Extremes are never the right option, but they do offer some new perspective on values and norms that we have come to see as self-evident. Views on Christmas, money, education and brainless entertainment are some of these themes the movie touches upon. Ben's children are stronger and have a greater general knowledge compared to children raised in or by the society, so there are some arguments for his way of education. 'Captain Fantastic' works as a movie foremost because it doesn't try to make Ben's ways of doing things seem superior to the traditional ways. The children benefit in some aspects but also clearly suffer from this alternative education and lifestyle. This is shown in several scenes throughout the movie, when one kid hurts himself or another is freezing in the pouring rain. When the children's grandfather (a great Frank Langella) clearly shows his disapproval of Ben's methods, these particular scenes prevent him from being viewed as the villain. You can completely understand where the man is coming from.Another great aspect of the movie, which provides a lot of comedic relief, is the contrast between the family and the real world. Some of them have clearly never been far into this world. This leads to some shocking reactions about the countless number of fat people, a deliciously awkward dinner scene, a short, but very awkward romance and even criminal behavior. The entire second act is one big road trip, providing us with all these funny sequences. The soundtrack is great and somehow you want to be part of this family, but on the other hand not. Apart from one cheesy scene that didn't work but luckily didn't ruin the ending, the third act delivered the same enjoyment as the second act. But only in a more heartfelt way.Captain Fantastic is a well-made, good looking movie with some great performances. The balance between the funny and emotional moments is perfect, making it a light movie, easy and fun to watch.",Captain Fantastic
243,vanwilgen,Finding truth through juxtaposition.,10,12 March 2021,"To me this movie is about mental health. The protagonist (in Stanislavski terms) is not able to cope with her disease and does something that sets off a series of events culminating in a scene that involves a stainless steel toilet on an airport. The entire story, especially where her parents are involved, is a palimpsest of the truth. The truth is that mental illness is a serious medical disease that needs to be treated as such. The kids growing up in nature on one side and the suburban family and then later on the Lord and Father on the other side represent the two sides of her illness, The adventurous dad, the Mosquito Coast references, understandable, but it's what we don't see that makes this movie important.",Captain Fantastic
244,lindarctica,"don't be offended, and it becomes a masterpice!",9,12 May 2018,"Made an account just for this one because it needs to be said that all the negative reviews this thing is getting is highly unjustified in my humble opinion. This movie gets a lot of hate, and i kinda see why, but i think the haters are whining. Yes, this movie can be offensive, it's the purpose of it and it does a damn good job at it! It portrayes two very different sides of life with all it's pro's and cons from BOTH SIDES. The movie doesn't pick a side at any time and overall, this is a very good display on the old right/wrong subject, because there IS NO right or wrong! Viggo Mortensens acting is always spot-on, and this is no exception. He always portrays a character so incredibly well, and the role of confused but caring father suits him like a charm. All the kids do a great job too, especially considering the age of the youngest few. I have to add; i've been a Christan for most of my life but i'm open minded to any healthy critisism. I hear people say this movie has too many attacks at Christianity, but what i see is good, critical viewpoint from all perspectives on the subject. Again, there is no bashing or overpraising either side, just a grounded view, and i have never seen a movie do it like Captain Fantastic! Really a fantastic movie that makes you use your brain!

That would be my only criticism of this film. I saw this in a cineplex during it's theatrical release, and liked it enough to grab the DVD when I saw it the local public library to share it with my wife and grown or nearly grown (22 & 17) kids. They all loved it. The central question in my mind after watching is actually posed by Viggo Mortenson in the ""extras"": Is the main character insane or insanely great? He certainly lives life by his own rules, which is awesome, but of course when you're a parent, especially a (n effectively) single parent, that has consequences. He is true to his beliefs in ways I think many of can only aspire to, and he pays the price (as do his kids).This is one of those films that gets better after a 2nd viewing, and I'd happily give it another screening.",Captain Fantastic

There is no false move or tone throughout it, it never keels over to the weepy side or gives out blows below the belt.

The pretentious moronic philosophical diatripe is so pathetic I can't believe that anyone would write such junk.

256,beginasyouare,Au Natural Whimsical Eccentric,1,3 February 2019,"Are there any spoilers in this review? It's impossible to spoil something that sets the standard for everything tainted. Captain Fantastic is an American freak show, it's so far left it might drag you into outer space. Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic), the father of a large family living off-the-grid, would agree that only calling it ""interesting"" would fall short. I call it honeycomb tripe, stomach lining that pretends to be food. Better to let 'Captain Fantastic' just be a 1975 Elton John album title.You don't have to be Christian to dislike how the film unnecessarily and unconvincingly complains about how bad Christianity is, because it only creates inconsistencies in the movie. For example, how is the singling out and negation of all of Chrisendom, compatible with the syncretistic (fusion) thinking of the Eastern Religions, which the family in the film embraces, along with Native American religions?Next, the movie's intended theme of individualism and off-the-grid living as a preference over free enterprise, a Jefferson vs Hamilton scenario with a nod to Jefferson, is out of sync with the philosophies that the movie presents as what the father (Ben) uses to base his childrens' indoctrinations on, namely Plato, the Bill of Rights and others.Good points were mentioned at times regarding the presence of excessive modern American corporate controls, prevalence of shopping addiction in our culture, video game addiction, the physical obesity of the well off, placing value in home schooling and natural foods, and even showing sympathy for unaware sheep by the end of the movie, though the presentation is often excessively talkative, coming off like a speech or pictoral homily in a religion of a man's own making instead of an authenticly filmed story, it's just rhetoric.Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic) the father of the family, practices nature worshipping as taught from American Indians, the son eats a heart of an animal kill as a rite of passage and decorates with things that look like Indian amulets. Individually, his family members were allowed to pick any religion for themself except Christianity. They are taught the 60s 'stick it to the man' mind set which is not necessarily bad depending on how or in what situations it is carried out. Asian or Eastern religions and thought are also favored along with American Indian. They oppose Western preachers but are preachy themselves. Ben thinks the Bill of Rights gives him the Right to plan a family trip around stealing food from farmers and grocery stores when he is an obviously capable person under no immediate handicap. His demeanor is presented cool on the outside, calm and collected, and has an answer for everyone and everything, while living in contrast to American norms.
The described behavior of Ben's suicidal wife and seeing several of his freakish children behave, suggest he does not really have the answers he'd like you to think he has. The father was hoping his wife's being close to nature, living like Indians, would cure her mental illness, but it did not. So there seems to be some admission, late in the film, that their 'dreamcatcher' plans had holes in it. The living daughters were depicted to be of very stable mood, the opposite of their dead mom whom we never meet. One of them, the youngest girl, maybe 1st or 2nd grade age, is straightforward, unrealistically smart and quick minded beyond her years, beyond anyone's years, and she's polite but with odd ideation, she made a Pol Pot shrine in a tree fort which is less of a surprise considering dad teaches with duplicity, that is to hate haters. She also liked to either wear a gas mask or a hat of an entire animal skin that includes its skull on top her head. Stronger yet are the frighteningly weird males. Ben's eldest son acts very naive and quirky when meeting a female his age and later told his dad he had raised freak kids. Later the same son travels to Africa on a whim. A younger son also seems unstable, he's rage prone and with constantly shifting loyalties. The father's kids don't always like Ben but in the end they don't betray him either. In general, all of the kids seem to know they are on stage, they do not appear natural, they come off rehearsed, and given the back-to-aboriginal theme, that is ironic.By the end of the movie, after some successes and failures when interacting with greater society during the trip for the mother's funeral, Ben has perhaps tempered his enthusiasm for his lifestyle, giving somber long looks in the mirror while shaving his grizzly beard, perhaps thinking of compromises, and probably having dread feelings of assimilation. As the movie progresses, beginning to end, the family home landscape switches a few times, moving from mobile rustic Teepee living toward a slightly more permanent rural American homesteading look with cheerful blue exterior house paint. The bus that was used to go to the funeral is transformed into a chicken coop. Maybe by the end the father is more even minded in our eyes but we do not get any living examples of this change. The family is still isolated in a rural house, that's all you are left with. I can't help but also think how that picture of life at the end, at least on the surface, reminds me of the self imposed isolation from the world of the monestaries and convents of Christians, groups that Ben supposedly abhors. Perhaps if his life was lived more like that kind of religious life, his wife would have lived longer. No similar admission, is ever made by the movie. The film expects you to think that Ben is an innocent and all of his troubles, all of his inconsistencies, are the fault of the wider society. At an earlier point in the movie, to prove this further, they disgrace a corpse by flushing its ashes down a toilet in a ritualized ceremony. Another time Ben shocks an elderly couple in public by standing nude while ridiculing them for their narrow mindedness. This lower than school bathroom humor is all this film offers to explain itself.",Captain Fantastic

264,streamofstars,"A highly enriching, offbeat and heartwarming film",8,8 September 2016,"Captain Fantastic opens with the beauty of the wilderness, a deer peacefully wandering through the forest. That quiet is quickly interrupted by what appears to be a group of savages. It is not of course, but a man and his children camouflaged and hidden, warrior like, as the oldest son springs out and kills the deer. The father then tells his son he is now a man for killing the deer. I can't say I enjoyed those first few minutes of the film, and thankfully the rest is not so harsh a reality as this, or is it? I grappled with many different emotions and feelings during the film, thinking about the choices and decisions that are made. You can't help but wonder what you yourself would do as each character deals with uncertainty and change.The father of the six children, Ben (Viggo Mortensen), is raising them alone in an off-grid home in the wild, while his wife is hospitalized with a mental illness. They read and study philosophy, science and literature, learn to fend for themselves and possess a level of physical fitness that would put most to shame. And although they may be leading a rich life and learning some much needed survival skills, at what cost? When tragedy hits, they take to the road in a bus called Steve, where adventure ensues and they all learn a few hard truths about life.It's clear Ben's often extreme approach to living is having an effect on two of the children in particular. One of the boys displays a simmering anger for his father, which becomes more evident as time goes on. And the oldest son has acceptance letters to various colleges which he has kept hidden from his father. Among these moments of hardship though are many moments of warmth, compassion and humour. They are a real family who genuinely love and care for one another.Many would say that Ben is teaching his children what he thinks is best for them, in the environment they live in. But one could also question his political and philosophical teachings, and how much do the children know of 'life' in the real world. The film examines not only unconventional parenting decisions, but family dysfunction and social dynamics. The children are learning things most should learn at some point in their lives, as often in school we are taught many things that we will never need to know ever again. What is acceptable and what isn't when teaching children and young adults? Whose to say what is right and wrong, or 'normal' when bringing up children? What is 'normal' anyway? The acting, I have to say, is fantastic! Viggo Mortensen once again displaying great range, bringing to life the tough, yet charismatic father. All the young actors who played the children – George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks, and Charlie Shotwell are absolutely wonderful. They exhibit such depth and honesty. Frank Langella, Katheryn Hahn and Steve Zahn are terrific as family members struggling to understand Ben's upbringing of the children.Beautifully directed by actor Matt Ross, the film is visually gorgeous, highlighting the wilds of America with other numerous places on their road trip. The soundtrack a perfect mix of different music genres. Captain Fantastic is real, raw and at times unforgiving, and what impressed me maybe most was the juxtaposition seen throughout, especially noted when the family that appeared so beastly in the opening minutes, are later seen that night sitting around the fire all reading in silence.While there were one or two moments that felt a bit too 'utopian', I appreciated the film more and more as it went on, and was greatly uplifted by the end. It's a highly enriching and enjoyable film with charm and plenty of heart. I laughed and cried, and it will leave you with much to think about. It's one of those rare gems that make you want to just sit and stare and take in what you've just seen.",Captain Fantastic

Whatever else happens the dream wins - there is only one way to live and be content and that is to grovel before the adman's spiel and totally resign to their whims.
The entire plot is based upon the emotional freak out of a family within the 1% financially and culturally and has no connection whatever with the vast bulk of humanity . None of what happens could or would occur in any normal family - largely because they wouldn't have the hard cash to indulge in such flippant nonsense, but primarily because all of the consequences of this family's actions in this film would hang far more heavily and permanently upon a middle/working class group.
The froth continues in a lame and frankly offensive view of mental illness and a frivolous take on cultural differences . For anyone with a fully functional frontal cortex the morality play is so simplistic as to be risible - right and wrong are literally thrown down the toilet.
This might have been a truly moving and authentic piece had it been set in normality rather than in extreme privilege .",Captain Fantastic

Beautiful movie nevertheless. And it's actually the encounter of both reflections that make a link to the life of 'Into the Wild', of a single family ('Captain Fantastic') or of a single individual ('Into the Wild'). And both experiences will bring most viewers to the same conclusion: such a change would be more touching, could it be societal.",Captain Fantastic
268,MuckyMuckMan73,Equally heartwarming & heartbreaking,10,5 November 2019,"Right from the Lord Of The Flies-esque opening scene I was instantly hooked by this emotionally compelling film about a family's loss and societal integration or lack of it. Matt Ross' Captain Fantastic tells the story of the Cash family who have lived out in the middle of forest and mountains, living off the land for 10 years. When Ben's wife is taken mentally ill he has to raise his six children by himself. After hearing his wife has committed suicide he gathers his children and sets off on the road to the funeral against the wishes of his dead wife's parents.
Captain Fantastic is a heartwarming yet heartbreaking film in equal measure. Ross decides to inject humour throughout to lessen the blow with the heavy subject matter and it really works. I laughed out loud on many occasions but my eyes welled up on a couple of moving occasions too. There are many standout scenes but my favourite had to be when Ben and his kids break out into spontaneous song with their musical instruments around the camp fire. It was such an uplifting scene of togetherness it brought happy tears to my eyes. But this isn't really a comedy. Ross brings us serious social commentary on mental health, consumerism, religion, societal integration and the inadequate schooling system which are all effectively brought to the fore to create a thought provoking experience.
Stëphane Fontaine's cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, especially when in the wilderness. It made me want to go out there and join them, for a week at least.
Performances are all outstanding, the kids especially, but Viggo Mortensen knocks his turn out of the park yet again. Every emotion conveyed in those sad deep set eyes. He's fast inserting himself into my top 10 favourite actors list.
With a stirring and at time haunting filmscore by Alex Somers, Captain Fantastic is quite possibly the best film I've seen this year.",Captain Fantastic

270,d-carlyle,Thoughtful intelligent character piece.,9,21 October 2016,"I enjoy the fact that though I feel the makers of this film have a predilection to fall towards one side of the argument this film makes as to whether the way the protagonist raises his children is right or wrong, it makes cogent arguments that each case has its good and bad points. Personally I can see the attraction of the simple life they lead, but can also see how it would make them completely unprepared for the real world they would face, if say something happened to the father. They are incredibly well educated, but as the eldest son states to his father during an argument, he understands nothing he hasn't learned in a book. I also like the way the film explores both the lifestyles of the family and that of those they encounter on their road trip to their mothers funeral, pointing out the incompatibilities and incongruities of each without making a case that one is better than the other, well maybe something of a case for one but while pointing out its drawbacks. Its a character piece of a film full of excellent performances with Viggo Mortenson excellent as the idealistic father who may have the best wishes of his children in mind in his actions but could be seen either as the hero or the villain of the piece depending on how you look at the lifestyle he want to raise his children in. He is ably supported by a series of excellent performances by the children. I am particularly drawn to the qualities of George MacKay who is developing quite the varied portfolio of performances ranging from this to a musical in the form of Sunshine on Leith, with all sorts of dramas and romantic leads in between. He could do worse than follow the lead of Viggo who is forging his own mercurial path only engaging in properties for which he truly cares.",Captain Fantastic
271,ericsavage,For intellectuals with a soul,8,19 September 2019,"First up, remember this is an art film and it suspends a lot of reality to explore ideas in a way you can't normally. The moment you see a family of kids scaling a rock face together in the rain, you either laugh and get on with it, or you become quite irritated, and for the latter, the movie might not work.What I loved was how I found myself both supporting and criticising the father's reasoning and intentions the whole way - managing that kind of love-hate with the audience is film mastery.Ignoring the political commentary, this is a story of family and parenting, and in a world lost in individualism, there's something very appealing about rediscovering that social connection again, and this story is a taste of something we could have again.",Captain Fantastic
272,please_stand_by,Great Potential Soured by Strange Decisions,6,9 June 2017,"This film left me a bit perplexed. The premise of six wilderness dwelling, society-shunning children and their unusually strict, blunt, and academically-inclined father being forced to confront modern society is genuinely very compelling. Viggo Mortensen's performance as the father is great (dare I say 'Fantastic'?), and the family's chemistry feels energetic and natural, albeit highly unusual. The film's cinematography and general aesthetic is also quite striking. The film's writing, however, is truly baffling at times. Most of this stems from the family's interactions with the modern world once they leave their home in the wilderness.Before I get into that, though, I really want to stress that Captain Fantastic is, on most levels, a fine film. Despite my reservations about many of the choices that were made, I'd still probably be inclined to recommend it to most people who are interested in exploring the dynamics and problems of a strangely unique family if they can tolerate the occasional dose of insufferable hypocrisy or arrogance. I honestly went into the film expecting to like it a lot, so I take no delight in picking it apart to explain what I believe is wrong with it, but I think it is worth doing. Also keep in mind that because this is probably going to be a love/hate movie for many people, these things I list might not bother you at all. That being said, let's get into some of the strange choices with the writing, of which there are many.We as the audience naturally expect the family to behave in an unusual manner given their rather extreme lifestyle, but what we don't expect is the rather distasteful undercurrent of arrogance and contempt for other people that seems to consistently guide their behavior. They are not merely fish out of water innocently bumbling through their interactions. Instead, they are constantly reassuring themselves of the inferiority and hopeless degeneracy of those around them, while reinforcing in their minds their own superiority.The family's inwardness allows them to justify various narcissistic antisocial behaviors. This includes the family stealing large quantities of merchandise from a store using a deceptive scheme, insulting and/or mocking nearly everyone they encounter including members of their own extended family (even when treated with hospitality), the father instructing his children to perform dangerous activities resulting in injuries, and openly despising Christians (but no other religions or beliefs). The family also has rather extreme communist leanings, even going as far as to identify favorably with despicable totalitarian communist dictators (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.). The oldest son goes as far as to seriously refer to himself as ""not a Trotskyist anymore, but a Maoist"", which is just an embarrassingly asinine thing to say.There are numerous other bizarre behaviors, such as the young children's fetishization of knives and other weaponry, clinically utilitarian honesty about sex, drugs, violence, death, rape, and suicide with young children, not only allowing and justifying young children drinking alcohol, but pouring them glasses of wine under the assumption they will drink it even if they didn't ask for it (with an ironically absent diatribe about the real dangers of alcohol particularly for children, despite going into morbidly and tediously explicit academic detail about almost every other subject imaginable), and who could forget the family's inexplicable worship of Noam Chomsky. I can't quite figure out if these are inserts by the writer/director that in some way reflect his own viewpoints, or if he is attempting to poke fun at people who think and behave this way. Either way, it doesn't come across as funny or satirical despite the film being labeled a ""comedy"". But it sure is obnoxious.Why do these details matter? Because this mixture of unpleasant traits make them come across as not just weird, but delusional, antisocial, arrogant, hypocritical, mean-spirited, and even dangerous. These traits can absolutely work in the right story, but they don't work well in a narrative about a father raising his impressionable young children. It's not a good sign when it's easy to see how if the father wanted his children to kill someone, it wouldn't take him long to convince them how, when, where, and why to do it with some lengthy pseudo-intellectual lecture about the evils of capitalism, his kids then rushing off with their knives to do the deed, all while smiling and singing. To put it simply, the family dynamic is that of a cult. Yet the film never ceases to treat the cult's leader (and chief brainwasher of children) as completely sympathetic.But all of this could be forgiven if the right ending properly redeemed these character traits. Could the children ever live within society, or would they forever be outcasts? Is there some disastrous consequence of the way they have chosen to live? Instead, the father is more or less bailed out of his problematic situation by a relative, despite being extremely disrespectful towards this person constantly. This is essentially a deus ex machina moment that makes no sense and provides no satisfying resolution. After the father has his realization that maybe his kids need to be prepared to deal with the real world, he leaves on his own, only to have his entire brood of kids inexplicably emerge from a compartment in their bus hours later to console him at the exact moment he needed it, another deus ex machina moment. The film then ends with, again, no resolution to the characters' actual underlying problems integrating into society.It really is unfortunate that such a great premise is burdened with so many elements that are obnoxious, hypocritical, or just don't go anywhere. The family of characters, especially the father, are just grating enough to frequently be annoying or alienating to the general audience member. I really feel that if the aggressively smug and cult-like family dynamic was toned down and the ending was better executed, this would be a genuinely great film. But the devil is in the details.",Captain Fantastic
273,laufeyson-64475,Why are Indie Films SO GOOD?!,10,17 October 2016,"OK, I know the answer. The scripts and the ideas are original and unique. There is usually no studio to force some guidelines upon directors. Therefore, they can mostly remain self-contained in their creative decisions.First of all, you have to respect Viggo Mortensen, not only because he's a terrific actor(artist), but due to his down-to-earthness. He said in an interview for this movie that he doesn't care, whether a movie will be a big-budget one or not, or that he will get a huge salary. He says that he has to like the script and think of the story and the character he's going to play as unique and interesting. Oh sorry, like his character in the movie says, we shouldn't just say ""interesting"" when describing sth., but be more precise :)) I think he deserves to be nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in this movie. He played the smart-crazy-lovable hippie-father so well! Everyone in this movie does a great job, the child actors are so sweet and clever.What the movie is mostly about is that there can be many different perceptions of people about life and religion within one society, but we have to respect each other and show love. In order to be successful and sophisticated, one has to be interested and open-minded to learn new things. Just going to school and university doesn't guarantee cleverness. Most students forget what they've learned within weeks after the exam. It's important to retain the knowledge.",Captain Fantastic
274,mikefox-04778,Enthralling and honest,9,6 May 2017,"Intelligent and funny, full of colour and emotion, this gripping movie does a great job of taking on the downsides of our more civilised life: detachment from nature, eroding of family bonds, focus on amassing wealth rather than experience and knowledge, lacking ethics. And then when you're lulled into believing going back to the roots is the answer, makes you understand it's all not that easy and one-sided. An impressive cast and story keeps you enthralled for the full two hours. It's interesting to read the negative reviews, which all focus on one thing basically: the perceived slight against our way of living. What they mostly seem to miss completely is the honesty with which the problems and short-comings of Ben's mindset are brought up. Most notably when he runs out of words to defend his actions (like teaching his kids to steal from a supermarket, or running the risk of climbing a rock face in uncertain weather) to his father-in-law, when he has to admit the life in the woods did not help his late wife, when his son rightfully accuses him of not preparing him enough (making him a freak) for social encounters, when he has to apologise for not respecting the rules of people within their own house. And when the movie finishes on a compromise.The bad reviews also mention (not without merit) the many extraordinary and too little explained talents Ben has. But it would take extraordinary people to attempt and successfully create this utopia, so just imagine he's the one that had the tenacity and qualifications to succeed where others have failed.

This movie would have been great if the family had stayed in the woods and talked about nature.Instead you quickly find that they're all sociopaths (with at least one true psychopath) they all hate capitalism while they clearly enjoy the benefits of it like most of the latte sipping lefties. Clearly this guy has set up his own little cult of followers that (had they been Christian) would have triggered mass anger from the left to the dangers of Fundamentalism.3 stars for the beautiful nature scenes, 0 stars for everything else.EDIT:By the way. Subsistence living is HARD, and doing so without large arable farmland is even harder. There is no way that this small family could not only hunt and gather enough food to survive (to say nothing of vitamin deficiencies) and ALSO become experts in philosophy, biology, quantum mechanics, mountaineering, economic and political theory, and music. They would be spending the vast majority of their day simply gathering enough food to survive. This is especially true since the Pacific Northwest is most certainly not the breadbasket of the American continent.One final note: Ever notice how the ""tolerant and enlightened"" leftists ONLY insult Christians?

281,sinisterene,Bernie Bro's LARPing as socialist New Men®,1,5 March 2017,"I found the story odd because these type of people in real life actually don't have a special education or any deep connection with the environment but instead are overpriced soy Latte sipping urbanites whose education is, at best, a liberal arts degree that set them tens of thousands of dollars in debt, whose diet chronically suffers from B complex deficiency, can't stand natural light, especially light coming from the sun, whose idea of discipline is engaging in vices on a regular schedule, and wouldn't be able to bench half their own weight if their lives depended on it, much less push themselves off the floor.The previous paragraph isn't meant to criticize people whose lives are like that since that's their own choice, but to criticize this movie's script, which managed to require a suspension of disbelief greater than movies that feature magical mitochondria that grant psychic powers.Since I tagged this review as containing spoilers I can warn readers that there's a scene with gratuitous Viggo Mortensen phallus. Its only purpose was an attempt at self-serving humor but we know in real life he would (hopefully) be charged with public indecency and probably put on some sex offender registry (unless he claimed some special victim status).",Captain Fantastic
282,adrijdin,This movie is Self Aware,9,28 February 2017,"This review was spawned in part as a reaction to the review on Roger Ebert's website - a ridiculous butchering which criticized this movie based on the fact that she didn't like the main character and can't seem to accept such a thing as a non-one-dimensional character. I see that other reviewers have a similar problem grasping the idea that a flawed man can have redeeming qualities and that modern life presents conundrums which cannot neatly be resolved within the time span of an hour and a half.Captain Fantastic is not the most masterful of its kind (it lacks the depth, writing, and laughs of, say, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Sideways"", films in a similar vein, IMO) but is still well worth watching. Viggo Mortenson is superb in this role, the kids are all uniquely awesome, it bumbles along nicely and it's food for thought throughout. The ending made me cry - family performance of ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" will truly go down in time for me; extraordinarily touching - from the children singing about their mother as being a ""sweet child"", to the moment the song turns upbeat (showing the absurdity of forced sadness at funerals) to the way in which her ashes were disposed - wonderful.On to my main point: I would argue that one of the major themes RUNNING THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE is that the dad, Ben, is a VERY flawed man, who does things that are very obviously wrong, to the point where his obtuse nature may or may not have been the deciding factor in his wife's suicide (!!!) yet he is not exactly a bad guy, either. The difficulty of assessing his integrity and whether or not he's ""good"" or ""bad"" is essentially why this movie exists.Can you kind of sort of get that?!Examples: when Rellian apologizes to his father for rebelling against him and vilifying him, to which Ben says, ""I love you"" instead of ""i'm sorry,"" Sheila, my parents never apologized for any of the things they did to me, and 95% of the time that I said sorry to them when I was a child, I had not really done anything wrong. Should my parents have said sorry for all the things they've done? YES. Was it within their emotional capacity? No. That is part of life. People can't be more or less than who they are. The film is not trying to say that Rellian was wrong for rebelling, or that Ben was right in that (or any) instance. I don't know how someone who saw it so naively is writing professional movie reviews. There's no question: Ben is a dictator, and he absolutely imposes his controversial views and values (not to mention lifestyle) on his children - just like countless other dads throughout history - we understand Rellian, but there are still very good reasons for the children to stay loyal to their dad and to each other regardless. Instead of clicking your tongue, why not contemplate the complexities of the parent-child relationship, the age old quandary of how sometimes the worst parents churn out the best kids, so maybe parents might as well just be who they really authentically are and trust that their children will turn out OK.The other significant scene is when the little Zaja is able to explain to his quite-a-bit-older cousins, being raised in a ""normal"" household, the finer details concerning the Bill of Rights, which they know nothing about (though Ben's kids are similarly clueless when it comes to matters of pop culture). This occurs during a family dinner where the clash between the lifestyle and values of the two families has become very apparent. Viewers saw this as smug; yes, I recognize how this would be a knee-jerk reaction. However, I think the scene was well-done, and one was actually more inclined to sympathize with Ben's sister Harper, who is duly embarrassed but in no way made to look like some kind of fool. We all know that that the average American teens aren't able to explain stuff like that, even though they ""should"" - yes, it's excessive that Zaja is as informed on political matters as she is, but it's as much of a salute to how much more you can teach kids when you take them out of the toxic public school environment and give them the one on one learning each kid deserves as it is a blatant display of Ben's aggressive focus on politics. Does a 6 year old kid need to be able to give such a detailed report about the Bill of Rights? No. Should Dave and Harper's teen sons have known a bit more about the Bill of Rights? Yes. I don't believe the film takes sides in that scene - it was meant to provoke thought.Finally, regarding Leslie's dad, Grandpa Jack who regards Ben as a toxic hippie who is basically responsible for his daughter's suicide and should have his kids taken away from him: yes, we all understand his stodgy viewpoint, and admittedly that the fact that he tried to disallow Ben and the gang from attending Leslie's funeral had us rooting for the underdogs. But Jack wasn't portrayed as a fool. He was shown the respect he deserved, and acted/thought the way millions of dads naturally would given the circumstances. I wouldn't blame him, and Ben doesn't, really - actually, he shows evidence of partially agreeing with him, of considering his criticisms and taking them to heart (especially during his final goodbye to Leslie). However, Ben is within his rights not to grant Jack all of his wishes, either.Naive people who can't see beyond ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" need to go back to fairy tales or at the very least, blockbusters, and leave honest critical appreciation of real movies to people who can see beyond black and white.",Captain Fantastic
283,mr-ddesouza,"""Power to the people! Stick it to the man!""",10,8 August 2016,"Is it worth the price of a movie ticket? Yes!I felt that this film was captivating in all aspects of story-telling. Especially in it's acting where all characters in the film did a superb job with special mention to Viggo Mortensen (Ben - Father) and George Mackay (Bo - Eldest Son). This film depicts the difficulty of parenting at the highest level as Ben has to raise his 6 children in the wilderness alone in the way he thinks will be best for them. Bo shows the rational side of this story as he accepts who he is, how he was raised, and who he wants to become in the future. We clearly see the struggle of a young man who will take care of his siblings yet long for a life he has never known. This was my first time seeing George MacKay on the big screen with a big part and he certainly did not disappoint. His performance along with Viggo Mortensen was the perfect balance for the film.The realness and rawness of this film aligns perfectly with Ben's choice in parenting and survival instincts in the wilderness. We are easily immersed into the idea that civilization and it's systems of government are toxic and that we as a people who take part in it are living the wrong life. A film that can manipulate at such a high degree is a great example of a film with a genius plot.The cinematography was beautiful as to be expected. Our setting for most of the film is in the Pacific Northwest and it was a pleasure to see that they didn't saturate the screen with wide aerial shots of the forest and mountains throughout the film. Instead they focused more on the home within the mountains. Details highlighting living spaces indoors and outdoors was a beautiful contrast to the another setting later in the film. Kielyr ""This house is a vulgar display of wealth"" Vespy ""and an unethical use of space!"". I believe the cinematographer & director chose not to concentrate on details of the luxurious house as they did with the home in the forest. Mostly shot on wides to display its enormity and that was all that was needed.The soundtrack I felt fit perfectly with the film. Times of quiet were also used very well here. The editing was seamless and kept the story moving perfectly.I take my hat off to Matt Ross for a genius script that focuses on ideas of socialism, the complexities of human relationships, and coming of age story.

We see a Marxist father of six kids age 8-18. He venerates Noam Chomsky and together with his Buddhist wife has led the family to live in a forest and kill animals for food - a typically Buddhist activity! He is drilling his kids to be something like Antifa Special Forces. This regime and the homeschooling without electricity has produced magical results: at least three of the children are geniuses; the 16-17 year old has mastered theoretical physics at graduate school level (the difficult mathematics behind it is not even worth mentioning), and so on. Really, this film is as anti-intellectual as it can be. (It is no exception in this regard to many US movies; I always laugh when, on screen, I see »Math professors« scribbling meaningless formulas, as if taken from American comic books.) The 8 year old daughter of the family has built a shrine to Pol Pot; after all he killed millions of Christians and Buddhists, and the family despises Christians.

It was readily apparent that the way they were living, the philosophies they spoke of (Buddhism mentioned twice), the way they were different from everyone else was a differing viewpoint - and that making fun of Christianity was just a cheap shot, something so very prevalent in Hollywood today. How can they ever expect to be respected for a differing viewpoint, when they don't extend the same courtesy to others ? Hypocrites, who are no better than me, no better than you. If they had substituted Christianity, with Judaism, Muslim, Wiccan, or any other ""group"", would it have been so easily accepted by the masses ? It should be just as easy to respect other's beliefs and customs, as it is to make fun of them.I was also offended at the continued vulgar language prevalent around and by the children in this movie. We're raising a planet full of kids who know no boundaries of decency. It's a form of child abuse. If you are 50 or over, then most likely, you were not raised to use or hear the words F***, God D***, S***, and others, until you were maybe 10 or over.",Captain Fantastic

295,canozer123,Evaluating Alternatives,9,5 January 2017,"Almost all discussions of this film center around two themes: criticism of the mainstream American/Western culture and raising children. But I think the strongest aspect of Captain Fantastic is its critical exploration of alternative systems.We all know the inconsistencies and the ironic hypocrisies of the mainstream culture. But no system is actually inherently coherent. While Ben appraises the norm of critical discussion during the part where the little kid opposes to the Chomsky day, Ben himself dismisses critical discussion and attempts to forcefully take the child from his grandparents. While we see that the little girl knows more about the Bill of Rights than two 13 years old boys, we also see that the oldest sibling is completely ignorant and clumsy when he chats up with Claire. While we see them very violently hunt animals, they are shocked with the brutality of video games.Now, the mainstream approach of the alternative system acknowledges these facts, and argues that the skills of our protagonists are more important than the skills of the American masses. This line of thinking can also be seen in various kinds of elitisms such as scientism, rationalism, eliminative physicalism, etc. But according to what standards exactly are they more important? How did the dichotomies between natural/unnatural, actual/non-actual food, real/unreal, etc. come about? This is where armchair intellectualism comes to a stop. These standards of determining what's important and what's not originates not by reference to some prior starting point that prepares the ground of discussion. There is first starting point, first standards, fundamentals of any kind, because they too would be in need of justification by reference to some prior standards.What gives rise to these standards at the first place is simply the way we live and the way we conceive of the world. These cannot be criticized through intellectual discussion, but they can only change through active participation in the world. This is what the film confirms. Before the girl fell down the roof and almost died, there was no intellectual discussion that could have changed Ben's beliefs. Not because Ben was bigoted the same way every other person is bigoted too, but because some things are inescapably accepted by him to make way for further beliefs.To sum up, Captain Fantastic shows the imperfect, fallible nature of human beings. It shows that derailing from the mainstream culture is not an answer to our problems, but that if there's any answer, it could be known not through blind intellectualism, but through actively exploring the alternatives.PS: the dialogue about Trotsky, Stalin and Mao also points to this issue.",Captain Fantastic

Honestly, I would love feeling the same feels again and again, like it is the first time meeting these characters.Behind every word, move or eye contact, I can see a whole world appearing. There are true meanings, deep and well-perfomanced.There is a constant flue, something that makes a 2hour movie seem like a brief, but still happy moment of life. I believe that the relationships actually never stopped developing or changing, a situation that kept me at the edge of my seat. Acting was pure and honest, something that made me feel close to the characters and their special inside worlds.It is proved in the movie, that everyone can choose his way of living only by the time he/she is prepared for the consequences. That's because our lives have became very similar to each other and the way of living too simple and unhealthy, both for the body and soul.it is our duty to step away from the today's hell and create something different, something that is worth of even making a movie for it. We need to escape, we need to establish our own way of living...because behind that, there is hidden a whole philosophy of self-expression.this movie opened my eyes, my soul and since then I tend to be honest with my self.",Captain Fantastic

309,mauro-taccone,A different take on the living in the wilderness movie,8,21 October 2016,"So i so this movie today and i found it interesting. Sorry I know I have to say more than that so let me explain.The cinematography was just beautiful. They really showed of the beauty of the outside.The acting was decent. Viggo Mortenson was really good in it. George McKay was also good and i really liked Frank Langellas Performance. The Characters were well developed and you could see where they were coming from. I liked the character of Frank Langella first you think that he is an asshole but as the movie progresses you could see his point of view and why he thinks that way.The Beginning of this movie was great, i loved that they gave the family time to show their relationship, it was really easy to relate to them. The Movie was also really funny it has some genuinely funny moments. I hate when movies try to be funny by being relatable and this movie didn't do that. When movies try to be relatable it comes across as cringe worthy and this movie didn't do that. It had one scene where it was cringe worthy but it was on purpose. I cringed so hard at that scene where Bo tried to marry that girl he just met. It was great.The R-Rating was unexpected especially for this kind of movie. I did not expect to see Viggo Mortensens dick. But if you think about it there is a reason why it is R-rated. In this movie the subject Sex was treated like a normal thing. In one scene he just straight up tells the kid straight up how sex works. The movie says that sex shouldn't be so controversial, it's just normal. And i think with the explicit things they tried to tell this to the audienceAnd the final point that i liked is the commentary. Normally in those kinds of living in the wilderness story's. It's about a person who hates society and tries to start a new life in the wild. This movie critiques that but doesn't say that it's bad. It shows the advantages and disadvantages of both sides. And I liked that it was left up to the viewer to decide if such a lifestyle is good or bad.But there were still flaws to this movie. The points that they were trying to make was sometimes a little bit too obvious. Scenes were sometimes going on too long like for example the dinner scene. And not all performances were that good, nothing terrible but nothing really outstanding.Despite the flaws I really liked the movie and I'm excited for the next Matt Ross project.

But after the death of the mother.so They need to come out of their comfort zone and step in the real world and to fulfill their mother's last wish.The acting by all the characters are awesome especially viggo Mortensen sir.. Nailed it. He potrayed emotions each emotions very calmy, I think just with his eyes . We are able to feel what he is feeling at some situation.The concept of movie is unique and creative as it lays down that going extreme in both ways of living will not necessarily give you the utmost pleasure. There are many flaws in our world but there are flaws in living in excluded from it too.Because at some point we have to face the real world because they are in the majority. The problem can be solved if we take the midway. Balancing both living situations like keeping technology at it's respective limit and try to join our body to nature have our own philosophies. And that's what's shown at the end of the movie.Especially we understand it all with the silence provided at the end.Direction of the movie is crisp, and it's also well written with bit of humour, there are time when you laugh joyously.

315,skyjw,An Unwieldy Exploration of Man and Nature and the Nature of Man,4,6 April 2021,"There is a moment at the beginning of the second act of ""Captain Fantastic"" where the titular character, Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen), admonishes one of his daughters for not delving deeper in her analysis of the novel ""Lolita"" beyond its plot. When pressed, she eventually gives a more nuanced, comprehensive understanding of the material beyond the basic idea of the novel. The film accomplishes the young lady's first try. It fails to replicate the second one.The biggest issue with this film is that the titular character is explored too little despite being the centerpiece of the story and origin of most, if not all, of its conflicts. Because even as someone who agrees with some of the broader points and socio-political sentiments this movie is trying to make, the behavior and actions of Mr. Cash range from highly negligent to what might appear to be the Pacific Northwest's one family Jonestown. One of the first questions you will undoubtedly ask is why this family has chosen to live a survivalist lifestyle in the Cascades. And while we are repeatedly subject to jokes, diatribes, and one off quips from both Ben himself and all the way down to his youngest child (seemingly no older than 5 or 6 years old) which establish their leftwing, anarchist views of the world, we are never truly informed as to why Mr. Cash possesses these views to begin with. His life prior to the events of this movie are largely left in total mystery. Where did he come from? Why did he come to have a disdain for the modern world beyond hatred for modern American consumerism? None of these questions are seriously posed by the film, let alone answered. And when the movie teeters into the slightest skepticism or critique of Ben's worldview and the manner in which he raises his family, director Matt Ross sweeps them away in what appears to be vicarious agreement with his protagonist. Ben is rarely challenged throughout the duration of the movie, and when he reveals why he and his recently deceased wife took to their isolated alpine home, the answer evokes the same kind of unanswered questions which remain unanswered. Mr. Cash barely grows by the end of the film, with what growth he does experience a byproduct of narrative necessity than the genuine evolution of a character.The film's saving grace is largely in its performances and its cinematography. The visual presentation captures a certain homeliness and warmth among the Cash family which does well to give the movie some manner of emotional core. And there is some good visual storytelling in how it differentiates certain characters and informs us of the basic narrative, although this same approach is largely foregone when exemplifying the Cash family's ideological beliefs which are explained almost completely via lengthy and unwieldy dialogue, especially when given to the youngest of the Cash family.But, other than those questionable choices pertaining to who delivers what dialogue, the performances are largely solid, even among the child actors (for the most part). Viggo Mortensen once again delivers a nuanced, believable performance even though he is hamstrung by a severely underwritten role. And the family as a whole is undercut by certain logical fallacies and incongruities throughout. Certain moments which are clearly meant to evoke laughter also fall flat due to poor execution and editing, becoming awkward and unfunny. The same can be said of scenes meant to be more serious and emotional impactful, only to fall victim to identical missteps which render them unintentionally comical.And, in the end, ""Captain Fantastic"" is exactly that - an intriguing premise, undercut by poor execution and a near slavish devotion to the characters and their lifestyle. It is a character study which disdains the notion of dissecting its characters and an comedic road trip film in which the majority of the comedy is found in the most unintended of moments.",Captain Fantastic

318,theresews,Relevant and thought-provoking,8,6 September 2016,"This movie is a brilliant philosophical piece. It asks a very complicated overall question - what does it mean to live in ""the real world?"". Because as far as the movie goes, there are different answers to this question. Because does ""living in the real world"" mean that you can walk along everybody else and understand socially constructed rules and laws on how to act and how to not? What to say and what to not? Is it the ability to understand your surroundings and be able to be normal? Or does ""living in the real world"" mean to understand what philosophies and ideas our society is built up on and take a stand for your own? Being able to see patterns, that prove that something has been overdone or where the original meaning has been forgotten over time. To be able to understand and see the things, that the average citizen would never take his/her time to read up on? For me, this is the most central question that this movie is attempting to present. Yes, each side of the argument has its extremities, but the overall ""fight"" between the two sides is not easy, and at the end of the day there is no definite answer for you, as a viewer. While being a movie, that will leave you with a whole lot to discuss with your peers, it is also brilliantly executed, with great acting as much as heart-warming and heart-breaking relations. However, there has been subtracted two stars due to some logical fallacies, and some missed comedic moments. But apart from this, the movie overall is funny and very interesting.

320,Sarden,We do make fun of Christians,9,19 October 2016,"A very well acted drama digging in to the hypocrisy, general shortcomings and sometimes outright idiocy of modern Western society in a way that can't help but make you both smile and cry a little. More than anything this film should make you think about how we are raising our children – the institution of the school and what we feed into our children's minds.Raised in the woods by their father, Ben Cash, and their currently absent mother, the six children in 'Captain Fantastic' appear to be small geniuses compared to the self-indulgent mush churned out by our institutional schools, Playstations and social media. Are we completely wasting the potential of our children?Once the geniuses face that real world of institutionalized learning and computer games, however, clashes of cultures are bound to happen. 'Captain Fantastic' is basically an exploration of the self-taught, intellectual Cash family's clash with mainstream culture and, perhaps, of what the two can learn from each other.The endearing rationalism of the Cash family is laid out as the film moves on, and several memorable quotes should put a smile on the face of any lucid mind, such as:""We don't make fun of other people ... except Christians"", and ""Who would you rather have a national holiday for? A non-existent magical elf or a real life humanitarian"" (free from the mind) - the humanitarian being Noam Chomsky.Viggo Mortensen is, as always, exceptional. The acting goes away, and you only see Ben Cash.At times, the script feels just a little too spelled out and predictable, so I can't give it a full 10. But it's close.

321,mannacio-124-682011,Less than it could have been,5,22 August 2016,"Raising 6 children, three boys and three girls, in the wilderness would be hard enough. Training them to be skilled hunters, gifted at self defense and schooling them effectively would be beyond the skills of most parents. But this Dad isn't most people. His oldest son speaks 6 languages and is accepted to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown and M.I.T. His youngest girl can recite or explain the Bill of Rights. All six children are able rock climbers and very fit. In keeping with the politics of the day they are followers of Noam Chomsky and more than just a little left of Bernie Sanders. All of this already strains credulity and is it really necessary? So, when the children and their father decide to leave their retreat in the woods to attend their mother's funeral, we are sure that there will be a culture clash. The excesses of this clash are to be expected after the excesses of the characterization of the children. The mere fact that these children grow up in the wilderness does not mean that their parents would have failed to provide any social skills whatsoever. This makes the culture clash setup less believable and true to life. If there might have been any issues that the audience is expected to think about, the way the characters are drawn detracts so much that any serious issues that could have been raised are no longer relevant.Perhaps this is the reason this movie is listed BOTH as a comedy AND a Drama.

327,witcherms,Ideology Impossible,8,13 July 2020,"Captain Fantastic (Matt Ross, 2016) fascinates from the start. He is fierce in criticism and delicate in family relationships that presents, which is one of the aspects that most shapes the long towards a distance of simple feelings. Following the delicate treatment and please do not confuse delicacy with weakness, the film is mounted on a large rudder shown in each scene. It is as if they say: what are you doing with the life you witness all the time? What have you done to the animal that is in you? Did it take how much false morality to erode the child that once existed in your body?Given these questions, I can say that captain fantastic is a difficult work to watch. It is worth mentioning that I refer to truly watching, donating the senses in the 118 minutes that make up the feature, since this way it is possible to perceive how much it can get to hurt in a directly proportional way to the lifestyle that the spectator and the spectator have led, because it is very likely that this style is criticized, or at least certain characteristics belonging to it. In view of this, here can be noted an excellent structure of the script developed by Matt Ross, because the disapprovals that are made by the characters and simultaneously forge the traits that relate to each other and the environment in which they are, are not directly conducted to the daily lives of and viewers, but to the system experienced by them.However, the film becomes too idealistic and somewhat extremist in its ideals, being therefore practically impossible to be applicable in reality, which can transmit a certain bitterness or bittersweet inspiration during and especially at the end of it, something that the film Glass Castle (Destin Crettonthe, 2017), which follows similar lines of plot, does not commit. Of course, I must point out that the fact that Glass Castle is a work based on Jeannette Walls' memoir must have been the main stronghold for the film to have been conceived with an enormously more realistic tone when compared to Captain Fantastic, which, however, does not disqualify either of the two feature films.Finally, it is necessary to watch many and many times Captain Fantastic, since he was not produced just to entertain in such a way that, if you are seeking only entertainment, the film will possibly disappoint you. It offers much more than an easy skiing fun; In fact, it recalls the infantile spontaneity in the step that unmasks with ease how much the life of supposed civilizations manifests an infinity of duties and rules that have been and are imposed even if they do not make the slightest sense for those who learn to perform them as machines, besides, of course, teaching them promptly to the next generations.In short, Captain Fantastic is a corner to life. It is something like the strongest condemnation of everything that prevents it from germinating. Being not only beautiful to feel, but also fertile to affect, she masterfully manifests values that have been neglected for a long time. It expresses that barbarity is not in starting to act like other animals, in fact, barbarism is in the abyss that now separates us from the possibilities of being animals, that is, of practicing the primordial condition of life, which is the simplest of all: to live. This is how the film tells its story by demonstrating the possibilities of contemplating the birth and death that we practice spontaneously at each moment, transforming creatively and coexisting in symbiosis with other organisms. Difficult task, I have to admit. However, it is something that is still worth fighting for.""I try all the time in this institution. And I pray, oh my God, as I pray.

330,FreakingMovieFanatic,Highly Recommended,8,12 May 2021,"If you don't mind taking a detour from the usual Hollywood fare, then this just might be your thing. It's a simple story of a family raised off the grid in the wilderness. And then a tragedy happens. I will leave it at that. Viggo Mortosen, and all the kid actors were well - fantastic!! It's an eye opening film as really bridges the life outdoors vs being conformed to what society expects of us. It's funny, sad, and very entertaining. Never once touched my phone the whole 1hr and 59min. I was that curious and glued to the screen.Really decent film.Watch it.You might like it, eh?",Captain Fantastic
331,jasontaylorr,10/10 An Instant Classic,10,7 July 2020,"Story - 9/10 pros: this is a very touching story of a father doing his best to raise his children as he sees best (albeit not a way the average american might agree with). It's a really touching family tell that dives into the complexities of love and protecting the ones you love. cons: there's not a lot to dislike here. it's one of the better stories I've seen in a while. Maybe it forces a hipster forest feel just a little at times.Cast - 10/10 pros: The ensemble cast is perfection but George MacKay is the the true standout. Viggo Mortensen is wonderful as the struggling father trying to keep his family together, but MacKay continually steals scene after scene. But yes the entire cast is brilliant; there is even a wonderful cameo of sorts from Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn (weird that their last names are so close) that they are brilliant in as well.
cons: no cons, here, cast is the star of the show. Maybe there's some believability factor here because the entire family is very good looking and perfectly hipstered groomed for a family living in the forest on their own.Direction - 9/10 pros: Writer/Director Matt Ross brilliantly weaves this touching family story together. He develops every character. Out of a family of 7 with 6 kids, he manages to make each character feel separate and distinct and always with purpose. He brilliantly walks the line between eccentric comedy and heartfelt drama without hesitation.
cons: again maybe he pushes a hipster feel into this family for comedic relief that can feel a bit forced.Pace - 9/10 pros: the movie checks in at just under two hours, but never feels slow or like a scene is wasted. Again with a family of seven, Ross uses every minute of this film to develop the characters, eccentricities, and insecurities of these family members. It takes it times and makes the audience fall in love with this unusual family.
cons: maybe some of the flashbacks to the mom seemed a little forced? again don't have too many cons for this movie.Atmosphere - 10/10 pros: the tone and atmosphere the filmmakers create is top notch. The costumes provide a fun sense of quirk and color to the film. The photography is very beautiful and helps accent some truly brilliant performances by the ensemble cast while always providing a clear geography with often very full cast oriented scenes. The music slides by in the background, and delivers one of the most powerful moments of the movie when the family celebrates a fond farewell to their mother; this scene is the personification of the movie and if it doesn't make you cry or feel happy or sad or some sort of strong emotion, then something is wrong with you.
cons: loved the atmosphere of this movie.Overall Score 10 out of 10, an instant classic",Captain Fantastic
332,darkknight_ind_usa,A venture by the bests in the game,8,23 June 2017,"While I was skimming over the list of movies for Oscars of 2017, I came across this movie. I always go over the reviews and trailers to determine whether the movie is as per my taste or not and boy, was I not thrilled to watch it.The movie gives you a feeling of how we have been surrounding ourselves with false sense of achievement with the increased materialism and losing their original essence. The movie has highlighted some of the nuances of current society. The schooling, the social interactions and priorities etc. It's a conflict between the parental guidance and philosophy; whether you should let your kids know everything when they have a question then and there or wait till they come of age. It'll leave you feeling stuck with the idea of this movie and certainly happy.

333,mrfreedomx-217-618147,You'll like it if you aren't a die hard patriot,9,11 March 2017,"I loved this movie far more than I anticipated. I won't go into depth about it really, but I did want to comment in particular about the other user reviews I read about it. I found that this movie is seemingly very polarizing in that people who didn't love it seemed to hate it for the most part. However, the overarching reasons that haters of this film have in common are that they all get extremely angered by what they deem as glorifying the father's political and social ideals. They furthermore seem to all think that the costly extremes of the father's lifestyle that he imparts on his children don't ever get denounced enough. I find the fact that everyone who gave this movie a 1/10 did so because they take offense to their interpretation of its message both laughable and misguided. When someone gives a movie a 1/10 on here simply because they didn't agree with the movie's message (more accurately, THEIR INTERPRETATION of the message), then he/she essentially proves him/herself to be a completely unreliable source of objective opinion regarding a film's quality in direction, cinematography, acting, storytelling, etc. And it's potentially a shame because I'm not sure how a movie's overall IMDb score is tallied, but if user reviews are a part of the equation at all, then this movie was dragged down by the haters who can't put their own politics aside and judge a movie on its merit beyond that. Yes, the protagonists are a family of off-the-grid ""hippies"" for lack of a better term, whose father seems to carry a socio-political ideology which he influences upon his kids which is ultimately anti-corporate America and against big business, commercialism, overzealous capitalism, and organized religion. So what? So the movie drags on and on because you don't agree with that line of thinking? That's ridiculous. There are all sorts of movies that I don't like because I don't like the subject matter or the main character, but I would never say that they're awful because of it. Grow up! So I will say that for me in particular, while I am a Democrat and definitely left-leaning in my politics, I'm certainly not a ""Maoist"" or ""Trotskyist"" as the eldest son proclaims early in the film. Yet, surprisingly enough, I found this film to be excellent all around. The acting was very good, which is always more precarious of a situation when the movie is so children-heavy. Though most of the kids are older kids, it's always still a potential drag if a movie's main character(s) is a minor. These kids are all very good actors. The shots of the land that the family lives on are beautiful, and made me wish I could go back to the Pacific Northwest for another visit. The casting beyond the family is great too. I'm a big fan of Ann Dowd any time she snags a supporting role, and Kathryn Hahn and Steve Zahn are indie champions. Overall, it's a film well worth a viewing. And if you're a Republican who's a Sam's Club member, perhaps watch it and then come on here and give it an objective review, and represent your kind better by proving you can watch this film without being so over sensitive about whatever message you think it's pushing, and maybe even enjoy yourself;)",Captain Fantastic

Viggo Mortenson delivers a powerhouse performance as a father determined to raise healthy, smart children who are free from the nonsense and BS typical of most Americans. He has chosen to live off the grid, and home-school his children. At the same time, he teaches them to be self-reliant. they know how to survive with only a knife. They all speak several foreign languages and can recite and discuss nearly any esoteric topic such as the relative merits of capitalism versus socialism. What becomes apparent, as they venture into the world at large on a mission to pay respects to the wife/mother of the family, is the fact that the children have no practical knowledge that is useful in American society. The thing I like most is this film seems to be a condemnation of that American society. It sheds an illuminating light on the materialism, greed, waste, anti=intellectualism and sheer ridiculousness that is the ""normal"" American Christian life. I would recommend this film for anyone who is interested in seeing how much better America could be if more of us rejected what has been fed to us as the ""proper"" way to live.",Captain Fantastic

However, I did find it extremely ironic that Chomsky dedicated his book to Lucifer, aka Satan. This movie falls prey to his BS. It is also ironic that the ""power to the people. Stick it to the man."" slogan used by this movie crystalizes what useful idiots Chomsky turned people into, including Hillary Clinton. Think about it for a moment. What form or governance is ruled by ""the man""? Unquestionably the answer is communists regimes and ""Maoists"" lauded in the movie.

348,hawkroad,The Power of a Good Story,9,12 October 2016,"Films like ""Captain Fantastic"" are as rare as hens teeth these days. Sure, it""s a warming story that tackles, in a subliminally enough way not to make your eyes roll, different points of view on religion, mental health, parenting and societal priorities; what makes ""Captain Fantastic"" stand out, however, is that it is a collaboration of artists who appear to hold the same fierce passion for the project. This is a necessary recipe for an independent film to really break out, much like ""Whiplash"", ""Juno"" and a few others have done. The acting, music, writing and directing were all on point.It's actually surprising these days to find yourself invested in a movie's characters. With all the fluff of CGI and frantic editing, the emphasis on ""entertainment"" almost always casts a dull shadow over the story. In this film, you genuinely dislike the antagonists and share the roller-coaster emotions of the protagonists. There are plenty of plot synopsis' available, so I won't bother. I will say that the stark contrasts of an open-dialogue, intimate parent-child relationship and one of an X- Box-babysitting, sheltered one was really fine-tuned here. I actually grunted out loud in disgust several times during the interactions between the ""town"" kids and the ""wild"" ones, when in truth we all lean heavily towards the friction-less and soulless parenting style of the former. I was also teary-eyed a few times, which has been such a rare movie-going experience lately that I almost blurted out, in The Grinch's words, ""I'm leaking!""I think it's really important to support films like these...to shout from the roof-tops (or simply write a few sentences online) and remind the industry to get back to story-telling the way it should be.

349,jorganovicmladen,Modern society vs family.,8,24 January 2017,"Captain Fantastic (2016), from director Matt Ross is a highly emotive family drama, which is special in it's own way, not like your average ""every day"" movie.It's about family that refuses to live by today's ""rules and standards"", and goes on to live in nature. Whole casting, along with main star Viggo Mortensen is fantastic! You really believe they are family, that takes you to a adventure with them, through self-discovery, inner fight with themselves for their way of life and philosophy, fight with others who don't agree with them, and possible mistakes. Movie establishes great question, which is: Is it better to be protected by lies or faced with the truth? And gives it's answer to that question. Vigo Mortensen (father) has his own inner fight in which he is faced with question is he a good father, would his children have better life without him.This movie is decorated by beautiful cinematography, because of beautiful shots of nature, but also there are shots of urban cities and industry, in comparison of those shots is point of this movie. And the point is: what means to be normal family and does normal family needs to fit in today's patterns of society, to be normal? Music in movie is also great, because in every moment it helps audience to awake feeling which director is aiming for. Movie is paced very well, and in it's 2 hours it never got boring.In conclusion beautiful film for whole family, that brings real values of life on screen, and shows audience what it means to be true family in both good and bad times.",Captain Fantastic

Someone has to know the complete Bill of Rights and believe in them. We all have to know how to properly bury our parents.  It is easy to see how some may not ""get"" this fine little movie whose generally honest script and disciplined direction* saved a ""renegade"" cinematic family from tired hippie jokes.  The two parents were extremist and ideological, granted, yet would we not have some like these among us, particularly if they are, as is Mortensen's character, capable of ultimate self-reflection and compromise?",Captain Fantastic

The company we keep will generate the next results for sure. Therefore this film is about transparency and this film is about how we raise the upcoming generation but mainly this film is about development via means of hard work and building up milestones of truth, honesty and transparency in the heart of our kids. There is a scene of animal hunting in the movie and i feel like captain fantastic would have supported vegetarian eating. Meat eating is bad and captain fantastic must know that. There is a scene of two video game playing boys who does not have basic knowledge of the law of their nation and a eight year old kid outruns them upon the basis of her knowledge. A filmy scene but also a truth where manipulation for selling things is so high that general knowledge is repressed somewhere between so called technological growth and economical development.In the end i would love to say that its time when we leave our ""mechanistic approach"" {as stated by Mr. Capra in the book Uncommon Wisdom} and it is the time when we all should look out for the good and practical effects of good company.",Captain Fantastic
354,christina-delimitrou,A gem hidden in the forests of the Pacific Northwest,10,27 April 2016,"I watched this in Sundance earlier in the year, and was captivated by the storytelling, acting and cinematography.The story follows Ben (Viggo Mortensen), a father of six, living deep in the forests of the pacific northwest, far from modern life. All six children, from seventeen year old Bodevan to seven year old Nai are fluent in philosophy, history and quantum theory (!), and can hunt and fend for themselves in the wilderness. At least that is until the suicide of their mother forces the family to clash with modern society, and then Ben realizes that he has in fact not prepared his children at all for what lies outside their forest. Bodevan, for example, accepted in a swarm of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer single-handedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without immediately proposing to her.The family's ideals further come under stress when his late wife's father (Frank Langella) who hates the life Ben has created for his family comes into the picture, and forbids Ben from attending his wife's funeral, threatening him with arrest. In what could have easily turned into a one-dimensional harsh/rich character, Frank Langella also projects empathy and deep grief over his daughter's death. When Ben and his children visit his sister's much more conventional family, and her smart phone-obsessed children, Ben criticizes their upbringing, only to have his sister bring his own parenting skills into question. Director Matt Ross skillfully presents both sides here without picking favorites.Acting-wise the film is captivating, with Mortensen fitting the renaissance profile of Ben like a glove. He projects all the arrogance and hardheadedness of Ben together with his warmth, adoration for his children, and respect for his wife's wishes with grace and subtlety in one of the most seemingly effortless performances I have seen. He is also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, from the children to his in-laws and sister.In summary, Captain Fantastic is a rare case where family dynamics, with their controversies and dilemmas are not oversimplified to a preaching doctrine in the finale; the film allows the viewer the space to find their own balance on what it means to raise a child.",Captain Fantastic

356,tainoarawak,"Somewhat unpolished, yet nonetheless a gem",7,11 October 2016,"**Possible Spoilers** I'll try to avoid spoilers or at least be as vague as I can with them, but I placed a spoiler alert just in case I don't succeed.Too many movies dominate the market that seem to discourage having an attention span. This isn't one of them. If you don't care for beautiful cinematography, good writing, and a sophisticated story line, this movie will seem to long for you.Personally, I didn't notice the time going by because I was so drawn into it. The movie is beautifully shot. The writing is very good, but with some flaws -- more on that later. The acting is wonderful (par for the course with Mortensen; it is always a pleasure to watch him work his craft) and the children shine as well.I completely disagree that this is a liberal propaganda piece. It is simplistic thinking to believe a movie is some sort of propaganda piece just because a character in is is a liberal, or a conservative, or anything else for that matter. The film isn't pushing any beliefs, and although there is some social commentary, it isn't preachy at all. Far from propaganda, the film is a character piece of a particular type of man, and of his family.In fact, the main character is depicted far from perfect or justified in all his actions and beliefs. He is challenged and critiqued throughout the movie, by the consequences of his actions, the grandparents, and even some of his own children. The fact that a deep change occurs in him is the ultimate evidence of that. Meanwhile, Captain Fantastic is a unique and overall well written story, but not without it's flaws... and they are somewhat glaring indeed.The end is untidy and feels a but rushed, as if the writers and director couldn't quite find a way to wrap up and tighten up certain ambitious sequences in the plot line. For example, we are expected to believe that the grandfather simply let ""it"" go. This isn't in keeping with neither the action of the movie, nor the character of the grandfather. He would have had the proper authorities go after them immediately. Still, at least in terms of how the family turns out, it is believable that given the father's adjustments, he would be favored lawfully as the guardian, so although too abrupt, that particular piece of the plot line can be forgiven. However, one is left to wonder how the father came about having the means to pull such a thing off, and there is zero explanation for it.Then of course is the climax, where the family goes on a special ""mission"" involving a rather serious crime, and an extremely ambitious goal. We are expected to believe that they were able to accomplish it without a hitch and with no one noticing. In this instance, suspension of disbelief becomes too challenging. Thus, the film gets pretty sloppy at the end.Dramatic, touching, challenging, disturbing at times, and yet also witty and funny, the film's virtues out weigh its flaws. Plus, with such great acting and lovely cinematography, Captain Fantastic is well worth the watch, unless your attention span is limited to CGI action flicks or simplistic, vapid story-telling.A very solid 7 out of ten stars.",Captain Fantastic
357,rachelchinb,I just love this film.,10,30 May 2020,"This movie has made me think quite a lot about all things that really matter in life. I recently just became an educator, and like any beginners into the field, I had idealistic views on how children must be taught, too, and about what really the essential skills to learn are. As I went on with my idealistic views backed up by theories of people--mostly dead--I began to feel frustrated because it isn't how it is in the ""real world"" especially that the practices being done at schools now are mostly ideas of people who won history over--and we never questioned that (well, we did. But only did a little). And this film. This film is just different. It isn't a cliche story about cliche topics on life. The things discussed here are real matters. It makes you want to question things and just think about how much we are missing, how much we've went on in life without looking back at past practices that were instictively ours that could've been developed and useful if given the opportunity to. This talks about the uncommon perspective of taking the road not taken by many. This movie teaches you about taking risks, and of being firm with whatever principle you have about life without of course, closing doors to intellectual discussions and sensible arguments. This gives you a different take at the usual lifestyle of people, and life in general. To be honest, it was quite disorienting when two worlds were contrasted in one frame--that of theirs and their aunt's family. As most of us would, we would really find the aunt's argument more practical and relevant in this world, (and I commend the movie for realistically showing that as well, because we're not talking about the ancient Greece here and the time of Socrates and Plato; we're talking about that kind of lifestyle adapted in the modern goddamn 21st century) but the movie didn't fail to turn our heads to that other side--to what could be. Overall, I just love this movie. Great cast, great acting, great plot (come on, just put in all the elements of drama). There are many good philosophical views shown in this movie, too!

358,andelko2001,"Something strange, something wrong",1,16 October 2016,"It's totally appalling to me from the start. I looked forward to this movie. I knew theme. But what was showed to me in the beginning makes me wonder do this movie's makers wanted me to feel disgusted by this family. I'm talking about scene where kid kills a deer. Whole scene was designed to present this family as survivalists but in cheap manner that screams ""Shock value!!!"". That is where all goes wrong. I know about customs of some old nations which almost apologizes for taking animal's life away for survival purposes. In this scene if you erase shoots where deer wanders and actual cheap ""shock value"" killing moments and start from the shoot of that kid face while blurred figures come from the woods, later on eating whatever body part was that, you might think, as it stroke me, it is cannibalistic sacrificial ritual. It intentionally represented some boy to man ritual but sacrificial part comes from kid's super total lack of any remorse, negative emotion regarding what he did just moment ago, emotion normal human would expect from someone doing act like that for a first time. From that point of view, scene from ""The Kings of Summer"" vibes more realistic, no shock value, shots and more in line with what I mentioned about old nation's customs. Unless makers of this movie wanted to show something else, darker, or just accidentally, in totally incompetent way, transformed this kid into cold blooded murderer who would easily next time do it to a human being with same amount of no emotions. Which brought me to feeling this kid is perfect candidate for a serial killer so I could imagine this scene put to better use in Halloween part 1 as real Mike Myers beginning. If he shouldn't have been that type, kid would've shown at least some remorse feelings before his father came to his front starting ""motivational"" speech. Regardless of how much he adores his father. Sound effects of dying deer's breathing visually covered by kid's cold face and, most of all, totally unnecessary, excessive shot of dying deer's face and his closed and, for a moment, opened eyes seem like movie makers wanted us to feel for a deer and hate this family more than they wanted just to point out this family members are survivalists. Because you can point out survivalist character of a person without painting him mandatory with maniacal colors and trying to make us watch this animal last moment's sufferings. Only thing makers made me is to stop caring about any story this family and whole movie set could bring. So I stopped. I can judge house just from looking at its foundations. This first scene was foundation and smashed price to zero. No sale whatever treasure may have been lying inside if salesman come across as disgusting maniac.",Captain Fantastic

It showing us two totally different point of view, from the parents ( of course ) and the kid ( teenager or not )... Bad and good parenting is mixed experiences, and we learn not to pushed ourselves as a straight parent figure for them.. Maybe we want the best for them, but maybe it's not what they want.. Parenting is always a gray side, it determine the effect from parent rules implied with the kid's natural behavior.. Watch how Viggo as a father figure explained sex education to his 5 years daughter, his answers is hilarious vulgar but I think that is bad answer for her ages, something that I believe I couldn't do to my daughter in the future.",Captain Fantastic

But then turns out, they are some kind of super humans, who not only can speak multiple languages and are also master of any theoretical or physical topic you can imagine. Everything ""outside"" is really bad and stupid, but they still use things from ""outside"" like the bus, knifes, perfectly clean and fancy cloths...it's some kind of new hippie, fantasy and not thought through. Then what put me most of was the constant mocking of Christianity and how stupid christians are but at the same time buddhism is super cool. Mao is not a mass murderer anymore but a a role model , it's OK to train you children to steal from a store (stuff you don't want anyway, because everything from ""outside"" is bad...but not in this case apparently) I could go on and on...I hope the rating goes down, because this is really not justified.",Captain Fantastic

363,johnjonsson-04540,Amazing!,10,21 May 2017,"I make a point out of not watching movie trailers, as they tend to give away too much about the movie and/or give me unrealistic expectations. In the case of Captain Fantastic, I'm extra happy that I stuck to that concept. I knew very little about Captain Fantastic before I decided to watch it, and after my brother's persistent insisting that I watch it, I finally caved. I'm glad I did, as it is one of the most unique, not to mention one of the greatest, movies I've ever seen. To make a movie where child actors are given lots of screen time is risky, but the casting crew did a great job finding actors. The ""Captain's"" children are played brilliantly by their actors, and I have to commend them as well as the writers for giving each of those characters a distinct personality. From the moment that the family is introduced, I found myself completely immersed in their story, and immediately I wanted to know more. There is great chemistry between all the actors, particularly between the Captain (played wonderfully by Mortensen) and his oldest child, Bodevan, played brilliantly by MacKay. The way that the actors managed to convey the nuances brought on by their characters' developments is truly impressive.Visually, the movie is stunning as well. Two thumbs up!",Captain Fantastic

365,izartirta,Crazy movie about crazy people doing crazy things,2,22 June 2018,"I am aware that in terms of acting or cinematography, this movie received a lot of nominations. But for me there are some disturbing things from what is presented in it.This film seems to teach about freedom, i.e do not want to be bound by norms or rules that have been generally accepted. But is it true that someone can indeed be free like that? Is not it in the so-called freedom by Ben Cash, he also has some rules that his children must do? Therefore, the problem is not whether a person is free of rules or bound by rules (basically, everyone is bound by the rules of life). The problem is that Cash is too arrogant to accept the prevailing rules and thinks that his own rules of life are the most correct.In his arrogance, thinking that his rule or lifestyle is the most correct one, Cash teaches his children to steal. They stole food in the supermarket, stole his mother's body and taught his children to fight the police (the authorities).In his arrogance that believes his lifestyle is right, Cash teaches that a person is allowed to be naked in a public place. Cash might think that why should we be governed by norms that are generally prevalent in society in naked affairs? Does not every man have a penis? What is wrong with showing a penis that is a member of the body itself to anyone? Cash does not want to be governed by such politeness norms. But the irony is, Cash himself made the rule that it should not be naked at meals? Is not this an ambiguity? Is not this once pointed out that the main reason Cash does what he does is not to support freedom, but that he does not want to recognize the rules of others and only acknowledge his own rules. Cash teaches his children not to be tolerant of others, no need to respect the beliefs of others. Just do what they think is right, no need to care about others. What kind of parent is this?I am deeply disappointed that the value of a film is as if it is only placed on how actors play their roles, or on how unique a story is. Why is it that we are not disturbed by the teachings of wild life that potentially damage the soul of a child? Or at least limiting a child to seeing the world in a broader way? In Cash's effort to give his children freedom to live in nature, Cash has limited their freedom of interaction and normal relationships with others who are different from them.Are we not aware that by assigning high marks to such film like this one, we indirectly also agree on a man's lifestyle that teaches his children to steal? So, if you think this is good, do you want to raise your own children in this manner?",Captain Fantastic

The title really doesn't give anything away about the plot or tone of the film. It isn't a superhero movie. Before I speak a little more about the film I would simply refer to my title, if you are on the fence about whether or not to give this a go - watch it. The only people I can see not getting some sort of satisfactory level of enjoyment out of the film (At the very least) are those whom it offends in some non-obvious way. I left it having thoroughly enjoyed the experience. If that is all you need, I wouldn't bother reading any further. The basic plot (no spoilers) revolves around a family who live in isolation from general society - living off the land mostly, hunting etc, with little contact with anyone else. For reasons I won't mention they end up having to mix back in with 'civilization' and this is basically what the movie revolves around... the contrast between those living in regular society and those who grew up with a completely different value system. The movie explores this premise fairly well, sometimes in obvious ways, but overall effectively done. The movie contains drama and humour, both of which are done subtly, I certainly never felt i was being beaten over the head with it. The movie is an easy watch, and opens the mind to ponder the pros and cons of different ways of life and different ways of approaching life. I feel those who criticize the film extensively possibly took it too seriously. As I have mentioned, I went in knowing little about it and left feeling very happy for the experience.

There are clearly holes in what he's teaching his kids. But, I connect with the main point of their message. I see that our world is not right. It is missing so much. But the inspirational part is that these people seem to have the will to do the work necessary to try to live better, something I don't have.
The work of raising his kids under these conditions especially all alone after losing his wife and the way he connects so deeply with his kids... I'm too old to be a father now, but when I thought about it when I was younger, I feel like the kind of commitment that he demonstrated to try to raise his kids right is what I would have wanted for myself. It's hard to put into words, but that is what brought some tears at a certain part of this movie. To the degree that he succeeded made me feel like he has the best kids in the world.

Viggo Mortensen leads an amazing cast of young actors, that immediately conquer your heart.Mortensen plays an eccentric and gruff man living in the middle of the woods with his children. Children that listen to Bach, hunt and know how to survive in the wild. There is a dark tone present in many scenes. In many occasions the behaviour of this family reminded me of a cult, the strict rules, the rejection of society, the feeling that ""we don't fit in"".Indeed, Mortensen's character lifestyle while nurturing in many ways, starts to fall apart, when he is forced to come back to the world of the living with his family. Each son or daughter have distinct personalities, which at times clash with the world they have lived so far.Captain Fantastic is also sharp in the way it approaches certain themes like religion, education, hell even the obese are not free from criticism. Mortensen is simply a treat for the senses. As usual he brings such an intensity to his performance, that you can't help but feel for him. His happiness, his sadness, his regret.Equally captivating is the young army of children behind him. Add to the recipe the gravitas of Frank Langella and a strong performance by Kathryn Hahn, and you got yourself an amazing cast.Captain Fantastic is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year.

So there was a masochistic part of me which kept me watching. I couldn't really relate to any of the characters and the ""escape from society"" as it is was pictured in a very extreme and negative way. Horrible to watch and in many parts very difficult to believe. So the mother is in hospital for three months with a mental illness and the father decides to leave her there alone, without any help and stay with his six children in the jungle? No contact with her whatsoever?? Their choice to leave society and live in the woods - OK, this was plausible, even if they overdid it. But with the father's daily training and education programme, which seemed over the top and very stressful it became incoherent - you leave today's society so your children have a peaceful life and then you stress the XXXX out of them? Really? The actors did a fine job, but you can't really relate to any of the figures because it is so exaggerated.

Yes, I know that the family portrayed in ""Captain Fantastic"" is MEANT to be weird. It's the whole point. But writer-director takes it to a completely unbeliavable level and sacrifices all possible realism. I would also have less of a problem with the weirdness if most of it wasn't obviously meant to be gags.Embarrasing. Again, I understand some scenes are meant to be embarrasing, but Ross just overdoes it. I had to stop myself from skipping a couple of scenes due to the embarassment (Bo kissing the girl comes to mind).Again, unrealistic. Speaking of Bo and the girl, that scene really was out of nowhere, wasn't it?

There's a scene where the family are having dinner with their cousins, and one of his sister in law's children asks how his wife died. He answers every question he asks honestly. This creates an awkward tention in the room, of colliding philosophies on whether children should be coddled from upsetting truths. While the scene is indeed amusing, it does have a consequence. He realised he crossed a line, as he was their guest, and it was inappropriate to make them feel uncomfortable in their own home. And that is the key to creating evocative stories, there should always be a consequence. And by consequence, I simply mean result('s).Humans are complicated and hypocritical, and I think people underestimate how self aware this movie really is. The children a highly intelligent, yet their social skills are non-existent. Again, consequence. His step father did indeed have an ethical high ground on the social wellbeing of his grandchildren, yet he spat on his daughters memory with a Christian burial despite her instructions in her will.Great movies don't prosaically answer ethical dilemmas with fully resolved endings. It's fine to judge the characters and their pretentiousness, but it doesn't negate a beautifully executed story. I think you'll find the devisive scores in the user review section to be a matter of personal distaste, with little constructive criticism to the actual film making.A movie made for everyone, is a movie made for no one.",Captain Fantastic

395,WithoutPorpoise,Joyfully inspiring,8,4 June 2017,"The trailer kept me wondering what to expect. There are so many movies that start with an original concept, but at some point have just run out of ideas, desperately seeking closure, and, having pulled all situational comedy, just drag out some grinding melodramatic scheme. This movie starts like just one of those. It is beautiful and captivating and comes with a great set of actors. As the family starts off into the 'real world', it pulls off some comedy that you will know if you have seen the trailer. At this point I really wondered how the movie would go on from now - mostly in fearful anticipation that this is said point where many movies go downhill. But it really doesn't. It neither continues as a comedy alone, nor does it turn into any shallow black and white tragedy. It remains entertaining and inspiring and keeps up some good enough narrative tension, and continues to thrive on its excellent actors. I think one should not except from such a movie too much of a theoretical statement on its background setting, the alternative lifestyles, and the many shortcomings of modernity, and of attempted flight from it. It is just a movie, and it does everything right in being primarily entertaining, and achieves to be joyful, positive and casually thought-provoking on the run. And often enough really funny.",Captain Fantastic
396,jaakennuste,Good balance between driving home a message but not tending to radical views,8,21 January 2019,"Rather hooked from start to finish, as from the very first scene you will understand that it is a movie unlike most others. Even a skeptic like me becomes quite attracted to the Utopian dream that the family is living in. Yet the writers made sure to delicately show the very obvious challenges that living in such a society will represent. Perhaps the only bit where I would have wished more variety was when the movie included people from the ""normal society"". If there would have been people from a balanced and well-rounded background that met the protagonist's family, the encounter would have been interesting to watch.Over the course of the movie it arrives at a pleasant conclusion, stating that even the most hard-headed and perhaps radical people can make compromises. And usually it is for the better.",Captain Fantastic

Henry David ThoreauI just happen to be reading Henry David Thoreau's book Walden for a philosophy club. When I saw this trailer I told myself I had to see this before it left my city. The similarity between the book Walden and this film are pretty high. With similar topics of arguments against commercialism and full industrialism. Then throw on top a yearning for spiritual truth and self-reliance. Still, this isn't just a stick your middle finger at the system film. It's way more than that.Matt Ross has an interesting meditation on what it means to live outside society in America. He shows a couple reasons why someone would do this and show the pros and cons in a very interesting way. The views evolve as the story moves on. Such is life eh?Viggo Mortensen acting is amazing in this role. With that said, don't overlook Jack (Frank Langella) acting in the film. For a good portion of the film, we only see the point of view from the family and mostly Ben (Viggo Mortensen) at that. But later in the film, you see Jack's motives too. I can see why he acted the way he did and I may have done this same if I was in his spot too.Bo (George MacKay) gets a couple good scenes too. It's great to see him fumble through interactions throughout the film and to discover what he wants out of adult life. This may or may not conflict with what his dad wants.I highly recommend this film and can't wait to see what Matt Ross does in the future. If this film comes to your town do yourself a favour and see it. Clever films are rare and need to be supported.",Captain Fantastic

399,twistedgiraff3,Full of itself and full of plotholes,2,7 March 2021,"This movie has some redeeming qualities but for me it's watchability is completely destroyed by the constant plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the film. For example, the kids have lived in an isolated forest their entire lives yet the youngest son wants to know why they don't celebrate Christmas like the other kids. Why would you ever care about that if all you've ever known is your own special family holidays? The kids are reading Dostoyevsky and Trotsky and other extremely difficult books yet they've had no formal education and are only ages like 11-17. They claim to despise Christians yet when a police officer pulls them over the elder son somehow knows prayer and breaks out into a Christian song, I'm not sure how they would know that.There's so many more little things like this that constantly ruined my suspension of disbelief and peeved me. Maybe others aren't bothered by these flaws, but they seem so fixable to me. So many of the issues could have been avoided by minor dialogue changes, but somehow they didn't care or were missed.",Captain Fantastic

407,fascintinglady,"""Captain Fantastic"" is well FANTASTIC!",9,8 August 2016,"In only his second foray into directing, Matt Ross has created an award-winning film that is catching the public's interest across the country, and which I highly recommend. While loosely based on his own upbringing, he has managed to shine a light on the struggles faced by individuals who attempt to live according to their own values and beliefs which differ from society's norm.The plot revolves around a father, Ben Cash played by Viggo Mortensen, who's lost his wife and his battle to have the family attend her funeral and carry out her final wishes, which differ from her family's. Mr. Mortensen's performance is stellar, as usual. He states that this was one of his favorite roles and it shows. You can really identify with his existential crisis, when he's forced to find a balance between his former extremism and conventionality. The family appears very bonded and the child actors are well-cast and very accomplished for their ages.Some people thought the movie was too long, I wish it had been longer. I would like to have had more backstory. How did Ben and Leslie meet? What drew them together? How did they come to hold their values and beliefs? What led them to adopt such an extreme lifestyle? What part did mental illness play in their relationship? Those are all questions I would have liked to have answered by the movie. Any chance of a prequel Mr. Ross?",Captain Fantastic

409,Manwe3019,My personal favorite of the year,10,11 February 2017,"I'd say it's only minor spoilers, but I'll be careful and tag it.Being a sucker for movies that end on...let's say at least a good note, this was one of the most satisfying movies of the year, a real feel-good show. There were many other high-rated movies (that I'm not going to spoil here) this year that I ultimately enjoyed less because of their endings while still really appreciating them otherwise. Biased opinion, but I claim nothing else. Viggo Mortensen is probably my favorite actor due to many amazing performances and movies. It was clear he would choose his next movie very carefully after, as usual, turning down roles for several blockbusters in the last couple years. It took him long enough to find something that he felt like doing and his choice was great. Imagine him being wasted in something like Avengers when he can work on gems like these. I'm glad he got recognized once more with an Academy Award nomination among several other ones.The movie itself is something really rare in the way it casually ridicules certain aspects of our lives and it absolutely hits the right spot in most of the chosen occasions. The church scene was probably my favorite scene of the year. A family that couldn't be much more oddly looking comes into a church to participate in the funeral ceremony of their wife and mother and is stared at by everyone else...dressed in black and white, with their bibles in hand, singing religious songs...and in this moment the question rises WHO exactly the weird ones in this situation are. That kind of scenario, which is depicted in several other scenes throughout, is the most intriguing thing in the movie for me. What the movie does not want to do is trying to convince people that everything the father does is right and should be followed like some people in the comment section seem to think. This is made pretty damn obvious in certain scenes like the one in the supermarket, which not everyone gets, but not everyone will perceive the church scene the same way I did either...sadly. If you're none of those people though, there's a good chance you'll really appreciate this very creative piece.",Captain Fantastic

There is this father who treats his children differently and tries to lead their lives the way he believed it actually should be. the father is a rebellious man who do not wish to follow the same norms and traditions we all have been following rather he wants to use his own instinct to judge between things and to set the meanings of right and wrong by himself. He wants his children to learn by their own observation and no to get involved in the materialistic lives. Talking about the story line, The plots are in great sequence everything happens when its the exact right time for it. The opening sequence is too good , it looks a bit violent but it has a meaning, the opening sequence tells you about the family. The cinematography is good, frames are well chosen.

415,yevgenavich,Most Unique film of the year.,9,13 October 2016,"The reason I enjoyed this film so much is because it forces you to actually take a perspective away from the ""normal"" life of an industrialized country. Albeit, it is not 100% so since they do have technology such as a bus and so on. This brings in a mix but still lives mostly off of natural items, rather than technological. Playing outside and getting hurt used to be a normal thing, but nowadays everyone is protected, and this shows opinions of both sides, as well as their logic. I don't want to spoil anything and the reason for 9 stars instead of 10 is because I felt like something was left out. As a philosophy major I felt as though they could have expanded more on some topics but the films wittiness does it justice. In order to appreciate this movie, people need to try and understand the characters.

It's the beginning of a crazy adventure with many plot twists and moving moments.In my opinion, it's a very good film because it criticises capitalism and the consumer society where we live in the XXI century. We discover that school isn't the only way to develop his knowledge and the importance of the ability and the physical condition in the daily life. But the producer successed to take part in the other point of view : it seems difficult to be totally out of the society of today and be only with his family doesn't prepare well people to have a social life, and it's an important point. School seems finally essential to develop his social life. It make us reflect about what is the best middle ground.

This is exciting to discover how some people live and how hard can be the transition from a ""savage life"" to the ""basic life"" of american people. But there are also bad aspects, some parts are quite boring, but in the globality it's a good movie",Captain Fantastic

The father have 6 child and at the mother's death they have to confront them to the life out of the forest with their cousins, grandfather... Ben and his children want to respect the last will and testament of their mother and wife. So they take a camping-car and ""rescue"" Leslie to burn her and put her ash in a toilet.
This is a dramatic comedy which give a lesson about our life. We can see that the father gives a good and healthy education to his children, he teaches them to respect and to survive in the forest with hunt... Like that all the children are very intelligent even the girl who is 6 and who knows better the amendment than her olders cousins.
The parents teach them that the society is bad, they got ""missions"" like steal in the market to fight against the capitalism for example.
But at the end the father understands that this life is not ideal when his girl has a serious accident so they choose to live more like the others and the children go to school but they don't abandon their life.

But childrens are trong, physically first, and have great knowledge.The advantage of this film is that it shows ideals, certainly different from those of society, but interesting to understand for open-mindedness.

454,siliashchuk,Consumer-friendly anti-consumerism,7,17 May 2020,"Consumer-friendly anti-consumerismI'll start off by identifying my biggest issue with this movie, that influenced the final score the most. ""Captain Fantastic"" plays some of it's themes too safe - and to a great detriment. While the emotionally driven tale of a father going all in on manifesting his ideals through his own children while caring for them as deeply as a parent could is truly inspirational and did brought a tear to my eye, the canvas it is painted on - mainly the idea of a family structured like a hippyish commune - falls short for me. I do like the concept, but the execution is really surface-level and feels like a pseudo-intellectual facade rather than a genuine, thought-out message. Far-left-leaning, self-sustained, somewhat anarchistic and deeply spiritual nature of Ben's ideology is displayed mostly through cliches, such as: ""McDonald's is bad"", ""Wealth over needs is a waste"", ""Best present for a 4-year-old is a tactical knife"" (that's a spicy one) and so on. When the movie actually goes somewhere questionable (like the toilet or the grocery store scenes) it makes sure to soften edges with good ol' family laugh. It is most recognizable in how Chomsky is brought up what feels like 20 times in 2 hours without once giving any real substance to the reference. Again, I really like the idea, but at the same time I'm almost sure that this approach will end up in a quick Google search and skimming an eye along the first sentence of Noam's wikipedia page, followed by closing the tab - all without pausing the movie. When you present characters that are in conflict with the world because of their ideas, said ideas should be explored and questioned - by the characters themselves or the viewers. Salinger, for example, does an excellent job at both with something like ""Franny and Zooey"". Captain Fantastic does too little of either.What it explores well and plenty, albeit predictably, is internal conflict, even hinting at some unsettling signs of ones to come. Needless to say, Viggo Mortensen and George MacKay do a great job at bringing to life interesting (forbidden word!), emotional and relatable stories prepared for their characters, and the portrayal of painful childish rebellion is executed nicely in Rellian. But it was also intriguing to see how Vespyr expresses too much devotion to the father figure, probably unable to act on her own, or how little Zaja is almost antisocial in her cold intelligence - foreshadowing of future struggles, surely.The story is done in a really basic fashion, with some abrupt pacing near the end of the runtime and loose ends, but it's actually structured quite well and doesn't feel like something heavily emphasized on anyway.I didn't really find the soundtrack attention grabbing, but it was amusing and fits it's place right. The one thing I certainly wished to be more expressive is the cinematography: most of the camerawork seemed really bland and primitive to me, with only a few scenes standing out as something interesting in that department.Overall, the movie was quite an enjoyable experience, but it lacked courage to actually challenge the viewer with it's provocative themes, while also being somewhat short on artistic expression in the most important movie aspect - cinematography. It belongs near that pile of light-hearted emotional Christmas movies you would watch with your family or close ones on a holiday, but it does not deliver anything else to be recognised for.",Captain Fantastic

461,jkwaldman,vomit inducing,1,21 August 2016,This is my first review i have done on IMDb and its because i had the misfortune to see captain fantastic at a preview screening in the uk this morning.I probably see about 200 to 300 films a year and don't think i have ever felt so angry and sick about a film such as this.Some people walked out but i just kept watching to see if it could introduce more and more ideals of living this lifestyle. As has been previously mentioned how was it OK to steal food from a supermarket using the kids.In England we call that shoplifting and you are arrested and then go to court and usually have to do community payback of some kind.So much in this film is smugly aimed at how much better a lifestyle Ben had for his kids.Well Ben its not real life as much as you think it is.Who pays for your over the top gas guzzler of a coach?Where do the books come from to teach the kids blah blah blah,Captain Fantastic
462,bardant-jean-xavier,"Your standard feel-good movie, hippie flavoured",4,12 November 2016,"I found this film extremely shallow, and in complete contradiction with its apparent message.The father insists that one has to be able to think for himself, but the film shows no nuance: You have the clever hippies on one side, and the silly fat Christian capitalists on the other.The film denounces capitalist comfort, but there is not the slightest hint that this life could be uncomfortable. They all live in a constant summer, they sleep in a huge tent that looks like the Hilton, they travel in a cozy bus. Who wouldn't accept to exchange his tiny flat in a rainy for this kind of lack of comfort?The film preaches respect for nature but the parents made six children (ever heard about overpopulation?), travel in a bus (bicycle anybody?) and the first scene shows a deer's throat being cut (no tofu?). Those people look more like survivalists than environmentalists to me.The film could have taught you that it takes all kind of people to make a world, and that one doesn't have to be superman to find happiness down here, but no. One has to understand everything about politics (expect the millions killed because of Mao's madness), speak six languages, be an expert on quantum physics, be able to enter Harvard, play guitar like a pro, run and climb like Rambo, when you're 8 years old. So American.Finally there is nothing more than the average feel-good movie here, the Noam Chomsky thing being just a flavour put on the top of it to customize an otherwise perfectly standard Hollywood product, like you have onion-flavoured Doritos or bacon flavoured ones. Denouncing capitalism? Come on, let's be serious.On the same subject, one should rather watch Cédric Kahn's ""La vie sauvage"".",Captain Fantastic

It contains a great story, has emotional impact, and characters are cared for and have defined arcs. Clash of philosophies and lifestyles. Each with their pros and cons. It provokes thoughts about society in general and in what way do we construct our modern societies and raise our children. Viggo Mortensen's character is a social outcast, but his way of looking at life and relationships can teach us a lot about ourselves and our species. What do we give up in order to have this conformed life? Is the price too high?

465,jjreit,A first class movie about an 'out of the box' family,10,9 October 2016,"I was extremely impressed by the acting of the whole family Cash. For me this is the first movie bouncing The Shawshank Redemption of my all time favorite list.This movie is about a father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his 6 children (aged 7 - 17) growing up in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. Ben is hard but just to them and has quite an extreme daily schedule for his kids. He educates them himself, not only basic knowledge but even far beyond that: Hunting, Survival, Physical training, Philosophy, Foreign Languages, Politics etc. But maybe most important he does not lie to them and gives 'grown-up' answers to all their questions which leads to some hilarious scenes.But I don't think this is where the movie is about (you could start a discussion on how they can learn so much when you probably need most of your daylight time to survive and that he goes to far).In my opinion this movie shows how important it is how you grew up as a kid and the hardship parents have to go through if they decide to raise their children in a different way (I'm not saying it not hard to raise kids in a 'normal' way, it is more about the probably unwanted advice and critic you get from other people). And later on that the children have to be able to cope with this if they go to the 'normal' world themselves. It also shows how most people want to 'help' others who are not like them by telling them what they should do. But they are forgetting that it is not always their way that is the best. It gives you a good look at our society which is maybe not always that great. Yes there are some minor things in the plot which don't stroke with Ben his philosophy I would say but ow the acting and filming make more than up for it!

It is thought provoking and shows all different aspects of family life. There is a small short scene of male frontal nudity but other then that it is fine.

474,was18106,Real Human in their Natural Habitat,10,6 January 2017,"I saw this movie on New Year weekend and was totally mesmerized by its conceptual beauty. This movie has an epic beginning which starts from a family living off in total wilderness on their own. They start off from hunting game for food, kids learning how to defend themselves in knife fight, Rock Climbing as a physical activity and all the jungle survival stuff. One of the thing which kept me mesmerized throughout this movie was the complete education which the dad was providing these kids, he was teaching them how to hunt, how to rock climb and then at the end of day he is teaching his kids on topics ranging from Quantum Entanglement to Literature and at last when all the daily chores are over they gather for a music session which start off from the dad bringing his guitar and strumming some classical notes to every kid bringing their instruments one by one finally converging to a soulful family music session. All the members of the family no matter how small in age have complete freedom to have their own opinions and thoughts as long as they can explain their perspective. It was beautiful to watch 8 year old kids explaining away recently passed US government bills and having their own point of view on its ramifications on economy .This guys philosophy on kids is to not feed them the usual bullshit but instead making them familiar with the plain truth whether it is about drugs , sex , death or mental illness. This guy does not want to keep his kids in a wonderland through misinformation. This movie makes you question the reality of things around you, especially the schools and colleges and showcases the importance of all round development of an individual as a human being which makes them ready to face the real world . I felt like one of the major cause of dysfunction in all of us stems from the detachment that all of us have from the reality since childhood because of over- protective parent or the general view of people to make kids focus more on fairy tales instead of real things . I mean why can't we treat them like grownups and answer their curiosity with the raw truth. That is why when most of us grow old and see the real world around we feel mostly confused, helpless and unable to cope up with the reality of things. This movie shook some of my internal concept from the ground up and made me re-think on my views on how we should live and what constitutes good parenting.

Using the art-house concept of creating the anti-(current)society atmosphere is used in this film to show that our society isn't that bad.The movie shows the tension between the western capitalist society and the more uncivilized alternative ways of living. Creating the perfect, let's call it the hippie, lifestyle where catching your own food is a necessity. On the other hand the movie shows us the grandparent's capitalist lifestyle, where money plays no role.When these lifestyles collide in the movie, Viggo (Mortensen, red) finds out his self-educated kids don't adapt in the 'real' world. Bad things happen, realization kicks in and they find a in-between solution by starting to live a more 'normal' countryside lifestyle. Kid's start taking the school bus, hippie Viggo shaves his beard.Cherry on the cake is the end scene, where the kids and their father sit around the table (still without the perks of current society, reading books instead of Xbox) without talking to each other. Whether it's a book or an Ipad, our current society isn't as messed up as people say it is. Criticism on the current way of technology innovation, leading to lesser social interaction than our ancestors had, gets downplayed (some hears capitalism?).For me this was the message that Ross tried to tell us. And it's not bad. The movie is good, but the underlying message (in my opinion) is the same as any other Hollywood movie. Also some loose ends, half of the kids changing their opinion of living with Viggo within one scene, makes the movie not as engaging as it could be.I would not advice you not to watch this movie. I think there are some good scenes and acting involved; honesty, Viggo admitting his (or their) decisions not turning out the way he thought to be as the best one. Viggo does a good job acting but to make this film an 8+, the story line should be more engaging and dramatic. This is a good movie, but because of it's wannabe art-house edge it annoys me a little bit.Watch it but don't get your hopes up too much; it does end the way you think it would.",Captain Fantastic

481,TheStig370,Viggo Mortensen shines (as always) in family dramedy,10,13 November 2016,"Captain Fantastic is a movie I've been wanting to wanting to watch for a while for a number of reasons. For one, one of my favourite actors, Aragorn himself, Viggo Mortensen is in it and it's been getting some incredible buzz. But sometimes buzz can be wrong. So Captain Fantastic follows a family who lives secluded in the forest in the middle of nowhere. Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, a father of six who wants nothing but for his kids to be intelligent, skilled and intellectually independent as well as being physically strong and healthy. The family must venture outside the woods to attend an event, which shows Ben that he might not have taught his children everything essential survive in the world. Captain Fantastic is a movie that seems to have flown under quite literally everyone's radar, which is a goddamn shame because Captain Fantastic with all the praise it's been getting deserves every single bit of praise its received because Captain Fantastic is quite the ride! I absolutely love the writing to Captain Fantastic. It was an intriguing look into the lives of an alternative American family, and an even more intriguing look into how people separate from society, even despising the idea of capitalism, reacts to a world full of shameless advertising, branding, sugary, unnatural foods and so on. Writer and director Matt Ross, whose only directing and writing credit previously is a film called 28 Hotel Rooms, he is an outstanding writer. The film is undeniably charming with plenty of witty and intelligent dialogue as well as packing a lot of heart. It's quite amusing seeing kids unaccustomed to the likes of video games and brands such as Adidas being exposed to such ideals and thankfully, Ross doesn't exploit this aspect, rather he embraces it and doesn't beat us over the head with the fact that these kids don't have a clue of what any of these things are. And if anything, after being introduced to all the characters and getting to know them, the outside world seems much more unusual than Ben and his family, which was an aspect of the film that caught me off guard and all the more intrigued me. The performances were absolutely excellent, which of course I expected Viggo Mortensen to be great, but wow were the children ever great and further proves that child actors are better than ever, thank god. Viggo Mortensen is easily the standout member of the cast here as Ben. He doesn't star in a lot of movies but when he does, boy, you better expect him to act his ass off because he is as good as always; his performance here is way up there with LOTR and A History of Violence. I also loved the supporting cast, including George MacKay, Frank Langella, Nicholas Hamilton, Steve Zahn, Katherine Hahn... The list of perfect to near perfect performances goes on. The film is full to the brim with talented actors. Overall, Captain Fantastic is absolutely outstanding. It succeeds due to its incredible performances, writing, directing and a heartfelt albeit unusual story. It is without a doubt one of my favourites, if not, my favourite of 2016 so far. Also, it has a rendition of Sweet Child O'Mine that damn near reduced me to tears, and I don't even bloody like Guns 'n' Roses!! Do yourself a favour and have a look at Captain Fantastic.",Captain Fantastic

485,carlosfernandes1999,"Wonderful cinematography, relevant subjects, and great performances. What else?",9,18 February 2017,"Perhaps questionable parenting choices are central to this remarkable piece of cinematography, but there is a lot more to read between the lines. Viggo Mortensen plays Ben, a wholeheartedly dedicated father of six children, raising them in the wild, whilst paradoxically providing them with extensive knowledge on subjects such as philosophy, politics, or physics - possibly achieving a close to perfect balance between a sane mind and a strong body.The drama materializes as Ben's wife commits suicide, thereof surfacing the profound divergences between her parents and Ben's way of life (primeval at first sight, but distinctly intricate, focused on a deep respect for both nature and a free human spirit). ""We created paradise"", says Ben once, referring to the haven he and his wife had created for their children, set in the dazzling forests of the Pacific Northwest - also beautifully captured on camera, for our cinematic pleasure.I was amazed at the way Matt Ross, the director, brought to the screen such an authentic family (very well casted) in quite an unusual fix, living in a somewhat parallel world apart from most of the societal norms.On the one side, there are Ben's kids, educated in a fully disclosed and frank fashion, to be critical and secular people, respecting and cherishing what nature gives them. On the other side, revealing a typical American family (I'd guess, not being American), Matt captures the dynamic of Ben's sister household, where children are depicted as somewhat ignorant, rude, and essentially unconcerned with anything beyond their video games. The ""normal"" parents are overprotective, trying to hide the true nature of pretty much anything considered inappropriate (however adequate the violent content of video games is). The hypocrisy is flagrant.Thus, it is, for me, precisely in that contradiction that lies the crux of the matter on this film: how much good are we doing, as (perhaps well-intentioned) educators, by covering everything up around deceitful concepts, so as to supposedly protect children from everything? At the same time, how come are we entitled to force our beliefs, traditions and social behaviour on our descendants?Ben's dead wife, a former Buddhist, was put through a Christian funeral and burial by her parents (which a relentless, narrow-minded father really insisted on), in spite of having left an explicit request to be cremated. How often does this happen in real life? Too often, I believe.Despite the deeper subjects, there's room for moments of hilarious satire, that provide the film with an interesting balance between joy and reflection.I felt like overall, the performances were splendid: the older son, Bo (played by George MacKay), vividly captured an interesting balance between gullibility and brightness; the other brothers and sisters skilfully assembled a very compelling family, for which you truly cared throughout the whole film; and Mortensen, finally, did his part brilliantly, conveying a wide range of emotions with such an on-screen ease that you rarely see. Regardless of getting the Oscar this year, his performance was unforgettable.To sum up, ""Captain Fantastic"" is definitely worth watching, especially because of how it inspires you to find the (lost) connection with Nature, and leave the petty unnecessary stuff behind. It's surely a reminder of how disconnected from the fundamentals of life we've become. The good thing is: it offers you an alternative.",Captain Fantastic

Instead of raving about some great movie I'd seen, I'm instead warning you off this flick. The opening scene where the family participates in the hunt for wild game as food (complete with mud cammo to hide their faces and depress their scent) came off way too much like Lord of the Flies. The killing of the deer was very graphic and eating the bloody, raw liver as some pagan spiritual ritual between hunter and deer was a real turn off. It went downhill from there.I could spend several more paragraphs describing all the things about the film that I really disliked, but in reality, I stopped watching about half-way thru and read a good book while my wife finished watching it. I did however look up when Viggo Mortensen was presenting the full frontal Monty for about five seconds. Now we know.In summary: save yourself the rental fee and the two hours watching this could be better spent with a good book.PS - One more thing, Hollywood again chose to paint Christianity as being chock full of brainless shills and nasty people.

493,liz-205-890601,Captain Fantastic: When Worlds Collide,9,23 August 2016,"Ben Cash and his six children live in a world beyond time, beyond modernity, beyond common American ideals.In the extended opening shot, we soar leisurely above towering evergreens. This lush green landscape is unmarked by man: the kind of place Sierra Club members dream of hiking.We sail lower, settling on an intimate closeup of a deer munching leaves. The idyllic scene is shattered when a knife-wielding killer leaps upon the deer, subdues the panicked animal and swiftly slashes its throat.The killer, we now see, is a young man smeared with mud like a third-world tribesman, panting beside the bloody tableau. Out of the woods, six other mud-smeared humans of various sizes emerge and circle the deer-slayer and the deer. The elder male administers a kind of communion commemorating the death of this boy and the birth of the man he has become. In lieu of a communion wafer, he offers the young man with the deer's liver to eat.Thus we are introduced to the Cash clan and their world. This first major motion picture from actor-writer-director Matt Ross stakes out fresh story-telling territory and has won early praise that may foreshadow future Oscars.Ben Cash, the father (Viggo Mortensen, in a thoughtful, restrained performance) teaches a home-schooling curriculum like no other, based on ""healthy mind, healthy body"" and administered with a healthy dose of survivalist knowledge and anti-consumerism.The children's day consists of reading and study time, balanced by a rigorous physical fitness regime that includes climbing, fighting, running and strength training.He tutors his unplugged brood with books and dialogue, requiring them to not simply read and recite, but to comprehend and communicate their own thoughts about the books he assigns them, largely from the literature of left-wing thought.Every opinion is on the table for discourse and communal votes. So, although Ben Cash is father and mentor, he is no dictator. He is developing ""philosopher kings,"" not subjects.The clan hunt and gather what they eat. For money, they make wooden bird houses and other products. They sew their own clothes from animal skins. They have no cell phones or TVs. They exercise by climbing, fighting, running and doing strength training. Consumption is bad, self-reliance is good.Ben tells the truth. Eight-year-old Nai (Charlie Shotwell) asks what sexual intercourse is, and Ben answers with a mechanistic explanation that leaves Nai wondering why a man would want to do that. Ben explains that it is pleasurable and creates babies. Later, on the family-created holiday, Noam Chomsky Day, Ben gives Nai a copy of ""The Joy of Sex"" as a little joke. The real gift is a super-cool 7"" hunting knife.The children are all thrilled to receive serious knives, fit for serious survival. But it becomes increasingly obvious that survival in the larger world requires more than woodsman skills.If only the family could live in the woods forever. But these young philosopher kings are bound to encounter modern culture in all its garish superficiality. Eighteen-year-old Bodevan (George MacKay), the eldest, wishes to attend a good college. How will that work, he wonders, when all he knows is from books, and none from living in the modern world? MacKay's performance perfectly captures the both the manly confidence of the survivalist woodsman and the timorous uncertainty of a stranger in a world he simply can't comprehend.The Cashes are driven into modern-day America by the suicide of Leslie (in flashbacks, Trin Miller), the children's mother. Finally receiving treatment in a facility for long-term bipolar disorder, she was unable to fight her mental illness any longer. The arrangements for a Christian funeral by her rich father, Jack, played with smooth stolidness by Frank Langella, enrage Ben, since his Buddhist wife had specifically requested a cremation and toilet-flushing of her ashes in her Last Will and Testament.Stubbornly, Ben devises a plan to steal her body and carry out Leslie's final wishes. So the family sets out for civilization aboard Steve, their adapted school bus, to carry out the corpse kidnapping plan. On the way, in a travel trailer campsite, Bodevan has a squirmy humorous encounter with an average American girl which ends in humiliation and shame, and he blows up at Ben.A dinner at the home of Leslie's sister, Harper (Kathryn Hahn), flares into a screaming attack on Ben after he tells her two boys the stark truth: Their aunt didn't ""die from her disease,"" she killed herself. When Harper angrily challenges Ben's tutorial methods, Ben administers a pop quiz on the Bill of Rights to her two sluggish, Xbox-addicted preteen boys, then to a much younger Cash child. The Cash kid leaves the young louts in the intellectual dust. Point made.The struggle of wills between husband and father over Leslie's funeral ratchets up when a couple of the children are injured in physical challenges, and Jack threatens to take the children away from Ben. The injuries, and Leslie's suicide, raise Ben's doubts as to whether he had done the right thing after all by bringing the family to the wilderness. The corpse-stealing plan turns out to be ill-advised, pitting him against an equally stubborn man with far greater resources. Not to give the rest of the story away, I'll just say that in the end, the resilience of the Cash clan prevails.The questions this film raises are not deep, but at a time when many question the capitalistic foundation upon which America is built, it is intriguing to see what plays out when that foundation is seriously questioned, and none of the answers are definitive.In ""Captain Fantastic,"" a family lives either an idyllic life or a dangerous fantasy. Perhaps both. This film gives you food for thought, as well as entertainment for an afternoon, and it is a most satisfying meal.",Captain Fantastic
494,martin-233-431474,The utter lack of self-awareness makes it almost funny. Almost.,1,13 October 2016,"So here we are. In 2016 a supposedly sympathetic character in a major motion picture proudly says 'I am a Maoist' without any trace of irony or doubt.I don't want to dwell on the acting, camera and other cinematic stuff. The cast are your usual fare of beautiful Hollywood people, camera and direction are not jarringly obvious, so they must be O.K. too. The only problem this movie has, is the atrocious script.The premise of the movie is a family living in a kind of Thoreau-esque paradise of unity of Man and Nature, hunting (and presumably gathering, we are not shown this explicitly) and not having to interact with the nasty, philistine and obese Christians inhabiting the rest of the country.The most jarring thing about the movie it its total lack of self-awareness. The protagonists ride through the whole thing on their high horses without a single character pointing out the obvious flaws in their reasoning:The basic tenor of the plot is the superiority of the enlightened individualism to the organized religion (Christianity specifically, the other monotheist religions are beyond pale, of course). However, the family unit that is the central protagonist of the movie resembles a sect tightly controlled by its charismatic leader more than any mainstream Christian church does.In the important scene in the movie, the Father of the family demonstrates the superiority of his education by having his small child giving a discourse on the Bill of Rights and Citizens United verdict. The 'normal' people are dutifully dumbfounded and ashamed of themselves. However, it's safe guess that the children in the family have no clue who's princess Lea, what's Facebook {or any computer technology for that matter), they also lack basic social skills. You can judge for yourself what kind of knowledge is useful IRL.The happy family celebrate a Noam Chomsky day after successful grocery store heist. You can think what you want about Mr. Chomsky's policies, but extreme individualism is hardly something that he would endorse.The proud Father snarkily comments that the 'Business of America is business' to demonstrate the soulless nature of capitalistic society. However, this is a quote from Calvin Coolidge, one of the presidents with actual survival skills.Extreme individualism and survival skills is something the proud Father boasts about to his weakling sister-in-law. However, hunting and gathering can support about 1 person per square mile. So if USA should revert to this way of living, about 98% of the population would have to be eliminated.And finally and most importantly, even their small family is totally dependent on the broader society. They don't have blast furnaces to produce steel to create their nice hunting knifes. Practical outdoor clothing they wear was probably manufactured in China, using technologies and materials that were not available not even fifty years ago. When one of the children is injured, they rush him to modern hospital to take advantage of the state-of-the-art medical facilities.So the movie's most pervasive feature is its monumental hypocrisy. Yeah, let the other people live their meaningless petty lives in the thrall of multinational corporations and subjugated by organized religion. We shall take the fruits of your labors, laugh at your travails and feel smugly superior about ourselves.",Captain Fantastic
495,veloskiw,Nuanced commentary on modern society,10,15 June 2016,"Set against the beautiful Pacific Northwest backdrop, Captain Fantastic is easily one of the most nuanced films to come to mainstream cinema in the last few years. It's main plot addresses the struggle when everyone has the best intentions but not the same values. Additionally, the film makes honest and straightforward comments on controversial issues in today's society that are often taboo in the media such as mental illness, the hypocrisy of children's exposure to violence and sex, religion, and the flaws in the American education system. This sounds heavy and uncomfortable but these issues are paralleled in such a way that parts of the film had us in tears; from laughing so hard. Director Matt Ross says the project started as an exaggerated exploration of the difficult choices that must be made in regards to raising children in today's society. I think the film goes a step further and awakens an internal dialogue in each of it's viewers about the way that we live our own lives based on societal influences. Furthermore, the performances given by the perfectly arranged cast enhance your investment in the story in a way that will cause you to question what right and wrong really are when you're only trying to do your best and do what you think is best for those that you love.",Captain Fantastic
496,swyattyoung,Longing for Eden,9,24 July 2016,"Captain Fantastic begins in a paradise based on Plato's Republic. Ben and Leslie, attempting to escape from Leslie's mental illness, have retreated into the wilderness of the Northwestern United States, where they and their children live isolated from the rest of the world—isolated from greed, ambition, and deceit, from all that is broken in the world. There, in the Eden they've created, they live out what they think it means to be truly free, giving their children an intense physical and intellectual education and teaching them to live off the land.But Leslie's illness isn't cured by paradise, and while in a hospital being treated for the only brokenness she and Ben could not escape, Leslie commits suicide. Leslie's father forbids Ben from attending the funeral, but Ben is quickly reminded by his daughter Zaja of the highest ideal in their Eden: human freedom.Together, he and his children venture back into the world from which he and Leslie escaped, and in the clash that ensues between Ben and Leslie's (extremely wealthy) family, Ben questions both his ability to parent and the education that he's been providing his children in the wilderness. Ben even comes to question the wife he thought he knew when he learns that she helped their oldest son Bodevan apply to elite colleges like Harvard and Stanford.Devastated by the loss of the Eden he thought he had, Ben agrees to leave his children in the custody of Leslie's parents and goes his separate way. But when he discovers his children have hidden away on his bus, holding fast to the education their father had given them, the vigor returns, and together, they dig up Leslie's body to give her the burial she always wanted.The movie ends not with an escape back to Eden, but with a newfound acceptance of the inescapable brokenness in our world. Immediately following their ""burial"" of Leslie, Ben and his children bid Bodevan farewell as he heads off to college. In the end, Ben returns his family to the broken world from which he and Leslie had tried so futilely to escape. They no longer live in the wilderness, but a rural suburb, where they still grow their own food and survive off the land, but are educated in the public school system.As a theology student at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, I interpret this film with a uniquely Christian perspective. In it, I find God's voice. I hear the Divine awakening of the desire in our hearts for the Eden we lost so long ago, for a world freed from greed, corruption, deceit, and illness. But I also hear a stern criticism of the Church for not speaking out against (and even joining) the greed, corruption, and deceit that plagues our world and our politics. Christians who claim to have been transformed by the good news that Christ brought seem to live no differently than the rest of the world. They've lost a sense of the in-breaking Kingdom of God, the very essence of which is to redeem our world from the brokenness that Ben and Leslie so futilely sought to escape. Rather than hearing in the voices of people like Ben and Leslie the longing for what Christianity promises and joining them in their efforts, like Leslie's father we have dismissed their ideas as ""far too liberal"" or ""out of touch with the real world."" We have sold out to the brokenness of our world, and in doing so, have forsaken the very Kingdom we claim to preach.",Captain Fantastic

Opening with a hunting scene that mashes together ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" the movie at first seems like a kind of liberal survivalist fantasy, a story of a family of free spirits of apparently Nordic extraction gone militantly native somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. But the mom is absent--getting treated for depression in a far-off place--and the dad seems dangerously strict, making everyone go for long bouts of running and calisthenics, and quizzing his children by firelight on the individualized, college-level curricula he has assigned each of them. The oldest child is college-age, and, it turns out, has gotten accepted to all of the Ivies, knowledge he discovers and then hides from his father while accompanying him on a supply run to town. The father too acquires a secret on this same supply run: he learns by phone that his wife, staying with her parents in New Mexico, has killed herself by cutting her wrists. She did this the night before, while the family was improvising a raucous folk-instrument jam around the fire, initiated somewhat aggressively by the black-sheep middle son, a short-haired 'tween who simmers with tension. It is this boy who, when the father breaks the news to the family in their yurt, lashes out angrily while the others wail in sorrow. He is angry at both his mother, for leaving them, and at his father, for somehow causing her to. The audience can sympathize with his rage, because we know the father is more than just a little strict--he is a criminal, apparently, since his father in law threatens to have him arrested if he shows his face at the funeral. Is he a draft dodger? A spousal abuser? Did he make terroristic threats to the government? We never find out, but we do learn the children are slightly imperiled by his zeal to turn them into physical as well as intellectual warriors: they are all covered in bruises and scratches from their forced exertions, and further tragedy seems imminent. The kids want to crash the funeral and handle their mother's interment as she specified in her will (cremation followed by the disposal of her cremains via a flush down a public toilet). Riding back from a training excursion in Steve, the family's converted school bus, they plead with their dad to head to New Mexico where her memorial is to take place. The father first protests, but then agrees, unable to resist an act of rebellion against his father in law. He points the bus down the mountain and towards their fate. There are some moments of humor as they enter the built environment; the children pretend to be zealous home-schooled Christians to repel a policeman who boards the bus; the father fakes a heart attack to create a diversion while the kids steal groceries; the oldest boy makes out with a goth girl at a campsite and proposes to her after their first kiss. Are they in a cult? No, but it seems like it. They celebrate ""Noam Chomsky Day"" spontaneously with their stolen food, gorging on grocery-store cake and singing a special song to a Shepard Fairey-style poster of his image. They are free thinkers, but how free are they if they can't relate to anyone but each other?The family warms up for their big comeuppance at the funeral with a stop off at the father's sister's house, where worlds collide and the children fail to bond with their cousins over violent video games. The father comes on too strong during an argument with his sister and brother and law about about his parenting choices, but then softens when he realizes he is a guest in a world of more-or-less well-meaning people. This softening is what the movie turns out to be about, we discover in the long-awaited climax. But it is not the compromising of ideologies that drives the narrative, but rather of gender roles: the strong-willed man must learn how to take the place of the children's compassionate mother, lest he drive his children away or ""ruin"" their lives, as he himself puts it in a believable moment of emotional reckoning. The fact that the only thing close to a person of color in this film is Frank Langella--playing the hostile father in law ensconced in a gated community-- tells you a lot about its intentions. It isn't social commentary. It's not trying to show us how other people live or think. It doesn't want you to question your politics. No one will feel transported by this movie into someone else's shoes, or brain, or heart. It wants you to think about fathers and mothers and children, and how families make their own worlds and support each other when the wider world intrudes. In this way, the plot and the sentiments evoked are beautifully matched, and the film is emotionally convincing even as it strains credulity with hackneyed details. In the final moments of the film, we see the father bathed in soft morning light, contentedly silent instead of barking orders. He watches his children absorbed in their books around the breakfast table as they wait for the school bus, having just brought in eggs from the chicken coop that's become of Steve, the vehicle that took them out of the murky forest and into a happier life.",Captain Fantastic
500,dgdeepsix,Warped view of right and wrong,2,3 August 2016,"Captain Fantastic was far from it. Hippy father raises six kids, in the forest of course, to conform to his way of thinking. Home-schooled to be anti-business, anti-police, anti-Christian and anti-conservative. I think the prop department must have run out of the standard Che Guevara t-shirts because this nut wore a ""Jesse Jackson '88"" shirt instead. The kids seemed well-schooled in the leftist arts: they were very proficient at robbing a grocery store while the father diverted attention by pretending to have a heart attack. Take that, you capitalist pigs! I suppose there are people who approve of this film's message; I just hope they don't elect the next president!",Captain Fantastic
501,roymartin-65813,Pretentious granola fantasy world flick,6,20 August 2016,"I'm a resident and lover of the Pacific Northwest and pretty far left on the political spectrum, so this should have been a film for me. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's well acted and nicely directed. But I had problems with its heavy handedness and Utopian pretentiousness.Perhaps if I were younger, with a more absolutist worldview, I'd have been able to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy this film without reservation. But it fell flat for me in a number of ways.First, there are too many things that don't add up, from having a magically fueled bus available at all times despite a lack of that terrible capitalist green stuff to a balanced and varied diet supportive of an extreme training regimen even though living as hunters and gatherers without taking the time or energy to cultivate crops. Everyone manages to stay clean and well dressed despite a lack of electricity or running water. The children are educated to be philosopher-scholars, musicians, theoretical physicists, linguists, endurance athletes and survivalists (all at the same time, as if any one of these challenges would not be a full time endeavor reserved for ones of special gifts and talents) while handling every aspect of their fully self-sufficient lives in their idyllic nature preserve. It's never explained how the family manages to purchase a huge tract of old growth forest or manages to squat without consequence on public land. Setting aside all of that, I found the political/philosophical point of view of the film heavy handed to say the least. The father inculcates the children with his westernized quasi-Buddhist spiritual philosophy and Marxist ideals; fine. But the film seems intent on antagonizing everyone who doesn't share such views -- though the themes are softened here and there, I guess in an effort to make it seem more open-minded and, thus, palatable to a broader audience.Personally, though not a Christian, I see no need to belittle and offend those who are. While projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview, with some tips of the cap to broad-mindedness as the father realizes he's been perhaps a tad extreme, the film is actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values. Why, for example, is it a good thing to educate the children on how to steal? I've no issue with a nudist lifestyle and have in fact spent time on nude beaches, so I have an understanding of the ways in which removing clothing can strip away pretensions and leave people open and vulnerable in good ways. At the same time, is inflicting one's nudist philosophy on others a good thing? It's also worth pointing out that among the most extreme of contemporary fundamentalists, Wahabi Muslims have this habit of bulldozing the shrines of Sufi Muslims and erecting public toilets in their place as a means to belittle and humiliate. This film, which tries to embody themes that are open and tolerant, in a very real way commits the same offense as the Muslim extremists of Saudi Arabia with a gratuitous scene set in a public toilet.At the end of the day, for all the messages the film seems to want to carry, it's really a rather thin and hypocritical gruel, blind to the irony of its own intolerance, offering little of lasting value (except a nicely nuanced nutshell review of the Nabikov novel ""Lolita"").I've still given the film six stars because it's well crafted and for its efforts to be thought provoking. Those are laudable goals even if the effort ultimately falls far short.",Captain Fantastic
502,minimalmagic,Absolutely beautiful movie,10,12 October 2016,"This movie will make you go through all kinds of emotions. It's a very special movie, and one that will take you on a journey. Its very rare I give a rating of 10 but this movie definitely deserves it. This is a story about a unique but to me a very special family, which sticks together through thick and thin. The kids are great, and the father plays a very important role. The storyline is beautiful, and it grips you from start to finish.

Only unfortunate because it still pressures an ideology of their own and mocks any other (Capitalism, Religion). The front of a family denying the 'pleasures' of USA society only to turn their back on the morals that are the basis of what allows us 'animals' to co-habitat. I can only hope no intellectual or informed individual will take to heart such hole-y perspective on life.

504,dawsonm-15387,Wonderfully thoughtful and feelgood,8,18 October 2016,Captain Fantastic is a thought provoking story of a family who try and do things differently when all the odds are firmly stacked against them. Viggo Mortensen as Bo is his usual excellent self battling the challenges of raising a big family on his own. The rest of the young cast are similarly excellent with each having different moments in the limelight throughout the film. A few twists and turns are never too upsetting although the movie touches on some dark themes without really delving into anything too disturbing. A really well put together film with some moving movements and some warm comedy to help it along. The story leaves you feeling good about the world without really thinking too hard but is most definitely worth a watch.,Captain Fantastic
505,juliannhaynes,Superb film...must watch.,10,23 October 2016,"Without a doubt, one of the best films I've ever seen. Mortenson was perfect for this role. The embedded commentary on modern society is at the same time obvious but most importantly not overly judgmental. The point is made as truth and nothing more. I love movies that stir my emotions or activate my thinking. This film does both. As a parent I've often imagined raising my kids outside of the societal norm. Watching this movie felt like an the dramatized version of an actual family that tried it. The acting was exceptional, as mentioned before Mortenson nailed the role. After watching, I simply cannot imagine another actor portraying the part. Even the child actors held their own Do yourself a favor and watch. Fantastic film on so many levels.",Captain Fantastic

Speechless. The kids are so smart and their dad raised them so well, no wonder are considered weird by the society, because they are different, unique. I wish man would do so many things for their children, listen do their desires and ideas. But they really don't do it because they are so busy with work and it is easier for them to give the child a mobile phone rather spend time with him.It is an outstanding movie.

507,shelbyshoobee,"Self absorbed, ridiculous",2,5 December 2016,"Ben has his 6 kids in the backwoods of the Northwest, away from civilization for a few years to get them away from ugly American capitalism. Where to even begin on the ridiculous premise, hmmm, lets start with the fact that they are living in some kind or small tent/yurt that is on government owned land, which is illegal. Not that he would care being the radical rebel that he is but surely people have stumbled across the family and the people in the local town know of him and the family. You can't just live in a national or state park or BLM land or everybody would do it! Hell, who doesn't want to live in beautiful, unspoiled land and not have to pay property taxes? How does he expect his kids to have any kind of grown up relationship, get married, learn how to interact with other people? His eldest son Bo has a very embarrassing encounter with a young lady who he fancies in a town on their way to their mother's funeral which showcases his social awkwardness in what is probably the hardest time in a young person's life. They all read sophisticated, high level books on governments, higher math, etc. All are well versed in Marxism, Maoism, the Bill or Rights, the US Constitution and probably several other isms. Bo proudly says ""I am not a Marxist, I am a Maoist."" Not much difference between the two. Both murderous regimes. Guess killing millions of people is better than shopping at a Walmart. They hate capitalism but are proud to be able to spout out the Bill of Rights with no problem as one of the younger children do to the chagrin of the spoiled, mindless, video game playing cousins who they stay with while attending their mother's funeral in what is probably the only redeemable part in the movie. They stop into a diner for lunch on the way in the big family bus and the father insists they leave because there is no ""real"" food on the menu. What is a father to do? Fake a heart attack at the grocery store so the kids can make off with groceries. Groceries full of processed food including a cake which they devour after digging up their mother's body so she could have to have a proper burial, Buddhist style. Yes, they burn her body over an open fire. They can't stand the fact that she is having a Christian service and burial. Several laws have been broken. Real laws. Felonies. And what's a good liberal anti-capitalism movie without some good Christian bashing? Christianity is the only thing they can make fun of and use it to ward off a possible red flag from a curious police officer who pulled them over. Not all organized religion, mind you, just Christianity. So I guess the Old Testament (Judaism)is o.k. but not the New Testament. Sure, it is refreshing to see kids not watching video games, being able to survive in the wild and read sophisticated literature and advanced math principals. But what are they supposed to do with that? It's also refreshing to see a parent not sugar coat things. Ben explains to his sister and her family that his wife died by killing herself and sis is upset because her children apparently have never heard of death, let alone suicide. No safe spaces for this family except, of course, their backwoods home in the wilderness. The ending is lame and half baked. This could have been a good movie if it wasn't so proud of itself and done with some real questions that the middle and elder children would have without thinking that the audience would believe that they would just follow him blindly in every aspect of his rigorous physical and mental demands and the realities of being isolated. The younger son rebels a bit and wants to stay with his grandparents who, thank goodness, aren't made out to be evil and bad even though they are well off. Seems as though the producer and director didn't even watch their own movie before releasing it.",Captain Fantastic

510,mbrumsen,A movie that pretends to do the opposite of what it does,6,2 January 2017,"Captain Fantastic is a beautifully filmed, moving story. But as much as I enjoyed watching it, it left a bad aftertaste. It pretends sympathy for the lifestyle choices of the main character, who brings up his children in the wild, teaching them both survival skills and a critical attitude towards capitalist, consumerist America. However, in the confrontation with this modern and consumerist society, he is in the end forced to admit that it was all a bit of a mistake, and that it was not in the interest of his children to educate them like that. Wherever your ideological sympathies may lie, this film manipulates the viewer badly. The Cash family, in the end, are some kind of caricature in their extremism. So the movie ends up trying to convince the viewer that turning one's back on this society, even though it is far from flawless, is a very bad idea. And this, after having first pretended great sympathy with the Cash family's lifestyle. What makes all of this worse is that it's very easy to take the film at first degree, and only see its insincere criticism of consumerist society. ""A film that really makes you think"", people will coo, without paying much attention to the fact that in the end all this reflection is rejected, thus making it easy for the viewer not to be challenged in their ideas at all. Additionally, what makes it a story badly told is that we do not really get to know the mother at all, apart from her last wishes, and the suggestion that the choice for the wilderness was made in the hope that it would help her recover her mental health. Why, crucially, did she at some point believe that her parents should ""rescue"" her from the wilderness (and her husband), why did she change her mind, and most importantly why was it decided that she ought to be hospitalised? How can this be a story about choices that parents have to confront if the mother's perspective is missing? See this film if you must: it does have beautiful scenery, beautiful and convincing actors, and very comical moments. But prepare to feel manipulated.",Captain Fantastic

I think he should have gotten one for The Road in 2009 already. This movie is similar but very different in pace and atmosphere. Loved the nature shots and how close they all acted as a family.

Criminal waste of a great central premise.,2,29 March 2017,"Wastes a potentially very interesting central premise.Quickly makes caricatures out of most of the characters (those which it doesn't leave underdeveloped or completely neglected, such as the elder sister). The narrative drags along at a snails pace, but worst of all perhaps are the countless scenes and situations which we are presumably supposed to take seriously (?) but which are at face value absurd or implausible , and for which little or no effort seems to have been made to make them believable. Two examples: Grandpa Jack's unexplained mafia-don-like powers of influence over Mommy's funeral proceedings (mommies last will and testament?), and daddy's sending daughter up walls and across rooftops of mansion on suicidal mission to somehow extract brother, against his will, without anyone inside noticing. Are we supposed to take these scenes seriously ? There is little humour throughout the film to signal that we shouldn't. The attempts at what (one assumes) is supposed to be humour generally fail (I think there were two instances of half-laughter during our cinema showing of the movie), and what (again, one assumes) are supposed to be unambiguously 'cutesy' moments just generally come across as creepy. Other scenes have little story or content and seem to just try to fill the void with jarringly loud atmospheric new-age type music. In the end they're all either annoying or largely forgettable.

There is this and then there is rubbish sequel like the 25th film where Scarlet Johansson jumps around without reason or talent instead of playing a sedate middle-aged woman. Honestly, this should be the billion dollar grossing film not Marvel #59. It depicts the horrors of modern society and conformity, the tragedy of the human nation Captain Fantastic shows us that no human life no matter how young should be dictated by the norms and clichés of society, the older generation or conformity and that there is nothing more valuable than freedom. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Ross, magnificently photographed with beautiful images of nature, perfect performances by Mortensen and the in-laws brings the whole tragedy of brainwashing, limiting thought and freedom to the fore, but with a lot of fun and wit to boot.

The two films are not comparable visually and story-wise, but certainly show that deviation from the mainstream and presentation of new ideas is possible without heavy-handed scripts that are not also entertaining. This film is fun to watch. Mortenson always brings a lot of talent to the screen, but it is surprise that a man who showed a lot of talent on screen with Big Love has the same and more behind the camera. Kudos to all involved.

520,bonnie-61822,New Title: Sweet Child O Mine,10,27 August 2017,"Captain Fantastic opens in a scene of apparent ritualistic and unfettered savagery unencumbered by ""civilization."" As Dad teaches his tribe of six children to hunt, climb, and—God forbid—think on high levels, he strives to mold them into a combination of survivalists, rebels, and young Socrates and Platos. Yet all is not well in paradise. Mom is somewhere back in civilization being treated for mental illness. Rebellion is brewing in the ranks as the second son blames his father for his mother's problems. When mom chooses a permanent solution, an odyssey into the ""real"" world brings the family face to face with inane cousins who can barely tolerate setting aside their electronics for some familial interaction, who participate in more acceptable forms of violence via Xbox, and whose schooling—while more socially acceptable in delivery—fails to impress. A loving but misguided grandfather then seeks to take the six siblings away from the only parent they have left, and the children themselves orchestrate their escape back to the only life they've known, however primitive. Throughout the film, parenting, philosophical, and even legal quandaries challenge the viewer's preconceptions about what constitutes a proper upbringing. In the end, one must conclude that no one right way to parent exists. Ultimately, Dad compromises in response to his brood's needs, yet the peaceful, electronics-free ending is testament to the enduring positive influence of their previously ""uncivilized"" lifestyle. Finally, the title ""Captain Fantastic"" focuses attention on the father even though the real story lies in the lives of the children and the forces of authority and chaos that surround them. Thus, ""Sweet Child O Mine"" seems to be a better title, and the Guns n Roses classic features heavily in an emotional, culminating scene late in the movie.",Captain Fantastic

His vast knowledge encompasses outdoor and survival skills, and he abhors capitalism, so his family lives and hunts in the woods (which they own). They kill and prepare all their own food because the rest of the world eats poison and garbage. His children are too smart and special to waste time playing, so they train. Nai, the precocious somewhere from 4-6 year old son, constantly reminds his dad to stay on mission. While climbing a steep rock face, 11ish year old Rellian loses his grip and collides with the rock. Nai, securely tethered and professionally kitted, adorably counsels his older brother to suck it up through the haze of pain brought on by a broken hand. Little scamp.Being this Fantastic (get it?) gives Ben and his kids all the confidence they need, but that doesn't make it any less important for Ben to constantly prove to other just how right he is. The most effective method he uses is direct demonstration. When Ben's 8 year old totally schooled her teenage cousins on the Bill of Rights and a SCOTUS ruling, I'm surprised people didn't appear out of thin air just to clap.Since Ben is always right, he never suffers any serious negative consequences for his actions. When teenage daughter Zephyr falls off a roof trying to free brother Rellian from the evil grandparents, Zephyr *just misses* fatally breaking her neck. The ER doctor who treats Zephyr is SO IMPRESSED by her muscle tone and overall health that he is completely unconcerned with the circumstances of her injury and obviously feels no need to alert the police. The close call shakes Ben to the core. The only logical thing to do is ditch his 6 kids, who have shaped their whole lives and worldview around him, with his in laws. The in laws love the kids and truly want the best for them, so Ben bugs right off, telling his totally not traumatized brood, ""I'll call you in a few days."" Obviously, the kids all hide under the floor of the converted schoolbus they call Steve and show Ben just how much THEY LOVE HIM.They jump back on the bus, dig up their mom's body and take her home for a DIY cremation. Nobody at the graveyard notices a missing tenant, at no point when traveling with the body do they encounter any other humans and they throw mom the best funeral ever. As per her wishes, they flush her ashes down a public toilet. The toilet is in the bathroom of the airport from which oldest son Bodavan is about to head off to Namibia. Bodavan had of course been accepted to Harvard, Dartmouth, Brown and literally every good college ever, but Ben reminded Bo that real knowledge comes from your father, not hundred year old institutions devoted to higher learning. So, Namibia it is.The film ends back on the farm, where Ben has obviously been allowed to keep his five minor children. They are packing their own lunches in paper bags because even though they are dogmatically ecoconscious and abhor waste, the simplicity of the bag fits their anesthetic. He tells the kids that they have to eat up because the school bus will be here soon. Zephyr and Kelrrlrlr exchange looks. The kids are unfazed. I'm pretty sure the school bus is question was Steve.

527,diegovalverde-91072,Where are u wrong with your children?,10,26 June 2018,"I'm not a communist, but I loved Captain Fantastic.
It's important to start this review saying that I'm not a communist, just because the extremals capitalists would say that only communists love this movie. 
Who never was a teenager asking themselves the following: How I will care my children?
It's inevitable to think that we will try to care them keeping away from drugs, premature sex and diseases, trying to educate them in a way that they turn into our friends and confidants.
But it's not easy. While you're trying to explain to them some things about life, they are hearing another thousand things from TV, Internet and other things. It's something like trying to cover the sun with a transparent fabric. 
The movie shows us an alternative of a desperate parent, the isolation. Ben and his wife, Leslie, moved to a forest in a tentative of caring their children away from the capitalist way of life. They live quite well during long years, but her wife, that had a disease, starts to see her health state get worst. In a forest it's quite impossible to solve somethings and they decide to move her to a hospital at civilization. And that's the moment where the movie starts. Leslie stays away from home during, approximately, three months. While this, Ben kept a high level rigor to caring with their children on all activities. Their children looks like genius in all activities, they know everything about politics, they are athletes, they know how to take care of a plantation and they love and obey their father. Ben is always paying attention to what is happening and trying to give all of his attention to their children. They are real family, in all points of view. But when Ben receives the sad info that his wife is dead, some problems in their relationship with his children are exposed. That happens because his father-in-law doesn't approve their way of life and decides to put their children against their father.
It's easy to see that this thing was only a disagreement, but the movie works to create empathy between us, the expectators, and them. You will really cheer to Ben! 
Without spoilers, I will jump directly to my point of view. I, as a future father, have million plans about how I would care my children. None of them consider change my personality. None of them is about be the same. None of them consider keep my sons in a prison. None of them will give too much freedom to them.
Be a father is not something that you can plan. Is about show to your son what you learn in life and be inclusive. Your son doesn't needs to have his father on his side all the time. Your son needs to want you by his side all the time. And the only way of getting it, is being a partner. Ben, put his rigor at the side, is that to them. Specially because he is available all the time. He doesn't have a cellphone, a television or a hard job to share his attention. How much of your time are you dedicating to do things that you really like or even don't like with your children?

528,maxharris-73932,Pretentious nonsense,1,27 August 2018,"Had to create an account to warn people off from this garbage. Apparently acting pretentious and teaching children how to steal is the way to go. Don't get me wrong, I agree and disagree I think in equal measure with the ideals represented by the father's teachings. However, how freaking high and mighty they act throughout the entire movie is a waste of their vaunted ""intelligence."" Not to mention the most important part, this movie is a snooze fest, and isn't funny AT ALL despite being described as many as a ""comedy, drama."" What a joke.",Captain Fantastic
529,jimpreast,"The unrealistic, liberal cliche filled version of the ""Alaskan Bush People"".",1,5 September 2018,"In less than 30 minutes the 6 kids hunted and killed a deer with their bare hands, discussed literature, physics, religion and politics from the books that they read around the fire, played musical instruments, rock climbed, all as their erudite/manly hunterman father instructed them on the lessons of life with a clear left lean.",Captain Fantastic
530,sandyc-76962,"Hollywood Socialist, Anti-Christian, Anti-America propoganda at its best.",5,10 September 2018,"I think this could have been a wonderful tale about people living off the grid in their Utopian forest world. However, as Hollywood is fond of doing, they decided to mock Christians and the American way of life to promote socialist/communistic ideology. One of the quotes that is supposed to be funny is, ""We don't make fun of anyone."" says Dad, then daughter says, ""Except Christians, we can make fun of them."" and everyone laughs and laughs. Isn't that special? The non-forest dwellers are portrayed as hateful (you can't come to your wife's funeral), dishonest (we lie to our children) and stupid (high schooler doesn't know what the Bill of Rights is). The forest raised children are absolutely brilliant and the 8 year old can quote the Bill of Rights and knows what it is for. Which is a weird scene as their ideology doesn't believe in individual rights or choices. They even celebrate Noam Chomsky day and ridicule Christmas as a ""myth.""
This could have been a great story, but it devolved into promoting mockery and hatred of Christians and people who love America.",Captain Fantastic
