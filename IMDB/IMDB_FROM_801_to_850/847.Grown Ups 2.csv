0,TheLittleSongbird,One of Sandler's worst,1,14 June 2016,"The first 'Grown Ups' film was a rather mediocre at best film, gave it a maybe generous 4/10. It had a few decent things, that sadly were outweighed by the many moments that were lazy and unfunny.Its sequel however is simply ghastly, personally am honestly struggling to find anything good about it. Not many sequels are as good as the original, although there are exceptions like 'Godfather Part 2', 'Aliens', 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Terminator 2' that come very close to being even better (actually 'Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the entire 'Star Wars' saga). But 'Grown Ups 2' which looks like no effort was put into it is down there with the worst sequels in existence (not as bad as 'Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2', 'Home Alone 4' and 'Neverending Story 3', but close).Credit is due, as far as Adam Sandler films go it is not as bad as 'Jack and Jill', one of those cases where almost anything is better than it. It is however down there with Sandler's all-time worst. For the record not everything that Sandler has done is bad, some of his 90s and early 2000s comedies are good, the 'Hotel Transylvania' films while with their issues were surprisingly good and he proved with 'Punch Drunk Love' and 'Reign Over Me' that he is capable of giving a good performance with great material which those two films have, but he has done too many misfires. Some have questioned, why watch it in the first place if you didn't like the first film and don't always like Sandler(an attitude that actually really annoys me)? The answer is easy. Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade have proved when they have strong material that they can be good, funny and likable actors. Anyway, talking about 'Grown Ups 2' as a film, the film looks cheap with direct-to-video production values. Scenery's alright and some of the costumes are nice in the party scene, but wasted by flat garish photography, lack of continuity and less than smooth editing. The music is at best forgettable, very generic and not very dynamic with what's going on. Dennis Dugan's direction is not very noticeable, fails to make the story cohesive and seems to rush through everything.That 'Grown Ups 2' is not funny, completely laughter-free in fact, is a huge part of the problem. The dialogue is childish, embarrassingly juvenile and crass while the gags and set pieces are incredibly tasteless and lumbering, most of the film saw this reviewer cringing through the childish slapstick and excessive bathroom humour. You know there's something wrong when the most memorable cameo is Taylor Lautner, and despite being the one actor to be enjoying himself the scene is one of the biggest examples of bad taste.Lack of story is also a major problem, almost non-existent in fact and just an excuse to string along incoherently the film's gags and the four leads to indulge in their antics with ill-at ease chemistry. The only real glimpse of one is with David Spade, and the film doesn't really delve into it properly. The first 'Grown Ups' story was not much special, but there was more of a resemblance of one. The characters are both annoying and bland, the men are too immature to be taken seriously or care for and the female leads are eye candy and little else. Acting doesn't help either.Sandler gives one of his laziest, phoned-in and irritating performances, James is at his most embarrassingly juvenile and annoying, Rock looks embarrassed and ill at ease and Spade is very little better. Apart from Lautner, none of the supporting characters or cameos shine, disadvantaged by worthless material.Overall, a complete mess of a film and one of Sandler's worst of a hit-and-miss career. Also one of the worst films personally seen all year (along with 'Norm of the North' all year in fact, know it's a 2013 release but didn't see it until this year). 1/10 Bethany Cox",Grown Ups 2
1,bkoganbing,Moving back home,6,11 July 2019,"This film has Adam Sandler and Selma Hayek moving back to the old home town
where he returned in the first Grown Ups movie for a reunion. The place is kind
of a piece of suburbia where people just seem to want to play. And Sandler wants
to be back with buds David Spade, Kevin James, and Chris Rock.There's no real plot to this film just a series of outrageous incidents one right
after another concluding with a titanic brawl between a bunch of snotty college kids and our overaged heroes.Fans of these folks, especially Sandler should be happy.",Grown Ups 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Love the friendship but there is a lot of stupidity,6,19 March 2014,"Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) has moved his family back home from LA. The guys Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James), Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock), and Marcus Higgins (David Spade) are back with the wives (Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello) and kids. There is also a bunch of frat guys led from the neighboring college.I love the friendship between the guys. Losing Rob Schneider actually improves the relationships. I love the wives especially Salma Hayek. I even love the kids. However this movie is flooded with stupidity. Sometimes the stupidity can be funny, but most of it is just really really really stupid. I can understand the haters. I agree with a lot of the criticisms. I just like everybody's happy relationships just enough to barely recommend this movie.",Grown Ups 2
3,Prismark10,80s disco time,3,18 June 2014,"When Rob Schneider bails out from the sequel then you know its not going to be good. The first Grown Up movie had enough feel good vibe and the actors blended well amusingly enough to make the film amiable enough and bring a few laughs.I only saw this film a few weeks ago and I an already struggling to recollect the plot. I know there was a scene with a deer going crazy, a hot Swedish teacher who is married to Steve Austin, a 1980s theme party and a big fight scene at the end and Taylor Lautner turns up as a jock who teases Sandler and co.The film is basically extended sketches with some trademark Sandler touches and use of 1980s music. Sandler knows who his audience is but the product is looking tired and his younger audience are moving on whilst those in the same age bracket as Sandler also getting restless.",Grown Ups 2
4,nogodnomasters,THERE'S A RAFT IN THERE?,4,2 August 2018,"The sequel comes with very little plot. Our foursome all have their child issues. David Spade suddenly has a long lost son so he doesn't miss out on the fun. There is an 80's theme party with a ridiculous townies vs. college boys fight.The humor is still crude, but perhaps a bit less than before as I found it tolerable. The film mostly relies on one liners and insults as is typical in a Sandler production. This film also highlights the talents or lack thereof of many Hollywood larvae including the Sandler clan, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Paulina Gretzky. Team Jacob fans can watch Taylor Lautner in an uncredited role as Fratboy Andy. My how they have fallen.Will work as a rental. No hurry to rush out and see it.Parental Guide: Brief male rear nudity. 1 f-bomb. No sex. Sex talk and general crudeness including urination, feces, and fart humor. Razzy nomination",Grown Ups 2
5,kosmasp,Still childish,3,3 September 2013,"Having two pee jokes in the first couple of minutes should tell you were this is heading. Don't get me wrong, the beginning does plant something that will be used later on. So you have some sort of redeeming factors that look like someone actually thought about this movie more than a minute.Is it sufficient for you to be enjoyed? I heard many laughs during the movie even when it went really south. And I'm talking about ""grown ups"" laughing not kids. Sometimes you have to be silly I guess. One of the factors that are sort of redeeming is not the father-son sub-story (though you could argue it adds a little character), it's Taylor Lautner. But even he is having moments where you want to choke the screenwriter. Obvious (and unfunny) Twilight jokes aside he does have some of the finer moments in the movie.",Grown Ups 2
6,tavm,Grown Ups 2 was good enough for what it was meant to be-a mostly harmless comedy just meant to entertain,7,18 July 2013,"Okay, I knew Grown Ups 2 wasn't going to be a great character comedy and that was okay with me. Really, I got what I expected which was plenty of pretty funny scenes along with some not so. And besides the return of Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade and a few other former ""SNL"" players, there were some more from that show that were added to the this sequel's cast like that of Jon Lovitz, Ellen Cleghorne, Cheri Oteri, Andy Samberg and a few others that provided some amusements. So no, Grown Ups 2 isn't by any stretch a great movie comedy but it's still pretty entertaining and despite some risqué humor, there's still some touching lessons about how important family is that shouldn't be too embarrassing to anyone taking their kids to this. So on that note, this is worth a look if you like this sort of thing. By the way, as with before with the predecessor, I'm once again going to review some other movies or TV specials with previous ""SNL"" cast members in the next several days in chronological order. So if you're reading this under my username, watch this space for early works of Chevy Chase, Garrett Morris, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Christopher Guest, Bill Murray, and Billy Crystal, among others...",Grown Ups 2
7,neil-476,"Not very good, but I quite liked it anyway",6,16 August 2013,"Grown Ups featured Adam Sandler and the usual suspects in a movie which had some amusement value in the context of a loose narrative about bringing together childhood friends for a particular event. Three years later, a sequel features many of the same cast in a plot less series of character threads and vignettes, much of which is childish, crude, slapstick, halfwitted, lazy, and occasionally sentimental.Make no mistake, this is not a very good film. But I wouldn't be fair if I didn't make three points: One, Sandler makes many films where his character is profoundly annoying (I mean fingernails scraping down blackboard annoying). Here his character is likable.Two, this film doesn't have as much outright cruelty in the humour as its predecessor.And, three, I hate to admit it, but it made me (and the cinema audience) laugh quite a bit.",Grown Ups 2
8,anaconda-40658,Twice As Small.,2,30 July 2015,"Grown Ups 2 (2013): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Nick Swardson: Dimwitted sequel to a dimwitted comedy only this time Rob Schneider avoided it. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, and David Spade all return and are sucked into a bunch of useless subplots that circle around a feud with frat boys. Sandler awakes to a deer in his bedroom, which sprays urine all over him. He is also met with the news that his wife is pregnant. Chris Rock's wife forgets their anniversary after she fishes a ribbon box out of her daughter's bloated diaper backside. Kevin James is challenged to dive off a high cliff but he keeps chickening out until they are all forced to jump naked when the frat boys arrive. This ends badly for Spade when James lands ass down on his head. Spade has problems of his own. He discovers that he has a teenage son who is fit for prison. The highlight is a massive party at Sandler's house with an eighties theme. We see lots of creative costumes that are far above anything the screenwriter does. Nick Swardson has the one funny role as a bus driver who is constantly high and the victim of antics by his friends. Director Dennis Dugan has worked with many of these performers before. Sandler seems to look after his own and it looks like a great hangout amongst friends, which is fine. However, it worked out better in You Don't Mess With the Zohan with its more comical screenplay. Grown Ups was bad enough but it had a theme of age and technology. The second time around it has grown even less. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Grown Ups 2
9,FlashCallahan,A dinosaur....,5,1 August 2013,"Adam Sandler decides to get everybody to move back to their hometown after the success of the first movie, and throw a huge eighties party to celebrate the wrap of the film.Only problem is, is that Taylor Lautner has finished making his college high school comedy on the other set, and he's pretty upset, because Stewart and Pattinson are getting bigger roles than him.....Lets have a fight....What did i expect when I saw this movie? well thanks to this films board, very, very little, apart from a moose urinating on Sandler, and Salma Hayek looking as hot as ever.Like the first movie, there is very little of plot, and there is no narrative to speak of at all. What you get instead, are little sketches involving characters that range from mildly amusing, to virtually unfunny dross.Cameos pop up all the time, people have catchphrases like 'Whaaaaaaat?', and the Eighites gets reminisced, but it's watchable, and i did find myself laughing a few times.The thing is with Sandler movies, is that there is always something that is just way over the top and silly, you cannot help but see the movie again for that particular part.In Jack and Jill, the Dunkacinno scene. In Mr Deeds, Macenroe jumping over the car In That's my Boy, the reverend saying F++++ng ***** people after a revelation.This has Shaq throwing someone over a house, and Taylor Lautner putting in a good performance.So it's not brilliant, but it's not the disaster it's made out to be..",Grown Ups 2

Its NOT for the pseudo intellects at all. Its caters to the easy-going movie-goer, who is ready not to take this joyride seriously. The Screenplay is childish, but funny. Dennis Dugan's Direction is passable. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler is in his element, while Kevin James, David Spade & Chris Rock are sportive. Salma Hayek, Maria Bello & Maya Rudolph are efficient. Nick Swardson is hilarious. Taylor Lautner is in decent form. Shaquille O'Neal is darn good.On the whole, 'Grown Ups 2' worked for me.

11,StevePulaski,"A lumbering, distasteful comedy that has a lower impression of you than you have of it",2,14 July 2013,"There I sat, in stone-cold silence, not completely watching, but observing Grown Ups 2, one of the most desperate comedies of the year. Smiling maybe twice, groaning several times, rolling my eyes several more, and eventually closing them for a few seconds trying to imagine what a movie like this could've been if the quality of the talent matched the quality of the three screenwriters behind this project.The first Grown Ups film wasn't great - or even good - by any means, but had the vibe of a cheery, stupid ABC Family movie. The strongest complaint I had about the original film carries over to this one immensely which is that given the immense amount of talent in this film, from the three title characters alone, this should be a much better, much funnier movie. Adam Sandler can be funny when he is given timing and a decent character, Kevin James can always be sweet, simple, and relatable, Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians working today, and David Spade almost always knocks one out of the park in Rules of Engagement. It's dumbfounding to note that Taylor Lautner has the biggest laughs in the film, and after watching this, I have faith that after the redundant Twilight franchise he'll find work in some solid buddy comedies. However, the first inkling that Grown Ups 2 is terrible is by the sole fact that Rob Schneider himself decided other matters were worth is time than making a film that was almost guaranteed to be a hit.The entire event is a plot less picture (not the good kind) that provides its audience with a pathetic array of scenes that seem more like throwaway skits from Saturday Night Live. It's a massively redundant, laundry-list of senseless setups with unfunny payoffs that usually involve something along the lines of bathroom humor, objectification, homophobia, and obnoxious behavior. In other words, it's another Sandler movie. It takes place entirely on the last day of school and revolves around the gang of Lenny (Adam Sandler), Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock), and Marcus (David Spade) returns, this time welcoming a more quiet, suburban lifestyle contrary to that of Lenny's in Hollywood, and the ridiculous series of sitcom antics that unfold overtime.The plot stops there. What follows is, as stated, a series of cheaply-staged, poorly-performed, witless gags that do nothing but make one check the time. Among the barrage of questions I had while watching this film, one of which was, ""who is the target audience here?"" My mind resorted immediately to tweens and adolescents, who spend too much time giggling at bathroom humor as is. But then, as the film progressed, it began to redirect its senses to a more sentimental side, which only shows the immense tonal strain the film has which is ""create cinematic anarchy for forty minutes before showing that this is a story about being true to ones roots and taking care of the family."" The sentimentalism is then mixed with a strangely out of place eighties party that concludes the picture, which will definitely not be appreciated to the fullest extent by the previously mentioned tweens and adolescences, as many of the jokes and period references will fly straight over their head.The problem with the film is that it seems so effortless and so poorly conducted. At least with various Sandler films like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and even the unexpectedly raunchy That's My Boy, I could sense that it was made for somebody, be it adolescents or a bit older of a crowd and stuck with that persona. Grown Ups 2 is a film made with no agenda, no personality, and no spirit. It even resorts to the tireless Sandler cliché of having all the male characters being a cornucopia of stupidity and the female characters being nothing but eye-candy for the men. There are certain things I expect Sandler to be over now, what with approaching fifty in a few years.You have a choice as a moviegoer this weekend and the several other weekends Grown Ups 2 is going to play. You can either a see a film that possesses gags as commonplace and predictable as a Fruity Pebbles commercial or use this time as an opportunity to seek out nearby independent features in theaters, at your local video store, or even on Netflix. Say you refute that suggestion and want to see Grown Ups 2 as a pleasant, feel-good movie. I know plenty of independent movies that are pleasant, feel good movies (Frances Ha is one of them and is still playing in many theaters nationwide). Wouldn't you at least want to give money to people who don't believe that you're sitting in the audience because you possess the attention-span of a newborn?

12,Rainey-Dawn,Strange Comedy,5,29 August 2021,This is one of those films what you wonder what is going on because there really isn't much of a plot but there are quite a number of funny jokes that are worth watching this movie for.If you are bored and this is on the boob-tube - give it a try!5/10.,Grown Ups 2
13,Hellmant,For the most part it's an insult to anyone who watches it.,4,22 October 2013,"'GROWN UPS 2': Two Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler reteams with his buddies Chris Rock, David Spade, Kevin James, Nick Swardson, Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows, Jon Lovitz, Colin Quinn and many others for this sequel to the 2010 hit buddy comedy film. Rob Schneider is notably missing (due to scheduling conflicts), and it's not even explained why his character is never there, but the movie makes no sense anyway. It has no story whatsoever and is instead just a series of strung together dick and fart jokes (like every Adam Sandler movie). Dennis Dugan once again directed the film (he directs almost all of Sandler's recent crappy movies) and Sandler once again co-wrote the movie, with Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy. Salma Hayek, Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph also reprise their roles as wives of three of the four main characters. The film is more of the same of Sandler and friends' usual antics. If you enjoyed the first movie you'll probably like this one (but maybe just a little less).The film takes place three years after the first one when Lenny Feder (Sandler) has moved back home to Connecticut with his wife Roxanne (Hayek) and three children (after successfully living in Hollywood for many years). His friend Kurt (Rock) is celebrating his 20th anniversary with his wife Deanne (Rudolph) but she forgot about it. His other friend Eric (James) is disagreeing with his wife Sally (Bello) about how to raise their children and his friend Marcus (Spade) just found out he has a 17-year-old son (Alexander Ludwig), who wants to kill him. The friends also have to deal with a group of angry frat boys (led by Taylor Lautner). It's become the new popular thing (recently) to totally bag on Adam Sandler and his movies. They still make a ton of money and audiences of a lower IQ still enjoy them but for the most part he's a joke (and not in a good way). I'd say his movies are almost as unpopular as the 'TWILIGHT' franchise, so it should come as no surprise that Lautner has now appeared in one. I used to think Sandler was a talented comedian and a decent actor (and still do) but he definitely doesn't put any effort into trying to make adults laugh anymore. He still makes a lot of money (and so do his friends) so you can't diss him too hard (this film cost $80 million to make, mostly for the actors' salaries probably). It looks like everyone is still having a good time making the movies and they seem to like their own jokes (a lot). I'd say 'GROWN UPS 2' isn't nearly as bad as something like 'JACK AND JILL' or 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY' but it's not as good as even the original 'GROWN UPS' and it's definitely not anywhere close to as clever as Sandler's early films (like 'HAPPY GILMORE' and 'BILLY MADISON'). It's like a bad sitcom; it has a few good jokes and a lot of energy but for the most part it's an insult to anyone who watches it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrdaYYFcs0U",Grown Ups 2
14,Buddy-51,Stunted growth,4,24 November 2013,"The original ""Grown Ups"" was a surprisingly deft and endearing comedy that at least managed to squeeze a modicum of quality out of its formulaic tale of four childlike buddies having trouble adjusting to the obligations and responsibilities that come with middle age. The movie somehow managed to balance the requisite gross-out gags with some genuinely thoughtful and sophisticated humor about the compromises that come with growing up. The sequel, imaginatively named ""Grown Ups 2,"" is something else again, a movie that's every bit as epicene, juvenile and dumbed-down as one would have expected the original to be. Suffice it to say that any movie that starts off with a deer urinating on an unsuspecting suburban family has set a pretty low bar for itself. And ""Grown Ups 2"" lives down to those expectations just about every step of the way.The original had at least a semblance of a plot on which to hang its jokes, namely the men's coming together for a memorial service for their junior high school basketball coach who had recently died. Here the script is nothing more than a loosely strung-together series of misadventures as the ""boys"" roam around town getting into all sorts of mischief, some unlooked-for and some a product of their own making.As with any movie that employs three comedy writers - Adam Sandler, Tim Herlihy and Fred Wolf - to hash out the screenplay, there will inevitably be a few genuinely funny moments scattered throughout the film, but they are not enough to counter the barrage of urine, poop and vomit jokes that receive a much higher percentage of the screen time.The movie wastes a quality cast that includes Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Selma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Steve Buscemi, Georgia Engel and Taylor Lautner.They - and we - deserve better.",Grown Ups 2

Then, I saw Grown Ups, and that took the crown. Jack & Jill was worse than those and following that, That's My Boy became my most hated of his movies. Well, you gotta hand it to Sandler; now that Grown Ups 2 is his absolutely worst film, he's been nothing but consistent. I can't wait to see what sh|t he'll come up with next.",Grown Ups 2
16,Robert_duder,Mr. Sandler...you've lost whatever you had. Please retire.,3,3 November 2013,"I have never hated Adam Sandler. In fact, he has had some truly great comedies over the years like The Wedding Singer, Click, Spanglish and even his stupider comedies like Big Daddy and Waterboy had their moments. But there was a time when he finally hit the point where he could literally do and produce anything he wanted and since then it has been a huge steady decline since then and his last three films at least have been utter crap. Grown Ups 1 was just barely tolerable. It was very typical and exactly what you would expect from the always immature Sandler. Well Grown Ups 2 is just off the rails with stupidity. In the first five minutes you have several urine/animal spray jokes, an ongoing fart/burp joke and one stupid ridiculous unfunny moment after another. There were a few (and I mean a very few) redeemable funny scenes that I enjoyed and laughed at even if it was the sheer ridiculousness of it. There is some decent physical comedy (something I am always a sucker for) although most of it looks like CGI or stunt doubles. The first film at least had some nostalgic storyline and the kids played a bigger part but this one focuses entirely on the random antics of Sandler's crew.In the first film I thought Adam Sandler sort of took a back seat and showed a calmer side of himself in order to let the others take all the laughs. Well, he was still slightly toned down in this but his stupid antics are definitely back. The only saving grace to his performance is I don't think he used that horrendously awful voice he's been using in things like That's My Boy or Jack and Jill. David Spade returns to his role which is actually barely a cameo. His sarcastic humour is very underused and nothing much of anything is done with him. Kevin James also returns and he gets a back seat too and doesn't really find a footing with his comedy style. I can like James in certain roles (Here Comes The Boom was fantastic) but he's basically just back for the sake of being there. Chris Rock was actually one of the funnier guys in the film. While his character is mostly bland and doesn't get any more depth than the rest of them, his one liners are some of the very few funny lines in the film. The gals are back too as their wives played by Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph and Salma Hayek. The three of them are so awkward in this film and they don't match their prospective husbands whatsoever. I mean, Sandler even cracks a joke about Hayek being his wife but its just too silly to even understand their chemistry is less than zero. And as with any Sandler film you have a whose who of SNL alumni and washed up comedians including Nick Swardson (in a horrible, irritating and downright stupid part), Steve Buscemi (barely a noticeable role), Colin Quinn, Tim Meadows (also incredibly irritating), Jon Lovitz (mildly funny as the perverted Janitor) and Shaquille O'Neal. You will notice many, many other cameos in the film but nothing saves it. The children should be a focal point of the movie but they are hardly used and also irritating.Director Dennis Dugan has made some the very best crappy Adam Sandler movies and I mean that in the worst way possible. Remarkably the first Grown Ups managed to just barely be entertaining but this was a complete mess. It was an excuse for Sandler and his ego and his money to goof around and annoy people. This was utter garbage like most comedies are these days. I'm not a prude and I can handle any sort of rude comedy but that doesn't make it funny. This isn't extreme in the gross out department but its bad enough. By this point we know what to expect from Sandler and Grown Ups 2 is what it is so you will know what you're walking into. For me it was a huge bomb and I won't be watching it again...ever. 3/10",Grown Ups 2
17,MLDinTN,this is what you call bad,2,1 March 2014,"This movie was so bad, even a lot worse than the first one. At least the first one was OK and had its moments, but this movie all the jokes just fell flat and where just silly and sometimes disgusting. When a movie starts with a deer spraying urine all over someone, you know that the movie just doesn't have much. Then of course there was the gross scene of the guy fixing the ice cream machine and chocolate ice cream leaking out. And what's funny about a dad breaking his own son's leg. The only amusing thing was the car wash scene with the hot chicks and guys wearing short shorts. But even that was too much.FINAL VERDICT: Watch at your own risk, but best to avoid.",Grown Ups 2
18,g-bodyl,"Okay, I Did Laugh......A Lot!",8,18 October 2014,"When Grown Ups 2 came out, it was instantly reviled just like Adam Sandler's other films. But like his most other films, I thought this film was actually pretty funny, though a little on the juvenile side. Admittedly, the first film had more of a plot and was just a tiny fraction better, but I couldn't deny the charm of this film and plus this film had a horde of excellent cameos. The film also shows that movies are subjective and despite everyone having their own taste, I found this film to be worth watching.The one thing I didn't like it that we really had no plot to work with. All I knew is that after Lenny and the gang moved back to their hometown, they just want to have a good time. Or so as the movie says.This film is filled with respectable, charming actors. Adam Sandler was his usual corny self as Lenny and Salma Hayek does a great job as his sexy wife. Then we have the likes of David Spade, Kevin James, and Chris Rock back in their respective roles. I also liked Steve Buscemi's role as the crazy driving instructor.Overall, I liked this movie and found it to be pretty funny and sweet. I laughed a lot so that is all what matters. Though some of the humor is juvenile, it's not all that bad. I mean you would have to think a urinating deer is funny, but I did. I may get a lot of hate, But I'm not afraid to admit I like this movie. Not as good as the 2010 original, but good enough. I rate this film 8/10.",Grown Ups 2
19,cricketbat,Adding insult to stupidity,3,4 June 2021,I should have known when this movie started with a deer peeing into a guy's mouth that Grown-Ups 2 was setting a pretty low bar for comedy. At least the first movie had some sort of story. This sequel just throws a bunch of loosely related gags onto the screen and doesn't care if it makes any sense or if they're actually funny. It's insulting that they thought audiences would enjoy this half-baked cash grab.,Grown Ups 2

On the last day of school for the year the gang all has individual problems that come up and deal with it in the only way they know how. As you may know by now I start all my reviews by summarizing the plot. This was the hardest part of the review for me, because there really wasn't a plot in this. The first movie was funny and did have a legitimate plot running through it and with this cast it made it hilarious and I really enjoyed it. I was looking forward to watching this but was a little leery. My worst suspicions came true. This is in no way terrible and it is worth watching but while the first one seemed like a movie this one was more...lets all hang out together and make a movie. There were some funny parts but it was more or less a series of SNL skits strung together. One scene had very little to do with the next one. All that said though it still is worth seeing but not even close to as good as the first one was. Overall, fans of this group and the first one will like it but don't expect to laugh as much as the original. I give it a B-.",Grown Ups 2

Grown Ups had a story, a nicely written plot and a believable get-together which was less gross and more narrative. Grown Ups 2 is just like those mindless blown-off comedies that are not only situational but also irritatingly paradoxical.Adam Sandler is funny as always & I've always loved watching him on- screen. His co-actors are fine, especially Chris Rock. Women in here are cleavage flashing puppets who is nothing to talk about. The characters seem like they wanna renew their teenage days (just like in the Indian comedy ""2 Harihar Nagar"") which goes disastrously awry. The humor is absolutely laughable, with wits, dialogs & sarcasm hugely involved. Non- verbal drama was ridiculous. Lots of misogyny involved and when they are from considerate chauvinists, just heck! And the appearances Taylor Lautner & Shaquille O'Neal were nightmarish.As it approaches the end, the only humor which was supporting the film, crashes to a shambles & the viewers are left paralyzed in the brain. Sequel to movies like Grown Ups don't need much art, let only potential, but the makers & writers here disappoint. 4.4/10 for the jokes, dialogs & Steve Austin. What was Steve Buscemi doing there?BOTTOM LINE: People who are following the franchise can have a look. Others can skip!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

24,The-Sarkologist,Lenny Feder Goes Home,6,16 August 2020,"I really have to get into the habit of checking Netflix (and the university library) before I go out and rent some movie from Youtube (or the numerous other platfoms that have the movie available) because I discovered, after renting it, that I could have watched this film for free. Anyway, that aside, after watching, and enjoying, the first movie a part of me really wanted to see what happens in the sequel. Well, yeah, it is more of the same, but it still has that rather nice feel good aspect to it.So, Lenny Feder and his family have decided to leave Hollywood and move back to their home town, though they do end up buying one of the biggest houses on the block. Lenny isn't working, but you get the impression that he really doesn't need to because, well, he has plenty of money as it is. Mind you, you also get the impression that his wife's fashion store isn't doing all that well either, but she doesn't seem to particularly care.It is the last day of school before the summer holidays, and of course it is a time for people to come to terms with a time era. Lenny has to confront the idea that his wife wants a fourth child, Marcus has to confront the fact that he has a boy, though this particular boy really doesn't seem to like him. Of course, there is also the issue that they aren't young like they were, and the local frat boys are out causing trouble. Oh, and the kids are growing up too, and Kurt needs to deal with the fact that his daughter is dating somebody that he doesn't particularly like.Look, this one wasn't anywhere near as good as the last one, but it was still pretty enjoyable. Obviously we have more characters, since we are in a small town as opposed to a lakeside retreat, and the conclusion is pretty good as well. I liked how it came out that their kids did in fact has some hidden talents as well, but I guess that has something to do with it being one of those Hollywood films where things do need to turn out right once in a while. Another thing that I appreciated was Sandler's rather casual and laid back nature, which certainly stands out from the image of a stuffy Hollywood agent - and also the fact that he was more than happy to drive the school bus when needed - yeah there were some pretty cool scenes, and the fact that it was just about friends being, well, friends, is what I really did like about these two films.Sure, the critics weren't all that thrilled with it, but in the end what really counts was the box office, and that certainly put the critic's opinons to shame.",Grown Ups 2
25,Reno-Rangan,Combined pieces of comedies became 'Grown Ups 2',6,16 November 2013,"Like the first part it is just a fine comedy. Story? I think there was none. It is a movie where series of fun scenes attached together which becomes the 'Grown Ups 2'. Yeah like the movie 'Jackass', nothing much difference between these two except one was rated PG13 and other were R.At least the first movie was somehow enjoyable, this movie completely failed to attract with its comedies. I think Adam Sandler's sense of humour is no longer effective like he was a decade ago. The combined star power was the key to this movie which made watchable. Hope there won't be a third.

26,Floated2,Lowercased Sequel,3,8 January 2015,"Grown Ups 2 the sequel to the hit Grown Ups in 2010. Although their were differences and some wavelength from the original Grown Ups, it had its moment. However in Grown Ups 2 we see a fairly different film with a different thinner plot. People may say all of these movies are equally bad, but that's not so. The original Grown Ups which is considered Sandler's most successful film since the 1990's, was a borderline thorough family picture that gave generous screen time to Chris Rock and Kevin James and other folks who can get laughs. And it had a vaguely engaging plot about middle-aged family men taking account of their lives 20 years after high school.The film showed a little discipline, a little heart. Now into Grown Ups 2, not so much. It's a plot less free-for-all about Sandler and his high school buddies throwing an 1980's theme party, and it's a string of slap-stick gags that gives each of the star's friends a pratfall and paycheck. There were many different characters which come in at various parts that are there to simply deliver laughs and move on. Grown Ups is far more predictable and does not deliver the laughs warranted of the hype and success.",Grown Ups 2
27,eddie_baggins,A fun time for everyone (other than the audience),3,16 February 2014,"I asked myself a couple of questions around 15 minutes into Grown Ups 2, Denis Duigan's Adam Sandler starring opus on life, love and the importance of family. The first question I asked myself internally was ""Why am I watching Grown Ups 2?"" the second question and much more harder to answer was ""Why am I finding this movie funny?"". It's a truly scary question that one can ask themselves when what they are admitting to is willingly laughing at a film that has been universally panned by anyone over the age of 10 and a film that on face value is nothing more an excuse for a bunch of Happy Madison alumni's getting together and getting paid to be immature. How wrong they all were.Grown Ups 2 is a touching and life affirming tale that shows us all that we need not care about working our daily jobs, just take the day off and wonder around town with your best friends and talk about high school and the good old days of partying and womanising and consequently running into Shaq. It's a realistic and brave decision by Duigan to not back away from the message and tell a tale that despite not knowing it we all needed to hear. Much can be taken away from what our hero's led by Sandler as rich family man Lenny Feder experience in their journey from overcoming past traumas by jumping naked of a cliff, fighting back urges experienced from watching attractive school dance teachers or getting your car washed at a College hand wash.The cast are all back after their ground-breaking and industry changing work on the first film and all acquit themselves well to the material, with Sandler in particular stretching himself with his return as the rich family man, James as the mummy's boy fat man, Spade as a womanising jobless trailer trash lost cause and Rock as a loud mouth Black man who cracks hilarious jokes that are not 10 years too late. A supporting cast featuring future Oscar nominee Taylor Lautner and a not slumming it in the slightest Steve Buscemi also add great depth and heart to a script which asks the hard questions and goes for the non- signposted joke at any available chance.Now dear readers as I asked myself the hard questions upon watching this film I now ask one of you – ""Did you believe any of what you just read?"". If you answered yes then shame on you, for what Grown Ups 2 is is a film that does not in any way shape or form try and be better than it should be. Jokes and effort are always aimed at the lowest common denominator and for all seriousness no one from actors through to director cares for they know they will be making money and undoubtedly enjoying their time doing it. I truthfully did find myself against all the good in the world enjoying moments in the film upon the opening 30 minutes but all goodness was quickly drained with a movie story that has to be one of the lamest ever committed to celluloid. If you're looking to turn off your brain, your heart and all sense for the greater good Grown Ups 2 is first up on that given night but in the end is another sad and sorry step in the career of all involved and proof that Lautner could do worse than his turn as Jacob Black.

What was is about? Probably it's creators had no idea as well, as the stories were all messed up, unfinished and a little juvenile. The college guys aiming against the grown up family guys reminded me of the movie bad neighbours, and it was still not entertaining. There were some funny moments in the film, especially because of that kid and his family who were all bald and sassy. But other than that it was boring and meaning less, with bad acting and bad comic scenes that were far stretched to become funny. So 2 out of 10 for grown ups 2.",Grown Ups 2
29,leonblackwood,Not Funny! 2/10,2,26 December 2013,"Review: I really didn't think that this movie was funny. The jokes were ridiculous and it just seemed like an hour and a half of watching actors make a total fool of themselves. In some ways, it's much better than the first one, which I totally hated, but this movie had a few more stars in it which made it slightly watchable. As the movie came out at the holiday season, it made quite a lot of money which means that we might get a 3rd one of these hard to watch movies. If you watch it with the family, then it might be fun, but as a single person, I struggled to stay awake through the whole film. I wasn't totally disappointed because I knew what to expect from this franchise, but it's still hard to watch actors like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, go downhill. Rubbish!Round-Up: Adam Sandler seems to be stuck on making movies like these nowadays, which is why I have totally gone off of watching his movies, but the problem is that they make so much money so we are always go to see these type of films coming out of Hollywood. Chris Rock has also gone way down in my estimation and his voice just becomes really annoying after a while. Kevin James makes some average movies so he is allowed to make some that are totally crap every now and again. Salem Hayek was the hardest to watch make her fool out of herself because she looks so great. Anyway, the storyline is so unrealistic and the characters are uninteresting, but it's one for the family.Budget: $80million (On What?) Worldwide Gross: $247millionI recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first movie in this franchise, but this isn't that much better. 2/10",Grown Ups 2

I don't understand why this movie got such bad ratings and reviews, but I don't go by public opinion, I go by my own two eyes.In this movie, Lenny has moved back to his hometown with his wife and kids, to be closer to his old friends. Everyone is getting along, even everyone's kids. But a lot of things go wrong in this sleepy little town. Bullies, old ones and new ones, a schizophrenic bus driver, drunk cops on skis, old girlfriends, new kids, and four-hundred frat guys crashing a party, this movie has everything you need to have a good time.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.",Grown Ups 2

I did not like the first one all that much, and I had doubts going in feeling it was gonna be pure blandness like the first one.But much too my surprise, I was quite amused by this. Now I did not think it was great, but passable. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Kevin James reprise there roles and all shine, not hogging the spot light. But Rob Schneider does not appear here, so Nick Swardson fills that void, but playing a different character. The kids playing the main characters kids are great, so are the wives, Selma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph. Shaq O'Neal is having a blast here, so is Taylor Lautner.The first one feels like it was making itself up has it was going on, this feels no different, but at least the filmmakers this time make a somewhat attempt to be entertaining instead of being bland.

He will be the equivalent of today's TCM ""Star of the Month,"" or an ubiquitous Judy Garland singing ""Over the Rainbow"" which you cannot get away from (not that ANYONE will want to). All of these recent flops essentially cloning each other--including PACIFIC RIM, THE LONE RANGER, and WHITE HOUSE DOWN--will be long forgotten in the dust bin of history, as Sandler revivals familiarize new generations with the once lesser known works from Adam's opus, such as LITTLE NICKY or WATERBOY. No one remembers the movie critics of yesteryear, much less their too frequent pans and rare (mostly misplaced) recommendations. Box office is king, and yesterday's losers seldom get recycled today; they've already rotted away on the mulch pile of their own time. Adam Sandler is this generation's Jimmy Stewart, and GROWN UPS and GROWN UPS 2 are the HARVEY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE of tomorrow. (Did anyone else notice how the prank forcing Adam and his friends to jump off the cliff echoes Stewart et al being dumped into the swim pool under the dance floor by a similar prank in LIFE, albeit with more clothes on?) While it is true that Stewart made a handful of more serious flicks, such as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, he was a real life Brigadier General in the U.S. Air Force reserve and flew 20 missions bombing the Nazis in WWII, for gosh sake!

That's not a criticism though. A lot of those gags hit, if not bulls-eye, then at least the target area. Sandler and his troupe could play these roles, all more or less their public persona's, in their sleep. But like the first film they all seem to be having fun. The themes about friendship that ran so deep in the first film are replaced here by a focus on family, but it still ties well into the overall theme about men and middle age.If you don't like Sandler and his brand of humor then there's nothing here that'll win you over, but if you liked the first one you'll likely enjoy revisiting these characters.",Grown Ups 2

It seems to be one of those films that is universally hated by both the critics and the IMDb community. Likewise, many people generally despise this sequel and I can only assume that people didn't like it because it's very thin in terms of plot and because it's pretty crude.OK, the first issue I do agree with; this film didn't really have a plot or a story and yes it probably was just made to cash in on the success of the first film. Whether you liked the first film or not, it did have a clearly structured plot and yes it was funnier than this sequel. Does that make this sequel a bad film? Absolutely not...I've always felt that comedies can get away with having thin plots as long as there is one crucial ingredient; humour. Yes this film is crude, but so was the first one. At the end of the day, if you hated the first film and thought it was crude then why would you watch the sequel? It's a dumb film, yes it's not particularly imaginative and yes it is the sort of film you'll forget about 5 minutes after watching it, but during those 90 minutes I was laughing so much that I almost didn't care that there was no story.I think that in order to enjoy this sequel, I think you will not only need to have enjoyed the first film, but I also think that you need to be able to relate to the characters. In some ways, both films have some focus on our 40 somethings trying to recapture their lost youth. I myself am not quite as old as our rather childish foursome, but I am at an age where I'm no longer a teenager and can sort of understand the fact that some adults don't like being Grown Ups. I suspect that this will be something that teenagers won't be able to identify with quite as well as they will be 'currently' living their youth.Had this film been completely full of vulgarity and had ALL the gags been vulgar then I probably would have rated it lower, but there are plenty of non vulgar gags in this film that many people may have missed. I understand that the vulgarity won't be for everyone, but at the end of the day I don't mind vulgar jokes as long as they're funny and many of the jokes do work in Grown Ups 2.In some ways, I can understand why people were disappointed with this sequel. It doesn't have much of a story and it is quite a lazy sequel - it's disappointing that they've had 3 years to come up with a sequel that has no story. That being said, it is almost as funny as the first film so as long as you just go with the flow and take it for what it is then it is a very funny follow up. I would have given this film a 7 out of 10, but I've knocked it down to a 6 because of its rather thin plot.",Grown Ups 2
36,3xHCCH,What Happened to Adam Sandler?,4,24 July 2013,"I did not get to watch the first ""Grown Ups"" in 2010, but I knew it was a successful comedy at the box office back then. The trailer for ""Grown Ups 2"" I saw was funny so I guess the whole movie would be as well. That is not exactly what happened.""Grown Ups 2"" has Lenny (Adam Sandler) coming back to live in the old suburban community where he grew up. So in that way, he gets to spend more time with his old buddies in a way Adam Sandler famously does -- stupidly. There is no plot to talk about. We follow Lenny and his gang, namely Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock) and Marcus (David Spade) in their raunchy and rowdy shenanigans at the K-Mart, at their old swimming hole now claimed by bratty frat boys, and finally at a wild 1980s themed party in Lenny's house. We meet their respective wives and kids, as well as various strange schoolmates (the drunk bus driver, the bald guy, the cross-eyed guy, the maniac cop), along the way. Everything felt so random, lazily put-together episodes. The kind of humor is also so random, anything goes. There was animal humor about a stag that entered their house. There was a lot of body function humor, including one about a burp-sneeze-fart combination. There was also a lot of green humor, ranging from boob jokes to gay jokes. Unfortunately, there was more misses than hits. The laughs were few and far between. I even feel the best funny parts were already in the trailer! I must say that Shaquille O'Neal was actually hilarious in his guest role as a gentle giant cop. He did not come off as annoying compared to the other odd people in town. Taylor Lautner looked a lot thinner this time (compared to his Twilight days), especially surrounded by those bulkier frat boys. Was he really the one doing all those backflips and flying kicks, or were those special effects (yeah, right)? He too was funny, perhaps unintentionally, with all his hyper-macho posturing.The most disappointing element in this film is Adam Sandler himself. He was so laid back here, he actually looked lazy on screen. I do not know what happened to this guy. Many of his movies were so hilarious and had a delightful charm about them, like ""Billy Madison"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Wedding Singer"", ""50 First Dates"". I even liked ""Don't Mess With the Zohan,"" offensive as that may be. But in this one, he is not even trying to do anything, and it obviously shows. A lot of his jokes were falling flat, compared to the others in the cast.I did enjoy the music, costumes and references at the climactic 80s party, but that ended in a poorly choreographed free-for -all brawl scene. I enjoyed seeing sweet Ms. Georgia Engel on the big screen as Eric's mom. I recall her from her appearances on ""The Love Boat""! So, in short, there are good and funny parts. Everyone will find a little something to enjoy, but they maybe not be enough for your money's worth. 4/10.",Grown Ups 2

This is a film that will have the young ones laughing, teenagers laughing, and even senior citizens enjoying a great time at the movies because deep in the middle of the silly jokes, there is a heart and the themes of family and plain human relationships.Sandler and his family are back in their old town to give their kids an opportunity to enjoy a simpler, safer existence. They discover that you will have bullies and other problems in there, too. Before we know it, the gags keep coming, and someone are pretty rude and dumb, but it's preferable material to the option of relying too much on gratuitous nudity, foul language, and the asinine pranks so prevalent in other contemporary comedies that sometimes people want to pass as sophisticated treats.It's a pleasure to see familiar faces, with Bello, James, Sandler, Rock, and a few newcomers playing supporting roles and having a ball, too. The feeling of nostalgia is big in this sequel, too, and be prepared to have some fun looking and listening to some good old 80's music and the guests dressing up in that decade's archetypes.So don't expect much of a demand on your brain and this is not high brow literature.

Adam Sandler's first ever sequel is no more than an excuse for him to get together with his Happy Madison pals for some male bonding time, to which he has also graciously invited some easily recognisable faces like Taylor Lautner (yes, we mean Jacob from the 'Twilight' movies), Shaquille O' Neal (remember that NBA star?) and even Steve Austin. How much you enjoy their get-together really depends on how much you enjoy Sandler and Co's brand of humour.Anyone who's a fan of Sandler will recognise his regular big-screen pals, many of whom like himself were 'Saturday Night Live' alumni - including Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Nick Swardson, as well as Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz, Tim Meadows and Colin Quinn in smaller parts. There is unmistakable chemistry among them honed from years of goofing off each other, so there's really no point chiding them for indulging in man-boy humour; instead, all you should be prepared to do is to laugh along with them - and occasionally at them.The script by Sandler and another two of his regulars - Fred Wolf and Tim Herlihy - provides the loosest structure for him to knock around with his pals. Set entirely in the course of the last day of school before summer break, it reunites Sandler's former hotshot Hollywood agent Lenny with his trio of childhood friends - Eric (James), Kurt (Rock) and Marcus (Spade) as they plan a 1980s-styled party at his house; the only noticeable absence from the first movie being Rob, no thanks to Sandler regular Rob Schneider sitting out this adventure.Each character gets his own individual storyline - Sandler objects to his wife's (Salma Hayek) wish to have a fourth kid in the family; Eric secretly hides out at his mother's place because his wife (Maria Bello) isn't affectionate enough; Kurt is feeling excited about his ""get out of jail free"" pass after remembering his twentieth wedding anniversary when the missus (Maya Rudolph) hasn't; and Marcus has just met his son who happens to be a tattooed teenage delinquent. All that, plus their children's complications of the heart, are however just filler among the string of episodic gags and infantile humour which follow.Keeping with the spirit of the first movie, bodily discharge is still very much in vogue; there is urination (the opening scene has a deer peeing on Sandler's face), simulated defecation and 'burpsnarts' (a one- two-three combo of a burp, sneeze and fart). Ditto for leering - first with Lovitz's janitor impersonating an aerobics instructor and getting the women to jiggle their breasts and spank their butts; then moving on to a hot ballet teacher at school; and then to a car wash by young nubile cheerleaders.Yes, this is that kind of movie, exactly the type Swardson's high-on- drugs bus driver can fit snugly in by stripping to his knickers, sleeping on a bed in Kmart and pooping in their toilet bowls on display. It is also that movie which Lautner's crew of frat boys form a childish rivalry with Sandler and his pals, resulting in an impromptu insult contest, naked dives off a 35-foot cliff, and culminating in a showdown at the very party on Sandler's home lawn where the very same deer that appears at the beginning returns for a ball-breaking finish.Not all the jokes work, not all the humour will resonate (in particular, those that aren't physical in nature), and the pace does slack from time to time - despite Sandler's go-to director Dennis Dugan's best efforts. But this is a movie that hinges on a bunch of grown-ups who refuse to grow up, that very circumstance mirrored by the kind of humour Sandler and his company indulge in and invite their audience to revel in. Call it slack and lazy if you like, but if you're not into watching Sandler slack and laze and relax with his pals, then 'Grown Ups 2' ain't for you.",Grown Ups 2

41,Screen_Blitz,Mediocre sequel to the 2010 original,4,27 May 2015,"It is quite that Adam Sandler comedies have gone down the hill recently. Not to say that all Adam Sandler films are bad, some of actually pretty decent despite what critics say. I enjoyed Grown Ups in 2010, it was very funny and entertaining to watch. Grown ups 2, however, was a bit mediocre compared to the 2010 original. While it had its laughs, everything else was pretty dumb. This film was filled with fart jokes, poop jokes, and corny sex jokes that are supposed to be funny, but only end up being absurd.With Rob Schneider absent from this installment, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, and David Spade return as friends with new problems to deal with. The group comes in conflict against college frat kids, Lenny (Adam Sandler) reunites with a bully from high school, and Marcus (David Spade) discovers he is a father of a troublemaker teenage son (played by Alexander Ludwig). The funniest part about this film was not the four main actors, but instead the supporting cast. Taylor Lautner plays the leader of a fraternity that clashes against Sandler, Rock, James, and Spade. He managed to throw some funny dialogue in his scenes. Sandler, Rock, James, and Spade never had any funny lines to say. I was very disappointed by this. The only dialogue these actors give is ridiculous scatological humor that had me rolling my eyes. Then there is Alexander Ludwig, who some might know as Cato in The Hunger Games, playing David Spade's estranged son who acts as a rebel and has the appearance of a punk biker. I found Ludwig to be ill-suited for his character, he was never funny and didn't seem to serve a purpose as David Spade's son. This film is just amateurish when it comes to humor, it has very little laughs and fails to level up with its predecessor.To be honest, I didn't find this film to be as bad as critics say but it was certainly wasn't anywhere near as good as the first film.",Grown Ups 2
42,ketgup83,Do not expect much from the film and you will thoroughly enjoy it at least for once. Timepass !!,6,31 October 2013,"The good part of watching Adam Sandler's films are that they are hilarious, funny and entertaining. The bad part is that some of his films goes over the top and becomes nonsense. Grown up 2 belongs to both category.Lenny moves back to hometown surrounded by childhood buddies Eric , Kurt and Marcus. However, he faces the challenge from old bullies along with new bullies in form of college kids.The hit-pair of Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler is back with no plot, senseless yet entertaining flick which will keep you at bay. There is no such thing as direction , screenplay or subtleness. The movie has few comic scenes in which you will laugh your way out but is strictly OK. The editing is loose. Art direction is nice. Cinematography is average. Background score is decent. It is Adam Sandler , Kevin James and Chris Rock all the way. They make sure the film is watchable at least once.Overall, do not expect much from the film and you will thoroughly enjoy it at least for once. Decent 2.5/5",Grown Ups 2

Reminiscent of later Burt Reynolds movies where he got his buddies around him and just goofed off for 90 minutes or so in front of a camera.

44,blott2319-1,It's as if they were trying to make a terrible movie,1,5 May 2020,"I try to give every movie a chance, because even things regarded as ""the worst ever made"" can sometimes have redeeming qualities that others failed to recognize. I'm even an Adam Sandler and Kevin James apologist and try to give them the benefit of the doubt because I've laughed at many of their movies that critics despised. In fact, I'll go out on a big limb and admit that I didn't despise the first Grown Ups movie. Therefore, it's a sign of the level of failure in Grown Ups 2 that even I will declare that this is easily one of the worst movies ever made. If there's one thing I can compliment in this movie it would be that they don't keep you waiting to discover it is terrible. It took less than 5 minutes to have a pee joke, a poop joke, and a masturbation joke. Literally, the first minute of this film involves a CGI deer urinating all over Adam Sandler. I'd like to say it gets better from there, but at a certain point this movie made me so mad that I envied the deer because I wanted to piss on Adam Sandler.It's vital to point out that there is no story in Grown Ups 2. I kept looking for one, and after the fourth or fifth hour, I realized this movie was going nowhere. I know, you're out there thinking ""but the runtime of this movie only says 101 minutes,"" but I swear this film is so inhumanly awful that it somehow folds space and time to make less than two hours feel like more than two days. My dedication to finishing films was tested to its fullest extent as I paused multiple times for bathroom breaks that I probably didn't need, and even turned off the movie about halfway through and finished the rest on the following day. Anyways, in place of a plot, the film is like a series of failed sketch ideas loosely based around being a father. It's as if someone was sweeping up the floor after the writer's finished the script for the first Grown Ups movie, and decided to save all the rejected ideas for a sequel. These were the ones that were so bad they weren't even considered for the first lame movie, and now they decide to recycle them to amalgamate another script.If it wasn't bad enough that Grown Ups 2 is plot-free and a comedy that isn't funny, it's also wildly offensive. Minorities are mistreated in the film and relegated to broad stereotypical roles. There are a number of jokes at the expense of homosexuals and the transgendered. And the entire film objectifies women from beginning to end. I love how other movies get called out for being insensitive by not casting people of the correct race, and yet something like this can skate by despite the fact that it belittles anyone who isn't an adult white male. The saddest part of writing this review of the film is that I'm looking at the cast list on IMDb at the same time, and it reminds me the amount of talent wasted. There are some truly great actors that appear and none of them gets even a moment to be great. There was not even one joke in Grown Ups 2 that made me chuckle, in fact I was getting progressively more annoyed as they tried and failed. The entire thing is so shoddily made that it feels like it shouldn't even qualify as a movie.In order to truly express the disastrous quality of Grown Ups 2, I feel like breaking down a scene might help. About halfway through the movie, Adam Sandler takes his son (played by Cameron Boyce) out onto the football field while the team is practicing. Now his son is not part of the football team, and there has been no discussion of him wanting to be on the football team, or Adam Sandler wanting him to be on the football team. Yet here he is trying to convince his son to practice kicking field goals. While they do this, a random girl (who has appeared once or twice at most in the film) is on the sideline making an idiot out of herself as a cheerleader just for Cameron Boyce. The kid starts making some field goals and we see the football players pausing their drills in order to watch. So now Adam Sandler decides to rush him and try to create a real-game scenario with a defender in his son's face. As he charges, something in the grass trips him, he falls on Boyce and breaks his leg. That's the joke.I have no idea why this scene exists in the film, and that's why it baffled me so much. It was not setup beforehand, it is referenced only once shortly after when Sandler has to explain to his wife. There is somewhat inspirational or triumphant music played through most of the scene, but this isn't something Boyce was working towards, and kicking field goals does nothing to resolve his character's biggest struggle (which was a bully.) So, then logic would dictate that this scene was included for comedic value. Yet I only count 4 pathetic attempts at comedy: 1) The crazy girl cheering like a fool as if Boyce were in a game and Sandler saying she might have been bit by a spider to make her act that way, 2) Sandler breaks his son's leg, 3) Sandler instantly says ""Don't tell your mother,"" and 4) The football coaches that started watching give up and say ""Oh well, that kid's dead."" I know I'm spending more time thinking about a scene than they did, but it's this kind of pointlessness that makes Grown Ups 2 so infuriating.No one involved in making Grown Ups 2 was an amateur. These writers had worked before, this director has lots of experience, and the cast is loaded with veterans. So, there's really no excuse for making a film that is so incompetent, unless it's simply a broad decision by everyone on set to not care. It seems that no one said ""That's really not that funny."" No one said ""Let me work on that scene so we can make it better."" No one even took the time to ask ""Why is this scene happening?"" It's almost like they went in actively trying to make something unfunny and incoherent, and if that is the case, they were extremely successful. There are many films I have hated in my lifetime, but usually I can see tiny hints at why someone else might like them. Grown Ups 2 is an anomaly, though. Not only can I not see why anyone would like it, I think I'd worry about anyone who told me they did. When people joke about a movie they don't like being played on repeat in Hell, I tend to scoff at their hyperbole, but now that I've seen Grown Ups 2...I understand what they mean.",Grown Ups 2
45,phubbs,Grown Ups 2,3,30 October 2013,"Really? a sequel? by now I'm sure we all know what happened and how this film somehow managed to sail high in the charts beating 'Pacific Rim'. Obviously Mr Sandler has a strong core fanbase that will endure anything he throws at them, and boy does he throw some stuff!.The plot is errr...geez I dunno really, there isn't a plot, this film is virtually one skit after another much like SNL. We are still following Sandler's character and his hectic family life, alongside him we are also still following the lives of his best friends too...and that's it. The only thing is there isn't really any point to what happens throughout, its just one set up for a silly childish joke, then on to the next silly childish set up.I guess this wouldn't be too bad if the jokes were funny, you look at classic spoof films like 'Naked Gun' or 'Airplane' and they are merely a collection of visual gag set ups. This film is the same accept the gags are tired, unoriginal and infantile, basically your standard toilet and sexual functions humour. Believe it or not but I actually found this sequel slightly enjoyable in places and better than the first, yep that's right. The main reason for this was the quite horrendously cringe worthy performance by Taylor Lautner and his snobby frat pack which was pure parody excellence. The other reason was the party finale where everybody dresses up in fancy dress, yet they all looked really good haha. Seriously they just looked really good, especially the guy as Tom Cruise from 'Risky Business'. Plus I must also give kudos for the big punch up in the finale which is completely farcical but a definite guilty pleasure in terms of sheer lunacy.I guess it gives you what you pay for, its not like anyone won't know what they're getting themselves into when they go to see this. You see an Adam Sandler film for certain reasons and this film delivers those reasons. So on one level it does its job, the problem is, it is pure pointless garbage in all honesty. The fart and belch gags with James were the worst thing in this film, I mean really Kevin...I thought you were a better comedian than that.3.5/10",Grown Ups 2
46,adamscastlevania2,Lazy beyond words,1,15 September 2014,"(2%) Truly dire in almost every way, but then again you already knew that. How, when and who spread the myth that creating good comedy was easy? Because it's not, in fact it is very, very difficult, more difficult truth be told than any other type of film-making, and this here is one of the laziest, slackest, most bone idle pieces of crap to come from the bowels of Hollywood since Transformers 2, actually this is lazier than even that toilet blocker. Adam Sandler probably burnt only 3 calories making the entire film as he spouts the garbage he and his two (that's right, it was written by 3 people) moronic writing buddies crayoned into the script. The tyre scene is ripped strait from a 1990's Beavis and Butt-head episode, the editing is beyond terrible as cuts between each awful segment to the next like a rubbish failed TV clip show, and it gets really boring at times, I zoned out almost constantly. There are one or two mildly funny parts, but I'd get better laughs from about one minute of a Simpsons episode than I'd get from this movies entire length. Lastly this turd of a film made $200 million at the box office proving cinema goers get exactly the movies they deserve.",Grown Ups 2
47,tbills2,"Grown Ups 2's better than Grown Ups! (Well, it's funnier, making it better from a comedy perspective but I haven't seen Grown Ups in so long that maybe the first one is actua",5,6 January 2015,"(...No, Grown Ups 2 is better, for a comedy.) I really love this movie. It's a great comedy; it's so consistently real and happy (Happy Madison productions :)) and funny. The jokes are performed with complete understanding of funny. (Funny is as funny goes) It is great, from a comedic standpoint. A great 5. It is so great as a comedy, that I can say, Grown Ups 2 is great. This might be the funniest full cast ever for a movie. It's clearly the funniest looking. Adam Sandler, David Spade, Chris Rock, Kevin James, and Nick Swardson, I mean without all of the smoking babes around this is like a trip to the freak show. (Nooo, I only joke around.) These funny men are reasonably handsome men (handsome like a horse). Adam Sandler may be a little on the fugly side, but fugly is sexy. Did you see this hunking heartthrob in Spanglish!?! Ya, me neither. (Just kidding! :)) Spade is just plain attractive. I'm totally saying David Spade is attractive as a heterosexual male. I am in no way gay, and I'm definitely not gay for Spade. I'm not. I'm not! You're gay for Spade. (I'm straight here people.) Chris Rock looks like one hell of an appealing skinny Danny Glover. Kevin James is a big and cuddly cute manbear. (I'm not! What are you thinking?) And Nick Swardson is a delicious boy toy treat. But that's not for me to decide. The women on the other hand (the left hand), are very lovely. Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph for starters, and who else? Cheri O'Teri and the hot blonde ballet teacher. (That's who else!) And there's all sorts of other tasty eye candy and the hot blonde ballet teacher is the sweetest sight of all (of all the tempting scoops of delectable ocular sugar snacks on display in this very pleasant viewing), except for the female star candy. Yes! The hot blonde ballet teacher is megahot and all, way super attractive physically, but not in the same league as these other women stars. (Kinda) Cheri O'Teri is always looking cute and always being funny but in Grown Ups 2 O'Teri just looks hot, really, like I've never seen her before. (I'm not, really!) Maya Rudolph is really fine, so wacky, but still, really fine. (Very funny too. SNL usually has funny people.) Maria Bello is pretty, pretty, fine, fine. (PPFF) She should of had a little more screen time. (Just a little, not much.) Yes. Salma Hayek...uh...uhhhhh she's hot too. There's a bevy (bevy? what the..) of funny people (Hey, Funny People, Adam Sandler! Okay, I am gay, I admit to it) whom make hilarious appearances. Tim Meadows, Jon Lovitz, Stonecold Steve Austin, Colin Quinn and the big fella, of course, Shaquille O'Neal. Shaq is impressively really good on screen, he absolutely is in the same ballpark of funny (or arena I should say) as all these other SNL legends (and Kevin James) and it shows. If Shaq was not the most dominating big man force scoring points in the paint on the hardwood floor in the history of professionalized basketball, then he could totally score parts as an actor (even as an unknown!). Shaq is great. Stonecold Steve Austin, Mr. Lovitz and funny guy Tim Meadows are great too. So are Colin Quinn, the fat principal in a little shirt (Where are you, Chris Farley?) the kids and Taylor Lautner and the crazy college kids. I would love to see Jon Lovitz face off against Stonecold Steve Austin in the wrestling ring. I would pay to see that. (I don't think Jon would be winning!) Meadows is generally underestimated and basically under-appreciated. (Basically.) Colin Quinn plays the spiteful and defeated by life ice cream server who serves up nasty little chocolate special. (Colin Quinn should get that comedian forum show he had on Comedy Central again where they talked about socially relevant current events with clever satire so that I can be meagerly amused for 5 minutes a week when I actually watch the show; that would be nice.) The fat principal in a little shirt is pretty funny. Taylor Lautner and the crazy college kids are drinkers and in a fraternity. Is there anybody I forgot? (Norm MacDonald?) I feel like somebody is missing. (Rob Schneider?) Guess not. This is an outstanding kids' movie (outstanding) but there are more than a few enjoyable parts for adults. Grown Ups 2 has such comedic balls that it totally delivers dedicated bit after dedicated bit, and I love all the mature sex appeal. (Nick Swardson has the best stand up. His grandmother thinks he's so strong because he can lift up milk cartons. Lol! Chris Rock...uh, his standup is good too. Adam Sandler, now Adam Sandler's stand up is actua",Grown Ups 2
48,Anurag-Shetty,A funny movie that's marred by too much potty humor.,7,15 September 2013,"Grown Ups 2 continues with the story of four childhood friends who are now grown up, Lenny Feder(Adam Sandler), Eric Lamonsoff(Kevin James), Kurt McKenzie(Chris Rock) & Marcus Higgins(David Spade). Lenny moves back to his hometown with his wife, Roxanne Chase-Feder(Salma Hayek) & kids, Greg(Jake Goldberg), Keithie(Cameron Boyce) & Becky Feder(Alexys Nycole Sanchez) to be closer to his friends. He soon realizes that, the pool where him & his friends used to swim when they were kids has been taken over by a couple of douche-y frat boys led by Andy(Taylor Lautner). Lenny, Eric, Kurt & Marcus decide to fight for their pool. What I've said above, is pretty much the film's plot. So, take the plot & add a lot of suggestive humor & potty humor & that's Grown Ups 2 in a nutshell. This movie is hilarious. I was laughing almost all the time. However, the potty humor really gets sickening after a certain point. Especially the 'burpsnarting'. The suggestive humor is the highlight of the film. It will leave you in splits. Adam Sandler is great as Lenny Feder. Kevin James is impressive as Eric Lamonsoff. Chris Rock is spectacular as Kurt McKenzie. David Spade is mind blowing as Marcus Higgins. Salma Hayek is outstanding as Roxanne Chase-Feder. Maya Rudolph is brilliant as Deanne McKenzie. Maria Bello is effective as Sally Lamonsoff. The kids are effective too. Shaquille O'Neal is hysterical as Officer Fluzoo. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as the Squats Fitness Janitor. Oliver Hudson is charming as gay fitness trainer, Kyle. Nick Swardson, Steve Buscemi, Colin Quinn & Peter Dante are brilliant as Nick, Wiley, Dickie Bailey & Officer Dante respectively. A special mention should be made for Taylor Lautner who is hilarious in his cameo as Frat Boy Andy.

They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is probably the worst of the SNL-cast sequels, with nothing to laugh at, yet heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last.

I haven't given an Adam Sandler movie a full recommendation since Funny People, not I am not one of those Sandler haters. In all honesty, not all of them are that bad. Case in point: Grown Ups 2. Of course, the critics hated it. But I actually thought it had its moments.Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and the majority of the cast are back the second time around. This time everyone is living in their hometown. Sandler's wife (Salma Hayak, who still looks fantastic) wants a baby, and there are plenty of other shenanigans. The main story (there really isn't a plot in all honesty) revolves around a group of frat boys (led by Taylor Lautner, finally doing something decent) whose territory is trashed and assume it's Sandler and crew.Like its predecessor, there isn't exactly a plot. It is a lot of shenanigans, and they are enjoyable to watch. This obviously doesn't rank up there with Sandler's funniest comedies, such as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, or The Wedding Singer, but it also isn't on Jack and Jill territory. That is good enough for me.The sequel has plenty of funny moments, but then again not all of them work. I just wish that Sandler and his friends would realize that farts and pee aren't funny. Who, besides a ten year old, laughs at that still? It is something was wasn't funny then, and I know I get really tired of it now. Grown Ups 2 needs a better story and a few other things. It honestly isn't that bad. I'm just glad it isn't Jack and Jill or That's My Boy. I hope we never have to see Sandler go there again. Ever again.B-",Grown Ups 2

54,Rickting,It doesn't get much worse than this,1,25 July 2015,"Adam Sandler wakes up. He looks around. Everything is fine. Everything is completely OK. This moron's life is perfect. He looks to the side. His wife is asleep. He turns to the other side. A poorly rendered CGI deer has wandered into his house and is now in his bedroom observing him. What are the chances of the deer being there right when he wakes up. Instead of just waiting for the deer to leave like sensible people would, he instead asks his wife to open the window which is too small for the deer to get through. After a couple of requests, his wife, played by Salma Hayek (what's an Oscar nominated actress doing in this movie?), irritably gets up, sees the deer and screams loudly. The frightened deer then rears up unrealistically on its hind legs and urinates all over Adam Sandler's face. What?! The deer then runs from the room and music starts playing. That's when you realize that this gag, less funny than Schindler's List, will be the first 5 minutes of Grown Ups 2. This is possibly the best scene of the film.Grown Ups was awful, but this makes that look like Some Like It Hot. There is literally no plot. The closest thing to a coherent plot thread is Kevin James repeatedly doing Burpsnarts (Burping, sneezing and then farting) throughout the movie. The 4 unlikable man-childs played by Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade go around their home town and encounter a bunch of excruciatingly unfunny skits such as David Spade rolling through town in a fake looking tyre, policemen being immature, a whole load of sexism and homophobia, bodily functions, comic violence and worst of all mean spirited gags cruelly making fun of some of the less intelligent characters in the film. Am I supposed to laugh as Shaquille O'Neal plays the world's dumbest cop, Nick Swardson humiliates himself repeatedly, poops in a supermarket and makes out with a dog and the deer from the beginning bites Taylor Lautner's crotch? A poorly directed, atrociously written and unbearable comedy fest which is more painful than a Saw torture machine, GU2 shows Adam Sandler achieving the impressive feat of outdoing himself; burdening us all with yet another rock bottom comedy which is arguably just as bad as 2011's Jack and Jill.0/10",Grown Ups 2

The entire film felt like throwaway jokes or deleted scenes from the first movie poorly edited together to create a movie that barely feels like a sequel. There's literally no story or plot going on (which leads me to believe the script was written in crayon and is three pages long--two of the pages are bad drawings of robots and dinosaurs fighting). The film is just an unbearable string of poorly contrived skits that center around awful throwback jokes, attempts at being gross with some lame bodily function gags and Nick Swardson trying way too be hard to be funny and, as usual, failing in a spectacular way.""Grown Ups 2"" goes out of its way to set up a ton of potential plot lines but then has no idea what to do with them. So, they all ended up being lazily resolved in a rapid fire sequence in the final act of the film and proving to the viewer that no time or effort was taken in making this movie.This film is a slap in the face to even the lowest of the low comedies in existence and is just a straight up insult to the very world of cinema.

It's very dumbfounding that this gets a 1 score when the first movie Is equally bad. It's like, what did u expect after watching the first one? A masterpiece? I do hope not. After the first movie it could only go downhill as with 99% of bad comedy sequels.
Now here's the thing. There are other people then me and those who dislikes a movie. There's them that enjoy this very light poop humour. Like Children perhaps",Grown Ups 2
60,HelenMary,funny but not brilliant. unsatisfying comedy.,5,7 February 2014,"The team of Sandler, Rock, James and Spade's ensemble cast don't bring anything new or surprising, and whilst it is unquestionably funny it's not intelligent and without the point or the emotional interest of the first one.I enjoyed the experience of the film but it was unsatisfactory and unmemorable. Usually Adam Sandler's films are funny but they have some sort of message, or heart to give it depth. David Spade played his normal character (see Rules of Engagement) and Chris Rock also played his typical loud self, like anything is funny if it's shouted. Much of the comedy came from the antics of the frat boys - (uncredited) Taylor Lautner and also a Schwarzenegger, as well as Shaquille O'Neal as the funny cop. Also Beefcake Kitty had some great parts.The SFX were pretty poor, as was the sound quality, and the entire film had a sort of poor-man quality about it like no-one was trying really hard and doing shoddy work. It was an unsatisfying sequel, certainly not as good as the first instalment.",Grown Ups 2
61,backup-50362,"I kept hearing about terrible Adam Sandler movies, surely people were exaggerating",4,8 September 2019,"This has a star cast of awesome people that I like, and it's supposed to be a light-hearted comedy - so I watched it hoping to have a nice escape from this hellish joke we call life and have my few laughs of the year.2 minutes in I was already thinking ""Wow, is this really a 2013 movie? Is this what the whole movie will be like? Really tired, ridiculous, basic low-IQ jokes that were already unfunny in the 90's?""You know those terrible overdone cliches where people are screaming over-the-top at ""outrageous slapstick scenarios"" and it's supposed to be comedy - this movie still does that, alot.It really is as bad as everyone in the reviews says and I can't believe those movies are financially successful, I guess there's no hope for humankind.The really sad part is after skipping half of the movie it got kind of good near the end - I actually laughed a few times and enjoyed some jokes. I think the main problem is they should've removed all the garbage jokes that the viewer is bombarded with in the beginning. Just stop with those lame gags. I see your budget is massive and you can do all sorts of effects, you can probably afford better writers also.If you want to watch a formulated, soulless rehash of every tired movie cliche ever - this is your movie. It has it all - ""awkward teenagers"" chasing girls, generic fat bullies, wives drooling over a fitness instructor, beta male husbands being cringey, highschool parties, wild animals charging at a man's privates, kicks in the balls, etc. You've seen it all done better but this time -- the budget is really high and they have celebs which sadly changes nothing.",Grown Ups 2
62,rollernerd,Feels like a burpsnarting,5,29 October 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy flick sequel Grown Ups 2 (2013) where we see Sandman and his SNL alumni pals come again for another reunion (except for Rob Schneider) where they move into their home town and try to rehash their own lives while confronting their own challenges including facing fears, realising you have a grown son, going back to work and whether one can do the ultimate ""burpsnarting"" the burping, sneezing and farting all at once method. The movie doesn't hold up to the first. Shaq man deliver funny moments, the bus driver sleeping in the Kmart bed was hilarious and the fight scene at the end was funny but not as great as Anchorman. The script doesn't provide any creative comedic displays and sometimes feels lazy and always targets humour around human faeces and belittling either women or different races. Doesn't stoke up to the first flick and the weird first scene with the deer in the house was sign of this. Overall 5/10",Grown Ups 2
63,cinephile-27690,Why was this my 3rd time seeing this?,5,18 July 2018,"I like Adam Sandler. Sue me, I do. I also like the first Grown Ups, and it was one of the few PG-13 movies I could see at the time. I saw this one once and it was alright. Then I saw it with a friend and liked it better. Now, it's just okay.I counted 32 pee, poo, and other sick jokes. The credits start at 94 minutes, so a character makes a scatological or gross joke every 2.9 minutes on average. I do not hate this movie, but I do not care for it either.When a whole gag is a man fixing a chocolate ice cream and it looks like he's crapping all over the machine, or a cough/sneeze/burp at once-like 3 times, and other sick jokes, I can't say I enjoyed it, and I know I am being WAY too kind to it, but I ALSO know that it sucks.94*3=282 minutes of my life I have spent on this. I apologize for spending 4 hours and 42 minutes of my life on this. To be fair, I have spent well over 1,050 minutes-over a day, on Stand By Me.But yes, it's stupid, and What The Flick! on YouTube opened my eyes that this sucks. Oh, and by the way, I laughed twice at most.I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore and a few other Sandler movies. But this, Sandler's first sequel, sucks. It just medicorely sucks.

This movie is what happens when someone wants to cash in on the success of a previous movie, but they have nothing in mind worth creating. What do you get? You get a bunch of 5-10 minute skits all thrown together into a soup dish and most do not make sense or have any input into what you would call the central story. Mentioning central story even is a joke since there really isn't one in this film. What the production team did was find something central to a few of the dumb skits and tried to play on them as the central story.Comedy? Nothing is really funny in this movie. The jokes have been seen in other movies and there is nothing original or nothing old told in a way that would make it funny again.

While the first movie had an actual plot, solid development, and endless laughs, the sequel was really just a stupid attempt at a cash in from the first film's greatness. The kids were too prominent in the film and all are horrible actors so that hurt the film quite a bit. The plot was pretty stupid. The main four lacked the same chemistry they had in the first one. Honestly, the only reason this movie was even watchable, and barely, was because of the cameos. Nick Swardson provided almost all of the humor, and guys like Peter Dante, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Buscemi, and so many more were great as well. There were some smoking hot women in the film too, so that didn't hurt, but honestly, I was very disappointed in this film.",Grown Ups 2
67,ssvikas,A funny pastime flick with tons of actors but without any real plot,5,18 September 2013,"Three years after the first 'Grown Ups' movie, Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) has joined his old friends Eric Lamensoff (Kevin James), Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) and Marcus Higgins (David Spade) after moving back to his hometown along with his wife Roxane (Salma Hayek) and kids. Soon, they need to deal with funny situations involving their old friends and the local college frat boys. Looking at it critically, the film could have just begun anywhere and ended up nowhere! Wait, no story? Are you kidding me? How can a movie exist without a central plot or a conflict that works itself out in the end? Well, they do it in 'Grown Ups 2' which credits Adam Sandler as one of the writers!The movie has numerous themes, like the issues of teenage kids of the lead characters who get into funny situations, a couple of them involving dating. Then, there are some gags involving accidents, baldness, farts, etc. which are not entirely unusual. And the kids and the grownups have a run-in with some college boys over the use of a secluded lake. And there's a scene involving a funny car-wash! 'Grown Ups 2' has a massive star-cast. Along with those already mentioned here, there's Twilight's Taylor Lautner playing one of the frat boys, the tall basketball star Shaquille O'Neal playing a cop and there is wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin who has been cast as a former school bully with a sizzling girlfriend (April Rose) who doubles up as a ballet teacher to one of Lenny Feder's kids. The movie tries hard to be funny. Take that incident involving a heavily drugged bus driver using the bed and toilet on display at a K-mart. Another one involves Lamensoff's lame gag that combines a burp, sneeze and a fart. A scene of a deer pissing on Sandler is extremely lame brand of humor. When you know that the film has Adam Sandler in it, you know the sort of humor that the film would have.Nonetheless, 'Grown Ups 2' also has its funny moments too. Some of its original but adult humor involves the faux exercise routine for the film's women. Also, the fact that Salma Hayek can pull of a glamorous role in her late forties is noteworthy! And the scene showing the attack by the Frat Boys led by Lautner, one tends to ask 'Hey, why isn't he turning into a werewolf?'Verdict: Movies like 'Grown Ups 2' are those that are lazily made; imagine a movie without even a real plot. As such, it won't make it worthwhile to visit to visit the big screen and pay big bucks. It has its share of fart jokes, but guess what, watching this film isn't altogether regrettable either. You could as well enjoy this on a lazy weekend when there seems nothing better to do.",Grown Ups 2
68,achyutaghosh,Witless. Unfunny. Perverted. Gross,3,22 October 2013,"When it comes to movies, two negatives do not make a positive. A sequel of a bad movie is invariably bad, no matter the number of stars in it, or its marketing budget. Grown Ups 2 is a real case study of the above fact. While the first movie was nothing to write home about, it still had its moments of stupid fun- a reunion of a bunch of midlife crisis facing middle aged men. This one though is just a canvas of incredibly unconnected scenes, involving Adam Sandler and his cohorts, indulging in jokes that only includes farts, crap, vomit, drool, racial slurs, and of course the staple of this breed of films- breasts. And all this under the guise of family values, parenthood and a coming of age comedy.Connect these- a peeing deer, a blood feud with a group of teenagers, a biting-dancing baby, a frat party. Tough, eh? Because there is no plot to speak of. But speaking of cohorts, Sandler has thrown the kitchen sink here- every Tom, Dick and Harry who usually appear in Happy Madison films feature here, and then some more. In addition to the original cast of Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Maya Rudolph, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello are joined this time by a surprisingly hilarious Taylor Lautner, Steve Austin, Shaquille O'Neal, Milo Ventimiglia, and rest of the Sandler family among others. In fact it is star power that kept this Titanic afloat. That this movie made USD 240 million dollars, more than the hundred times better Pacific Rim released on the same day- is an incredible travesty of a statistic, and a testament to the stupidity of today's audience. A couple of laughs here, and a couple of laughs there, but mostly witless, unfunny, perverted and gross, it is an incredibly boorish watch for any audience.3/10 for star-power only!",Grown Ups 2
69,CMTiago,"Insulting at times, barely tolerable in others",6,13 July 2014,"As a teen I get what this movie is trying to accomplish with people my age. Since I'm not totally brain dead, I wouldn't consider this to be a high standard of cinema, but still there are certain traits of my youth that made me laugh during this movie. This is an offensive and sometimes obnoxious movie with very cruel and misdirected jokes. An then there are scenes that are just outright disgusting. So in short, what I liked about this movie was the more family friendly jokes, some of the women's more sexual appeal (sue me, I'm a man), and a surprisingly funny role for Taylor Lautner. Other than that, this is one of the weakest Sandler movies ever, and I'm trying to stand by him, I really am, but at this point it seems like he's just not putting in the effort and simply doesn't care anymore. I hope I can see another good Adam Sandler movie in the future, because I know he can deliver.Rating: 6/10",Grown Ups 2
70,atzimo,"Funny, Silly, Fun",10,27 October 2014,"I almost didn't watch this one because of all the bad reviews. Grown Ups 2 is the best Adam Sandler comedy since a LONG time. Much better than the first Grown Ups. It's full of silliness and good fun. All the favourite cameos are the jokes are constant.All the bad reviews are void to what these comedies represent; you have to be in that wavelength to enjoy the movie. Don#t bother if Adam Sandler annoys you, this movie is not for you.So here's the deal; if you enjoy the old Adam Sandler movies, like the Waterboy, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, this is the 2013 equivalent.

72,rjsf96,One of the worst atrocities ever put to film.,1,5 October 2013,"Wow. So it has come to this Grown Ups 2. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but just to make things clear I don't hate Adam Sandler. Not all of his movies are this horrific, but because of the crimes that this puts to film, it makes a very strong case of reasons to dislike Adam Sandler.Well, I can't say that I was surprised by how bad it was, as after watching the trailer, my expectations were pretty much rock bottom. You know that when a movie starts with a deer peeing into multiple people's faces, it isn't going to be the comedy of the year. But, this movie isn't even trying, I think I genuinely laughed (not out of pity) about twice in the movie and the laughs were attributed to Taylor Lautner (this is not a good thing).I advise anyone who is even considering watching this movie to avoid it like the plague, and if you find anyone on this earth, heck even anyone in this universe who likes it to punch them in the face. There are countless gags in the movie but anyone over the age of 12 will not find them funny, this is basically a film with endless potty jokes and it really is only for the simple minded.When I was in the cinema it felt like Grown Ups 2 was playing for a year, I would check my watch every 10 minutes or so to see when this hellish film would end, but alas it continued to drone on and on and on So if you find yourself in the cinema watching Grown Ups 2, don't say I didn't warn you. Walk out of the cinema and watch any film and I'm almost certain it will be funnier than this steaming hot mess.But you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if that within the next 3 years there will be a Grown Ups 3, and that movie will be even more distasteful than the last, with poop and fart jokes every 30 seconds. But if anyone is wise enough to not give Adam Sandler and his friends any of your well-deserved cash or time then maybe we will avoid this atrocity for the next half decade if we have any luckVerdict: If you can even call this distasteful comedy a comedy then I don't think you have seen one. By the end of it you'll realise that the only people who are laughing are Adam Sandler and his friends as they rake in the big bucks, for what is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year.",Grown Ups 2

74,CowherPowerForever,Almost Pointless,4,22 July 2013,Well the title of my review for Grown Ups 2 says it all. This film was basically pointless. While there is some humor in the film overall this doesn't make you laugh as much as the first film did. The story seems nonexistent with Sandler and company just push along a boat of nothing for ninety five minutes or so.The acting in films such as these usually aren't anything to brag about and Grown Ups 2 does nothing to change that mold. However most of the actors are real life friends and they do have a chemistry that does add something to the film. But really overall there is no reason to see this movie just for its acting.As I mentioned above I enjoyed the first movie. The jokes happened more often and were so much more funny than in this film. This was the first sequel for Adam Sander and it should probably be his last. The story runs along hoping to find something similar to the first film but nothing ever happens and when the film ends you are truly asking yourself was there even a story here? Or were those guys just running around for ninety five minutes trying to be funny. And sadly even the jokes aren't that funny this time around. The farting jokes and the urine jokes control this film as expected but outside of those the laugh factor is almost not there at all.So overall this film is basically not worth watching. The first film Grown Ups made you laugh a lot more and actually had a story that kept you interested to a point. This film was a mess almost from the start and never picks up. Outside of some laughs here and there there is no point to watch this. So please stay away from this film.,Grown Ups 2
75,The_moan_of_all_moans,Worse than toothache.,1,13 August 2013,"90 minutes of my life...just gone. Never to be retrieved...gone. As the minutes went by I grasped onto the fading hope that it was going to get better but before I knew it an hour and a half had been and gone.It is without question one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yet it is successful; is it me? Have i .....grown up? Am i humourless? Now to investigate further i watched ""This is the End"" a couple of weeks ago and it was excellent; i laughed through the majority of the film; it was superb. I love Airplane, Naked Gun, Dumb and Dumber, Anchorman amongst many others; and they are smothered in silly comedy. So what is wrong then.....Behind all of those films are creative geniuses; people who come up with scenarios and situations that others can't. Does Sandler have that same asset? No, he doesn't; he uses jokes that a 5 year old could make, he relies on toilet humour and outlandish, ridiculous events; he doesn't have a innovative bone in his body anymore. A personal vendetta against Sandler? I loved Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Waterboy, Wedding Singer, Bulletproof and despite harsh feedback i liked Funny People. Those films are long gone and now we're stuck with Jack and Jill, That's My Boy, Grown Ups and of course it's rotten sequel. He has been accused of being lazy and comparing his past work to now i can see why. And what better way to revive your past glories than by surrounding yourself with fellow has beens. Chris Rock hasn't been relevant since..... well since... i can't remember. Kevin James tries to bring life to the film, but due to the dire dialogue he has, he sinks with the rest of them. And David Spade continues to dig deeper into irrelevance. The 1/10 is for the efforts of Nick Swarsdon who has blatant potential to be a comedy star of the future, unless of course he continues to be Sandler's human cannonball.Due to the money this film has brought in it is clear that i am a minority, but that i can't understand. It just isn't funny; Admittedly morbid, but i think i would have more chance of laughing at a funeral than at this. Would take a violent case of toothache for 90 minutes than watch this again.In conclusion, if you are easily amused by farts and chocolate ice cream symbolising excrement for example, then this may well be the movie for you.1/10",Grown Ups 2

The sequel seemed like the actors where cashing in, and we gave up watching after about forty minutes (over a third of the film) without anything really keeping us from doing so. The ""plot"" is Lenny (Sandler) moving his family back to his childhood neighbourhood to be with his childhood friends, following the first film, and it never seemed to move from there (maybe it took a hour to get going?). All the pretext about their previous lives - his Hollywood career, his wife's fashion career, and the aggravations they cause, etc - seems to have vanished, and instead it's just toilet humour all round.

They are in a state of prepetual reflection > back to particularly unremarkable scenes of teenhood in a very boring town. Sandler runs into an old school nemesis, while he's screwing around at the K-Mart. Somehow the schoolyard bully found out that Adam was saying bad things about him. This becomes a major plot point.

I tend to enjoy almost any film that is thrown in my direction for some reason or another. Grown Ups had a few laughs which put the label of 'Alright' on it. Below average, but watchable.Grown Ups 2, however, is the worst film I have ever watched. Seriously, if you can find a film that is more terrible than Grown Ups 2, please enlighten me. I mean, was this wrote by a five year old? Who can tell. The humour is astoundingly bad, there simply isn't a plot or a moral to the story and the entire film will just leave you cringing. I know one or two people who would like this, but those people also have the worst sense of humour that I have ever encountered.How this was released, I do not know. It is simply a terrible film and I cannot find one good aspect about it. And to think Adam Sandler was once a good actor for a few years. 1/10. Never gave that to a film before. At least, not that I can remember.",Grown Ups 2
83,mystic80,Dogshit,1,25 August 2014,"There's no other way to describe such a terrible movie.For years, Adam Sandler has been the scourge of film critics. But speaking as someone who grew up on Sandler from his days on SNL and his ingenious comedy albums to his explosive film career, I was a fan. Sandler unleashes the inner child in all of us. The ones who don't mind a goofy slapstick comedy with gags and babes. Sandler taps into the adolescent rage that can affect anyone, particular males 13 years old and up. This theme was put to its maximum in ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Big Daddy"", which granted, aren't the greatest films on the level of a Fellini or Scorsese movie. However, they did the trick and kept you entertained consistently. Plus there was a story in there somewhere.Then came ""Little Nicky"", which had potential but it was buried under bullshit. I will only have contempt for people who can only take a concept so far and then not care about the film by the third act. With ""Little Nicky"", the movie's laziness shows in the film's post title card ending. It's as if Sandler didn't care anymore and had the balls to actually release it in theaters like that, to paying customers. The film, despite its potential and parade of cameos, burned in Hell at the box office. I was disappointed. Sandler seemed to be back on the mend with ""Mr. Deeds"" but I think that overall run was short lived. As if ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" with its contrived ending featuring puppies was bad enough, came ""Jack & Jill"", a film so painfully bad that a trip to the dentist without novocaine is more enlightening. I won't write about its awfulness, which you can see throughout the web.""Grown Ups 2"" is nowhere near as bad as the 2011 film, but it's a stinker to high heaven. It's something that I don't know if I'd want to flush down the toilet in fear of wasting my money. ""Grown Ups 2"" tries to have a message about the meaning of community, the importance of family and the camaraderie of friends. Those messages are presented in between bits of chocolate ice cream being poured out to look like a grown man is crapping and the cartoonish frat boy villains in the film that make you want to drown yourself. The company, especially Sandler, stood to make a fortune and I can assure you that they did since the movie made a lot of money at the box office. What money Sandler makes in residuals alone, is more than I'll see in a lifetime. I'm clearly in the minority since his films still retain their popularity. But the one thing they're missing that Sandler's earlier work had in ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""The Waterboy"" is simple: a quality comedy I'm not expecting Sandler's work to be ""Sullivan's Travels"" with the frat boy humor and dick & fart jokes. But what I am asking, is not to be treated as if I'm a complete idiot. What ""Grown Ups 2"" does, is take a half assed script, toss it in with a bunch of comics with a gift for ad libbing and churns out a piece of junk food loaded with so many preservatives that you wish you could get in a time machine, go back in time and make sure you never saw said piece of junk food. The chances of Sandler and company reading this, is few and far between but if they were to, I would say ""You're losing your touch fellas. The movie may have been a box office hit but I can assure you that people thought it really sucked."" I can only hope that Sandler, who has a couple movies on the horizon that sound really interesting, can rebound and not give us this film. Watching the image of Nick Swardson's poorly conceived and possibly challenged bus driver parade through this movie in a mullet and dirty undies, is just disturbing. The cherry on top is the character craps in a toilet in a blatant Kmart ad in the movie. There was a critic who suggested that Sandler should move away from his repertory of players and do something different. I couldn't agree more. I was really impressed with Sandler teaming up with buddy Judd Apatow for ""Funny People"". That film, despite it's length, was decent and Sandler in many respects, satirizes his career. I only wish that came after ""Grown Ups 2"".Adam Sandler, I'm still a fan but dude, make something that's actually good. Make something like ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Big Daddy"", something that knew how to entertain without the constant poop jokes or the obvious ad libbing.",Grown Ups 2
84,fluturoj,Nonsense,4,4 August 2016,"This movie was bad in many many points. There was no real plot or real story-line. There was also no message or lesson that makes you think or reflect. It felt like scenes, scenes from an unrelated movie. There was unnecessary violence and unpleasant scenes. Did those who made the movie even go to high school? Because it did seem to me that they had no clue how it really is. Why did they even make a part two. Despite its terrible plot, and all the issues it did sometimes out of no where made you laugh and that's one good point only that I could see. Personally, I am starting to feel that whenever I watch an Adam Sandler movie I am terribly let down and I might say that properly I'll stay away from his movies in the future. Lets also not discuss how the characters and the stories where far far away from real life and what would actually happen. I wouldn't recommend it and in case you do watch it do not expect much from this movie because you will be let down.",Grown Ups 2
85,DJ_Shilo,Shameful and Disgusting,2,14 July 2020,"Who would have thought Adam Sandler would make a sequel to ""Grown Ups,"" after making money at the box office. It was effusively stupid with Adam Sandler and his buddies acting like tools for 1hr 42 Mins. There were some giggles to it, and it tried to show a family element that did work, however, with all the fart jokes intact. Rob Schneider and the older woman was funny with the ""Saskatoon"" joke that made me howl because I am Canadian. So, Adam Sandler is back for the cash-grab sequel with ""Grown Ups 2,"" It's shockingly worse than the original and one of the worst comedies from beginning to end. If you can make it through the opening with a scared deer flaunting a hot pink bra on its antlers that proceeds to piss on Sandler, you're watching the right movie and should not watch anything else.It's about Lenny Fader (Adam Sandler who moved his family back to New England so he can be closer to his childhood friends, Eric (Kevin James), Higgins (David Spade) and Kurt (Chris Rock). The four friends spend the day realizing they are not in their twenties anymore and deal with the day to day lives of being married with kids.""Grown Ups"" was not a terrible comedy, and it got a lot of flack for merely being an Adam Sandler comedy, which I don't like was wholly fair and was unjust. Granted, Sandler is known for cash-grabs, but the original film had its heart in the right place, and the aspect of family was pleasant. The crude humour was typical and unfunny, and it wasn't great by any means but nowhere near as bad as his previous films. I even gave small praise to Rob for not playing his usual idiot and playing a somewhat funny character. Rob won a Razzie for his performance in the original movie because of his past comedies, which is also unjust to signal him out like that.Only in an Adam Sandler movie would it open with a deer pissing on someone's face if you missed it before. Sandler scares the hell out of a deer, and it proceeds to copiously piss on his face before it takes off down a hallway, and he chases after it. Who would've thought a deer would run into a bathroom, use its antlers to whip open the curtains to Sandler's kid showering? He screams, and the Deer haunches up and starts pissing on him as well. I suppose one should expect this humour from Sandler and his usual partner in crime, director Dennis Dugan who still can't make a good movie, which is why he has stuck to Sandler for the last two decades. Merely put, Sandler's films make money, and it's an easy win for him with no ambition or talent to show for it. It's a shameful easy w n for both of them.I think the film picks up around three years after the original, which I hope and pray ""Grown Ups 3"" is not what happened in between those years. Anyway, Lenny has moved his family back and I'm assuming it's too be closer to his buddies, It's never really told. Essentially, the film is a series of situations, and the crude jokes get crammed in throughout. Lenny and his buddies spend the day trying to relive their adolescent days while seeing how much the world has changed since their time with years behind them. I can agree with the aspects of feeling old and trying to feel young again in an ever-changing world, especially when you were born before the Internet and Cell Phones. It's sometimes not easy to get used too. If this is what the screenwriters were going for, I will give them credit, but I don't think they were. Kevin James and several fart scenes say otherwise, and a rolling tire scene resulting in a gruesome vomit scene also says otherwise.They decided to make this film disgusting for laughs beyond me, and its comedy is about as juvenile as you can get. One of the characters is a coach, and he throws a ball at a horribly acted and annoying kid who raps every time he talks. The coach says, ""Who wants to watch me climb a rope?"" He proceeds to climb a rope in the gym while the camera pans under him, wearing short shorts that do not cover his parts very well, and it's disgusting. The dicky character gets tricked into hitting an ice cream machine and chocolate ice cream splats under him, you get the idea.Taylor Lautner is an embarrassing joke as a frat idiot who has the intelligence of a child and, for some reason, likes smacking his equal idiot friend on the ass. Legendary Basketball hall of fame, Shaq is in the picture, and he is quite funny as a larger than life cop of sorts. I did laugh one when one of the dumb sorority sisters starts nogging Shaq's brothers to which Shaq grabs him and noogies him, and the kid says, ""My Brain! My Brain! Shaq proceeds to fire him about thirty feet into the air.There was no reason to make this other than Sandler phoning in another cash grab. However, for the film to be as bad as it is, it goes to show that Sandler and Dugan still have no problem ripping off their audiences. While this film will make a ton of money, it will, unfortunately, allow them to keep shamefully ripping audiences off with disgusting low brow humour, horrible characters and no doubt ""Grown Ups 3.""",Grown Ups 2
86,keyope,It made me laugh a lot,8,22 June 2020,"I remember seeing the first Grown Ups film and not finding it very funny. I tried watching it again recently on TV and recorded part 2 as well. I still didn't find the first one funny and switched off after half an hour. I then decided to watch ten minutes of GU2 to see what it was like. Wow, I was in hysterics in the opening scene with the wild animal in Sandler's house. I stuck with it after that, and while there is almost no plot whatsoever there are some epic laugh out loud gags in this film. I can see why some people hate it because for long spells it feels like a bunch of unconnected scenes. However the final showdown / party is fantastic fun and makes a lot of earlier scenes make sense. On the whole this film made me laugh enough times to put me in a really good mood and for that I can forgive the lack of structure.",Grown Ups 2

I got bored and came to IMDb to check out a few ratings and saw that a lot of people didn't like this movie at all. Thing is, I was already a good twenty minutes into the film, so I kept watching. There were a lot of lame jokes and cameos of people who no longer have careers. A lot's wrong with this movie. But in about the middle of it the humor was okay. I laughed a few times and ended up enjoying what I saw. Wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this, however, it's not that bad. If anything, the movie was good for a few cheap laughs. I've seen much worse.",Grown Ups 2

However, a friend forced me to go and I'm glad I did! Yes, it was shallow, pointless and sophomoric but it also made me laugh. In fact, one scene regarding an inflatable raft made me laugh harder than I think I ever have at any movie. I'm sorry that I prejudged this film and I'm definitely going to rent the first one to see what I missed.Had the creators added more of a plot and tried to flesh out the characters a little more this may have been a perfect film.

Grown Ups 2 is funnier more enjoyable and entertaining than the first . I mean sure the first one was pretty good but I strongly think the sequel was an improvement. Highly recommended movie!

I decided to give both films another chance, like an idiot!The only reason i didn't give 1 star was because Stone Cold is in it and I'm a fan.I do like a few Sandler films, but this really is a comedy for idiots and immature kids who are also idiots...Maybe I'm not getting it because I'm English? Or because my IQ is in triple figures? But do thick Yanks like this kind of thing?Watching Sandler yell in a childs face and it not be funny has been done in too many of his films now.
All the blokes getting stiff for the ballet teacher while there's a bunch of nippers on the stage at the same time was really uncomfortable to watch.
The bald fella and his son saying ""Whaaat!"" Over and over gets annoying fast (Ironic for a Steve Austin fan to say)! Most of the film and characters are annoying infact.At least the first one made me smile a couple of times, no laughs but a smile is better than nothing.

This film does one thing right, lots of cameos, and consistent editing.To be clear, there is no plot to speak of. There is no character development that endears any one character to you for anything but the most base reasons. This is an immoral film, that makes no attempts to conceal that. This is however also some of the most painful cinema to watch as it blurs the lines between washed up comedians who have run out of material, and the washed up middle-aged men they portray.It's painfully obvious that the material is either blatantly lifted from other projects, or just piles of the least successful humour being inexplicably rehashed again on screen. The genuine laughs in this film are in very short supply, so if you brave the rest of the film's nonsense, there are a couple of gems in there to lift your spirits, and the occaissonal cameo to make it interesting.",Grown Ups 2

97,britishdominion,The Worst Movie Of 2013 (So Far)...,1,21 August 2013,"Without a doubt, ""Grown Ups 2"" is the worst movie I've seen this year.It's fascinatingly bad - the film starts and... just continues to be starting. Every scene could be the beginning of the movie: there's no movement, no action, no incident to propel the characters or start the story. That, and there's absolutely no laughs. At one point, I thought the filmmakers were going for some kind of a Robert Altman-style of picture, where the camera seems to be browsing the scene, looking for interesting bits of human interaction. But no, with Grown Ups 2, it was just craft laziness - stick someone in front of the camera, make them say something to another character, make a fart joke, on to the next bit. Story lines start, then stop in virtually the same scene. It goes on like that for 90 minutes.",Grown Ups 2

The first part was really disappointment, I was looking for story and what not, it was just like a 2-3 day event which kept on happening randomly with no sequence correlated, here too, is the same. Just some random happenings over a 2-3 day period, its more like your tele serial. But this time I was prepared, I just kept my brains aside, took scene by scene and it was humorous and not just for me, the entire cinema was having a ball. The story kind of picks up from the first part, the guys are having their children who are in the adolescent age, there is no lessons to be learned, no message, just some good one liners. There are characters who doesn't even need to be there, sub plots of no value, but everything will make you laugh. Don't now what to write, but it is a typical Adam Sandler movie. I didn't have any expectations at all, so probably like it. I would have given it a 6, but 4.7 is way too low, so giving it a 9 just to average out",Grown Ups 2

I told myself I wouldn't watch it but it came out on STARZ and I did. What a mistake. Adam Sandler needs to go on hiatus from doing movies. The humor is juvenile if that makes any sense. It's like a 48 year old guy stuck at 13. The actors are recycled from older Sandler flicks. Nothing wrong with that if only their characters bring something to the table but they don't. The only bright spot is Salma Hayek. Let's face it, she's beautiful. This movie falls flat and is boring. Giving it at 3 out of 10 is being generous.

Also liked the first Grown Ups was okay and got couple of laughs wacthing it. But GU2 is another deal.I'm thinking Grown Ups 2 is directed to much more younger audience, maybe 10-12 years old. You know the age when poop humor hasn't got old yet and pretty much anything silly makes you laugh. Still I'm not sure though if I would really have liked this film at that age. I also got the feeling the whole thing was made without much thought and heart, and the result looks like actors are trying to convince you that this really is a comedy.

105,stellbread,Painfully Lame,3,16 November 2013,"The original cast of Grown Ups is back for a second go-round and Adam Sandler again allows one of his films to become a rest home for former SNL stalwarts--this time Tim Meadows, Cheri Oteri, Ellen Clghorne, Colin Quinn, Andy Samburg and the underrated, under-used Jon Lovitz. Also stopping by is Shaquille O'Neal. But even if Shaq had turned into his on-screen persona Shazam, his powers couldn't have fixed this dreck.This is not so much a movie as it is a series of late-in-the-show SNL skits loosely strung together, but with far less wit. It is connected by a plot thin as chicken broth and I can't help but think this was anything but a money grab. This time family men Lenny, Eric, Kurt and Marcus (Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James and David Spade) must contend with their children's woes (one is a wimp and the other a potential serial killer), as well as problems in their relationships. We've seen this recycled plot too many times to count and Sandler and company bring nothing new to it. In fact there are several recycled scenes from the first film that simply don't work here. The opening scene, involving a frightened, urinating deer, is the funniest one and there is one other brief moment of hilarity--Steve Buscemi at a 1980's-themed costume party dressed as former Public Enemy hype man Flavor Flav.Salma Hayek as Sandler's wife and Maya Rudolph (as Rock's) are wasted parts. Alas, a check is a check, and its like everyone's mailing it in. For once, Spade doesn't play a smarmy-I'm-the-smartest-guy-in-the-room role. The boys gather at Sandler's for another male-bonding session that falls flat, courtesy of meandering dialogue and jokes that simply don't work.

It's worse than most comedy sequels, and worse then most movies period. It's worse than Grown Ups, for heaven's sake! There's no plot, none, zip, nada. Characters and gags are set up without payoff much like in Jack and Jill. Almost every attempt at a joke falls flat. Anyone who wants to make a comedy should watch Grown Ups 2 as an example of one that does almost everything wrong and what to and what not to do when directing and making a mainstream comedy.Almost every joke in this movie is pointless, absolutely pointless. The movie's first joke: a deer wanders into Sandler's house where it pees in Sandler's face. In a movie that had actual though: this would happen not just because a deer peeing on a man is funny, but for some reason that has a point, maybe to show that the family had moved out of the city and into the country. There is no point, none and only the dumbest of the audience will find this amusing.Grown Ups 2 is worse then the first and is a close 2nd as the worst Sandler movie ever made, nothing in this movie had a point, there is no plot, the whole movie and setup basically everything was lazy and Rob Schneider may have actually made one of his best decisions ever by skipping out on not only one of the worst sequels ever but one of the worst comedies I've seen in a long, long time. 1 out of 10.

There may be one out of every twenty jokes that are even worthy of a chuckle. One could easily be convinced that the script was written by children and perverted teenagers.

This story pisses me off, now lets get to the only things i like in this movie, the beginning and the Burpsnart joke, but i had an issue with this joke, and thats how many times they repeat it, like, it was funny at first, but during the film, it just gets old by the 3rd time they do that, but now, the cons, because to be honest, there's a lot of problems with this movie, first of all, Spades relation with his son wasn't emotional, at all, another con are the antagonists, seriously, a gang of teenagers, thats not what i call an antagonist, because the main characters didn't do something that bad, all they did is invade their party, thats stupid, look guys, to make a decent antagonist, make sure that was mean to the antagonists, so they can plan on revenge, for example: Captain Hook, all Peter did to him was cut his hand off, and that was mean to him, so he plans on revenge. But in here, the antagonists had no reason to plan revenge. Another con, is that this movie is filler, like, they don't do nothing fun, now if you're going to say "" oh, but they didn't go anywhere in the first movie to"" well all i can say is that, at least, they did had some fun in the first movie, like jump on a rope, or whatever they did in the camp. But in here is absolutely nothing in 100% , and thats not what expect on an Adam Sandler film.

But it was just a movie that made me happy. The characters you like them maybe because of there past movies, its just a joyful film of old friends and there family now living back in there home town. Characters- Well we have the main characters Lenny, Eric, Kurt and Marcus. All funny people. Yet none of them make you laugh, there really isn't any funny moments in the film from either of them, there are some moments where you make a little smirk but nothing more. The only character development is Lenny. All the children have grown up none of them really have a big role or none of them are really funny. The wife's well i guess the only reason is that they are hot. Nothing special or funny comes from them. There rivals from the first bring nothing to it. Story- There is no story to this film, but this film is intended not to have one but just to see how they fit back in Lenny's home town. No plot or anything. Overall this movie was a movie that i did somewhat enjoy, it gave me a happy family feeling inside. Its not really funny at all or interesting. If you have seen the first then you can watch this. Its a nice movie but nothing special.",Grown Ups 2

126,jaiami,It Took Guts,1,22 December 2013,"I'll have to say this about Adam Sandler: it took a lot of guts to admit he had anything to do with the writing of this distasteful, sorry excuse of a ""movie."" I guess he has gotten to the point where his arrogant, narcissistic mentality (and unfortunately his continued (?) popularity) would allow him to release such an embarrassing piece of crap without throwing his entire career (and reputation) down the sewer. It pains me to think that people were paid millions of dollars each to write, produce, direct, star in, and distribute this travesty (and that it made enough money to assume more is on the way). After watching this movie (I got it from the library, so thank heaven I didn't waste any money on it), I would have no trouble believing that all these functions were performed by 12 year olds. Did intelligent people actually watch the final cut and think it was a good movie? (and why are these people making millions of dollars?) Unfortunately, many of the movie's stars are celebrities that I have enjoyed in other projects. All through this movie, I was so embarrassed for them, but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck (and this movie will soon be forgotten). Its seems more and more celebrities are willing to put their names on inferior projects like this just to stay in the spotlight.If there is any justice in this industry, this turkey will be the beginning of the end to Adam Sandler phoning it in for millions.",Grown Ups 2

My favourite scene is the fight at the end where the college kids fight the order generation and the college kids get beaten up and surrender.There are some less good things like Taylor Lautner is terrible in this film and some of the actors are underused.

The plot was all over the place not intending to be this pointless.It wasn't that funny and it was usually looking at girls areas. These actors were just making fools out of their characters in a way over a no go movie. The thing with Taylor Launtner and the this is our club thing was absolutely pointless.

It was scattered all over the place the guys act pointless to the movie and the only person who I thought was alright was Kevin James but that thing with his mother was like what! I don't get it this really doesn't add up to be a movie just the usual men doing whatever the heck they feel like doing. The party scene was pointless and the costumes with Nick Swardson was just funny to see him in a movie like this I thought he was better in Just Go With it.

The first one had its moments but this one felt like a big ""one of those moments."" The dialog was disappointingly gross in the end.

I only laughed once throughout the whole movie. It doesn't even have a plot. Its about all of the cast moving back to the city they grew up in which already that makes no sense.

135,aahari5,Adam Sandler just doesn't care anymore.,1,22 May 2014,"There once was a time when Adam Sandler's films were funny and genuinely enjoyable. None of them are masterpieces, but most of them had their moments (I particularly enjoyed Click, though, because of its surprising emotionality). In more recent years, however, Sandler's films have plummeted in quality and have become obnoxious and unpleasant. Grown Ups 2 is the shining example of this downward spiral and suggests that perhaps Adam Sandler no longer cares about the quality of his work.I would go into some of the plot details, but there is really no coherent plot to speak of. The entirety of the film revolves around Sandler and co. doing childish and disgusting acts such as, ""burpsnarting"" (burping, sneezing, and farting all at once) and defecating in a display toilet. If these had been stunts performed on Jackass then I might have been amused, but since this is a movie aimed at children I was just appalled. The script, which was co-written by Sandler, is what provides the film with its incredibly lazy and non-existent feel. It seems as though the writers intentionally sought to make a film that was squarely focused on toilet humor and raunchiness with little actual story in order to, ""appeal"" to a younger audience. I can certainly guarantee that this kind of rubbish won't be liked by most children or parents.I can go on and on about Grown Ups 2. There are many other raunchy comedies out there, but a lot of them have decent stories and the studios don't make the mistake targeting the films at children. It is a vulgar and infantile film, completely devoid of any remote plot or likable characters. Just skip this one.",Grown Ups 2

You either like him or you don't, my family does. This is another movie I will buy when it goes to DVD. It has potential for an awesome soundtrack also, if released. This is one of the most under rated comedy's of the year. Everyone in the theater was in stitches. Maybe it didn't touch people of all backgrounds but the people here in the Midwest loved it.

If you're wondering just how bad and disjointed this movie is, imagine having 10 people work on separate filming projects without communicating with one another before splicing everything together and voilà, you get Grown Ups 2. Frankly though, this steaming pile of crap is nothing short of what one can expect when Sandler is allowed to write anything (think Jack & Jill). Not only has the quality of his script-writing officially crossed over into the zone of non-existence, but his acting is equally as bad too. I've read reviews/comments posted that those who hate this movie obviously do not get what Happy Madison is all about. WRONG! I hated every minute of this movie (especially those with closeups of Sandler's poor acting) but I loved their past works such as Grandma's Boy and Deuce Bigalow. THOSE movies are fun and mindless entertainment that were actually hilarious as hell (and still are)! Grown Ups 2 on the other hand, isn't for those who are seeking mindless entertainment; it's for those who'd like to effectively find a way to destroy brain cells and commit self-torture.I wish I could write a more technical review of this movie but all I can do is just fling dirt & feces at it because this movie, quite frankly, is a flimsy house of cards; all it takes is a gust of wind to bring it crashing down. Reviewers (myself included) are not exaggerating when they claim that the movie progressively gets worse because it really does.

From start to finish funny moment after funny moment with the kids coming into their own especially the baby Chris Rock. This movie is set a few years after the first and all the characters have excuse the pun 'Grown Up'. Some great additions to this cast were Steve Austin and Shaq O' Neill.

I'm not saying it's the best movie ever, or that you should definitely watch it. Some stomachs are not made for this movie for sure...

This movie literally sucks your will to live as corny joke after corny joke is delivered. Whatever you do, NEVER watch this movie. Needless to say that is $8 I am never going to get back. This is a movie you buy for someone you hate. I have never seen Grown Ups, but after watching the sequel there is absolutely no way I will see it.

The children really move the plot along nicely. But like I said, you will be rewarded the further along you get in this film. For someone who is very critical of movies, I must say Sandler plays yet another character we can all love. The writers put a lot of thought into the dialog and it shows.

I believe Dennis Dugan has the ability to create much better comedies; comedies like ""I now pronounce you Chuck n Larry"" or ""Big Daddy"" that I personally found entertaining.

Even old fans hated on his newer movies. But this is a good movie, IF you want to watch a movie with no plot and just slapstick, crude and sexual humor. You have to turn off your brain for 1 and a half hour. If you do, watch this with your friends and you'll have a blast. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously. And you shouldn't neither. Is it good? No. Is it bad? Not at all. It's an average comedy, meant to not make any sense and just make you and a couple buddies have a great time. This is in NO way a family safe movie, in fact, there's a lot of rude humor and sexual jokes meant for teenagers the age 12+ and grown ups. I liked the first one better though, the first one had more of a plot. This is just a pile of random happenings for 1 and a half hour. It's not a sh**y movie, but it's not perfect neither. And this is really not an Oscar-movie or even standing a chance to win any type of award, but it will leave you with a good time. If you want a movie that makes sense, has a good plot and a complex story, then this is NOT the movie for you. If you like senseless slapstick humor, i'm sure you'll like this. Even more if you're a fan of Sandlers latest movies as well as the good oldies. This is not meant to be a totally serious movie, it's what it is. So take it for what it is, if you don't like these kind of movies, you should skip this one. Sandler does a great job exaggerating things as usual, i love all the actors, they did a great job. Some of the children in this movie did an OKAY job, but nothing more.

146,balloutnewvegas,Sandler knocks it out of the park. A future classic.,8,2 September 2016,"Can Adam Sandler be stopped? From the uproarious, family-friendly romp ""Jack and Jill"" to the raunchy laugh-a-minute ""That's my Boy"", Sandler's recent string of cinematic hits show that Sandler is at the top of his game in the 2010's, nearly thirty years after first spellbinding audiences with the underdog comedy ""Going Overboard"". Netflix signing a four-picture deal with him is one of the best decisions the company could have made. Sandler produces winner after winner nowadays and this film is no exception. Without any doubt, Grown Ups 2 is easily one of the top comedies of 2013, in serious competition with ""Grudge Match"" and the criminally underrated ""Movie 43"". This is why:IT'S NOT A SEQUEL, IT'S A CONTINUATION. Grown Ups 2 is Sandler's first sequel, and after seeing this film it should not be his last. Much like the ""Godfather"" trilogy and the ""Hot Shots"" movies, Grown Ups 2 follows hot on the heels of the first installment. However, unlike many sequels Grown Ups 2 hits the sweet spot in storytelling and comedic substance in a way that it doesn't feel like a re-hash or outright xerox copy of the first film. Every second of Grown Ups 2 feels fresh, no second is wasted or replaced with a tired callback to the previous film. Nothing feels drawn out or cut too short, and the comedic timing is frame- perfect. Minutes of screen time feel like they contain hours of content.I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN (IF?) I STOPPED LAUGHING. Face it, if you put the cast of Grown Ups 2 in any movie whatsoever, you ain't leaving the theater with your sides intact. Obviously, kudos is given to the four starring actors Adam Sandler (Just Go With It), David Spade (Joe Dirt 2), Shaq (Grown Ups 2) and ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (Smosh: the Movie) for bringing nonstop laughs for the 86 minutes that all four were on screen simultaneously. I had to deduct one star for not taking the extra mile on a couple of the jokes, the only thing that would have made this a nearly perfect comedy. For example, the first scene of the movie involves a CGI deer p*ssing on Adam Sandler with no explanation. I feel as if this would have been a stronger gag if it was made into a running joke: the deer could have p*ssed on Sandler multiple times, or Kevin James could have strangled the deer to death at the end of the film while doing his trademark fart-burp-sneeze action. Instead, we got the J. Geils Band performing ""Centerfold"" live in front of children. Horrible. I feel as if there was a missed opportunity here: imagine if the deer defecated on the majority of the cast as the J. Geils Band belted out the chorus of ""Love Stinks""? Now that would be an ending.THE PLOT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED. We don't need a backstory. We don't need sub-plots. What we need is a good old-fashioned revenge story in the vein of Django Unchained and Oldboy and that is exactly what we get. Twenty years ago, Bobby Dallas (played by Stone Cold Steve Austin in his strongest film role yet) made a bet with Adam Sandler that he would go the longest without getting p*ssed on by a CGI deer. Obviously, Sandler loses and must endure getting hit with the Stone Cold Stunner and verbal abuse from Stone Cold for ten minutes. This is done well for an all-ages comedy but I was surprised when Steve Austin referred to Sandler's character as a ""Peter Pan N*gga"" and a ""Deer F*cker."" I know that Steve Austin is black, but I thought this was too much. After 70 minutes of run-time, Sandler succeeds in killing Austin with a stapler before having an ""80's Party"" with the rest of the main cast. This was also done well.If you don't like this movie, you don't like movies. Funny, heartfelt and just outlandish enough. 8/10 stars.",Grown Ups 2

It's one of those movies I watched one time when I was feeling very unwell, and it cheered me up, and it's my go-to if I'm ever having a sleepless night or sick in bed. I've always been a fan of Kevin James as well as David Spade, and neither of them let me down. Yes, some of the jokes are kind of ridiculous, but if you appreciate it for what it is, it's pretty funny. I like the kinds of movies that usually take place over one night or one day, like a lot of Sandler's films do, and that's exactly what you get with this one. I didn't much care for the first Grown Ups, but this one did elicit some pretty loud laughs. If you're expecting witty dialogue and subtle comedy, this isn't for you.

This time the gang is all back together and Lenny has moved back into his old hometown and of course, his old pals join him. Kevin James, Chris Rock David Spade are back (minus Rob Schneider, god bless him) and they act exactly unlike a grown up would; Perverse, immature and stupid. Let's just say they would act more or less like a kid would. The movie really has no plot to speak of. Instead, the movie is just a bunch of set pieces, some of them funny, some of not. The humor in this movie is an acquired taste: some will find it funny and some will find it racist, misogynistic and homophobic.I liked the scenes with Shaquille O' Neal as the cop and Taylor Lautner as Frat Boy Andy. Their scenes were amusing and well staged. Also in one scene, David Spade goes rolling in a tire down a rather bumpy terrain, that made me laugh hard. But one wishes that Adam Sandler's comedy were more inspired and in the lieu of set pieces, create some more character driven comedy. The characters in Grown Ups 2 are barley sketched out and different events just get thrown at them.But compared to some of the comedies released this year like Movie 43, Scary Movie 5 and Identity Thief.

It literally had maybe two or three zingers that I kinda chuckled at. I mean, it's pretty sad when the best acting in a movie is done by a NBA player (Shaq, who has a somewhat funny part). But seriously, if Shaq wasn't in this movie, I probably would've walked out.There is nothing about this movie that is even remotely interesting and the posters lie (where the @#$% is the roller coaster?!). This is the second worst Sandler flick ever (Jack and Jill first). Even the cameos by Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Peter Dante, Allen Covert, Nick Swardson, etc. don't do anything for the movie. In fact, they hurt it! Seeing Buscemi in this movie made me cringe. Why would such a respected actor like Buscemi do something like this. And his jokes (like everything else in this movie) are not funny! Lautner doesn't fit in here and his lack of acting chops are definitely seen. He scrapes the bottom of the barrel here (as does everyone in this movie). The worst part about it, I'm a HUGE Sandler fan! And frankly, I think people have been too hard on him lately. Sure Jack and Jill sucked but That's My Boy was a fairly funny raunch fest. And the first Grown Ups was far from terrible. Even Hotel Transylvania was a pretty cute movie. But this, is just BADDDDDDDDD. Really BADDDDDDDD. Please Adam Sandler, stop trying to make family friendly movies. Take a year off. Spend some time writing your next one. And come back with comedic gold!",Grown Ups 2
153,zakwaripop,a serious waste of time.,2,31 July 2013,"It is sad to see ""mainstream comedy"" downgraded to this. how did we get to ""Grown ups"" becoming a franchise from classic movies like ""Duck Soup"" which used to make the World laugh? It is very sad indeed to know that a culture of the world is reflected in the fact that this kind of movies can be made and marketed hard globally and then even find interest. what does that say about us? Because it is a mindless, low comedy. How do we rise above this kind of movies? It is very depressing to live in a world in a time when this is what the ""world"" wants.

154,chole1952,A disappointing film,3,31 August 2013,I couldn't wait to watch this film after i thoroughly enjoyed the first one. I thought the cast was great and they all worked well together however this film was an utter disappointment.As soon as it began i immediately regretted choosing this film to watch at the cinema. I felt like the only one there that didn't seem to find the jokes even the slightest bit funny. It just seemed to be a script filled with joke after joke that eventually became irritating rather than funny. There wasn't even an actually story line - nothing significant happened. Maybe one or two (at most) jokes might make you smile however its probably more cringe worthy than funny.I am normally a fan of Adam Sandler films (e.g. 50 first dates and happy Gilmore) but i thought his acting became annoying at times with his repeated shouting and tone of voice.The only way i can describe this film is as a complete disappointment. Unless you are desperate to waste an hour of time then i would strongly suggest steering clear of this film!,Grown Ups 2

First of all, you can't beat this casting for comedy, although I was a little disappointed in Chris Rock since he was so quiet most of the time.The soundtrack took me back to my own school days, although I didn't listen to a lot of rock, there were a few in there that really tugged at some memories I hadn't thought about in ages. Seemed they selected a wide variety of songs from the mid 70s through to the early 80s, so there's a song in there for everyone from that era I think.This silly movie even had a great story. It reminds us at how lost we've become. It was really odd how on the spot it was. The part about the little boy who picked up the rock but didn't seem to know what to do with it struck me as sad for today's kids.It made me long for childhood. It made me happy to remember, it makes me want to call some old friends, and it makes me wonder how we all survived in such a once care-free world so vastly different from the world we built for our own children.",Grown Ups 2

You SERIOUSLY need to start consulting REAL comedians before you make another movie. What you think is funny is not. Hey, not picking on you but check the mirror, hit movie, Happy Gilmore, you made fun of yourself, Just Go With It, great movie great soundtrack, but the nose, do you think audiences are stupid, and you make fun of a musician with a goatee.

I expected more from the second. But except for a very few funny parts which we already saw in the trailer, this movie was horrible.Adam Sandler produces some truly great stuff every few movies (Funny People, Spanglish, Wedding Singer, etc).. but he seems required to produce garbage in between these and Grown Ups 2 is a double dud.

I watched it for my comedy review podcast, One Good Thing. We try to find redeeming qualities in terrible movies. Battlefield Earth, Lesbian Vampire Killers, Bucky Larson, all seemed terrible. Grown Ups 2 has forced me to re- evaluate my standards of awful. I came here to try to understand. I read the positive reviews in an attempt to understand why someone would like this. The juvenile humour, the paper-thin characterisation, the painfully awkward editing, how could anyone enjoy this and not feel annoyed for having been sold it. The whole point of my podcast is to be an antithesis to all the people who watch Nolan movies and high concept thrillers and complain about minor details that apparently ""ruined"" the movie. It was an attempt to re-frame film criticism in a positive way. This film was our toughest challenge. Tomorrow I need to get on Mic and figure out why it's a good thing that this movie did so well at the box office and why so many people loved it. And for the first time since we started this podcast, ten months ago, I feel that we shall fail.",Grown Ups 2

162,edselgracias,A glass half full gives nothing to whiners.. and how much do you want anyway?,7,3 August 2013,"Okay so I am not sure what is with all the negative energy simulation about the movie.. it was way better than the first one and to give it a 1/2 out of 10 is ridiculous. If the movie dint get you off on more than a few occasions then probably your sense of humor has been damaged..It's a comedy after all so there will be many attempts at humor, it helps to see the lighter side of things. The punches did have substance and there will always be a few that don't go down so well, but there are 2 ways to take it in; one is to go on with the spirit and the other is to crib about each scene making the experience even worse for oneself..The plot itself was light, it could have had a little more but one can try to appreciate the way in which the pieces were put together. This is not inception, what plot are the people looking for? The basic idea is that you had a bunch of teenagers who got older and how they lead their family lives, it is not a new concept but that should not be the focus.. understand what you are watching the movie for..When you have such a powerful cast it is not easy to balance titans with justice at each moment of the film.. this is perhaps where the audience is expecting too much.. not taking the main lead also means everyone has to consolidate on certain aspects of their regular individual acts as it may otherwise be too much in the equation to balance.. that being said i think they had better energy synchronization this time around.The negatives.. I would give this a 6\7 mainly because of a)Some avoidable cliché moments b)The plot wasn't great but it wasn't bad either A rating below 3 is a review done by the mentally defeated.. let alone challenged.",Grown Ups 2
163,thenameuwishuhad,Not even for Sandler fans.,1,17 July 2013,"I saw this movie 5 days ago. My feelings towards this movie gets worse as time passes. When I first saw it, I gave it a 7, then a 5, now my rating is a 3. This movie was horrible. I am a huge Adam Sandler fan. I loved the first Grown Ups. I even liked Jack & Jill. There were movies like 'You Don't Mess With the Zohan' and 'Funny People' which I didn't like but Grown Ups 2 beats those. This is by far the worst Adam Sandler movie.The jokes in the first movie were great, in this one, they fail to deliver. The jokes were simply not funny. Grown Ups had a great message as most other Sandler films have. This one probably had one but it was so loosely put together that I couldn't spot it. Everything was over the top, from the moose in his room, to Taylor Lautner doing multiple back flips, the big fight scene, the blow up boat in Kmart, the blow up boat on top of the school bus. This movie was way to over the top for Adam. I had to force myself to laugh at some parts.The characters in this movie had nothing to do with the same characters from Grown Ups. It's like they completely rewrote the characters as completely different people. Lenny turned into an annoying mean adult. The new characters didn't add anything either. Higgins was annoying with an over the top unfunny son. Donna was incredibly annoying. Kethie, Greg, and Becky were also different from Grown Ups. Kids to grow up but most of what we loved was thrown out.The new characters didn't add to anything, even the jokes. Nick Swardson played a bus driver which constantly reminded me of 'Otto' from 'The Simpsons'. It was alright there but not here. 'The Simpsons' is a cartoon. They can do whatever they want. Grown Ups 2 is a movie, this was unrealistic, even for Adam Sandler. Tim Meadow's character and his family were just another stupid addition. A swaggy teen with two parents that look a like with a repeating joke of saying ""What?"" in a squeaky high pitched tone. It wasn't funny the first time, nor the second, nor the third. Steve Austin's character with his hot girlfriend didn't add anything. Jon Lovitz was playing a pervert as he did in ""Little Nicky"". I didn't find it funny then, and I still don't find it funny now. The only addition that made a difference for the better was Shaq. It seemed like all the good jokes were his and they mainly were. Shaq never failed to deliver but he wasn't enough to save this movie.This movie was offensive and over sexualized. The jokes were demeaning to other characters (even though they were fictitious) and it even offended me, and I'm not all that easy to offend. I also don't mind the sexuality but this movie is targeted towards younger audiences. The amount of bikini's, cleavage, masturbation jokes, and other sexual jokes was too much. I didn't bother me but it was a completely different kind of experience than I expected. I expected a more family friendly comedy.This movie would have been better off as a direct to DVD movie (notice how I didn't say Blu-ray). This is a movie that I'm ashamed to have seen. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who worked on this movie, especially Adam Sandler. He is my favorite comedian. I feel sorry to see him make such a horrible movie.",Grown Ups 2

They're getting on now; one in her early teens and the other rapidly approaching the teen years.At one point the eldest turned to me and asked if I thought there was a story to this movie at all? Sadly, I don't think there was. It reeked of doing a group of people who have an affection for each other grabbing hold of a script and using it to hang out with each other on the set. For God's sake... it's not often that you see a movie that's missing Rob Schneider and think it may be worse than the one he WAS in. But Grown Ups 2 manages to make me wonder if it would've been just a little more enjoyable if Schneider made an appearance. The answer of course is no - he makes nothing better, but the fact I even entertained the thought should give a clear indication just how poor this film is.Whilst the first Grown Ups had a little heart, this was a complete waste of time and, more importantly, money - do not waste either of yours on this. You'll feel yourself getting dumber as you struggle to watch. This review would've been a lot shorter had it been allowed to be.",Grown Ups 2
166,coolmatthew333,50/50,5,13 July 2013,"The reason why I titled this review 50/50 is because of every joke you'll have a 50/50 chance of laughing. There were tons of toilet humor with the sneeze/fart/burp jokes, but with the wanna be rap boy saying ""whaaaaaaaat?"". Some people might like the toilet humor, (I thought it was gross) but I actually liked the ""Whaaaaaaaaat?"" parts. The college kids parts sort of make me cringe at things they said and did. The story was great, though with it all taking place in one day. The cop situation was very unrealistic, pointing their loaded guns at people for no reason, not stopping rioting/mass fighting, and they would definitely get fired if it was in real life.Overall it was pretty funny with a 50% chance of laughing. I definitely wouldn't rate it a one-star like some people are doing. I would rate it a 5, but it's a 7 for the story. Just wait until it's on Redbox/Netflix. 7/10.",Grown Ups 2

It's quite sad when all we seem to see if films lately is penis and toilet jokes..it's quite clear that most people do not find them funny and I even go as far as calling them crass and un- tasteful. Yet here we are again with deer's peeing over people, men getting their genitalia attacked (even one scene where a woman gets kicked in the groin) ,, and women being placed in parts of the film for pure sexual gratification. It really sets a new all time low for comedies. This isn't quite as bad as ""The Heat"" but it almost is, which is a shockingly bad place to be.It's about time Hollywood grew up and tried using their heads instead of relying on unfunny offensive gags.",Grown Ups 2

I am SHOCKED this got a 5/10 overall. This is a sorry excuse for a film. With such a strong, all star cast I can't believe they couldn't piece together! It had so much potential. I actually don't think I've ever seen a movie that was such a hot mess before. There's also a random character introduced in this movie with no background whatsoever from the school. The first movie was so good, and this one just wasn't. It even had a lot of potential to be a good movie if they had tried. Adam Sandler has written so many movies and done a damn good job at making us laugh. There is no point to this movie.

Not one redeeming quality in the entire movie. I contemplated leaving after the first 15 minutes! I forced myself to stay just to see if this mess would get any better. It didn't. The jokes concern nude men, homosexual men, brainless women, sex, bodily functions (over and over again!), and more of the same, repeatedly. No story, no acting, no thought, no point.

This movie is very unfunny. A lot of jokes are fired at the viewer but only a few make you wanna smile. Yes smile. Not laugh, but smile. That's the most you are going to get out of this flick. Situations happen that are suppose to be funny, but all you do is say wtf and look over at your viewing-partner. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is the presence of the insanely beautiful April Rose. She gets to show off her body and it's the highlight of the picture. Also Salma Hayek's boobs are seen perking through her shirt and that also is something to watch for. Yes very immature of me, but what do you expect of a movie that tries to score with fart jokes, a peeing deer (yes you are reading it correct) and Kevin James mastery of something called a burb-sneeze-fart.

I also agree that this movie didn't have much of a plot - it was just kind of random things happening over a couple of days in a group of friends' hometown.But, honestly, if you find this movie cringey, stupid or immature why do you ever bother seeing Sandler films? That's what he's always been about and I don't think the essentials of his films have changed at all. There's Sandler's quirky-yet-still-average-Joe character with a super- hot girl. There's loads of goof ball comedy (think farts, poo, boobs, fighting). And of course there's the many random weirdo characters with their funny lines and totally unrealistic behaviour (a parade of familiar Sandler faces: Allen Covert, Steve Buscemi, Peter Dante, Jonathan Loughran, Nick Swardson and many more - the 'Ladies' Night' man from Little Nicky even makes an appearance!!). Also loved the fight scene and appearances of Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shaquille O'Neal. It's fun, it's weird, it's random, it's quirky and slapstick and it's Sandler at his best.

However, my expectations towards Grown Ups 2 were not met in the slightest. There was so much going on in the storyline at once that I often found myself wondering what was happening, the acting was not up to par and the jokes weren't as funny as the first. The fact that Rob Schneider was not in the movie disappointed me. I used to be a huge Adam Sandler fan, but if he's going to continue to do comedies he needs to step up his game a little bit. I think he's getting a little old to be attempting comedies like this (despite age being a topic of interest in the movie). The character he plays in all of his movies is getting a little tiresome. Kevin James does a good job that some of his lines made me chuckle. Chris Rock kind of lost his touch in the movie, too.

186,BiggestCrazyFrogFan69,A masterpiece of a movie (warning real tearjerker) (not for kids despite the rating),10,18 March 2019,"Adam sandler really out did himself with this one, telling the story of life in world war 2 with a real gritty and depressing look at life back then.
adam sandler stars in the movie as a world war 1 veteran being forced to go into world war 2, the scene when he is forced into a auto vehicular device and taken to a ship to be sent off to germany to fight hitler himself.
The Fight proceeds to take up a good portion of the film which is boring at times but i really thought the sword fighting scene really brought out the truth of how hitler didn't kill himself, he was just challenged to a sword fight to the death by a world war 1 veteran (played by adam sandler)
some of the parts where the world war 1 veteran (played by adam sandler)
had flashbacks to the first war which can be really traumatising to the audience.
even though the movie is rated G in Australia i don't recommend taking you kids to see it as it may be scary and cause ptsd in children as young as 3.
some of the themes are definitely not for children
but the movie is still rated G none of the less.
movie is very nice and the cinematography was put together very good.
i really like the scene where kevin james said my name jeff.
thank you for listening to my review and i hope you take this to heart and realise that this movie deserves an oscar every year.

Why did all these grown men have a weekday OFF to drive around in a (stolen?) school bus and then hang out at K-Mart?It's the middle of a school day, when employed people are usually working, and suddenly one of these men remembers that their daughter has a dance recital....because dance recitals always happen in the middle of a school day...when the kids are in school....and the parents are working. Dance teachers attend recitals in 80's workout spandex and then proceed to dance with the children...sure sure sure. It was beyond raunchy. Are there adults out there who seriously get excited to see breasts bouncing around? Are they over the age of 19? We walked out and got our money back.

I laughed my ass off HOME ALONE! I don't like all the actors in the movie, but none of them were annoying. Where have Eddie Murphy or Jim Carrey went? Where are they?

191,BRoz123,Grown Ups 2 (2013) Review,4,9 June 2014,"Grown Ups 2 is directed by Dennis Dugan, starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, David Spade, and Chris Rock. Grown Ups 2 is the follow up to the box office successful 2010 Grown Ups. So why shouldn't there be a sequel? Well, there should not have been a sequel. This movie is bad. I'm generally not too hard on movies, especially ones that attempt to be stupid on purpose. The problem, with this movie is that it thinks it is more important and funny than it actually is. This makes sense because this is how Adam Sandler and all of his friends think of themselves. Anyway, the movie takes place in Sandler's hometown after moving his family from LA. That's really it. Nothing else important happens. The rest is filled with terrible jokes and the most annoying frat guys ever led by Taylor Lautner. There was only one remotely funny scene that came from Steve Busscemi during a driving test, In the hour and a half run time, there is one joke that you will laugh at, if that... I'll be honest here, I did not mind the first Grown Ups. It incorporated an element of nostalgia and was kind of fun to watch, not a good movie, but still fun to watch. Growns Ups 2 had no nostalgia and was actually quite boring. The only reason it gets a 4 is because you will be able to see it once without hating yourself,but you will never have the desire to see it again, or think about it again.",Grown Ups 2

Some say this movie would bore audience. Hmm it sure didn't in the theater i was in audience's were laughing their ass off. It keeps you laughing from beginning to end that is what you want in a movie. Most comedies only have like one or two funny scenes but critics say it is the best? Psh please a comedy is suppose to keep you laughing. I loved the first Grown Ups and def loved this one. I never trust critics cause they always give good movies bad review and bad movies good reviews.Just because Adam Sandler is in this movie and produced it people think it is bad. I love Adam Sandler now yes some of his movies has been awful. Examples Jack and Jill, That's My Boy and Just Go With It. But the Grown Ups movies are just funny.For me a good comedy is something to keeps you laughing from beginning to end not just have one or two funny moments. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a good comedy lover. Also a piece of advice never believe critics until you see the movie for yourself.",Grown Ups 2

What kind of retarded producer has Kevin James and Chris Rock and still ends up with a horrible hopefully career-ruining film ? DING DING DING That's Denis Dugan. What is the movie about ? I don't know, and that's after I've watched it. All it was, or appeared to be was a series of failed desperate attempts to make something funny but there was definitely no humor in this movie. Maybe the director was laughing, but it wasn't funny. I don't why they made this movie, seriously! Kevin James and Chris Rock are both natural comedians and I think their natural talent is to a large extent compressed and limited during this movie. They can both be big stars in their own right but their is going to have to be a strong comeback from both of them or they will fade away into the list of actors who were known, and then forgotten.",Grown Ups 2

It's cheerful, hilarious, and has messages about family values. I laughed harder in that movie than I have in a while, and I loved the surprise cameos all over the place! Anyone who is a fan of SNL stars, of Adam Sandler, or just great comedies in general, will love this movie. The jokes are hilarious and very creative, even if they are a little immature. And, even more important than that, is it is definitely a feel-good movie! I left the movie with a smile on my face, and so did many others in the theater, everyone from teens to seniors. Don't go into this movie with a negative attitude; go in positively, ready to laugh and smile, and you will love it! Don't listen to the uptight critics. They never appreciate Adam Sandler's genius & talent, yet millions of people do. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh and have a great time in the theater, and this is the perfect movie to bring a couple of friends to! Even if you don't love it the way I did, you are guaranteed to smile at the end. Grown Ups 2 is definitely an under-appreciated work of art. :)",Grown Ups 2

I would consider it a mediocre movie if it had of been released in the 90's, but Sandler's movies are becoming extremely repetitive, and I think people are beginning to get fed up with Adam Sandler if they weren't already, I think it is time he gives it a rest. Grown-Ups 2 has some jokes that made me crack a smile, or chuckle, but has absolutely no plot, it's like watching a mash-up of jokes play out in front of you, rather then watching a movie thats funny. Not worth watching in theatres, rent or watch it online. Hopefully this will be Sandler's last movie for a while, and this is coming from a person who enjoys some of his movies.",Grown Ups 2

Who knows..Sure, it was fun to see a lot of past Saturday Night Live-stars make an appearance, and even a few newer ones, but after the movie I walked out asking myself ""What did I just see?"".

Adam Sandler pretty much makes movies to have fun with his friends now, and that is perfectly OK. This movie is goofy, filled with childish humor, and yes it doesn't actually have any recognizable plot structure. But it was funny pretty much from the jump. There are awkward jokes that fall flat, but someone will get those references and find them hilarious. The star of this movie has to be Shaq, I had no idea he was so funny, almost every scene he was in had me laughing out loud. Lots of great cameos by all of Sandlers friends keep the lack of story flowing into the next joke. Is this art ? No, if you expect art from a movie called Grown Ups 2 you really need to re-evaluate your expectations. Is it funny, hell yeah it is, its stupid and immature funny, but sometimes its nice to laugh like a kid again :)",Grown Ups 2
213,taylortillytally,"Paid for it, but luckily got my money back.",2,1 January 2014,"I must admit; the first Grown Ups movie did provide some humour and I overall enjoyed it, but when I saw the trailer of Grown Ups 2 I was greatly disappointed. I already knew that film did not look good enough to watch and I already planned not to watch it, but today my sister convinced my family (and me) to give it a try. I agreed because she did have positive things to say about it so I was ALMOST convinced that the movie wouldn't be as bad as it seemed, but was quickly reassured that I was right about it in the first place.I missed a bit of the first part because I was making tea, though I still heard what was going on in the movie. From what I heard, I was confused as to what the storyline in the movie was, but as I took a seat in front of the television I slowly realized that the plot was nonexistent. So how about the jokes you ask? Well, there were not many laughs in the family room. My father nodded in shame through the duration of the film and I my jaw dropped many times as I was surprised at the stupidity and nonsense happening. Lots of gross humour, as well as racist, sexist, and nonsensical humour. How about the acting and characters? I must admit I appreciated that characters/actors from the previous film were reintroduced, but the acting.... eh. Nothing special in all honesty. Some characters were straight up annoying (the character Kiki and David Spade's son in the film), while others were unneeded (the dance teacher). Luckily, the horror that is this movie did not last too long. My dad left the room because he could not bear the film anymore and so we decided to complain to our service provider that we were unsatisfied with the movie. Thankfully, we are going to get a refund, but we will never get the time that we spent back again. To conclude: I gave this film a 2 out of 10. I would have given it 1 star, but I was generous and gave 2 stars because the first movie was not so bad. I would not recommend that you try this film unless you have seen the trailer and actually thought it seemed enjoyable. This movie has no plot, mediocre acting, and lame jokes. Thank god we were granted a refund.",Grown Ups 2

216,wf-air-designs,Yea it is not like the more recent Sandler movies (all age appropriate) but it is like his earlier works. Very funny,10,23 September 2013,"Loved this movie. Yea it is not like the more recent Sandler movies (all age appropriate) but it is like his earlier works. Very funny shows friends and family stick together and good times. This one is more like the Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison movies. One thing I appreciate about Adam Sandler is that he keeps his buddies in his movies. Hated rob was not in this one but what ever his reason (new baby or didn't like the role) maybe he will come back for the next. I see so many neg ratings but its because so many were expecting this to be a family oriented movie but they should have known better. Now I did not like Zohan and not really grandma's boy, but all the others are funny. Having Shaq and Stone Cold are added bonuses. I do not care for the gross comedy but this movie had more not so gross funny lines. Loved the cliff jump well I won't give any away but sure many of the more adult directed lines could have been worked to a more family base but then it wouldn't be a Happy Madison movie. I don't think that people or critics should base their ratings on expecting this to be like others or for making the error to take kids to this movie before checking it out first. Adam is known for childish pranks or funny gross comedy in his movies and for someone to not expect it is their own thinking error. This movie is great and funny, if I haven't said it enough. But it is not for children unless you want to answer some awkward questions and not for the weak stomached. This movies shows how family and friends stick together and to over come some life obstacles. All in all my family loved it. Though several moments I had to turn away like the principle eating out of his belly button. Gross! But it is just like a Sandler movie. Even my favorites. Wedding Singer and 50 first dates had its Sandler gross comedy and yelling childish moments. So get past those and it is awesome! Oh and Taylor Lawtner being in it had many taking their younger girls to see him and ended up answering some odd questions. Yet I found his roll to make him look stupid and spoiled that was what his roll was written to be and he pulled it off. Rob made the remark that Sandler makes his cast look like idiots but that is what makes people laugh and he doesn't make them take on the rolls. Besides there are too many horror movies there need to be more comedies and I applaud Sandler for creating these awesome movies. He has made some directed for all family members but he isn't a kid these are buddy movies to sit around and laugh. I rate the critics a 1 star and this movie a 10********** and I wait the next installment and hope I can let my daughter watch.

Do not watch this waste of time. I remember watching Kevin James on the king of queens and that is a really funny show, I really don't know why he is also constantly in movies that aren't funny. I guess its a way to make a quick buck in the industry, stick to real comedies, like This Is The End.

We walked out of the theater after about 30 minutes which is 25 minutes too late. This movie is so childish and immature that there were even teenagers booing the screen. There were less than 15 people in the theater so ""word of mouth"" must be getting around. The movie was more like a ""stand-up"" comedian's act, i.e., silly one liners dominated the first 30 minutes and you could tell Adam Sandler's fingerprints were all over a terribly weak script. As bad as the script was, it can't compare to the ""grade school"" level of acting by the children in the movie. OMG, they were so bad I was actually embarrassed for them. There are so many terrific child actors that one has to wonder if they were children of the actors, producer or directors.

I think you can feel that the others in the cast are embarrassed to be in it. The humour is past stupid, I don't mind a mindless comedy film if it has humour in it, but I think that the flake in the ice cream for me, was the scene were the ice cream guy, was told to fix the machine, in such a manor that it looked like he was releasing brown wastage... It takes millions of dollars to come up with that. I'm not sure if sandler is that deluded that he thinks everything he does will be funny. There's also the scenes where he starts shouting at his kid, he's been there and done it better in the past! I think the film starts as it means to go on with a wild animal urinating on his whole family. At risk of making this sound funny it's really not. Avoid. It'll take something special for him to even tempt me to consider watching any new material.",Grown Ups 2

I wouldn't recommend you go and see this movie.But, if you are like me and you enjoy a bit of silly, potty, childish humour that all the other serious people in this world don't even try to understand then I urge you to go and see this movie.I laughed from start to finish, in fact NO I HOWLED from start to finish. I found this film to be amazingly funny and it is one of the best comedies I have seen in years. I haven't laughed this much in a long time.I appreciate a crappy plot with some stupid humour every once in a while.

Yes, it's full of slapstick, sophomoric and tasteless humor. There are pee jokes and fart jokes.... Hot women and hot guys.... etc., etc. It's not Shakespeare, not even Steven King. However, sometimes I'm in the mood for a stupid summer movie that appeals to the child in me. I like high brow humor but I also have the Fart Button on my Kindle. If you expected more that what was there don't blame the movie, blame yourself. Since when has any Adam Sandler movie striven to win an Oscar. He makes movies that appeal to the child in all of us; some hit the mark while some don't. My family left the movie feeling happy.",Grown Ups 2
227,a-christoffer,"Good, not great.",6,27 September 2013,"Just saw the movie and I was pleasantly surprised. But mainly because of the rather low score here on IMDb, which kept my expectations low. It is a rather slow paced movie that does rely mainly on physical humor and jokes. There isn't really a plot or any tension that is developed but then it is not really needed here. It is a light flick that manages to entertain, and that is what it was supposed to be. There were some enjoyable moments for the male viewer-ship and maybe a few moments where you really could laugh out loud. All in all, it is one of the better efforts of Mr. Sandler in the last years who reached his personal bottom with ""Jack and Jill"", which was so cringe-worthy that I didn't manage to finish it. The same man acted in ""Reign over me"" and ""punch drunk love"", which are two truly great movies in my humble opinion. But I digress, back to the movie at hand.

One-liners that are pathetic. You can just feel them grasping at straws to see who gets to say the cheesy lines next. A total waste of time. Adam Sandler is less than stupid, along with his usual cast of former Happy Gilmour misfits tagging along to join in on the simple, low budget comedy this movie will surely be known as for the rest of its existence. Chris Rock is at his worst. David Spade is non-existent. Thank goodness Rob Schneider stayed away or I probably would have committed a crime after my eyeballs were so insulted.

The film lacks everything and includes terrible roles for Steve Austin and Shaquille o'Neil. It is a pointless follow up to a pointless film. It is a film to watched maybe once or twice but never after that.Most of the film isn't that great. The start is ridiculous as the children are stupid enough to leave the front door open over night. The film has a lot of pointless parts and it's like a few sketches put into a film. The end has the most random fight ever and it is actually quite funny. The film is an okay film.

It would be even better if the jokes were actually funny but unfortunately, they are not. It is an attempt for Adam Sandler to make the same movie over and over for no purpose with just a slight variation of the jokes. Sandler has played the same character in all of his movies and shows that he has no depth as an actor. Sandler has done this for years and the box-office is finally starting to catch up with him.I am sick of Adam Sandler and I find him to be the least original humor.

236,thiam1,A crime against comedy,2,4 January 2014,"I don't remember much from Grown-Ups, other than that it did not live up to the potential of its cast of comedians. I know that I laughed a few times, but it was definitely what I would call a forgettable (and forgotten) movie. Within a couple of minutes of the beginning of Grown- Ups 2, it was obvious that this was going to be significantly worse.Sequels are rarely as good as the movie the are trying to cash in on, especially when that wasn't the original plan. I would venture to say that comedy sequels are always worse. I cannot think of a comedy with a ""2"" in the title that's as good or as funny as the first one. The Hangover is a perfect example of this. The problem is, Grown-Ups was no Hangover. So the sequel was already starting from a worse place. But when a deer stood up on its hind legs in the opening scene to urinate in Adam Sandler's face, I knew that no amount of comedic genius in the subsequent 90 minutes would bring this baby back from the ICU. It was headed straight for the morgue. That was the worst use of computer- animated animals I had seen since the dancing mouse in Bad Boys 2. Which I just now realize was another sequel.About 45 minutes into the movie, it dawned on me that it was just a loose collection of scenes with no particular plot line. The story was going absolutely nowhere, and the script was just killing time until the big party at the end of the movie. I don't want to be overly negative, so I feel obligated to point out some of its redeeming qualities. For instance, I learned a new term from Kevin James' character: ""burpsnarting."" Yes, it's exactly what you think it is, if you figured out that the ""sn"" is for ""sneeze."" And there was Salma Hayek's curvy, voluptuous, bountiful assets. The woman could probably single-handedly sustain life on earth for 12 months after the apocalypse. So there, it wasn't all bad. Finally, on a more serious note, Shaquille O'Neal was pretty funny. He looked as comfortable in his police uniform as Hightower in Police Academy. And he is a better comedian.In fact, I did laugh a lot. I'm still trying to figure out if I laughed because the movie was funny, or because it was so bad that it made it funny. I suspect the latter, but I do not discount the possibility that the writers might have been smarter than me and actually anticipated exactly what would make me laugh, thereby accomplishing their goal for these comedy. It's a real conundrum. I am fairly easy to amuse. Definitely not the highly-intellectual independent movie type of customer. But this was atrocious. So much so that it made a wonderful experience. This movie was to comedy what Sharknado is to thrillers. I am writing this review in a state of confusion that cannot be described in words. Perhaps I should have slept on it.",Grown Ups 2

245,Krishthegod,A new low in comedy standards,1,24 February 2014,"Wow. Just wow. I know it's been a couple of months already, and yeah, it's already got its reputation for being absolute sh*t. But wow. I had no idea. This damn thing is just OOZING mediocrity and hatred. For the record, BTW, i did not watch this in the theaters or on DVD, but on YouTube. Yes, i watched an illegal copy of this movie. Cry me a river cause one of the richest and laziest Jews(not an Ant-Semite, just anti-laziness) in Hollywood missed out on one ticket payment. Now, onto the movie.With a lot of these Adam Sandler movies, I always hear complaints about potty humor, mean-spirited slapstick, Adam Sandler's unfunny voice, well-known comedians embarrassing themselves, slushy, crow barred sentimentality, and, as always, absence of punchlines etc. Until i saw this piece of sh*t, i had no reason to look at Adam Sandler's past few ""comedies"" for these flaws. Normally, as with most of Adam Sandler's works, i would say that the low-brow jokes take precedence over the narrative. Only, in this case, there is LITERALLY no plot. I now realize the true meaning of having no plot. In Adam Sandler and Denis Dugan's mind, stringing a bunch of unfunny set pieces together can tie together as a narrative. Starting with a CG deer pissing in Adam Sandler's house, it can only go downhill from here, folks.As irritating as everyone is in the ""film"" trying to deliver the lowest common denominator, the one that irked me the most is Adam Sandler. He is absolutely one of the most selfish, self-absorbed and immature parents I've ever seen on film. And yes, complaining about that in a lowbrow movie(especially with the title Grown Ups 2) is probably the last thing i should complain about, but it bothered me. He takes no responsibility for the things he does to his children, his wife, and even David Spade, who i guess decided to be the butt monkey in place of Rob Schneider, even though apparently Nick Swardson is the new Rob Schneider. As said above, comedians who have done some decent work are here to collect a check and do the most embarrassing bullshit ever ""written"" on a cocktail napkin. Speaking of shorthand material thrown at the camera, there's a moment earlier in the film where Adam Sandler calls his own son ""fugly"" and comments about how the only way the men in his family get gorgeous women like Salma Hayek is if they're in a Hollywood movie. Good job, Adam Sandler. Do you wanna a cookie? YOu think that justifies you making a smug-fest where you and your buddies get to take a vacation in god knows where and act like a bunch of apes and treat your wives like crap? Oh and as far as his kids being ""fugly"", i really recommend Adam Sandler fans watch ""Going Overboard"", where his personality is 1000 times worse than his looks.Anyway, enough of me ranting. You'd think after Funny People, Adam Sandler would take a hint. But no. He's only looking at the dollar, instead of actual artistic integrity. And his new upcoming movie ""Blended"" looks pretty much like that atrocious ""Just Go With It"" except with Drew Barrymore. I guess she's thrown in there as a way to remind people, ""Hey America, i had an on screen chemistry with Adam Sandler, more so than my marriage to Tom Green. Please watch this movie"".

I think the main flaw in this movie is that it tries too hard to be funny, forced fun is not funny it's like being tickled by a bully for a long time, you may laugh a bit at the time but it leaves humiliated, and that's what this film is like. Also the whole movie is lazy especially the script and the plot. You know what's going to happen and hope for a twist but there is none, it's hollow. Not recommended. 1 star.

Same actors may have played but the characters were nothing similar to the ones in Grown Ups the first. It looked like the whole movie was shot in 1 day, including the scenario. This was the only Adam Sandler movie that let me down. I don't know what happened but it seems like he got some bad advice from a bad friend.

I don't understand what people were expecting while going to see a Sandler movie. No doubt there was some bad acting, still the cast in the movie was pretty amazing and widespread. It's not always good to have too many known names in the movie, as the short screen time usually leaves their characters undeveloped. None of the ""big stars"" did a bad job, mostly the inexperienced ones given too big of a role were under performing. There were a bunch of dumb jokes, some forced repetitive jokes that became annoying, but there were enough good jokes and a few nicely written family importance lectures to make it enjoyable. Sure it's not better or equal to the first one, hardly any sequel is though. Still the first movie was great and skipping this one because of bad reviews is not the way to go. Always best to see the movie and judge it yourself. I myself give it 6/10. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed that it was well worth the money.

This movie had some of the cheesiest jokes that I have ever heard and to say the plot was bad would be a compliment, because you would be crediting the writers for coming up with a plot in this waste of screen time. It seriously felt like they let a fifth grader write any joke they wanted and then put it in the script. I really hope that Adam Sandler actually tries in his next film and makes one that is worth my time like Happy Gilmore. Sadly, I expect to see more movies like Jack and Jill and Grown Ups in the upcoming future.",Grown Ups 2

Feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie as their career might be over after this. Pathetic sums it up pretty good. Even writing this review seems like a waste of time. But felt it was my duty to save people from this embarrassing movie. Since IMDb won't let me write a short review. I'll just ramble for a bit here so no need to read any further. Except for maybe Mr Sandler if he even cares what people think of his movies. Click was the latest good movie you made. And I really liked Little Nicky. Why are you making such bad movies?

I new it had bad reviews before but I though I would give it a shot. I regret this, don't watch this movie if you value humanity. Women are objectified and men are shown to be morons. The humor is gross, slap stick, and crude and even though it may get the occasional laugh it is not satisfying. This would have been okay if it had a plot, but there is no plot. This movie is so disjointed that not only does it go in the sh*t list, but so does every actor who played in this including the non-actor - Shaquille Oneal.What is even worse is that they had a lot of great material that they could have developed, but it is like they just gave up. The daughter with her hidden talent, the estranged father son relationship, the surprise pregnancy, the fake affair, and the bullying. There could have been some important life lessons taught and some even better more developed comedic situations, but it has none of this. The slap stick and farts take the dominant role. This does not even deserve a spoiler warning, because you can't spoil something so sh*tty.",Grown Ups 2

Though it was packed to the brim with cheesy and simple laughs, as most of Adam Sandler's recent and even some old movies are, it was a nice family movie, and a great sequel to the first. What you have to remember going into watching this movie, is that it is not some Oscar nominated dramatic tragedy where all the characters slowly die off, it is a nice, lighthearted film, and should be reviewed as that. As usual, Adam Sandler was perfect, Kevin James was funny, Chris Rock was hilarious and David Spade was pathetic, in an entertaining sort of way. The child actors and actresses were brilliant, and all the minor characters were as equally funny as the main ones. But to me, the funniest thing in the movie was Shaq, who made me laugh dozens of times. Overall, this movie is well deserved of more then six stars, and as having laughed the way I did, I think eight is a suitable number. To put it simply, if you loved 'Grown Ups', then you'll love 'Grown Ups 2'.",Grown Ups 2

The humor was so stupid, it was embarrassing, and I watched it by myself! I am so tired of big named actors flopping out crap movies to earn quick millions. I wish more people would wait to see a movie and check out the reviews and stop making these actors even richer when this movie doesn't deserve a single red cent. You couldn't pay me to watch it ever again.Do not waste your time or your money on this movie. This is not a Naked Gun type of funny movie. Even the dumb humor in this movie was stupid.

The actors did a great job and the overall production was well done. There was never really a dull moment of the film, my friend and I were always laughing at something. They seemed to mix the 'stupid' funny, 'sexual' funny and the 'funny' funny well. There are some hidden funny things (like how Taylor Lautner is the one who asks the men to get naked when they are about to jump off the cliff). It is much better than the first movie.

In saying this, it is in fact a very funny movie if you are open-minded and aren't looking for plot or characterization or anything else you would expect in a movie. I honestly laughed out loud multiple times and do not regret watching this movie. I can't stress enough how bad it is as a movie but it does provide a few chuckles here and there.All in all, I was expecting so much more.

I get that it's a comedy but it still has to have a good plot, like ""Nature Calls"" for example. Every character in this movie was degrading and portrayed as a loser, I would not want my kids to learn their actions.Overall if you want to watch something that is mindless, stupid, and cringy then watch it, but for people who don't like fart jokes, stay away from it like fire.",Grown Ups 2

When the credits started rolling I hadn't seen one thing that would redeem this movie. I could describe it this way: It was like they had taken a number of skits that all bombed horribly on Saturday Night Live and combined them together into what could laughingly be called the screenplay. Unfortunately, that's about the only laugh one will get from this movie. What a waste of 101 minutes!On the positive side, I feel that this movie did help me cultivate endurance.

Lazy, dumb, and totally morally bereft.This movie was racist, sexist, and ageist. It was also EXTREMELY misogynistic. And it wasn't even funny (except a few slapstick moments of farting and people getting hurt in really stupid ways)!I think what bothered me even more is that they kept the cursing out of it so it could be tagged as PG. I happened to go during kids' school holidays and the theater was packed with kids from 5 to 16. The slapstick jokes kept them laughing while exposing them to the disgusting array of discrimination.Needless to say, I walked out of the theater. I was actually so angry I nearly tried to get my money back.

I enjoyed every second of it, oh come on if you need cgi then go to fast 6 and if you need a moving story the buy a ticket for some romantic flick but with Adam Sandler on board and all the funny actors in here it is totally worthless to focus on a story, it is enjoyable the way it is and I can 100% assure you that you will laugh hard, really hard.If you are looking for a movie that delivers infinite laughs and has a great cast then grown ups 2 is the way to go.

I have to say the first was really good. It had somewhat of a plot while maintaining funny jokes and scenes throughout it. But this-- no plot. Every time they had a faint outline of one they ruined it. The most decent part about it was the jokes, but those got old and annoying. Everything was predictable, cheesy and and totally unrealistic. The scenes where the action that's happening is supposed to make you laugh were all from other comedy movies, just a lame remake of them. Tire rolling down the city. Wow didn't see that coming. The fight party scene. Totally cliché. It was all very fake. How could one take a decent movie and butcher the sequel so bad? I don't know why this has so many stars. All around a waste of my time and money! If you are going to make a movie with continuous bad humor, at least make it funny for some immature kids or tweens.

People (being PAYED for their ""contribution to society"") literally sat in chairs for HOURS writing fart joke after fart joke for a small child forced to recite the monstrosity that is the humour of these movies, and people pay money, money that they WORKED for, to go see these movies. And I'll bet SOMEONE OUT THERE thought it was the funniest thing that has ever graced their sad, dead eyes. I think that before every ""grown ups"" movie there should be a disclaimer saying that if you spent a penny of your own money on a ticket to see this on-screen terror then you are a worthless human being who should go outside and heavily reevaluate your deflated balloon of a life. Maybe afterwards they can have a group therapy session to ease the life- long guilt of spending hard earned cash to see this movie.Also on a side note about the Jewish golden boy that is Adam Sandler; You can't base an entire career on Jew jokes. Do you hear of any famous Jewish comedians? No, you don't. And do you know why? You cannot profit on being Jewish. You can profit on being black or Hispanic because they actually have material based on racial stereotypes/race specific rituals that is relatable, and if not relatable, mildly humorous. The only jokes that Jews can make are ""ha ha I'm Jewish"", and maybe someone will have a pity laugh for you because you're just not funny at all. Start writing material that isn't laced with ""happy Hanukkah"" and maybe you can reclaim your roles in shitty chick flicks that only air at 5 in the morning. You are comedy scum.I spent more time out of my life writing this ""review"" than the writers did thinking of the plot of this movie. What is the plot? Adults? What kind of plot is that? Are you legitimately cashing in on the ""comedy gold"" that is old age? This isn't Keeping Up Appearances, we don't need, or want, your sitcom- esque ""I'm old, ow my back, I'm always cranky"" jokes. Did you genuinely think this would make people laugh, or are you the one laughing while you roll around in the supposed $42.5 million that this cinematic masterpiece raked in?But you know what, all of that aside, I would crank out this eye sore if I had endless amounts of money and all the time in the world to smear my filth on the face of movie making. As my blaze of glory. Even then, I would be back at square one. Because I'm willing to bet that you shelled out more money from your greasy little pockets to get this plague into theaters than you actually made by people viewing it.I hope you go home every night feeling like you just witnessed the Holocaust, and I hope your wife doesn't let you touch her anymore.This movie is garbage.",Grown Ups 2

No. And you know what? There's no need for it, it works great without one. This is what a comedy should be sometimes. Or would you prefer the classic (and annoying) plot where guy meets girl, they hate one another, they start getting along, they break up always because of something the guy did, he does something pseudo-amazing and they live together ever after (or until a sequel where everything repeats itself)... Oh and you laugh around 2-3 times the 90 min..Well this works because this is just 4 friends remembering what they did while growing up, and attempting to redo it, while trashing each other and others in harmless fun.It's a good movie and it doesn't deserve such bad reviews.Now a word to the critics: GROW UP!! This is not a pseudo comedy for pseudo intellectuals to pretend to appreciate, honestly have you ever heard something called mindless fun? Just enjoying something without pretending everything needs to be an internal reflection on the human condition! I mean I also like the great works of art, like Inception and Cloud Atlas (two of the best master pieces ever made in the movie industry) but sometimes you also need to relax, and forget the seriousness and the fact that life is also a celebration in itself!

I thought they had a ""good"" enough trailer so sort of went along with it.Yesterday i found Grown Ups 2 the full movie on youtube for free and I tried it out. Good thing i didn't have to watch that movie in the theatersthe good: funnythe bad: all the scenes were cut up like carrots and sprinkled all over the movie, ex: (spoiler) the conflict was introduced in the middle of the movie, and the climax was shown only 10 minutes left in the movie. but in between that there was no talk about the conflict.

Very Witty! better than the first one... 80s! . Good old Fun and party!. Shaq as a cop, Steve Buscemi dressed as Vanilla Ice! and The whole story is great... I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE for anyone seeking a good laugh. Cons: the end bit doesn't explain David spade and son much... and a bit violent in the end ( i think this didn't appeal to a lot of people) but all in all. it was great. I hope the Blue ray have a different ending. But its quite FUNNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!! thanks Adam!~ recommended audience: for the Witty. There are depictions of family aspect, love of town, and the attempt to present good moral values in the film which were depicted By STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN!, a lot of immature but funny scenes, a lot of gag and jokes, running jokes and plain messiness are in the movie. At some point it seemed that stunts are jackass type too. But all in all i decided this movie is worth the buck. I hope they make a third installment but they need to get rid of the violence in the end,where the fraternity fights the townspeople, it could have gone better or if the enemy were just goons.

295,dadafadi,Completely useless but hilarious.,8,13 September 2013,"Watching Grown ups 2 was just like watching very funny is sketches that have nothing to do with each other. If the movie had a plot, I would have loved it because besides that it has a great cast and great humor. Finding a movie to compare grown ups 2 is hard since almost all movies have plots . In addition, the movie does not have any conflict by any means, Grown ups 2 made me think that Dennis Dugan (the director) had a lot of money and jokes he wanted to share with people so he said ''let's make a grown ups movie''. Honestly, no person should rush to watch grown ups 2 at the theaters , he/she should wait for it to be released on DVD . Grown ups 2 is not recommended for people who want to watch a movie with a smart plot, but for people who want to laugh no matter what.

My husband and I felt this movie is a big waste of time, money and life in general! What has happened to Adam Sandler?? He has been doing movies that were, in my opinion, borderline ignorant comedies....sometimes he pushes the limits and other times, he uses real humorous material. Seems he now is crossing completely overboard to the stupid, wasteful, mind-numbing, ignorance......Carol Burnett, Tim Conway, Don Rickles, Flip Wilson, Don Knotts, Vicky Lawrence, Harvey Korman......and so many more would not think this is real comedy....NOT FUNNY :( It takes a certain kind of person to really make someone laugh.

I was left scratching my head into what the point of this movie was. The characters were bland and without too much defining personalities; they were completely unrealistic as was the plot.

There seemed to be nothing left of humor in Adam Sandler... nothing. I had to have said ""this is a bad"" about 6 times, before turning it off, about 15 min before the end. I really didn't care how it ended. It was just not that funny. Most of his movies have stupid humor, but this was not even close to being funny. It was just poorly done.

305,autobotmuir64,The worst movie I have ever seen... PERIOD. And I've seen Batman and Robin!,1,20 December 2013,"I was on school camp when this movie was in cinemas and when the teacher announced that we would be going to the movies, I got excited because Gravity was in cinemas at the same time, but i'll get to that later. I was praying that we wouldn't see this atrocity, but what do you know. We did. The only redeeming quality about it was that me and my friend picked it apart and had a lot of fun doing so. Other than that, where do I begin? From the beginning seems like a good place...I will analyze the first scene to give you an idea of how idiotic this movie is. Adam Sandler wakes up to find a deer in his room. He does an Adam Sandler scream as the deer gets on its hind legs and urinates in his mouth. Then the deer runs out into the kitchen and Sandlers' family attempt to catch it in one of the worst scenes in cinema his-tor-y. To begin with, the scene makes no coherent sense what so ever. The deer is constructed of CGI technology so bad, it makes the special effects in Godzilla (1998) look like Avatar. The scene may have been comical if the deer was convincing enough. If they couldn't make a good looking CGI animal then they should have scraped the idea completely. Dennis Dugan thinks people are stupid. A lot of people under 14 I know loved this film, as the humor appeals to them in many ways. but what I don't understand is how they can love a film as stupid as this, and hate a movie like Gravity. Firstly, I think it has a lot to do with maturity, as Gravity deals with themes not approached at face value, that children will not understand. Secondly, Grown Ups 2 is playing it safe. Dennis Dugan knows what people expect, and plays upon the statistics to make the money he needs. But what he does not seem to realize is that people only go to his movies at the cinema because they want quick, mindless entertainment. His movies do not have replay value. Films such as Gravity do, as they have many themes and messages to ponder long after the film is finished. It urges people to watch it again and purchase it to own in their homes, and watch at will. Gravity is not made using conventional or normal methods of film making, which a lot people do not like or appreciate the first time they see it. But after a few years many films that are different become classics and inspire new and innovative ways for films to be made. I will not go into detail of the silliness of what is laughably called the ""plot"" of this film, for I know many people will not want it spoiled. But I must urge people to avoid this film, even if they enjoyed the original Grown Ups. I must also suggest that people begin to expand their acceptance of films different to most.",Grown Ups 2

Unlike the first movie, the sequel is set in one day rather than over the summer like in Grown Ups one. The film reminds me of Cheaper by the Dozen 2, in the fact that they are a large group of family/friends enjoying the summer. It is an all round happy and funny film that I would recommend it to anyone, young or old! It's nice that the whole cast live in one area too.",Grown Ups 2
311,schneide-oliv,Not impressed.,4,14 February 2014,"The wives are hot, the kids are sweet, and the men are as goofy as ever. Grown Ups 2, directed by Dennis Dugan, is nothing more than a good laugh. Although I enjoyed watching Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider act like the complete opposite of ""grown ups"" in the first film, one was definitely enough. I'd be lying if I said the film isn't funny, but it hardly qualifies as a movie. I wouldn't refer to it as acting either; it's simply Sandler spending time with his friends. First off, Schneider doesn't make a second appearance. Unfortunately, not even he could save this film. Grown Ups 2 begins with a deer that appears in Lenny and Roxanne's bedroom (played by Adam Sandler and Salma Hayek). The deer then proceeds to pee all over them and their bed... If that doesn't say this movie is going nowhere, I don't know what does. This movie is unrealistic, childish, and pointless. If you've grown up in any way since the first flick, the second is not worth your time. The first film had a clear storyline; the families were headed to the infamous lake house, in hopes of reliving old memories with friends and creating new memories with their kids. However, this film is all over the place. Lenny's wife wants another baby, Kurt and his wife are ""celebrating"" their anniversary, Eric chooses to spend time with his mom over his wife, and Higgins tries to have a relationship with his son. Meanwhile, the kids are actually growing up, going on a first date and taking a driver's test. It seems the kids are the only ones who have matured since the first film. It's the last day of school for kids. And since the bus driver is not fit for the job, Lenny drives the school bus, and then picks up Kurt (played by Chris Rock) and Eric, (played by Kevin James) as well as their kids. On the bus ride to school, a bully makes fun of Kurt's daughter along with Lenny's son, so the adults, being the mature individuals that they are, call the bully a ""beanbag with arms and legs"" with a ""Mariah Carey hairdo."" Once the kids are dropped off, they continue to ride around in the bus and go to Kmart. Ironically enough, Marcus, typically referred to by his last name Higgins, (played by David Spade) is already there. It only makes sense that four grown men would hang out at a Kmart in the middle of the day, right? Grown Ups 2 is a bunch of adult actors and actresses acting like teenagers. When it comes to the script, half of what is said during the film was probably said on the spot. While this is great, because as an actor that is hard to do, most of the dialogue ended up being just bad jokes told unsuccessfully. So if you're in the mood to see Taylor Lautner, a frat boy, refer to the men as the ""Flabby Bunch"" or Shaquille O'Neal, as a cop, peeing in a pool, this is the movie for you. It ends with a somewhat cute ending, but seeing that would require sitting through the other 90 minutes of the film. Lenny has got it right, ""We're irrelevant, we're losers, we're old.""",Grown Ups 2

I mean how could you think that Adam Sandler is not funny or did a bad job in this movie. HE DID do a great job and a lot of people tell me he shouldn't have made a sequel to the first Grown ups because it was a stupid movie too. But there wrong Grown ups was a profitable movie and it was funny. Also I was a little disappointed that Rob Schneider was not in this movie but thats OK because in my mind Shaquille o'Neal replaced him.

The core group of friends have good comedic chemistry (aside from Nick Swardson...blek), the kids are funny, and you even get to see Shaq as a dancing crossing guard. It pokes fun at fraternities, Taylor Lautner actually made me laugh, and it is unrealistic enough to let people know that those involved with the film are fully aware of the stupidity of it all and somehow that makes it better haha. That all being said, though, there were definitely parts that were stupid and/or too gross for my liking. I went to see this to take a break from stressful life and just mindlessly laugh at a few jokes, and was completely uninterested in any of the potty humor. Pee stains, fart jokes, throwing up, etc. does not make me laugh and I thought there was too much of it.Go into the movie expecting to see a typical Adam Sandler movie and you will be pleased :)",Grown Ups 2

From start to finish it is an unfunny god awful piece of utter humiliating trash. Humiliating both for each actor on screen and humiliating that you actually find yourself watching it. There is no real storyline accept the overused running gags sandler is famed for. Adam Sandler's face is on the poster and so therefore he has decided he must be portrayed as a successful ladies man punching way above his weight. Just like Jack and Jill, Just go with it and so on. The film is awful from start to finish and one can't help but think what on earth was going through their minds writing this script. The casting is terrible, how Salma Hayek ever became a successful actress is a question only the gods can answer. The film drags on and on spewing out stupid one liners and childish gags, each one will leave you wanting to rip your ears off.

322,CloudOMatic,The sequel that didn't grow up........,6,18 November 2016,"Following the mild success of the first instalment, Grown Ups 2, in my opinion, flopped for a number of reasons. One such reason is the fact that the humour that was demonstrated in the film was repetitive and overall quite bland. It almost felt like the director tried too hard to make the audience laugh, which has never worked in any film ever. The director may have been going for a quite childlike sense of humour in contrast to the adult figures however as this was also the theme in the first film it has lost its charm. I may be comparing it too much to the first film however this comparison is essential as a sequel is meant to add a new light to the feel of the original film. This film did not and in my opinion I feel like it was banking on the success of the original in order to propel it into a state of sufficient box office success which in a way it did, as fans of Adam Sandler's work would be flocking to the cinema in order to see it.On the other hand I enjoyed the plot, despite the linear nature, and found it satisfying how each individual strand connected in a penultimate fashion, with it all coming together at the 80s party. I particularly liked Chris Rock's character as he, despite losing most of the charm of the original personality, still retained part of what made his character particularly appealing.CloudOMatic",Grown Ups 2

It's not a must see for everyone but if you like Sandler and the Happy Madison crew, it's a must watch. The kids are pretty funny too, especially bumpty. Stupid funny",Grown Ups 2
325,cembohan,not all the movies are made to compete for top10 imdb.,8,11 July 2020,Nothing to fuss about. it made me so emotional seeing all those families with their grandparents to children loving each other. Such a nice family Tv movie. Good job to writers and all the cast.,Grown Ups 2
326,roryluff,Terrible,1,8 October 2017,"The definition of an awful film. No structures, the jokes were painfully bad, and the acting was equally terrible. But then again, it's an Adam Sandler and Paul Blart film, and being a sequel of a pretty average film, I wasn't expecting much either. 1 star out of 10, for sure.",Grown Ups 2

328,beboshanty,Horrible!! Worse than the first one.,1,8 November 2019,"I literally tried to laugh, Adam sandler is overrated actor, no humor at all! It's a very silly movie",Grown Ups 2
329,RaccoonBearry,This Movie is Pretty Good,6,1 August 2018,"This is actually a pretty good movie. The plot makes sense, the jokes are kinda good to, but the one problem is the actors. Every Adam Sandler Movie has almost the same Actors in it. (Examples: Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, etc.) But Overall, the movie is great.",Grown Ups 2
330,james-carrigan,Very enjoyable,10,13 November 2018,I felt had the right amount of laughs in this movie very enjoyable!,Grown Ups 2
331,pokeriscute,"I've watched half the movie, I completely hate it.",1,5 February 2019,"It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen.
The whole movie is very very sexist.
Humor is worse than a 10 year old's, Was all stale and tremendously stupid.",Grown Ups 2
332,Mitchel926,Funny Movie Had A Great Time,8,21 July 2013,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I went to see a comedy and have a great time. This movie made me laugh through out. I can't believe some people try to review this movie as if it would win an Oscar. Adam Sandler makes fun movies that are meant to show people a good time. I went there with my two sons (29 and 25 years old) and all three of us left laughing and talking about the movie the next day. I went to work and told my friends how good it was and when they went they thanked me for telling them about it.If you want to go to a movie and laugh then this is the movie for you!!! Don't over think it, it's a comedy and was made to make people smile and laugh and enjoy yourself for an hour and a half.",Grown Ups 2
