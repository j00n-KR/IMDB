0,Leofwine_draca,Scottish historical action done well,7,11 November 2018,"OUTLAW KING is a semi-sequel to the Mel Gibson classic BRAVEHEART, made over 20 years later and by Netflix of all people. You needn't worry about this being a low budget production, however, as it's actually the most expensive film ever made in Scotland, and an entirely visual experience in which the medieval era has never looked so realistic. From stunning scenery and authentic sets and props to lavish battle sequences in which CGI effects are integrated seamlessly with the real actors, this is a wonderful film to look at and behold. The story itself is straightforward, following Robert the Bruce's rise to become king of Scotland and his battles waged against Edwards I and II. There isn't a great deal of depth here, and the first half is quite slow, but that's not really a problem. Chris Pine does well with the material, perhaps not as charismatic as Gibson was but arguably more realistic. The supporting cast work very hard too, aside from Florence Pugh, but then it's not really her fault given her underwritten and extraneous role (she's only there to have a female character in the story). Elsewhere, the film doesn't shy away from the gore of the era, which is all for the better, and it builds to a climax that satisfies. Will a sequel follow? I hope so.",Outlaw King
1,SnoopyStyle,history lesson,6,17 November 2018,"In 1304, Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine), under his father's command, joins the other nobles to submit to the King of England after their defeat. Only William Wallace remains free as a marauding outlaw. After the execution of Wallace, Robert slowly decides to unite the Scots in an uprising against the English.This is inevitably compared to Braveheart. Certainly, it's a lower budget affair. The battles are smaller, more brutal, more chaotic, and more visceral. Somehow I find them fitting for the times. It's Chris Pine where the difference is more noticeable. He's a modern American actor. He's more emo and less commanding. That's a problem for this commander of men. This is a brutal time. While he does harden over the course of the movie, he does not leave behind his modern sensibilities. He's not hitting the right notes for this iconic man. His wife is also a bit bland although I do like their relationship. It seems that all the elements are there but it doesn't quite have the gravitas. This is a history lesson but as a human story, it lacks a certain human touch. The emotional journey rings a little hollow.",Outlaw King
2,Prismark10,To play the king,5,14 November 2018,"This is a muddy, grungy and semi fictionalised follow up from the William Wallace story who is now dead in this film as the focus moves on to Robert the Bruce.Robert Bruce (Chris Pine) pledges loyalty to King Edward I (Stephen Dillane) and the king provides him with his new bride Elizabeth (Florence Pugh.)However the peace is short lived as Robert leads a rebellion and the king sends his son Edward (Billy Howle) to brutally repress it.It is a muddled and soggy film. It starts off with a good opening shot that ends with a firebolt thrown at a castle. It shows that for a Netflix feature a lot of money has been spent on it. The final blood soaked battle shots are again well staged demonstrating that this is a lavish production.Chris Pine is a bit restrained and even sensitive as the Scots warrior. The Highlands look wonderful but the movie is a bit of a slog.",Outlaw King
3,nogodnomasters,Today we are beasts,5,31 December 2018,"In 1304 the King Of Scotland dies with no apparent heir, so the Scottish nobles ask the King of England (Stephen Dillane) to help pick the king. Guess how that works out? After 8 years of fighting, truce, then no truce. Chris Pine kills his Scottish rival and unites the people to challenge the English army in an all male mud wrestling event with horses. Yup, that is the climax, sorry. The people in the film were rather dull and lifeless.Guide: Sex and Nudity (Rebecca Robin)",Outlaw King
4,kosmasp,Wallace successor,8,15 June 2019,"So I had no idea what this was going to be about, but the movie works even without any previous knowledge. Actually even if you haven't seen Braveheart, you will get thrown into circumstances that you will get very quickly. Maybe not have seen Braveheart works better for some, because they won't compare the two movies, no matter when they play time wise in History.Having said all that, Chris Pine is really relishing in a role that is quite difficult to pull off. He has to be tough yet show a ""softer"" side too. Especially when it comes to his wife. Now how much of this is accurate, I can't tell, because I'm not read up on the details of what actually happened. I'm guessing that the bigger events/fights are more or less accurate. There is blood, there is a bit of nudity and there is a lot of fighting with swords ... if that sounds like ""fun"" to you, the movie will be entertaining. And you will also learn a little bit of actual history",Outlaw King
5,searchanddestroy-1,Awesome directing but lousy script,7,15 November 2018,"Yes, a lousy script because everything is predictable here, he good vs the evil one. We have seen this thousands times before. But the directing is more than powerful, acting too, and I don't speak of the realistic scenes of battle. Brutal, bloody, terrific sequences. But for the rest, sorry, but nothing new. I HIGHLY prefered BRAVEHEART or ROB ROY, because of Tim Roth's character.",Outlaw King
6,CinemaSerf,History be damned....,5,17 June 2020,"Ok, as a Scot I have to say that this might as well have had Errol Flynn and Claude Rains in it, for all the historical accuracy it delivers. So, second time of watching I decided to watch it as another historical adventure film.. and it still falls short. Chris Pine as ""Robert Bruce"" isn't actually so terrible as he tries to rally the Scots nobles to defy their English overload. Pine's problem is that he has nobody to really work with. Aside from an almost honorary appearance from James Cosmo as his father, the rest of the cast feature wonderfully in the good looks department - Billy Howle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Florence Pugh as his initially unwilling wife; but their performances are lacklustre at best. It shows off some lovely Scottish scenery to good effect - indeed the cinematographic and costume aspects lend a considerable degree of detail to the grubbiness and toughness of Scottish existence in the 14th Century, but the dialogue is weak and the story meanders like a typical wee burn. Netflix need to take a long hard look at their investment in these factual-based dramas - it's not just about headline cast, the writing and research has got to improve, otherwise we might as well do it all in a back lot in Los Angeles.",Outlaw King
7,ferguson-6,mud and blood,6,10 November 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Much was made of the 'artistic license' director Mel Gibson took in creating his own version of historical events and actions of William Wallace for his Oscar-winning BRAVEHEART (1995). Director David Mackenzie (in his follow up to the excellent HELL OR HIGH WATER, 2016) pays a bit more attention to historical details as he picks up the story at the end of Wallace's rebellion - and the beginning of the uprising led by Robert the Bruce.Chris Pine plays Robert the Bruce, a man forced to pledge loyalty to Kind Edward I and England prior to leading the rebellion. It's the year 1304 and director Mackenzie's opening sequence is a several minute long tracking shot that is simply superb. It features our introduction to Robert the Bruce (Pine), King Edward I (Stephen Dillane) and Prince Edward (Billy Howle, ON CHESIL BEACH), as well as an early swordfight and an eye-popping fireball shot from an enormous catapult into the protective wall of a distant castle.Not long after, we learn William Wallace has been killed, the King has provided Robert the Bruce a wife in Elizabeth de Burgh (Florence Pugh, LADY MACBETH) and Robert takes the life of fellow Scotsman John Comyn ... an act that costs him dearly in the early going. However, it does lead to his being named King of Scots by the Church, and he slowly begins to build his forces. Of course, Scotland's forces are always dwarfed in numbers by that of the English Empire, but never in spirit.Pine plays Robert the Bruce as the strong, (mostly) silent leader, while Howle and Aaron Taylor-Johnson cross into camp in their respective portrayals of Prince Edward (yet another wide-eyed son intent on making his father proud) and James Douglas (a manic, crazy-eyed Scotsman bent on revenge). Ms. Pugh brings courage and a headstrong nature to Elizabeth (in far too limited a role), while Mr. Dillane shows us a worn down King Edward I who gets the film's best line ... ""I am so sick of Scotland!""The two words of the title are actually separated by a slash in the opening credits; a device meant to emphasize the dual sides to the man and his actions. In addition to that opening long shot, there is a visually stunning sequence of a nighttime raid on a camp site. Unfortunately after that, we get mostly mud and blood, including the pivotal Battle of Loudon Hill which features the ultimate in home field advantage. There are some terrific costumes and set pieces, but mostly it's elaborate and detailed moviemaking (with a few downright silly moments) that never fully clicks. Perhaps that's a factor of having 5 different writers involved. With many familiar faces from ""Game of Thrones"", it will be interesting to see how this plays on laptops and TVs via Netflix. Another Robert the Bruce film is scheduled for theatrical release in 2019, and the inevitable comparison will be made at that time.",Outlaw King
8,phd_travel,A realistic more modern sequel to Braveheart,7,6 February 2019,"Actually this movie is quite good. Don't give up during the slow part in the beginning. The story is quite clear, the Scottish accents aren't too incomprehensible, the filming is on location and quite beautiful at times and muddy and realistic at others.
Chris Pine doesn't act to big hero like or put on too much of an accent. He is part of the bigger story instead of the movie being all about him. Supporting cast including Florence Pugh as his wife and Aaron Taylor Johnson as his ally are effective.It's not Braveheart. It's good in a different way - less Hollywood and more modern. Surprised it was just released on Netflix with the big battle scenes.",Outlaw King
9,Wuchakk,A superior and realistic medieval film,8,23 November 2018,"""Outlaw King"" (2018) is the sequel to the events shown in ""Braveheart"" (1995). The story begins in 1304 during the last year of William Wallace's life. After Wallace is drawn-and-quartered, Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) takes up the torch for Scotland's war of independence over England. Disregarding the excellent epilogue, the movie ends with the Battle of Loudoun Hill in 1307 where Robert the Bruce takes on a 3000-man English force with only 600 Scots.""Outlaw King"" is actually better than the overrated ""Braveheart"": Chris Pine is an all-around superior protagonist to Gibson; Florence Pugh is more beautiful compared to Sophie Marceau (or Catherine McCormack) in a petite, curvy way; not to mention she's a more interesting character; the locations are better (even though the locations in ""Braveheart"" are excellent); the music edges out the score to ""Braveheart""; the movie's more streamlined and consistent; and the film's all-around more compelling and realistic.True, ""Outlaw King"" doesn't top Patrick McGoohan's delightfully diabolic portrayal of the pompous Longshanks nor does it have the superb defenestration sequence. But it lacks the sluggish start of ""Braveheart"" (the opening 25 minutes); the eye-rolling betrayal scene; the equally eye-rolling episode where Wallace rides into a noble's bed chamber on a freakin' horse and easily escapes (Why Sure!); and, lastly, the overlong and dull execution sequence in ""Braveheart"" wherein the Christ symbolism is laid on too thick.It's also more historically accurate in that it doesn't have the Scots wearing kilts or painting their faces, nor does it wrongly have Robert the Bruce betraying Wallace, which never happened (although he initially disowned him publicly, obviously for political reasons, he secretly supported his war effort and openly admitted it later).While ""Outlaw King"" is more historically accurate, it has its own less significant inaccuracies: Elizabeth & Majorie actually escaped Kildrummy Castle, along with Robert's sisters, but were found by Edward's men shortly later; Edward II (Billy Howle) wasn't even at the Battle of Loudoun Hill so, naturally, the duel with Edward II never happened; actually, Edward I (Stephen Dillane) was not yet dead when this battle was fought in 1307 so his son was not yet crowned; Queen Elizabeth wasn't put in a cage, but Robert's sister was; the English were already familiar with the Scottish hedgehog formation by the time of Loudoun Hill and, in fact, destroyed this formation with arrows nine years earlier at Falkirk; Elizabeth was held in captivity for over seven years before Robert could negotiate her return in 1314 after his great victory at the Battle of Bannockburn (the movie makes it seem much shorter).Closing word: If you like realistic medieval flicks like the excellent ""Tristan + Isolde"" (2006) be sure to check out ""Outlaw King.""The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot mostly in Scotland, but also England. Whilst this is a Netflix movie, it cost a whopping $120 million and looks it.GRADE: B+/A-",Outlaw King
10,deloudelouvain,Accurate or not it's entertaining.,7,10 October 2020,"Whether it is historically accurate or not I couldn't tell you but what I can tell you with certainty is that Outlaw King is an entertaining movie. In this genre and about that time period it's a well made movie with realistically looking battles that made me wonder if horses got hurt or not, that's how good it sometimes looked. The cast was well chosen as well, good actors that looked like they could have lived at that time. The story is for sure worth telling, and even if everything is apparently not one hunderd percent accurate it's still worth watching. The battle scenes are bloody and intense, those are the best parts of the movie, and there are quite a few of those.",Outlaw King
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Generally impressive, despite some niggling flaws",7,26 November 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWhen the Scottish royal ancestral bloodline loses a member, they turn to King Edward 1 of England (Stephen Dillane) to maintain order, but instead he enslaves Scotland and forces them to bend to his will, with his son Seamus (Stephen McCole) happy to enact it. Following the defeat of William Wallace, the people turn to a new saviour, Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine), though he is rejected by the church for having a murder to his name. But with the love of his beautiful wife Elizabeth (Florence Pugh) and the heart of a lion, Bruce sets out to continue Wallace's legacy...While historical yarns are not really my favoured thing, much publicity has come the way of this Netflix original, featuring hot Hollywood talent Chris Pine and directed by David Mackenzie, the man behind Hell or High Water and Starred Up. Initially appearing as a sort of Braveheart lite, this is actually a continuation of that film's story, about the man who came after William Wallace. This is certainly a highly relevant part of Scotland's history (and certainly the main explanation behind the older generation's highly contentious attitude towards the English), and many have complained that the film would have served better as a series than a film, with all the important events that needed to be dramatized...Pine is well suited in the lead role, capturing Bruce's charisma, machismo and pulling off a very convincing Scottish accent. While none of the supporting cast quite match his performance, they certainly enhance the experience with their competency and suitability. Aesthetically, Mackenzie's film fires on all cylinders too, with some genuinely breath-taking, sweeping, visceral cinematography and lavish costume design (that meticulously stays all clean and sparkly, despite all the fighting and mud stomping!) On the downside, it has to contend with a slow, sluggish pace that fails to always keep the viewer engaged, and some ill drawn out supporting characters that add little to the broth.For those interested in further exploring the legend behind Robert the Bruce, though, this is well worth your time, suitably and unflinchingly brutal and gory where it needs to be, convincingly recreating the time period it's set in and rounded off with an epic, climactic battle sequence. Not so much Braveheart lite, just Braveheart on a bit more of a budget. ***",Outlaw King
12,ThomasDrufke,Riveting,8,15 November 2018,"I really wish I would have seen this in theaters and not sitting in my basement on a 50 inch television screen. Sure, I don't have the distractions of a theater and I can pause it whenever I want, but sometimes those can actually add to the theater going experience. Outlaw King is quite the film, and it is 100% something that would benefit from a large screen with 4k resolution. It works as both a riveting follow up to Braveheart (1995) and a potent standalone adventure about Robert the Bruce. Admittedly, it does feel like there's some stuff missing, with the obvious absence of the Battle of Bannockburn. And there were many reports of some serious editing this film went through after initial screenings, but I found the entire film to be extremely engaging and epic. Just like Braveheart, you feel the weight of the conflict between the Scots and English, and just how much of an underdog they truly were. Chris Pine gives one of his best performances as the titular character and the rest of the cast (including several Game of Thrones alums) give similar turns. I loved this film.8.6/10",Outlaw King
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,20 November 2018,"Outlaw KingThe key to being a great Scottish King is making sure your Queen's woolen fleece is sheared every summer.However, the ruler in this drama has broken from tradition and married a human.In the wake of William Wallace's execution, Scottish King Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) plots a rebellion against the monarchy. But when an Englishman overhears his plans, Robert has no choice but to slay them. This murderous act incites England to declare Robert, his new wife (Florence Pugh) and their allies (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tony Curran) outlaws.While this historical Netflix film plays fast-and-loose with the facts, the overall experience is a visceral one backed by gory battle scenes, stirring speeches and convincing portrayals. In fact, it stands as the best feature the streaming service has produced thus far.However, it would've been easier to get the British out of Scotland by staging a Robert Burns poetry reading.

14,851222,Good,7,6 December 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Outlaw King"" (2018) is was a good, pretty spectacular action, biography, history movie. I liked this story, which i did not knew very much about. I liked acting, of this movie looked and was crafted. The only downside for me events was that some events were told very quickly - but i understand that because its not documentary, and still at running time 2 h 5 min this was pretty well paced. Also battle scenes were brual and bloody. The ending scene reminded me of course ""Braveheart"" - it wasn't as good as in that movie (still), but they were very good.",Outlaw King
15,Thanos_Alfie,The king of Scotland...,7,5 July 2019,"""Outlaw King"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the story of how Robert the Bruce who was the 14th century Scottish 'Outlaw King' used everything he had including bravery to defeat the English army. He raised an army of Scottish fighters and started a rebellion. They had to fight against an English army which was very well equipped and of course it was much larger but nothing could stop them from fighting for their freedom.I liked this movie very much because it was based on some true historic events, it consisted of many great scenes with much of suspense and action, and a very good direction. Regarding the interpretations I have to say that I was stunned by the interpretation of Chris Pine who played as Robert Bruce - Earl of Carrick because he was simply amazing, something that it was a very nice surprise for me. Other good interpretations were Stephen Dillane's who played as the King Edward I of England, Billy Howle's who played as Edward, Prince of Wales and James Cosmo's who played as Robert Bruce Senior. The direction which was made by David Mackenzie was very interesting and with many good scenes with which he presented very well the difficulties of the Scottish people and what obstacles they had to surpass in order to be free.Finally, I have to say that ""Outlaw King"" is a great movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and if you haven't already watched the movie ""Braveheart"" then it's a very good opportunity to combine these two movies by watching first the movie ""Braveheart"" and after that the movie ""Outlaw King"".",Outlaw King
16,cruise01,One of Netflix's better movies and great performances by Chris Pine.,7,7 December 2018,"Outlaw King (3.5 out of 5 stars).Outlaw King is surprisingly a better Netflix film than I expected. Not by much though. For a historical action drama film. A plot about Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) who launched a war against King Edward. The performances were great. It had some exciting and gritty violent battles. And the plot could have been better laid out instead of feeling a little rushed with the beginning and trying to end it abruptly. It was a pretty fair film.The beginning of the first 20 minutes felt rushed. A stunning long sequence with a one camera one shot scene of seeing Robert and his father camping outside a castle. Once, the plot slows down so you can figure out who the characters are. After Robert is married to Elizabeth (Florence Pugh). And Robert goes to town to see the English people are plotting to revolt against Edward I of England. That is were the plot kicks into gear with Robert trying to recruit an army together. While Edward is moving in on trying to find him.Chris Pine gave a great performance as Robert the Bruce. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tony Curran, and Florence Pugh were all good.The film does have some built up emotional tension and can be gritty with its bloody violence. I felt like the battle sequence could have been better directed. Director was too focused on close up fight sequences, quick editing, and it just made the battle scenes a little confusing on what is going on. During the climatic battle, it was difficult trying to make out on what was going on in the fight scene. And the movie tried ending a little too abruptly. Like after the battle was over, the resolution was shown through the epilogue captions. Felt like they had difficulties trying to end the movie.Overall, Outlaw King is a pretty fair film. Acting was great. The plot was a bit rushed with characters not having development or having enough time for the story to be inspirational. And a poor direction during the action scenes. It was definitely a film that will provide entertainment when you are bored.",Outlaw King
17,eddie_baggins,A fine film that feels rushed and cold,6,11 November 2018,"Having found success with smaller character driven films such as Starred Up and even more so critically and commercially with Hell of High Water in 2016, Scottish born director David Mackenzie has found himself in charge of his biggest feature yet with Robert the Bruce tale Outlaw King, a $70 million plus Netflix film that is one of the streaming giants most ambitious films yet in size and scope.Unfortunately for the well-regarded filmmaker, Outlaw King has faced a rough journey to living rooms around the world after a disastrous premiere at this years Toronto International Film Festival where Mackenzie's high-reaching epic was derided by critics as to long and plodding to be regarded as a success.This unwanted publicity and advanced word of mouth lead to Mackenzie completely re-working his vision to scrap roughly 20 minutes of footage to create the version we now get to stream, a brave move from the director and one that is amiable and commendable in a day and age where a number of filmmakers refuse to take a hard lined approach to cutting runtimes but curiously with that Outlaw King feels like a rather rushed and unfocussed experience that suffers from the consequences of being re-focussed at the end game.It's not to say Outlaw King is a bad film perse, it's actually an eminently watchable and often thrilling experience, a stunning opening tracking shot is the undeniable work of a master filmmaker while the visuals and battle scenes will be winners for any Braveheart or medieval fans but there's something that feels odd and off about Outlaw King's ebb and flow as we journey from key Bruce moment to key Bruce moment, with little time to stop and smell the roses or contemplate what has come before or what now lays before us a viewer.There's scarily little time spent on developing Bruce's relationship with his family, either his wife or beloved brothers or in his engagement with his loyal band of guerrilla warfare soldiers and by the time the films thrilling final battle takes place (seemingly out of nowhere), you feel as though the film has rushed to its conclusion.You can't help but escape the feeling that having more time to flesh out the character of Pine's Bruce or the life changing events he was going through to take back his country from the reign of the English would've benefited the film greatly, as Pine is a fine leading man presence in an untypical role for the Hollywood heartthrob whose ably supported by rising star Florence Pugh as his loyal second wife Elizabeth Burgh and in particular Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the fiercely determined James Douglas, with the actor bringing a feverish and manic energy to the role of a mistreated Lord.Without this fleshing out, Outlaw King's battles, character movements and performance can only take the film so far, becoming a visually grandiose yet emotionally cold film, that's pace and structure feels rushed and curiously disengaging.It's a shame that the film feels this way, an unfortunate victim of a harsh and judgemental critical lambasting that changed the course of its destiny, a grand and high-reaching epic that would've possibly been the exact type of cinematic and large-scale film Netflix needs more of, that has now become a watchable and enjoyable experience but one that's lacking the heart, soul and scope that would've made it so much more.Final Say -Outlaw King is a fine film but also one that feels like the victim of an overly harsh edit. Considering Mackenzie is such a fine curator of characters and place, Outlaw King's failures in this area are a shame, as it ends up becoming another Netflix film that could've been.3 pre-battle hot spring visits out of 5",Outlaw King

19,southdavid,Monarch Of The Glen.,5,10 April 2019,"I feel it would only be fair to provide a bit of context to this review. I did not see ""Outlaw King"" in the most ideal of settings. I watched it on a small Ipad screen, whilst on holiday, splitting the film over two nights as I was too exhausted to make it through it on one sitting.Reuniting with this ""Hell Or High Water"" director, Chris Pine plays ""Robert The Bruce"" who is proclaimed King of Scotland following an unsuccessful war to expel the English from the land. His campaign against a much larger invading force becomes one of tactics and cunning, using persuasion and the land itself to his advantage.From what I could tell, performances in ""Outlaw King"" were pretty good. Chris Pine is excellent and his accent work is pretty solid throughout. It seemed very focussed through on telling its specific part of the overall Scottish independence story, and I'm really not sure why. If there was indeed a cut at four hours, surely Netflix could have asked for it to be recut as a mini-series. (And certainly why they haven't now, once the initial furore around the film has died down is strange.)The film is, it has to be said, a little on the dull side. This can be the trade off with historical accuracy I suppose, and there will be people on both sides hammering you whatever decision you make, but given that the relationships don't seem to really get solidified anyway, cutting further action scenes whilst keeping those felt like the wrong decision.I'm not going to say any more, or be any more negative as, as I said, my viewing experience was certainly not as the director would have intended, but based on my experience, it's tough to recommend it too highly.",Outlaw King

Pine is a solid Hollywood choice here, well supported by seemingly every Scottish actor on the planet and the excellent scene stealing Florence Pugh as his bride.

23,dierregi,One of the goriest version of Robert Bruce's story,6,9 October 2020,"Moviemakers are fascinated by the never-ending strife between England and Scotland. After the huge success of Braveheart there have been other movies on the subject and this is one of the latest.Outlaw/King takes lots of liberties with the truth, but it is quite entertaining and it gets the main facts more or less right. It also gives a chance to the audience to enjoy the spectacular landscape. The beautiful scenery is probably the only thing to enjoy because the movie is brutal to the extreme.Brutality and gore are not gratuitous but used to show (probably even with restrain) how violent were the times of Robert Bruce.The plot starts with Robert trying to make peace with Edward I and continues with his claiming the Scottish crown, because of English greed and violence against the Scots. During the following fights, Robert's wife and daughter are made prisoners and some of Robert's brothers get killed in most unsavoury ways.The movie ends with the final battle of Loudoun Hill, shown also with graphic violence.

The acting is serviceable, but the costumes, period sets, and cinematography is world-class. The battle scenes are realistic to the point a few may find certain ones too much so. The story works and it's not meant to be any kind of definitive history lesson which it is not. That would be a different movie and would likely be too long eschewing much of the entertainment factor which is the point here.

There are big dramatic scenes here, with great effects, and lots of blood. I was impressed at how the narrative followed the actual history as we know it.

26,jadepietro,A Saga That Sags,7,13 November 2018,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Epic in its battle scene minus the human drama.JIM'S REVIEW: David MacKenzie's historical drama, Outlaw King, has plenty of action, lotsa battle scenes where many are hacked to death or eviscerated in all its gory close-up details and blood-spurting effects. Were such accuracy and consideration given to the personal drama of this biography, the film would have been a memorable experience. As it stands, it is epic in its production values and splendidly photographed by Barry Ackroyd. Technically very well made but lacking in depth, the story follows the life of Robert The Bruce, a Scottish king who fought against the English to gain his rightful property.Mr. Mackenzie depicts this legendary tale quite effectively. But the director seems more interested in the rebellion and capturing the 14th century trappings that he gets trapped into sacrificing the human drama behind the war. He stages the action scenes with much flourish but loses the battle with his script. At times, the pacing of the film is rushed with gaps of the narrative that are not fully developed. The screenplay-by-committee has five writers listed which might explain the literary confusion.Chris Pine stars in the title role and he is fine. Although his Scottish brogue is inconsistent and disappears more often than his clothing, the actor uses his good looks and charm to be convincing. (Much has been made of his full frontal display...much ado about nothing.) Strong support comes from Stephen Dillane, Tony Curran, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. As the villain of the piece, Billy Howle has his moments. That he was enthusiastic in his wild interpretation of his character is obvious to any moviegoer. The actor could and should have been reined in by the director as he deliberately goes so over-the-top in many scenes which actually undercuts his role.By far, the best performance comes from Florence Pugh as Robert's wife, Elizabeth. With all the testosterone surrounding her, she simply steals the film from its mostly male cast and delivers a haunting portrayal of a woman whose loyalty is tested. She becomes the necessary emotional core to the film. Both Ms. Pugh and Mr. Pine have a nice bonding throughout the film and one wishes more emphasis and screen time had been placed on their love story. That would have provided the impact which the film falls short in providing.Still, if big action set pieces and grisly violence is your preference, then, by all means, see Outlaw King. It is an earnest and highly serviceable film. However, my sagas are in need of more backstory than back stabbing.",Outlaw King

Coupled with poor acting, that is almost wooden like, and ridiculous dialog, it just does not work. Overall, it's a silly try and depicting a really important event in Scottish history.

This was good, pretty well acted, but if you're looking for historical accuracy read a book.

Chris Pine stood out the most as the lead, stunning performance.David Mackenzie was the one that made this movie into a good medieval to a great medieval movie with his focus on realism like the lightning and mood of the movie, the cinematography was beautiful and the sets they used makes me want to visit Scotland.
The choreography and the raw/gritty fight scenes played out so well, I would describe it as pure chaos.Only bad thing I could think of was that the writing and script could have been better at times but it sure is a great movie!",Outlaw King
36,juliankennedy23,Wanted Dead or Alive,8,16 November 2018,"Outlaw King: 8 out of 10: Robert the Bruce declares himself king of Scotland and looks to lead his people from under the tyranny of an English king.The Good: The acting: Chris Pine performance in this film is amazing. There are a few scenes where you can tell its Chris Pine, a smirk here or a glance there. For most of the film, however, he simply disappears in the role. Certainly, a performance that could gather some awards.I already praised Florence Pugh as the best thing in Malevolent and she threatens to be the best thing here. She also looks the part. She comes across as both a child bride in an arranged marriage (a price for Robert the Bruce to not betray the English) and a woman who can hold her own. If HBO had any sense they would find a way to do a Game of Thrones spinoff starring Pugh. She is that magnetic and in touch with the material.The sets and costumes seem spot on and genuine. Excellent use of extras and scenery. You can tell this was a true labor of love by director David Mackenzie. The whole film has a wonderful understated realistic feel. A beautifully shot film.The action scenes are also really well done. Very realistic and yet tense. Appropriate scale for the times and the type of warfare.The Bad: One cannot watch or review this film without using Braveheart as some sort of touchstone. (Sorry Rob Roy) Outlaw King cleans Bravehearts clock in things like historical accuracy and costume design. It certainly holds its own against Braveheart in acting chops. I would argue that it also has better (and more realistic battle scenes than Braveheart.) But the race isn't one-sided. If I were to rate them I would give them a gentleman's tie.You see Braveheart is about William Wallace and Outlaw king is about Robert the Bruce. Mel Gibson knew exactly what he was doing when he picked Wallace. A true heroes tale of a lesser noble avenging the death of his wife and driving both the English king and his Scottish lackeys crazy. Robert the Bruce on the other hand.... To put this in Star Wars terms Gibson made a film about Han Solo while Mackenzie made a film about Lando Calrissian if we are being generous or Sheev Palpatine if we are not.I understand that Robert the Bruce is a national hero and time and patriotism will smooth some rough edges. Everyone admires Washington crossing the Delaware but few then remember why he was crossing and what he did when he got there.I think Chris Pine does a fantastic job but that is not Robert the Bruce. It is some sort of sensitive man who declares himself king out of loyalty to his people. He likes children and animals and takes no for an answer in such a sensitive way. If only those other Scots would listen to him and follow him instead of fighting among themselves.Robert the Bruce was a bastard. He killed anyone who stood in the way between him and the Scottish throne. English and Scots alike. One historian said his story was Macbeth but with a happy ending. Imagine if Benedict Arnold had stabbed Washington to death then betrayed the British and led the American Revolution. Yeah, that is our guy.Outlaw King also makes the common mistake of trying to stack the deck by making the opponents of our protagonist easily identifiable bad guys. You know raping, pillaging, swan chocking, scenery-chewing bad guys. It is a bit silly.The Ugly: The movie had over twenty minutes cut from it for theatrical release and you can feel it. It is a relaxed film for a Scottish war epic but particularly, in the beginning, it could have used a bit more background on who was who and what was what.In Conclusion: This is a really good film with some flaws. Great performances and scenery and costumes go a long way to making this an enjoyable romp. I have a feeling that scenes were added and subtracted due to focus groups rather than artistic vision causing the rough edges to be filed off of more than just the main character.",Outlaw King

38,joachimokeefe,"It *feels* authentic, and punches above its weight.",9,11 November 2018,"Apparently a lot of money was splurged on this post-William (Braveheart) Wallace dramatisation by Netflix. Strangely, it looks cheap, kind of not-quite-Breughel colouring, as if they're trying to disguise the CGI. But I do like the bits where they go from indoors to outdoors in one take. If you've seen Braveheart, it's like that with authentic lighting, and the pseudo-Zen-master-bloke off the dreadful Royal Bank of Scotland ads (James Cosmo). But they do give you their money's worth in scenery and staging.The battle scenes - and the horse wrangling - are absolutely stunning. Best battle scenes since 'The 300 Spartans'. And that was better than 'Saving Private Ryan'. Flinch and wince, rinse and repeat. Real Scottish mud, blood and English fuds.Who cares if it's historically accurate or not?

I do not get the weak reputation it recently got because it was a great and epic Knight's Tale and got everything a film like this needs to fulfill my expectations: Epic Look, fantastic cinematography, very decent acting and a very solid direction. The only flaw you could point out is the rather weakish screenplay that deserved more work to justify a great heroic story like this. But there were many aspects that made up for that.
Chris Pine was pretty good in the lead as Robert the Bruce and turns into one of his best performances. I liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson in an almost unrecognizable role and Billy Howle made a good villain. Florence Pugh ones again turns into a charismatic performance. Really one actress to look out for, she will go places. Stephen Dillane was fabulous and gave probably the best performance. But also his character deserved to be flashier. It's an interesting piece of history that influenced a lot of Great Brittain. David Mackenzie sure knows how to direct epic scenes and I hope this was not the last time he touched this theretory.

It didn't bomb. The acting was legitimately very good. The battle scenes fit. The outfits and scenery were great. The only thing that wasn't that great was the pacing. Some of it felt too rushed and maybe a little forced but other than that it was great. Chris Pine killed it as did a few of his men in the movie. It was nice to finally see the Scots win their freedom instead of just hear Mel Gibson talk about it in the end of Braveheart.

It paints a rather unpersuasive and neither well written nor well acted picture of the protagonist, and it ends on one of the greatest anticlimaxes ever committed to the big screen. The audience ends up feeling cheated, because the whole thing leads nowhere. Just as it kind of gets interesting, the film ends, and then simply informs us of the events it can't be bothered to present to us.

It starts with a blistering one take, ends with a cracking skirmish. It boats a toasty villain in Edward II, a dedicated central performance from an authentically Scottished Pine and a notably breakout Florence Pugh. The dialogue crackles with a classic charm and it's not without its stings of humour. And with that Netflix money, the sets and costumes are superb. Mackenzie has a strong eye and has made a cohesive, pacey but rich epic where his masters have recently been failing.

54,eagandersongil,A good movie but without feeling,7,20 November 2018,"The Legitimate King,"" David Mackenzie's new film comes with the proposal to continue the history of the classic ""Braveheart"" and by many, was given the nickname ""Brave New Heart"" but the film is on a plateau below and sins precisely in what ""Braveheart"" has to spare, Feeling. David, in giving a historical context, tries to make his script more fluid, but this does not happen, because the contextualization is given without depth, we are inserted in a Scotland that lives a fight of power, and suddenly, we are seeing the dispute of 2 kings to the throne, the events that lead to it are very fast and even a bit confusing and fictional, everything is done in the first act, leaving the next two to conflicts.
Technically, ""The Legitimate King"" is very good for innovating some techniques in a medium-age film, such as the handheld camera used at various times and a high use of zoom in and out, of course, this takes a but it is very nice to see such features being well applied and to give an air of ""Difference"" to the film, another point to be spoken, is the sequences plans, which are used in some scenes, but mainly in the first scene of the film where we have a sequential plan of almost ten minutes beautiful. The film has a good soundtrack, but that calls for a little more euphoria, editing, and sound mixing are good, especially in battles, which are simple but cruel, turbulent, bloodthirsty, with a lot of graphic violence and stunning, but it also lacks an ""epic"" factor. Chris Pine is not well on paper, the actor does not convey charisma and does not make the viewer believe in his fight, it's as if we do not twist for him or we just do not care who he will be king, lack emotion and passion to the actor, but the highlights Billy Howle and Callan Mulvey as well as Florence Pugh, who is undermined by the script, which puts its core aside and at some point in the film, is simply abandoned from the drama leaving a good dramatic feature aside.
Some terms in this criticism are common, and I will use them to conclude, to begin with, the lack of the ""epic"" factor, the ""Legitimate King"" seems a film, simple, minor, this is due to the set of technical factors, are bad, but that they are strange in this film proposal, in addition, the lack of emotion, feeling, soul, spirit and heart, are the fault of the artistic part by the script that does not excite and by the performance of Chris Pine that does not convince, as if to be moved to see the movie, to cheer or to believe in the protagonist during the long, its cause does not bring us feeling. But even so, ""The Legitimate King"" within his problems, is a good movie, fun, with some cool features and cool story. Note 7.",Outlaw King
55,Med-Jasta,Very well done!,10,6 August 2020,"I find praise for modern movies hard to hand out but this one deserves it. The story is very well told with strong visuals and doesn't rely on modern gimmicks to ""grab"" your attention.After Star Trek I didn't think Chris Pine would be an actor to follow. He was great in that but I assumed he was a one trick pony. Not only is he a good and diverse actor but he also makes good choices. So many actors are consistently in bad movies. They are good but the movies aren't. Christian Bale is one. But Pine has good taste or instincts.The action scenes are killer! Good shots and good CG! So many movies phone in the CG and ruin the scene. This CG is flawless and it's good to see well executed CG. It really helped tell the story. The final battle had the horses and people so close together that this couldn't have been achieved with real people. It was nice to see people using the tool correctly. There's no excuse in these days to have bad CG. Jurassic Park still beats most movies.Of course this continues the story of Braveheart but while that movie was inspired by a true story this one sticks to the facts and contradicts Braveheart. Which is fine because they're going for truth and aren't a direct sequel. And they make zero attempt to follow on the footsteps of the classic and made their own movie.",Outlaw King
56,DeBBss,One of Netflix's Best Movies,7,9 December 2018,"I'm not really a fan of Netflix movie, because most of them feel really cheap,like Tau. I wasn't really expecting to enjoy this movie, but since Chris Pine is in this one, it convinced my enough to watch it. I'm a huge fan of these types of movies, and I feel like most of the movies like Outlaw King aren't brutal or realistic enough. Outlaw King reminds so much of Saving Private Ryan, with the realism of war. This movie feels so realistic, to the clothing, the hygiene, the warfare, and society. I'm really impressed with Netflix, and I hope they make more movies like Outlaw King.The story continues right after the death of William Wallace, and I recommend that you watch Braveheart before watching Outlaw King, for some context. The story is pretty much the same as Braveheart, but with different characters. The Scottish are fighting back for their rights and their land from the English, but this time, the Scottish win. Their's no problems with the story that I noticed; there's no major plot holes and the pacing is good.The characters are good, and every actor does a good believable job. Chris Pine obviously does the best in the movie, and I'm surprised a guy like him could look so medieval. The supporting cast does a fine job, but there's so many characters that it's hard to keep track of them all.By far the best part of the movie is the warfare. I knew Netflix would do a good job with the brutality, as they always do a great job with it. This is one of those movies that some people can't stomach. The executions are insanely brutal and realistic; one of the least brutal executions in the movie is the aftermath of William Wallace's execution, with him be dismembered. The combat is dirty and bloody, as it should be. I was actually shocked at the last battle of the movie, as it is one of the most violent parts in Outlaw King.Overall, Outlaw King is a good medieval movie. It had everything a war movie needed, hateable bad guys and brutally cringey warfare. I've only seen one Netflix movie before Outlaw King, and that movie was horrible, so I was being judgmental, and now I've learned to never underestimate Netflix again.",Outlaw King
57,thebricks,"Pretty bad movie, lots of historical revisionism",1,10 November 2018,"Chris Pine just wasn't the best actor for this role. He's not someone who could ever be a king or a leader. I was bothered by the fact he wouldn't consummate the marriage the first night. I mean, this was 1307, not 2018, he would not have treated his wife like some equal. As a matter of fact, I believe someone had to witness the marriage being consummated in order for it to be legitimate. This was a great opportunity wasted to show what cultural attitudes were like back then but Netflix had to go politically correct and give the characters modern attitudes that only people in major cities have.As for the rest of the movie, history and acting, it was fine, but it seemed like Edward II had a more interesting story to be told than Robert The Bruce. Edward I actually has an amazing life story that is movie epic-worthy that to my knowledge, has yet to be told.Also, in regards to Edward II, if you know anything about Medieval Europe, there is a scene at the end of the Battle of Loudoun Hill that is so egregious and unbelievable, you will give dirty looks to the screen.

At no point do you get bogged down with need-to-know information or get confused about who characters are and how they link. A very vague knowledge of the period would be helpful, but you can still gather the jist from the beginning to carry on from.Acting was superb, and although you'd like to see a true Scot play the lead, Chris Pine does an excellent job playing Robert the Bruce.The only issue with this film is its length. At 2 hours it's not short, but there is so much more that could be included - and was included before the edit. A 4-hour film, as this originally was, can be a slog, but it would have been good to witness some deeper character development.

62,harrylosborne,Great choreography and realistic imagery marred by a cut down story,6,9 May 2019,"Netflix productions have a habit of throwing big money and big stars at a mediocre script to see what sticks, and Outlaw King doesn't seem to buck that trend. Here, the formula is Chris Pine as a Scottish rebel king, opposing the rule of the conquering English monarchy. Chris Pine brings all he can to the role, but this script doesn't offer a lot of leeway, confining the character to a fairly wooden, monotonous personality. Aaron Taylor Johnson also features (albeit in a slightly minor role), bringing some fierceness to a film starved of big performances.The production value is obvious: with every scene shot on location in Scotland, the scenery is incredible, wide panning shots of unblemished landscape. No expense was spared when creating the battle scenes either - the film stays true to intimate battles of small troop numbers, rather than defaulting to digitally creating entire armies for the sake of scale. By devoting all the attention to compact armies, the battles are made far more realistic, with some gratuitous violence being thrown in to flesh out the brutality of combat.Unfortunately, since the script doesn't do justice to the story, these fight scenes feel like devices to break up the very average scenes in between. The film opens with an excellent 10-minute single take of the bustling English camp, but from then on these scenes lose their value, detracting from the heart of the film. If the set and costume design wasn't so strong, Outlaw King would have to be classified as another Netflix misfire.",Outlaw King
63,Avwillfan89,Achieves what Braveheart (and William Wallace) failed to do.,8,26 March 2020,"Braveheart really sucks. Both as a historical film and as a thrilling film itself. It was more concerned with presenting Wallace as an insufferable Jesus figure who kept screaming Freedom instead of using clever tactics in his battles against the English.The movie starts off with Robert the Bruce and his men swearing fealty to King Edward I of England in order to bring peace to the two nations. But when English soldiers nail the dismembered arm of William Wallace on a pike in a Scottish square, the peace is broken and Robert fights the English soldiers. Furious, Edward I dispatches his army to raid and rampage any village that that was known to shelter Robert and hangs and disembowls his brother in front of his wife and child.
So Robert and his men come up with clever tactics to fight back against the English by sneaking into villages taken over by the crown's army and sacking them unannounced. As well as leading Edward's son's army into bogs filled with pikes quicksand.All I could think about while watching the film is: thank God the Scottish are not wearing kilts. Or blue paint on their faces. It's a good costume - combining both the Picts and the traditional kilt tartan - but it has no place in this period in history.Also the villains are fairly depicted. Edward being a ruthless person and ""hammer of the Scots"" and his son, inept in his eyes, desperately wanting to please his father. In Braveheart the king is nothing more than a moustache twirling Hollywood baddie and his son is portrayed as a weak homosexual unfit to rule.Here both the antagonists and the protagonists are three dimensional. Robert the Bruce kills one of his own men for defying him, and Edward the second attempts to be merciful towards Robert's wife when she is captured.The final battle is brilliantly done - mixing the right amount of CGI with practical effects.",Outlaw King

Being a huge fan of the 1995 Braveheart movie I loved the references to that film, would have been even better if they made the speared head of William Wallace look more like Mel Gibson ;-)Wonderful performance by Chris Pine and most of the other actors except Prince Edward who was really annoying.Probably very realistic depiction of battle scenes with very little glory and a lot of mud and blood.",Outlaw King

67,keelhaul-80856,"I hope Netflix continues in this vein, but this one is missing some key items for greatness.",5,21 November 2018,"I was very excited to see a historical movie about Robert the Bruce on Netflix. However, this one feels a bit amateurish and rushed, no matter how much I tried to really like it. I love brutal and intriguing period films like Braveheart, Gladiator, Spartacus, etc. So I came into this with arms wide open, but not expecting too much. Well, I pretty much got what I hypothesized it would be...The Good= This movie has some decent actors, and the cinematography is quite beautiful and epic. There are some good action sequences, and enough moments to make it watchable. I give it an 8/10 for sound, scenery, and visual action.The Bad= This movie just DOESN'T STAND OUT!!! It screams mediocrity on every level. The acting is decent, but I feel there were some poor casting choices, and it doesn't emotionally attach you to characters and feelings the way that Braveheart does. It feels very robotic in places, and I feel Chris Pine was not really the first choice for this role. He looks manly enough, but I never really believed he is ROBERT THE BRUCE. It always feels more like he is a side character in a movie about HIM!!! I felt that the movie focused more on Edward 1 and his silly son more than the Bruce. Even other supporting characters(such as his wife and other Scottish politicians and officers) seemed to steal the scenes. It felt like Pine was rushed into this at the last minute, given a sword, and told to fill in as the understudy. His final battle scenes are pretty damn good, but much of the movie felt like it lacked any depth or macho charisma from the title character.The Ugly= While movies like Braveheart stray from actual historical facts, they do NOT stray from epic film-making and things that work. I felt this movie was another sad knockoff, trying to ride the coattails of films like that, and imitate certain scenes and patriotic feelings-- but just can't deliver. There seem to be no close-up shots of key characters; every scene is filmed as if we are watching an NBA game, and we don't want to lose sight of the full court press. The film and scenery are great, but they never really pull you in close or slow down scenes for effect, or use the soundtrack to its full potential alongside poignant scenes to romanticize and captivate the audience. It is very dull, and causes a feeling of boredom and repetition, where you never really feel like anything new or deep is happening. It is like watching a high school play unfold with the same show and style for 3 acts. Also, Edward II from Braveheart was hilarious and believable in his role; this Edward II is just atrocious. From his haircut to his absurd crying and whining on the battlefield, I thought they overplayed his effeminate character in all the wrong places and wrong times. The man playing Edward 1 was a pathetic excuse for the powerhouse performance of others, like the actor in Braveheart. The other thing that pissed me off beyond belief was the use of Loudon Hill or whatever for the final battle scene!!!!! WTF??? How are you going to do a movie about Robert the Bruce, and NOT INCLUDE THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN!!?!?!??!?! Unbelievably stupid, and that is what dropped my vote from a 7 to 5. They use lesser battles to tell the story, and then fill in the ending without showing Robert's greatest success with the pikes and schiltron system at Bannockburn! By the way, the writing on the screen is so damn small, you can barely read any of it throughout the movie, without pausing and walking up to your TV screen. 2/10 for depth, originality, casting, historical accuracy, re-watch value.Final Verdict= It is always bad when I have to go to sleep in the middle of a film, and finish it the next day. Watchable, but a huge disappointment. Some epic battle scenes, but it takes more than that to make a great film about epic historical figures. A very poor man's Braveheart. I hope Netflix tries again with historical epics, but gets the story, actors, and depth right on the next attempt.",Outlaw King

While the movie was ambitious and had its moments like Braveheart, it falsified events to such an extent that I can't give it any credit.",Outlaw King
69,Come-and-Review,"Visually striking, with a conventional storyline",8,9 November 2018,"While the plot is very conventional, the visual style of the film, its pace and its battle sequences are the winning elements that once again prove that Netflix is capable of releasing relevant films.It is very unfortunate that this film had such a troubled release history, quickly completed in order to be released at Tiff, its 2h21m original cut was lukewarmly received by critics. This lead to the new 2-hours-cut by Director Mackenzie that was then released to the general public via Netflix. My review refers to this latter version of the film.I enjoyed very much 'Hell or High Water', so I had high expectations for this film. I would say that my expectations were met: although I still prefer 'Hell or High Water', there's a lot of positive aspects that make this movie a great Netflix original.Plot wise, we can pretty much say it's almost a sequel to Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart': it picks up in the near-same period and focuses on the other great Scottish hero, Robert the Bruce (featured also in the Mel Gibson film as an ambiguous character) and his struggle for indipendence.
I read somewhere that the original cut released at Tiff included William Wallace as a character, but he was cut out from the released version. There is a precise connection that occurs around the 15 minutes mark that makes 'The Outlaw King' a direct continuation of 'Braveheart'.Style-wise, the difference is huge. I personally felt 'The Outlaw King' to be much more realistic than 'Braveheart'.
To be fair, plot wise, 'The Outlaw King' is a quite conventional historical movie: its story builds up to a final battle scene, there's some romance, ecc. What makes it a great film is its dim, dirty but stunning visuals and style.I really loved the locations of this film, and the use of photography. The film starts with an 8-minutes-long single take, something astonishing to see. As for the locations, they gave a wonderful glimpse of the real Scotland (the iconic plains battle scene in 'Braveheart' was shot in Ireland).
Another thing to praise was the battle sequences (particularly the final one). Again, shot majestically and with true realism.
This film is very gory, particularly due to a very graphic execution at mid film.The magnitude of the landscapes and some of the battle scenes is why this film demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find.'The Outlaw King' is one of the best releases by Netflix so far. I can't say anything about the version released at Tiff, but for sure the general public released version had nothing wrong in terms of pacing or too much space given to battles.",Outlaw King
70,apjc,"Very good film, enjoyed it, but usual why did you do that.",8,10 November 2018,"First off I really did enjoy it, very entertaining, best I've seen lately. It is of course a romanticised re-telling of history, especially when history becomes legend. What's wrong then, well the fact this is the battle of Loudon Hill and Edward I doesn't die until a few months later. Edward II is nowhere near Scotland let alone this battle, it was fought between De Brice & De Valence. No I've not mixed up countries, though Scots and English would like it so. The Normans, Plantagenets, Angevins ruled these Isles for centuries, 100 years war had to change the name, just like house of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha had to switch to Windsor when the extended family had a major fall out. I'm being picky, just watch the film it's very good.",Outlaw King
71,HadiAriyan07,Lands of Our Fathers,8,19 March 2020,"Just a great historical epic from a great director in David Mackenzie with great lead in Chris Pine and awesome cast especially Florence Pugh Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

73,iamtherobotman,An excellent effort...,8,30 October 2019,"I must admit i wasn't expecting anything from this film, indeed, i feared a 'Braveheart MkII' with Bruce meeting Mary Stuart before joining forces with Bonnie Prince Charlie and an ultimate showdown with Henry VIII at Flodden.
Thankfully i was very wrong.This film was excellent. Sure, there were certain inaccuracies but they at very least made an effort on historical accuracy throughout. The time line was a skewed, but many of the main events of the time were covered and done so with logic.
Edward's use of 'War Wolf' and 'Greek fire' at Stirling castle for instance, although not entirely accurate to history did give the general idea of just how the sacking of Stirling could very well have happened.
The meeting with Comyn was another aspect i thought was very well done. Again the events of the film are conjecture but what better reason would Bruce have to kill Comyn than what happened in the film?
Use of the spider story was handled well also, even though the tale as told by Sir Walter Scott didn't actually happen there was the suggestion that a spider inspired Bruce to continue.
Overall the story was brilliantly told and as a Scot it's nice to see, particularly after the absolute farce which was 'Braveheart', it showed that in order to make an historical film you don't have to go full fantasy, you can actually use history to create an interesting film.
The one major let down of the film was the ending. Not only was allowing the future Edward II to walk away when he could've held him for ransom in exchange for the release of his wife and daughter but it really took liberty with history since Edward II wasn't even at Loudin Hill. Add to this that it then went on to tell us in footnotes what transpired in history ruined what could've and perhaps should've been an excellent trilogy of films with the second part taking us from the aftermath of Loudin Hill up until the outcome of Bannockburn. The third part then from his campaign in Ireland up until his death. I feel this was a massive opportunity lost to create something more than special.
Overall though, an excellent effort, well acted by all and might i say, kudos to Pine for his accent, which overall was excellent but did break from tme to time.",Outlaw King

This is definitely not as great of a film as some reviewers have indicated, nor is it nearly as bad as others reviewers would have us believe.
I consider this as a light ""period"" film where the main intent is to entertain viewers rather than to inform them.

76,ssvfolder-1,Far from Brave Heart,5,31 January 2019,"1995 was a year that introduced me to Scottish history. Mel Gibson in his prime, shot Brave Heart and despite historical inaccuracy, it was great. From characters to small details, the movie captured your imagination and you became one with the story. This one, shot about the same place in history seems like a beta version of that movie. Granted, there are some decent fight scenes, yet Pine, with all his talent is no Gibson in his prime. He seems missing from his scenes and his character's motives and behaviour are unclear and unsuited for a leader. The others are a pale version of the same characters at Brave Heart. It's not a good movie and felt like I was wasting time watching it. Gave 5/10 because of the setting.P.S. Pine was great in Star Trek, so he will redeem himself regardless of this one.",Outlaw King

I didn't mind the longer running time, that's a benefit of Netflix IMO is that Directors can give us their 'unedited cut' right out of the gate and if people don't like it, they can just fast forward. The plot wasn't quite as engaging as Braveheart and Pine's Robert the Bruce is fairly subdued compared to Gibson's William Wallace. Perhaps that's historically accurate and intended, but it's not as much fun. I love this type of action period piece and I'm glad this film was made with big budget and capable actors. It just left me comparing to (and favoring) Braveheart.",Outlaw King

79,mochteam,Wasn't good Wasn't Bad it Just Was.,5,28 December 2019,"There's some review below where some obnoxious person is ranting about the 10second film shot with some ""black people"" in the background and how dare they put ""black people"" in a film. Well my prejudice friend I want you to know that like many other countries Scotland also traded with other countries and allowed merchants on their harbors. Slavery and all the other things that make people so wonderfully full of hatred and bitterness today didn't exists yet. It was just open trade and the best items came from distant lands.Outlaw King like most of these sword and shield, king and castle movies all suffer from being too much of the same. The clear bad guy and the clear good guy. When history is really kind of grey. Last movie I watched it was the English that were glorified this movie I watch it's the Scottish that are glorified. If it weren't for the accents though I would get a lot of these movies confused.Outlaw King starts off with what I feel was the wrong actor for the role role of King. Nothing against the actor that played the King of Scotts but compared to every other actor he just looked like a visitor and not a native to their land so that threw you off quite a bit.There's also the story that can't seem to find a good speed in which to tell itself. It rushes in one part and then moves slowly in another. There's also some things about the story which seemed silly and I'm not sure if it actually happened or if it's just writers but the King does really foolish things that get him ambushed quite a few times. I'm not sure why you would let your guard down with your enemies right a stones throw away from you. I almost wanted to turn the movie off because of the stupidity.The pacing again though makes the story not so enjoyable as you don't get much time to familiarize yourself with the characters you should be getting to know. There's also too much time spent on the King's Wife and his Daughter and I say that because their scenes don't add anything to the substance of the movie. They would of been better as background characters we hardly saw because they served no purpose other than to fill in the lack of the primary story with unneeded love scenes and dialogue.Well I guess that's all I should say about this flick it's a film you watch when you've seen just about everything else in this category so why not.",Outlaw King
80,manuel_medeiros,Great cinematography but ultimately does not bring anything new to the genre,7,18 November 2018,"Netflix's Outlaw King is a cinema-worthy movie clearly, an epic war/drama film and unofficially a sequel to Mel Gibson's Braveheart as it is staged shortly after William Wallace's downfall.The cinematography is very good in Outlaw King and you can really see they spared no expenses in accurately recreating the period, the scenarios, settings and characterization.In my view, it fails however in two aspectsit feels rushed (allegedly the first take of this movie had 4 hours). The relationship that Robert (main character, played Chris Pine) develops with his arranged wife seems forced because her level of loyalty implies a much greater length of quality time spent together. The same goes for the sequencing of events - seems to follow too fast.ultimately, although the quality is undeniable, it does not add to the genre. It is a classical David vs. Goliath story which brings all the characteristics you tend to see in those movies - the antogonist ruler of a extense realm, the use of unfair methods against a much more ethical hero, etc.SO - it is worth watching (potentially in a bigger TV if you can) but I dont think it is cutting edge. It does add a new genre to Netflix's original movie portfolio, so that is a plus in itself.7/10",Outlaw King

Given that, it's very fast paced with no real slow burn backstory, which I personally enjoy. I may watch it again now so I can pick up all the details. I'm sure many scenes were cut to make it 2 hours. 2 hours that were definitely worth it.The lead actress Florence Pugh is very talented and Chris pine is also a great lead. Without those 2 it wouldn't have been so good. It is violent but only in spots to convey emotion. Overall it's entertaining, well filmed with some killer battle scenes and by the end it's stitched together nicely.

86,Dannyboi94,"Great film, but should have been a 6 episode mini series",8,9 November 2018,"Outlaw King is one of the most visually breathtaking films of 2018, the cinematography, the set pieces, costume designs, are absolutely perfect. The story, based of a true event, is very engaging, and the film does a great job at making you route for Robert Bruce. However, the film feels like it should have been longer, which makes me believe that it should have been a mini series instead. The period in which this film takes place, was a major event in Scottish history, and they crammed it all within a 2 hour movie. Some of it works, and some of it doesn't.The actors are all fantastic, Chris Pine was great as the Bruce, although I would have preferred Gerard Butler in the role, Pine gave a very convincing performance. Most of the other characters are very bland, and you don't get much time to spend with them, as they just stand in the background and do some cool stuff. Aaron Taylor Johnson however was the highlight of the film, and I wish we got to see more of him. He was insanely entertaining here, as a savage lunatic eager to avenge his family.Some reviews I have read have pointed out that the English are portrayed in a very negative manner, which is true. They are made to be evil in this film, burning castles, and slaughtering innocent people, but this film is as historically accurate as possible, and these events most likely took place. But like I said before, everything is crammed together quickly, if they had made a mini series they could have showed more of the story.The action scenes are brilliant in the Outlaw King, and you can tell that most of it was inspired by Braveheart, from the gore, to the realism. However I feel the movie put style over story and characters. I would watch it just for its visuals alone.The Outlaw King will disappoint fans wanting a new Braveheart, but history buffs, or hardcore movie goers will love this film for what it is, a good piece of entertaining visuals and action.7.7/10",Outlaw King
87,tmpsvita,Very realistic and accurated but it miss some emotions,7,21 November 2020,"It's pretty obvious that with ""Outlaw King"" they wanted to be as realistic as possible and, watching it with this point of view, it works perfectly: the costumes are very accurated, the scenographies are very well designed and, most importantly, the battles are ruogh, cruel, vivid, the struggle, the pain, the swords' and armors' heaviness are deeply perceptible thanks to beautifully managed stunts, a functional make up and a direction that managed to be clear and dinamic at the same time.

However, the ending of the movie is a bit of a let-down as we don't get to see the Outlaw King's obnoxious little girl.I've never understood why people go all 'gooey eyed & gah-gah' over a dying mans death wish. Once dead you can please yourself, they're never gonna know - unless you believe in an 'afterlife' - which is exactly what the Prince Of Wales & heir to the English throne does. He has the right attitude for war and leaves no stone unturned, not even to grant or honour his father's dying wish and buries the now dead king, of England in Scotland. Whilst the Prince may have right attitude for war, he is less equipped 'upstairs' & cares more for his ensuing battle against the Outlaw King of Scotland.You know the saying about 'safety in numbers' - the prince therefore relied on the laurels of having a bigger & better army that outnumbers the Scots. Therefore the prince didn't really have a battle plan as such, neither did he have the sense to seek out or hatch a plan.What I like about this period in history is that the Kings & Queens of old, did themselves participate in whatever battles or wars that ensued. They didn't just send out their entourage of soldiers or village people. Can you imagine Queen Elizabeth 2 in her younger days with whatever weaponry was used to fight 'The Falklands War' or whatever war you can think of?",Outlaw King

Calling him an outlaw paints him closer to Robin Hood rather than the ruthless bastard he obviously was.History (and this movie) then glosses over the fact that he broke the treaty with the English and then brings Scotland and England to war once more.Outlaw King is amazing as a Netflix movie. The large sets, the polished cast and huge battle at the end matches just about anything similar from Hollywood.

Though the film comes across as authentic and makes a genuine effort to get the history right, it lacks some essential ingredients to break into the top tier.As the film opens, the defeated Scottish lords are vowing fealty to King Edward I of England (Stephen Dillane), including Robert Bruce (Chris Pine), Lord John III Comyn (Callan Mulvey), and Aymer de Valence (Sam Spruell). Robert has history with King Edward I's son, Edward, Prince of Wales (Billy Howle), a weaker man who just wants his father's approval. As a parting gift, King Edward I sends his goddaughter, Elizabeth de Burgh (Florence Pugh), to become Robert's wife.Things get complicated when Robert's father dies, and Robert is left competing with Lord Comyn for the Scottish throne. When Robert learns King Edward I executed William Wallace, he senses an opportunity to renew the rebellion. Lord Comyn wants to remain loyal to England, so Robert brutally murders him in a church and then gathers an army. Unfortunately, Aymer de Valence has also remained loyal to England, ambushes Robert's army in a forest, and destroys it.Robert and a few companions are forced to flee. He sends his wife and daughter into hiding, where Edward, Prince of Wales captures them and brutally murders Robert's brother. Robert decides to fight a guerilla war, culminating in the Battle of Loudoun Hill, where Robert uses the boggy terrain and clever tactics to his advantage. He defeats the English army and humiliates the Prince of Wales, who is revealed to be a miserable coward. Robert and Elizabeth are reunited and live happily ever after.Robert the Bruce (1274-1329) was king of Scotland from 1306 to 1329. In the 1290s, King Edward I of England took advantage of a power vacuum in Scotland to claim the throne. Sir William Wallace led a rebellion until his defeat and eventual capture in 1305. Edward I had Wallace hanged, drawn, and quartered. Robert the Bruce (Earl of Carrick) and John Comyn (Lord of Badenoch) were appointed joint Guardians of Scotland after Wallace's death, but Robert murdered Comyn and claimed the Scottish throne for himself. He led a second rebellion against England, this one ultimately successful.Despite a few flaws, critics have raved about this film's historical accuracy, at least in comparison to its predecessors. The weapons, clothes and uniforms, traditions, and events depicted are as authentic as can be expected, from ""raising the dragon"" to being married under a sheet, to Elizabeth being hung in a cage and Robert the Bruce murdering his rival in a church (although a companion actually finished him off).But as a successor to Mel Gibson's Braveheart (1995), the epic retelling of William Wallace's rebellion, Outlaw King falls flat. Braveheart was notoriously inaccurate, but it was a great movie with great characters we wanted to succeed. In contrast, Outlaw King is mostly accurate but I couldn't care less about the characters. Robert the Bruce is dull and unconvincing. The filmmakers attempted to give his wife, Elizabeth, some agency but she mostly just hangs around like a set piece.Contrast William Wallace's speech before the Battle of Stirling Bridge in Braveheart with Robert's final speech in Outlaw King. Wallace's motivation is clear. He wants freedom for the Scottish people (and revenge against England). You want to jump up, grab an anachronistic claymore sword and fight with him. In Outlaw King, Robert literally says, ""I don't care what you fight for, as long as you fight."" Um, ok? Wallace had a cause that was larger than himself. Robert the Bruce just wanted to be king because... he deserves it, I guess?Outlaw King premiered on Netflix to generally positive reviews. It currently has a critic rating of 61 percent and audience favorability rating of 71 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences were thrilled by the gritty realism and battles, but the film lacked that certain quality that makes for great drama. We want to feel something as well as be awed by spectacle.",Outlaw King
100,nancy-793-228879,Loved it!,8,11 November 2018,"Historically better than braveheart. Let's face it it wouldn't be hard. Really enjoyed it and loved seeing bits of Scotland I recognised. ""See that hill over there, that's Loudoun Hill. I'll fight you there tomorrow"" fantastic! I live a mile from Loudoun hill and not too far away is Turnberry. I wonder if we can banish someone else from Turnberry golf course there, perhaps a certain American president! I'd be up for that :0)",Outlaw King
101,robertasmith,Plays fast and loose with history,5,9 November 2018,"For me the pace was too slow and there was not enough character development. The Bruce would have been a charismatic leader and Chris Pine failed to convince me he could lead a bunch of cheerleaders let alone a nation. This was far too black and white and the complexities of the true story were lost. It just seemed to say England bad, Scotland good. Whilst a great deal more accurate than Braveheart it lacks rhythm in the telling of the story and with one or two honourable exceptions was poorly acted. Florence Pugh is, without a doubt, completely overrated at the moment and must have friends in high places to get the leading roles she is currently landing. James Cosmo as the father of the Bruce brings a bit of class to the early part of the film but class is severely lacking for the most part.
I was very disappointed with this film having really looked forward to it.",Outlaw King
102,livinglifing,Scotts take another beating...soid this film,1,10 November 2018,"Another film about the Scotts fighting their best but not good enough,,,yet again. Nothing about this Netflix offering stands out and is your basic made for tv piece with the same old storyline with terrible fighting sequences. Enough already...",Outlaw King
103,eismoc,Super Exaggerated,4,11 November 2018,"It could've been a very nice movie if the main role wasn't pictured as a super hero, super kind, super wise and super strong, not to mention of course, super sexy. Adding this to the over exaggerated dramatic dialogues inside the story makes it perfect for a stage play, not for a movie. It is an overdo continuation to ""Brave Heart (1995)"", and could've been much better if the story had much less drama, more history and more moderation of the line of main role.Brave Heart was a very successful movie, IMO because the main role was perfectly written and played as it gave an impression that any ordinary person can actually be a national hero and make a huge difference in other people's lives. This impression is not found in Outlaw King at all. It has too much yeast that radically affects the taste.Anyways it is entertaining movie but in many times I was annoyed bu the far-from-reality and unnecessary details. Most probably I will never watch it again. 6/10 is fair.",Outlaw King

105,SpacemanBob,Excellent until the end,6,3 March 2020,"Very good most of the way. My biggest issue was the ending. They took plenty of time to establish the story and characters, only to wrap it all up rather abruptly. For once I would have preferred a longer film. Still worth watching, fine acting, some great fighting and war scenes. The cinematography was impressive.",Outlaw King
106,amirmustafaa,A Brutal and Well Made Film but Lacking in Scale,7,18 November 2018,"I thought this was a very well made movie and a great follow up to Hell or High Water for David Mackenzie. Outlaw King had some brutal and thrilling scenes, great cinematography and locations, and some good performances. Chris Pine is good in this movie, but the standout is Aaron Taylor Johnson who gives a crazy and enjoyable performance.With that being said, I wish this movie was longer. This movie is definitely missing an ""epic"" feel to it. It just felt a little too small in scale for the story it was trying to tell, and I think this movie would've been a lot better if it spent more time exploring the main characters and building to the brutal final battle. Its a well made film, but this story definitely didn't deserve to fit into such a small running time.",Outlaw King

108,baroncoco,"LOOKS GREAT, IS PLAGIARISM.",5,10 November 2018,"Braveheart meets Game of Thrones: that would've been the pitch, and that's what they got.
Stephen Dillane is the sole standout as Edward I, but that king is still written as far worse than he was.
But you're not getting history, whatever they say, so why quibble on that.
And who the hell dubbed Pine's voice?

109,walshj-01468,Very entertaining movie,9,17 November 2018,"I studied medieval history at college and even I can't recall the finer detail , so whether this is 100% historically accurate I can't say and I'm fairly certain the poor reviews on here aren't experts either. So, let's review this as a piece of movie entertainment rather than a historical documentary. On that level it is an engaging movie and most people who like this genre will simply enjoy it. Great 2 hours of entertainment with fantastic cinematography and location detail.",Outlaw King
110,ztigr,All Pine nothing else,5,10 November 2018,"Really another disappointing Netflix offering, no character development, rushed dialogue, and some nice scenery. Netflix really needs to invest in some better writing and less in pageantry. Other than Robert the Bruce and his wife, you got to know exactly no one in the story. Even there relationship seemed forced because of the short amount of screen time they shared. This movie assumes you know the backstory and the events leading up to it, and then gives you a few sentences onscreen about what happens next.",Outlaw King
111,xpunisherx,Glad I gave it a chance,7,25 October 2021,"Great movie overall but leaves you wanting to find a better medieval movie to watch. To which you will realize there aren't many. The romance, while not at all a big part of the film, is one of the best parts. The main characters are all great and it has plenty of action but not many battles. Does a great job of making you feel hopelessness.",Outlaw King
112,BillSims28,Often intense and enjoyable but unfocused and inconsistent,6,17 February 2019,"A stealth sequel to 'Braveheart' was perhaps not high on the list of priorities in 2018, but the story of Robert the Bruce appeared anyway. Set before and after the death of William Wallace, and focusing on Scotland's renewed fight for independence from England's various King Edwards, it is a decently enjoyable and sometimes surprisingly intense historical film but one which has little new to offer.The revival of interest in medieval media buoyed by 'Game of Thrones' is clearly the main influence for this feature. The film boasts GoT acting alumni such as Stephen Dillane, James Cosmo, and Clive Russell, and has clearly looked to the HBO giant for inspiration in creating a violent epic. The battle scenes in particular are rooted in the style perfected by director Miguel Sapochnik in series 6 of the TV series, which feature huge numbers of extras, gore aplenty, relentless noise, and a feeling of realism unmatched by other medieval pieces. The early ambush by the English at Methven and the climactic battle at Loudoun Hill are highlights, featuring some truly astounding battle set pieces.In terms of the cast, Chris Pine is a reliable lead that director David Mackenzie has previously utilised (2016's 'Hell or High Water'), but Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the standout amongst an average cast, injecting deuteragonist the Black Douglas with impassioned bloodthirsty mania. There's clearly a good deal of passion from the majority of the cast and crew, evidenced by a jaw-dropping opening salvo. This is a remarkable tracking shot in the English camp at Stirling Castle, wherein the camera seamlessly roams in and out of the command tent introducing all the main characters whilst detailing the initial Scottish surrender.The film never really gets better than its excellent opening 10 minutes however. It rumbles along lacking momentum for the most part, before bursting into life at times of battle. The characters are wildly inconsistent, even disregarding their dissimilarity to their real historical counterparts, and are mostly underdeveloped. The personality of the titular Robert, for example, veers between guerrilla expert people's hero and at other times a morally shady power-hunter that more closely reflects the man who actually existed.Furthermore, Billy Howle as Edward, Prince of Wales makes for a disappointing and inconsistently characterised antagonist. The filmmakers cannot quite seem to decide whether they want to make him a megalomaniacal, unpredictable sadist, or a reluctant prince trying to step out of the shadow of his domineering, disappointed father. The end result is an off-putting and unsatisfying blend of pathos and revulsion far from the complicated villain who I'm sure was envisioned.All in all, 'Outlaw King' is a watchable and often properly entertaining historical action drama which features some impressive battle production values. Much like the villainous Edward, Prince of Wales, however, it is ultimately unable to escape the shadow of vastly superior contemporaries. 63/100.",Outlaw King
113,fxdx4,Your historical sequel to Braveheart,8,23 November 2018,"Although not an actual sequel to Braveheart, historically it happens right after that film's version of history, and many of the characters in Braveheart appear here as well; forcing invariably comparisons. Where the original Braveheart set the Guinness world record for the number of times a person could say 'freedom' in a scene, Outlaw King is much less over the top and restrained.Robert Bruce (Chris Pine) is forced into a truce with England, and when his father dies, he must decide if he is going to betray his honour and rebel against England, or suffer under English rule. This film does a good job of exploring the character of Robert Bruce, and Pine does a solid job of showing us the moral struggles he faces. ""Freedom"" has a cost and he is aware of the price Scotland will pay.Other than Bruce, the other characters are somewhat forgettable - with none as charismatic or memorable as those in Braveheart. Rebecca Robin is very good as Bruce's wife Margaret, but her role is not expanded on enough. Other characters come and go with little fan fare. Even the chief antagonist's character is inconsistent and left mostly unexplored - a real missed opportunity.The action is of a good quality, but not spectacular. With the final battle scene holding its own against some of the better battle scenes filmed, but missing some of the drama of the opening battle of Gladiator, or the final battle in Henry V.Although there are some inaccuracies historically, it is much more of a 'real' film than Braveheart which comes across as silly and over the top. The choices characters are forced to make and the consequences of those choices are not lost on this film, and I respect the director for often exploring character over action and plot. Braveheart may be more mindlessly entertaining, but this is the better film.I enjoyed the film even though it did leave me wanting a bit more from the supporting cast and some expanded roles for his wife and the main villain.8/10",Outlaw King
114,jon-22643,"Good movie, reliable scenes",8,10 November 2018,"This movie will take you back to around year 1300, and the reconstruction is simple great, from the armory to the swords, castles, outfits, and the atmosphere of the time. It tries to be as authentic as possible, and I was really drifted into the plot and story. It's not a big budget but they made the best with the budget they had. The last fight scene is a master-peace of knights battle movies. This is not Braveheart with Mel Gibson, but some scenes reminds it a bit, including superb acting of all crew. You will enjoy this one.",Outlaw King

118,yoyopa,Forgettable,1,25 November 2018,"This is one of the few films I've seen that I thought both dragged and was simultaneously rushed. Character and relationship development was almost completely skipped over. Robert Bruce and his wife are a prime example-- they meet, its kinda awkward, they fall in love-- they fall in love to the point that she's willing to be tortured and die horribly for him. Sounds great... but we never see that process... how she goes from barely knowing this guy to willingly sacrificing her life for him if need be.Now I heard this film screened at TIFF and the general consensus was that it ran too long. I also heard that the director, instead of sticking to his original vision, took those opinions to heart, went back and did some chopping and cutting. It shows. Not in a good way. Being that this is a Netflix film, I'm surprised he caved to pressure instead of taking a risk.The film as a whole is weak. It feels hollow and empty throughout... like it's desperately trying to imitate much better films and television shows(BRAVEHEART AND GAME OF THRONES)Speaking of Game of Thrones, Stephen Dillane who played Stannis Baratheon is BY FAR the best part of this film and of course he's criminally underused. It's shocking to me that no one has thought to make a film about Edward I... he is a far more interesting study than both Robert Bruce or William Wallace.My point is that, of the three historical figures... none of them were heroes... none of them were villains. They all had agendas. So it's kind of lame and tired to prop Wallace and Bruce up as heroes.Chris Pine is a decent actor but here I'm sorry... at best he was boring, at worst he was utterly forgettable... but then again so was the entire film. Same goes for the rest of the cast.I'd skip it unless you need help falling asleep.",Outlaw King
119,yoyopa,Outlaw Mediocrity.,1,6 January 2019,"An incredibly boring rehash of much better attempts(Braveheart, Game of Thrones) I heard the crowd at TIFF were bored to tears which drove the director to cut a significant amount of time off the film... he shouldve kept cutting. I couldn't even finish it... Stephen Dillane... arguably the strongest and most positive aspect of this film, ends up dying about half way - maybe less than halfway through the film and that's where I checked out.Everything in this film is either a rip off of something better or painfully uninteresting. Netflix saved this one from a box office bomb. Florence pugh and Chris Pine have zero chemistry and their love and loyalty are completely unbelievable and rushed. Just skip it.",Outlaw King
120,heydiddlediddle007,Loved It!!!,8,11 November 2018,Fantastic movie! Like other reviews it might have started a little slow but well done!

121,BestBenedikt,"Great battle scenes, mediocre storytelling",6,11 November 2018,"The overall visual direction of OUTLAW KING by David Mackenzie and the battle scenes in particular are great. The whole film has a very rough and historically accurate look (no kilts this time!). If it was just for the visuals, this would be an instant classic in its genre.Unfortunately, the storytelling here doesn't work as well. The movie starts out strong with an impressive one-take, but begins to fall flat shortly after. Scenes just add up without developing a good flow, hence the movie feels quite rushed in some parts and drags in others. Besides, the whole script with its simplistic ""good vs. evil"" doctrine felt a little heavy-handed to me.It also leaves little room for characterization - especially Robert Bruce's motivations and his personality seem quite shallow and are never thoroughly explored. The only performance that really stickes out, is the one given by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who portrayes the ""Black Douglas"" very characteristically.I would still recommend seeing OUTLAW KING, even if only for the battle scenes and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. But don't expect the emotional weight of BRAVEHEART, which is definitely the superior film in that manner.",Outlaw King

This turned out to be a great film! It is about as historically accurate as any historical film gets, and watching the rise of Robert The Bruce really is fascinating. Chris Pine played Robert The Bruce very well and the cinematography truly makes you feel transported to the 14th century. My only gripe with the film is that it would have been even better as a mini series!",Outlaw King
125,vandrist,What you've come to expect from movies now.,7,9 November 2018,"The story of this movie is great, they sacrifice historical accuracy instead of changing it to a Hollywood movie. I love history movies and this one was pretty interesting, but in terms of execution, this movie falls a little short. It's still a pretty decent period piece and I was still entertained for the most of this movie, but i still ending it with a bad taste it my mouth. Chris pine is the silver lining of this movie, but if you like this movie, then your should watch The Last Kingdom, which is a show on Netflix about Vikings and the English that's better than this movie.

127,yasiru1991,80% Boring 20% Interesting,5,25 November 2018,"Film would have been 100% boring if not for the final battle sequel and strategic planning for the battle. Entire plot before the last act consists of slow moving and very lazy type action sequels and the plot was little far too obvious for the viewer.Battle sequences and Planning of revenge on English staring from an army of 40 would have been far more strategically superior. But none of that was highlighted in the movie and it was just jumping from one castle to another with a cheap act of battle. The locations of the castle, their importance to the final goal and the methods of conquering them etc should be there to let know the audience that he is going in the right direction to target and win the final battle with English. But audience was just suddenly put on to a grand final battle against Englishmen suddenly without no background preparation for such an act. So audience never felt the depth and gravity of the final battle even the action sequels was good.I am from Asia hence i would not comment on costumes.Acting is below average as well. Romance between Elizabeth and Robert is pretty ordinary. The spark of love was missing between the duo.So the audience never get the feel of their intimate bonding.Douglas guy was over acting and we can see clearly that he is in a film and acting which i presume to be a failure. Every thing in Harry Potter or GOT is fake but viewers doesnot feel that they are watching a movie or else a Fantasy. It is because the actors, special effect guys was pretty perfect in their respective job roles. Special effects was also sub par in the movie. Audience feel that they are watching an ancient story from their theater seat. Audience never lived inside the story.",Outlaw King
128,sarahelizabethparker,"7 stars for acting, cinematography, and set design",7,8 August 2019,"Ok, so Chris Pine really made this movie what it was. He is a Grade A actor in my book now. Phenomenal job. Also, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was unrecognizable in his role.The cinematography was beautiful. You can tell it was filmed on location in Scotland. I was in awe while watching this and now I'm dying to travel there someday.The set design and special effects were so realistic it was immersive. Reminded me a lot of the TV show Vikings in its production quality, particular in its sets and battle sequences.Why this movie isn't 10 stars is based solely on script. It was a bit boring and slow in some places and it didn't do a great job of introducing any of the side characters or making me feel anything towards them. I can tell a lot of this movie was left on the editing room floor. It does a good job of showing a glimpse of Robert's rebellion, but doesn't do a good enough job showing the full context. Chris Pine did most of the heavy lifting in terms of building Robert's character, when normally the script should also pitch in. I really wish I could see the full director's cut. I heard it was at almost 4 hours.All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Chris Pine, British history, or medieval times.",Outlaw King
129,davish_wulf-1,Finally an epic worth of the name,9,10 November 2018,"It's been over a decade since the last epic-worth movie was made. The genre is lacking good movies since the Marvel and tireless CGI overloaded movies made their advance.
What a pleasant surprise from Netflix. Great acting and casting in such beautiful landscapes glorious Scottish weather.
The movie is a feast for the eyes, the pace is just right, giving time to know the characters and plot.
This is the best effort since Braveheart hit the cinemas in early 90s, to reproduce Scotland's medieval times.
Chris Pine had a strong presence along the way, needed for the Bruce parte and James Cosmo made again an appearance, in a already long list of period dramas/epic movies.
Aaron Taylor-Johnson had such a fine role, his action scenes were among the best and Tony Curran once again feeling at home.
Actions scenes were top notch, the final battle sequence is nothing short of awesome and all in all a movie already on its way to be a classic alongside Braveheart, Rob Roy and the first Highlander.
If this is the kind of quality Netflix is bringing to the table, bring on more epic movies, perhaps there's a good chance for a Witcher movie to be successfully made under their name.

133,ajrg-17-381639,Braveheart II light,3,15 November 2018,"This was a terrible movie. No one was complex. There was no emotion. They depended on good vs evil and that was too bad. There was plenty of room for complexity in this story. First Robert the Bruce was very ambitious, ruthless but successful. He was excommunicated by the church after spending two years as the right hand man of Edward for killing his rival in a church. This was not an accident. He had nothing to lose when he took the chance and saved Scotland. That would have made a more interesting character, strong, ruthless ultimately a victor and than the milky toast here.His enemy was gay, a great fighter and a terrible ruler killed by his own nobles in a plot his wife might have been behind. That would have made a complex character.His second wife was caught between her husband and father and she was married without her opinion at a young age.

136,zanghi_james,I think this is much better than Braveheart,8,13 June 2020,"Just watched this historical epic with my parents and I really enjoyed it.I was extremely skeptical of the casting of Chris Pine as Robert the Bruce, especially after watching his light-hearted smooth operator performance as Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise. However, I can confidently say that Mister Pine does a good job playing the Bruce as a serious dramatic character. I also liked him more than Angus MacFayden portraying the Bruce in Braveheart, or at least, what I remember the portrayal was like. (Still might check out his recent sequel to Braveheart, though.)Florence Pugh, who is an actor I think is doing a great job with other performances, despite having only a handful of scenes altogether gives a fine performance and she does have some great chemistry with both Pine and the young girl who plays the Bruce's daughter. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Tony Curran shine in their more wilder and rougher performances, while Stephen Dillane is far more menacing and intimidating as Edward Longshanks than Patrick McGoohan was in Braveheart. James Cosmo (who was in Braveheart as a different character, I think) is mostly underused as Robert Bruce the Elder, as well as fellow Game of Thrones alum Roy Donachie. The guy who plays the main villain the Prince of Wales, whose name has completely slipped out of my brain, does a good job and his story-arc resolution is quite satisfying. He kind of reminds me of some of the villains on Game of Thrones, appropriately, mainly resembling a combination of Joffrey Baratheon and Ramsey Bolton.The action scenes were above than a standard medieval epic and definitely had a level of realism matched by their savagery and viciousness and gore. The final battle was quite satisfying and invoked imagery of the Winterfell battle in Season Six of Game of Thrones as well as the big final battle in The Last Samurai. However, in comparison to various films by Ridley Scott like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven, the action is surprisingly tame. There are some good gory scenes, though, most notably the scene at Castle Fraser.Visually, this movie is excellent. I think it was shot on location in Scotland and England, which definitely gives the movie an authentic feel. I really enjoyed all the camerawork, also. The opening tracking shot alone is exceptionally well done, just as great as the opening shot to Spectre. Especially if it was done as a single shot and not spliced together, like the opening to Spectre.The only real lament about this film I have is that there are supposedly twenty minutes of footage that the director, David Mackenzie, took out. Reportedly it includes two impressive sounding action sequences and some other stuff involving William Wallace. Since this is a Netflix Original film, I doubt it is going to be distributed physically on DVD or Blu-Ray which means that we won't see an Expanded Cut or a Director's Cut. The movie is still extremely enjoyable nevertheless.May the Force be with You!",Outlaw King
137,World-viewer,Forgettable,1,8 January 2021,"Unwatchable movie. Boring as hell. Utterly forgettable. So forgettable that I can't even summarize the plot coherently. The only thing I remember about this movie is the expression on Chris Pine's face, because he wears it throughout - no change ever - he manages to wear that EXACT same dazed, faraway, partially confused, serious look that one puts on when one attends a meeting at work but has totally forgotten about his deliverable, and desperately hopes that the boss won't call on him. Except the Outlaw King's thought bubble seems to be reading.. ""What the *bleep* am I doing here in a fancy bathrobe? Shouldn't I be plotting a course through the stars in a fancy spaceship instead? How long must I endure this agony?"". In other words, the exact same thoughts we, as viewers, are thinking as we watch this atrocity. No thanks. Better fare awaits.",Outlaw King
138,Sumpmonster,Amazing,10,10 November 2018,"I hate films like this where the story is so overpowering that it drives emotions at every level. Chris Pine is excellent in the lead, but he is more than ably backed up by some outstanding performances from Billy Howle, Florence Pugh and Tony Curran. Brilliant locations act as a backdrop to some intense scenes ensuring that the audience is left in no doubt of the brutality of the invading forces.
Bruce himself is a piece of work, knifing his confederate to death in a place of sanctuary, but it pales into insignificance as to what befalls his family and loyal supporters.
The battle scenes are superbly gritty and the guerrilla warfare deployed by Bruce has stunning results. I guess this is probably more historically accurate than others in the genre, but it captures the mood and intensity perfectly. Best movie of 2018.",Outlaw King
139,jpolywog-52354,Dreadful,2,12 November 2018,I am sure that the Scottish Tourist Board will appreciate the glorious scenery depicted in this picture show. I am disinclined to use the term movie lest I create a false impression of entertainment. Firstly the movie is so historically incorrect as to render the story obsolete. As a Scot and student of Scottish history I was embarrassed watching this. I give credit to Mr Pine for at least attempting to capture the Scottish accent but apart from that his acting and those of his co-stars in attempting to accurately interpret events was woeful. What we had here was clearly an assembly of out-of-work Scottish actors getting the opportunity to dress up and roam about the countryside. In my opinion a complete waste of time. All I can say is 'Beam me up Scotty'...,Outlaw King

141,alihandemiral,"If only it was not made by Netflix, we could call it "" the new Braveheart"".",8,17 December 2018,"Netflix has its good sides. It enables an extra platform for countless producers, writers and directors to give life to projects that would have never been made otherwise. But it also has some very bad sides.
Netflix allows in its platform thousands of shows and films continuously. Their business model reminds one of a factory; pushing countless content with the aim of becoming an enormous empire, a monopoly. Therefore, their products sometimes lack the artistic value that they could have if they were made by the classic Hollywood companies that we know of.We can see the example of this in ""Outlaw King."" It is a giant production.
Great cinematography, decent acting, stellar ensemble... Yet, sadly; lots of plotholes - that I begin to see a lot in Netflix productions. Their way of ""chain production"" takes away from the art a bit each time. Outlaw King is pretty good. But it has the potential to be great in it, something is missing. That something may very well be ""an eye that watches out for artistic values in the production"".Netflix fails to make complete use of David MacKenzie's and the stellar cast's potentialin greatness.",Outlaw King
142,targa9,Couldn't get into it,2,29 June 2020,"I usually like medieval sagas. This film essentially starts off where Braveheart ended. But unlike that much superior film, this film lacks all spark and personality.
It starts out in a very muddy field with tents, with the various princes and kings of Scotland and Wales bowing down to the English king (Edward I, apparently). However, Edward's son was, in reality, an effeminate homosexual, but here he's portrayed as a young bull. So that was a glaring error.Secondly, much ado is made about the new wife for Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine).
She's very pretty, but Bruce treats her very gently, as if she would be disgusted to be with him, and has to ""endure"" the wedding party. What? This is not realistic. Bruce (as played by Pine) is certainly handsome enough to have confidence with women, and if gifted such a bride, would act very confidently with her, and she in turn would probably be greatly relieved that he was young, handsome and treated her decently. Instead, he acts as if he's still courting her. Silly. Worse, when he has to make a decision to go to WAR, and asks her to leave the room, she acts indignant as if she has a right to know battle plans and stuff. She overhears anyway, and then confirms with him that she ""chooses"" Bruce, even though she came from Ireland. Well, that's nice. What sort of progressive claptrap is this?Thirdly, there's a scene where Bruce goes to pay taxes, and at a border Scottish town, the Brits bring a dismembered part of Wallace's carcass and hangs it for display. The people go nuts, and who, again, looks scared and indecisive?
Robert the Bruce. THIS is the guy who's going to lead Scotland against England? So he immediately goes back, and for this ONE incident alone, decides to break his sworn oath and wage war on England. What? Wallace was already in hiding or considered dead. The fact the English caught him and dismembered him as a warning might be depressing, but not a cause for war.Fourthly, Bruce asks a powerful Scottish baron, John Comyn, to join his silly war. Even sillier, Comyn refuses, but THEN tells Bruce he will snitch on him, get him hanged, and Comyn will be crowned king. At this, Bruce (of course) stabs him. What's wrong with this is if Comyn was at such enmity with Bruce, why did he meet him alone, with no guards, and then reveal he will tell Edward of Bruce's treachery? Would he not know Bruce might kill him? Not very wise behavior. Comyn's face looked war-scarred, so would he be so incredibly stupid and leave his guard down like that, knowing Bruce had nothing to lose?Fifthly, Bruce declares war on England and meets the king's rep, Aymer de Valence, who agrees to Bruce's foolish suggestion of settling the war with a swordmatch with Valence. Not only is this ignorant of England's apparent ""dragon banner policy"" (which Bruce should be familiar with) which allows Valence to arrange a sneak attack at night against Bruce while his camp is drunk and merry-making, but to imagine for one second that such a thing as ""Scottish independence"" will be decided, and agreed to by Longshanks, over a duel with one of his subordinates, is ludicrous. So Bruce's foolishness cost him many men that night.Finally, I lost interest when Bruce's men, already decimated, were rowing boats in some lake and were attacked by some OTHER Scottish band. In the midst of them being slaughtered (again) I shut it off. I mean, film makers sometimes don't understand how to make a character believable as a leader. Chris Pine's expression the entire time is quiet, serious concern. That doesn't get people to follow you! Plus, before he could even kill any English, his entire army is practically wiped out. So how are they even going to put up a fight? And unlike Braveheart, which very clearly showed the despicable depredations of the English against the Scottish, this film starts out with a PEACE AGREEMENT between the Scottish and Irish nobles and Edward I, so we are not even given a real motive why the Scots want independence so badly, and why they would fight so dearly for it. We are shown a ""Douglas"" whose father's lands were stolen from him, and that's about it. But with Bruce, it seems the entire motive was to avenge Wallace or something. It's just not credible. I felt the movie was pretty boring, and it didn't invest itself with any real character or personality or motives--we are just supposed to go along for the ride because, well, Braveheart.",Outlaw King

Apart from a bit of shouting when his soldiers collected taxes, or inducted men, it's difficult to see what would really have motivated the Scots to take the giant step of breaking their vows to the English Edward. And why choose Bruce as leader? He shows no particular political ability beyond his peers and doesn't come over as particularly charismatic or inspiring.
Hollywood oversimplification all over the place. For example, did the Bruce really drift in to see John Comy at prayer alone (carrying a weapon), get annoyed, kill him and then stroll out past the inevitable guards?

But from which time frame of his life to start telling his story is the main question should be considered. The producer chose to start from 1299 is a good choice. The story will not make the film out of focus because of the failure of the previous war, but also succinctly explain the background of the story. However, the story still too big and long to tell which make the audience feel that the movie is incomprehensible.The director's love for the blood battle scene has made the film has great part description of blood and sword.

Chris Pine is the stoic (and not very Scottish ) Robert the Bruce who, after accepting the overlordship of the psychotic Edward I of England and his nearly as bad son, decides to try and liberate Scotland despite overwhelming odds. The film paints a picture of a very complicated situation in which the Anglo Norman rulers of both Kingdoms struggle for control and, in a scene where Bruce is clearly an outsider, cleverly shows the differences between the Gaelic highland culture and the Anglo Norman lowland culture.
With some great battles and plenty of flesh on show they're going for the GOT audience here but it works.

I stopped the movie a couple times and had to mansplain to my wife what was happening and the connection to other things that were going on, not on camera. She appreciated it.

I think ideally it needed to be turned into a series, so each character could be given the proper development time and we therefore appreciate their importance to the story.I doubt any viewer could name more than 1 of his brothers, despite there being 5 of them. I could name more of the English than the Scots because the English characters were kept to a minimum (well, 3 really unless you count de Bruce's wife to make it 4).There's a giant flaw at the end as well. The historical inaccuracy, and common sense with it, is thrown out the window for the finale which undermines the entire film.

But in this story, he seems to have 'mailed it in' as they say. It's so blatant I could hardly believe what I was seeing. Up to the 1 hour point he never emoted anything but the same complacent gaze. Even in scenes where he was supposed to be animated and emotional, it was just the same low-no affect and whispering dubbed voice. Yes his voice was sooo dubbed... I couldn't even be sure it was his own voice all deep and monotone. Weird.So many of the scenes were poorly directed and weakly executed. I suppose the average viewer may or may not notice those kind of details, but I do.Look, I'm a big fan of the genre, but this film, Outlaw King, spent its budget on locations and sets while neglecting investing in a director that has vision and the ability to get great performances from actors.A sad disappointment.",Outlaw King
157,janjeltes,Mostly Excellent,7,5 November 2019,"The cinematography, sets, costumes and weapons are superb in this film. The events are largely accurate: there are even YouTube videos critiquing the film positively.
What I found hard to swallow was the behaviour of some of the characters. At one point, a camp is ambushed. Their leader (The Bruce) is more interested in a soppy, elongated goodbye with his daughter than supporting his men. In another scene, a nun tried to get a child to go with her. In reality, she would have been cuffed behind the ear (I kid you not, nuns were tough and much tougher than you see in Hollywood). This sort of mushiness was very distracting.
As others have pointed out, the English were also vilified. Neither the English or Scots were saints. However, the English were reduced to 1-dimensional villains and the Scots far too sanitised. It undermined the story and insulted the audience's ability to see shades of grey. Particularly jarring was The Bruce's wife who gave a ""I'm a woman and that makes me special"" speech, although it was tempered d by the end of her monologue. This is typical Netflix, sadly.
For a movie that tries so hard to create a visual feel that was highly accurate, they let personalities derail,often painfully so.. I. This respect, their 2019 piece (The King) was much better as I felt personalities were largely in the ballpark of realistic.

It tries to be an epic war story and it has some really bloody fight scenes, but they are entirely unrealistic, as when the fighting virtually stops so that major characters can deliver their lines, when the Scottish king and the prince of Wales engage in man to man combat and virtually no one notices or when the prince of Wales is allowed to walk away after losing the final battle. It tries to be an epic love story, but there's no attempt to show how real emotional bonds develop between what are basically two strangers. The wife just suddenly declares that she'll support her husband's rebellion. The storytelling itself is disjointed and unrealistic and each character is so one dimensional (either entirely good or entirely evil) that the movie comes across as a simplistic allegory.

The character of Robert Bruce appears in the 1995 film and it is very easy to slip in its shoes and repeat a big part of the events in it. ""Outlaw King""managed to distance itself from ""Braveheart"" with just hinting the outcome of the events concerning Wallace and then goes into different direction of its own.
Actors are great. Pine's portrayal is beliavable and real. To me the most interesting performance is that of Florence Pugh. She made her character interesting by avoiding the stereotype of the medieval queen and that really stands out. The final battle was realistic and well-choreographed.

Special praise must also go to Chris Pine as Bruce his accent is spot on (I should know I'm Scottish) but some of the other actors accents were a bit ropey.Must also praise the filmmakers for including James Douglas 'The Black Douglas' as he was absolutely pivotal in the events and Robert Bruces' right hand man.The problem with the film is running time it feels far too short to tell half of what happened and it feels like the filmmakers are trying to squeeze too much into too little.The film ends at Loudoun Hill completely ignoring Bannockburn the event that would cement Robert The Bruce as King Of Scots.Why?

181,Hoverwolf,Fairly accurate historically,8,30 November 2018,"Being of Scottish heritage, I fully appreciated the historical accuracy and treatment of Robert the Bruce's ascension to the throne of Scotland. English Colonialism was never a pretty thing, simply being just an aggressive form of tribalism, really. And it's depicted well in the film, as well as the squabbles between the Scottish clans themselves.Not like Braveheart, which was rife with exaggerations and mis-truths about William Wallace (filmed in Ireland; using Uilleann bagpipes in the soundtrack; blue face paint which the Picts did, not Scots; Robert the Bruce did not betray William Wallace, I could go on...), Outlaw King stuck pretty close to the real timeline and events, even filming in Scotland!The story itself is well told and acted, and the story arc succinctly executed. Would have been nice to see this one on the big screen, particularly the battle scenes. Chris Pine has an entirely believable Scottish accent (to me), and plays his role flawlessly, as does the supporting cast. When I finish watching a movie and can't pick at anything wrong, then I can attest to the synergy all movie elements that make up good on-screen story telling... the editing in particular, which can make or break a film.Two thumbs up.",Outlaw King

The acting was brilliant and beautiful footage captured etc... But boy did it whisk through the story fast. I had to stop and Google things to keep up and understand properly. I really, REALLY wish this was turned into a mini series instead. It would have been able to go into greater detail with some things they whisked through and gone on to tell the story even further.

185,LaSaggezza,"Braveheart, the Sequel",7,11 November 2018,"Shame on Hollywood. If I recall correctly, Braveheart was a box office block-buster. So in this age a infinite sequels, this was a missed opportunity. As for Outlaw King, well it's as advertised, an action-adventure drama based on historical events. It's a good warm-up act for your movie night or good rainy day entertainment.What I didn't like was something which also annoys me in about all of the 'quiet-type' male lead: the strong-silent types mumble. Chris Pine speaks so softly I had to turn on English subtitles. This may have been a technical problem, but I think my ears swelled up from straining to hear him.Speaking of English, Braveheart and other action adventures of this period are doing a fair bit of ""English Bashing"". If I'm not mistaken, Edward, his successors and predecessors spoke old French, and they were what I think are referred to as Norman-Saxons. (All the way up to the Tudor dynasty who restored the English language). The 'Knights' were Norman lords who also spoke the French language of the time and England was still a conquered part of the Norman Empire on the coast of France. (If I recall correctly, English was a dying language at this time) Yet the action adventures of the period present the ""English"" aristocracy as brutal, insensitive, overlords who speak with a snooty, nose-in-the-air English accent.If you notice Billy Howle's 'bowl-over-the-head' haircut, well that was actually something like the way the Norman knights actually cut their hair. (See the Bayeux Tapestry)Alas, this is entertainment and not history so as for entertainment, it's pretty good and another feather in the cap for Netflix which is changing the industry with their combined production+subscription+distribution business model.",Outlaw King

187,danchi-75448,Bad Acting,1,12 December 2018,"The last film I saw Chris Pine in was ""A Wrinkle In Time"" and thought he just kind of went through the motions in that film. I was wrong. He was terrible in this film. I liked him in the Star Trek films. He was engaging and enthusiastic, entertaining to watch but in this film, he was just going through the motions. It was painful to watch. He seemed detached at times and really no chemistry with any of the other actors. Ex; the wedding night scene where he decides not to consummate the marriage which back than was a requirement. In fact from some of the historical writing there was usually a person in the room to make sure the marriage was consummated and the stained sheet paraded around for all to see afterwards. In this film, I didn't get the sense that he was thinking abut his new wife's level of comfort, to me he projected he just couldn't be bothered. When they did have sex there was no build up to draw the audience in. There was no chemistry between Pine and the actress.The pace of the movie was slow. I fast forwarded a lot to get to something that resembled interaction between the characters. Overall there was not one character I could invest in and cheer for. Amazing that none of the primary characters were killed. How did that happen?Aside from what I wrote already two things bothered me: the animal abuse-choking the swans was way over the top. The horses that had to have been injured or killed in the final battle scene. Disturbing. Also, the end where The Prince of Wales was allowed to leave after he got is butt kicked by Bruce-Really? You don't hold him hostage to use as leverage for something? Anything? That made NO sense!",Outlaw King
188,minamoto,Great cinematography idea,4,25 December 2020,"The film started really promising. The director seams to have some brilliant ideas implementing mocumentary style on an epic movie.He somehow achieves that but only on the first scene.

189,NikkiFromSiberia,Now THIS is how you make a medieval epic!,10,19 November 2018,"This movie deserves all of its 10 stars. It has such a realistic take on the Robert the Bruce situation while managing to squeeze in a realistic romance and capture the imagination...the spirit of the era. The scenes are masterfully done, the scenery is captivating (beautiful Scotland) and (my weakness) the costumes and decor is spotless...perfect (considering how many a period movie has fallen into the pitfall of bad costumes)! Great cinematography.
The action scenes are entertaining and i love the way this is portrayed, with realism but a lot of charm. Bonus, it contains one the hottest ahem....love making scenees that i've seen in a long while.
I've re watched the movie and will probably watch it again in the future.
Also, Chris Pine is surprisingly good here, doesn't look like the Hollywood pretty boy i know him as.
Great movie, one of the best this year! Maybe an Oscar contender....",Outlaw King
190,writer143,Not Enough Time,6,11 November 2018,"The movie attempts to tell a very complex, multi-layered story in 2 hours. It simply can't be done. This would have been a good mini-series, or standard series. Due to the time constraints, we don't get a much of a feel for the characters. What we get is fairly shallow and one-dimensional. And, as another reviewer mentioned, it doesn't follow history as closely as it could.The scenery is stunning, and there is plenty of action once the movie gets started. The actors do a good job with what they are given. But, I came away from the movie wanting to know these people and their history better. Two hours simply isn't enough time to delve deep enough into the rich history of the time. And so, it becomes a historical action movie, instead of an exciting view into the life and times of Robert the Bruce.",Outlaw King
191,sumdyude,Washed out b movie,2,10 November 2018,"Another medieval-themed film trying to piggy back ride on the Game of Thrones vibe, but falls flat.

Netflix really needs to do a better job with their ""originals"".",Outlaw King

193,merlinsk,A damn fine attempt at making an accurate historical Scottish epic.... And no tartan in sight!,7,2 December 2019,"Now let's get this straight right of the bat, Braveheart was a bloody good film. Criminally inaccurate, but bloody good nonetheless.This film tries to do the same while sticking (mostly) to the facts. People should remember, a movie is for entertainment, if you want 100% accuracy go see a documentary. A historical movie will always take some liberties to aid pace or dramatic effect so always watch with a suspension of disbelief and, in the opinion of an historian, if a movie inspires you to research a subject, if only to find out the inaccuracies, then some success has been had.Secondly I'd like to say to all those who've complained about the behaviour of the English - burning, raping, killing women and children - well, read some history, we did all of that and more in Scotland. And Ireland. And India. And North America. Anywhere, in fact, that our colonial foot trod. The last incidences of (by then, British) atrocities on our ""colonial subjects"" was in 1950s Kenya! The Union Flag is indeed the ""Bloody Rag""! Patriotism is a good thing, blind patriotism is dangerous, something our American friends could learn too.Anyway, this film is as accurate as possible though does contain a few small issues - one of which happens in EVERY historical movie involving British royalty, the use of ""Your Majesty"". This form of address never happened before Henry VIII, it was always ""Your Grace"" or ""My Lord"" - these are however understandable and certainly do not detract.There are some issues at establishing characters. Other than, The Bruce, the two Edwards, the Black Douglas, Angus Mac Donald and Elizabeth, I found myself not knowing who people were even to the point of the death of a character in the final battle who seems important to The Bruce but I didn't really know why.The pace of the film is just right, the cinematography is just fantastic, helped by locations actually IN Scotland and the script is well done. I found the bald guy's acting poor but he was alone in that and Chris Pine's accent (at least, to an Englishman) seemed spot on, though I do wish they'd used a real Scot for the part but movies are forever using Americans doing (sometimes awful) British accents in lead roles so I guess it's just a marketing thing.Overall a damn fine movie. Keep doing what you're doing Netflix and you may find yourselves the biggest shake up of the movie industry since colour film!",Outlaw King
194,kosaildiko-70264,sorry...,3,12 December 2018,"I like the big epic historical movies very much.

195,poetictank,Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.,10,16 November 2018,"Don't believe the negativity. Netflix made a masterpiece with this film. The cinematography, acting, screenplay are all just screaming that of an A-list blockbuster. Sadly, the reviewers giving this movie any negativity are coincidentally those who give CGI teen-crazed movies blaring reviews. Outlaw King is poetic in every subtle detail this movie has to offer. If you loved movies like Braveheart, this is that, but cleaned up and with cinematography that'll stand the test of time. My only gripe is that I'd wished this would've been a mini series of roughly 4-6 episodes. This story has so much that it seems almost impossible to cram into a few hours. I haven't seen this good of filming since Band of Brothers and The Pacific.",Outlaw King
196,ladiesbane,Everyone did a great job...except the writers.,2,14 November 2018,"Again and again, while watching, I asked myself why I wasn't enjoying the show. I will watch any period piece and medieval is my favorite. I had heard this movie was significantly closer to historical accuracy than Braveheart, and I was looking forward to that. What was the problem?No story. History, but no story.Tools that would have helped:1. Setting the stage and providing context in a way that makes the watcher eager to find out what's going to happen next. This is especially important in histories where we know exactly what's going to happen but we're dying to see it play out. (NB: this does NOT mean, ""telling the tale faster""; that's just getting it over with quickly. Instead, tell the tale so richly that time flies.)2. Making us care about the players rather than simply saying, ""Here is another unremarkable guy with a generic outfit, whose speech has no character, and whose behavior has no emotional impact on his friends or foes."" I am not suggesting that you insert lovable buffoons or extraneous scenes, but you can give people personalities, details, quirks that add dimension, make them memorable, make us care.3. Don't be afraid to trim details and characters who are extraneous to the action. Interchangeable Lords Six Through Fourteen are just people we notice, then look for, then wonder if they are ever going to matter, then ignore as we realize that no, we never needed to know them at all, and more of our admittedly meager emotional investment trickles away.And if you are following #2, you see what I mean. Have more pungent characters and fewer of them. Streamline the tale. You don't have to throw out history. But if you are making a movie rather than a documentary, consider the differences between the two.When I saw that five people were credited with writing, it made sense. A story can't be told by a chorus. Committees are for writing textbooks. And that's exactly what this feels like.",Outlaw King
197,seriouspark,A must see!,10,29 December 2018,"Fantastic film! At the same level as Braveheart, but a bit more historically accurate!The scenes, the acting, the music, top level. Probably Netflix's best original film.",Outlaw King
198,LeftyMcLefterson,"Great Film, honestly wish it was an hour longer.",7,9 November 2018,"Great movie, especially for history buffs who were struck in awe by the pure stupidity in Braveheart.There are some story points that they have taken some liberties, but this is for the sake of entertainment, not at the downfall of historical perspective.Chris Pine shows his acting chops here, he was well casted and really exemplified the role of Robert the Bruce. The cast to back up his protagonist role was also quite stellar, filled with a milieu of personality types and no one stuck out as a bad pick for the role though many of them forgettable which was a shame.
It was great seeing Stephen Dillan (Stannis Baratheon in Game of Thrones) back in a medieval role, it really suits him and his performance as Edward I was really quite spectacular.My biggest complaint is that it felt the story left unfinished at the end, and I wish there was about an hour more of film to watch. The battles were brutally violent and visceral, and the sets were simply stunning.Overall I give this movie an 7/10, Characters could have been flushed out better and some pacing issues fixed.

The first act lasts 35 minutes and by that time I was ready to fall asleep. I don't understand how other reviewers say it needs to be watched on a big screen or asking for the directors cut which is plus 30 minutes.
There are several shots cut in that are completely unnecessary or out of place.
There is a clear beginning that is already boring but the middle and and ending are disappointing and historical accuracy flies once again out the window if you're interested in that. Worth a watch on TV but that's it. It could have been much better.",Outlaw King

All in all the film couldn't decide what it want to be: a blockbuster or a tv-series. What a pity, The movie had huge potential to be a modern Braveheart. but it failed miserably.

205,Gotrek_Fabian,Good viewing if you don't know the history,7,25 November 2018,"There is a great spectacle to behold with this film which tells the story of the warrior king of Scotland, Robert the Bruce and the fight for the monarchy of Scotland with, initially, Edward the 1st. The cast is very well suited to their roles and cinematography is delightful with castles, towns and villages et al to behold, battles are enjoyable to watch and well choreographed but the story is romanticised too heavily in places at the cost of the truth. I won't bore you with all of the details but the ending for example *spoiler* at the Battle of Bannockburn which has Robert fighting Edward II in a swordfight just didn't happen. Edward II was dragged from that particular battle before the heaviest phase began and retreated to England soon after.If you can get past these inconsistencies with the story then there is an enjoyable film here for you but, if you are anything like me, these minor points will grate on you a little.",Outlaw King

207,hal-926-758283,Disappointing and rather tedious,4,15 February 2019,"Right from the start there was something about the writing and directing that made this feel fake. Unfortunately that coloured my viewing of the rest of the film.
Chris Pine does a good job as Robert the Bruce despite (for no obvious reason) being made to look much older than he would have been at the time of the events in the film.As a side note one of the goofs listed talks about the Act of Union 1707 but claims this was in the reign of Henry VIII: union took place long after death of Henry VIII - in fact after a whole different dynasty was in power and Queen Anne was on the throne.As many reviewers have said it probably should have been a mini-series rather than a film and then some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more so that you actually care about them.The final battle scene is one of the best parts of the film, though let down by the camera work.

210,Nathiri,Could have been something great.,7,17 December 2018,"Outlaw King deserves some praise, but ultimately falls short in some areas. The filming and set pieces are great. You can really tell they tried to be as historically accurate as possible. I especially liked how they dealt with Bruce's marriage in how he was friendly but not cold, considering the circumstances. Then there was some warming up scenes before you could see a love starting to grow however quick the development was.As I saw the movie unfold, I began to think they were moving a bit too fast and leaving out some crucial events I wished they explored. They had a quick dialogue about a spider, but didn't actually show Bruce becoming discouraged in any way. Then they left out what I think could have been potentially thrilling scenes with Stirling Castle and especially Edinburgh Castle; and his later raids into England when King Edward II marched away. And wasn't there a duel somewhere they might have wanted to show? The movie needed to definitely be longer or split into a mini-series. It is enjoyable to see the movie unfold in its current state, but afterwards you wish there was more story to it and it raps up rather quickly.",Outlaw King

212,JohnLondon-03818,It's a glossier than average TV Movie,6,11 November 2018,"OK, I accept that a certain editorial leeway has to be given in order to dramatise history, but eventually there is a point where you have to title it 'Work of fiction'. This film is sufficiently removed from actual history that even 'Based on historical events' is bordering on flattery.I know, I know. Nobody is meant to care and it is all just entertainment. But this film dresses itself up as some kind of historic truth. If polititians or companies rewrote history for commercial gain and presented it as truth, we'd rightly be up in arms. God knows the real story and events are exciting enough without having to lard them up with hackneyed characatuers and cliches.The Bruce was a great man and a flawed man in a complex age of power politics. His allegiances vis a vis Scotland and England were fluid at best. The murder of Comyn was just that, murder. Edward II, though a useless King in other ways had to be dragged from the battlefield - there was no mano a mano showdown. I could go on.Enjoy the yarn, but appreciate this is a 'Disney' film about boy with sword meets girl with modern sensibilities, whilst charming minority group with pleasing ethnic music overcomes neighbours who are all shallow, sadistic stereotypes. It's the medieval equivalent of a 1940's war film with monocled German baddies.And the film? Nice scenery, bit of blokey bonding, splatter battle scenes. Not one you'd watch twice.",Outlaw King

A historical fiction about an arranged marriage, the movie tries to be a romance pandering to feminists. A bloody period piece akin to The Kingdom of Heaven, it tries to be the tv show Merlin with a smattering of Game of Thrones.
It may have pulled it off, but it put too much time into wide shots and not near enough into character development. The dialogue was suited to a young adult fantasy drama, but swords would randomly make fully armored men expell chunks of blood and guts across the battlefield.",Outlaw King

The movie did not disappoint at all. The acting was spot on. All of the actors seemed really authentic and did a really decent job. The movie follows the story of the newly appointed King of Scots (played by Chris Pine) and his fight for freedom from the English. What i did not like from this film was that it felt a bit rushed. As some of the other people in the comments pointed out this would have been an amazing mini series. A lot of things happened in a short amount of time which resulted in poor character development. Even though it lacked in some areas overall was entertaining movie with epic raw battles and no boredom in between scenes.,Outlaw King

Better portrayal of Richard Bruce than in Braveheart. Dillane is always interesting to watch and great here as well. The queen, Robin, played the role intelligently which helped keep my interest. The violence was also well done. Better movie than I expected.",Outlaw King

236,henrylightfoot,Really Solid Film,8,16 December 2018,"Chris Pine gives a pretty understated performance here, and it works well that way. Similarly it's a very good looking film in a way that works to make the setting and events believable, more than going for the wow factor. I was expecting it to be a miniseries and was surprised when it wrapped up, but I was really satisfied nonetheless. Terrific drama, nice ending. A well made period piece with good performances, locations and direction. Definitely worth recommending.",Outlaw King
237,huggie_g,Potentially great but falls flat,5,13 November 2018,"Watched this hopeful that it would be good. And for parts of it it's exciting and dramatic. Chris Pine does a good job as Bruce. Stephan Dillane is great as Edward I. Most notably.
But found it hard to empathise much with a lot of the characters. We know they should be significant but when something dramatic happens it always feels a bit anticlimatic.Main annoyance is the fighting feels extremely lazy. When a lot of fighting films focus on great fighting choreography Outlaw King has a lot of wild swishing. To much fighting where everyone is going for strange wild haymakers. Can understand for untrained fighters. But with most of the fighting focus on the leaders they would've been skilled swordsmen.In the end it was enjoyable to watch in places. But felt very rushed and a little flat for chunks of it. A poor child of Braveheart, which says a lot.",Outlaw King

239,CzechGangsta,Finaly...,10,4 May 2019,"Netflix just proved us that they can make high budget movies, and damn they do them well. I think that Outlaw king is perhaps best medieval themed film of all times.
Historic accuracy i regard to weapons and equipment is amazing accept use of fire arrows. No they were not used, but i guess that they just look cool. And yes the last epic battle was a mix of battle of Bannockburn and battle of Louden hill, but i can forgive those small mishaps. Robert the Bruce is a great historical figure of medieval Britain by itself and this movie just reinforces that. LOVE IT",Outlaw King

242,jadzia69,Robert the Bruce meets Game of Thrones,8,25 May 2019,"A little slow to start but soon picks up speed. I compare it to Game of Thrones in that it is brutal and gritty, retribution is delivered swiftly and mercilessly (also King Stannis and Lord Commander Mormont of The Nights Watch feature) The battle scenes are chaotic and bloody, not for the faint hearted. Billy Howle is particularly good at portraying Prince Edward, and Florence Pugh puts in a strong performance as the Queen too. Chris Pine produces a passable Scottish accent too. Overall I enjoyed it, bloody and brutal and grows into itself.",Outlaw King
243,octored,Excellent,6,28 July 2021,"Great movie. Gorgeous cinematography. What a great opening sequence! Congratulations to the entire team. I would have liked having characters being physically similar to the actual people of the XIV century.... but the cast and performances are superb. Definitely to another level than anything else that comes out of Netflix and along side in quality of Andi Baiz' ""Narcos"". This film definitely deserves higher praises and will probably be recognized as time go by as all good work of art does ""far away from the common rabble"". David Mackenzie is definitely such a great director confirmed since ""Hell or High Water"". Thank you for not succumbing in one of those immature dumb down movies that are plaguing the screens, and offering finally a great feudal story. I only wished it was 20 minutes longer.

It's inevitable. However, I was surprised that Mackenzie, a man who brought us the amazing, Academy award nominated Hell or High Water, also brought us Outlaw King, as the film was pummelled with hopelessness. There is a tiny bit of humour, there is a tiny bit of heart, but it became a long road of suffering, and that's even compared to the tragic ending of Braveheart.I wish it had more of the same mix of life and drama that Hell or High Water had.",Outlaw King

The film is, at best, average.. Something I should add is if theyre going to employ a non scot in the lead role shouldnt they make sure he can speak in a Scots accent? Chris Pine in this film only speaks at one sentence at a time, he clearly cannot handle any more than that and even at that, his accent is clearly not that of a Scotsman...

The Cinematography was one of the only things that kept me captivated but really how many different perspectives can you capture from this beautiful place called Scotland? It seemed to me that David McKenzie was trying to capture that ""Bravehart"" feel which he probably did in his mind but just couldn't transfer it to film, I presume that's what a great director can do.
Chris Pine did a good job with what he was given in my opinion.",Outlaw King
254,davidtaylor84,Brilliant,9,12 November 2018,Brilliant movie. Don't understand about all these people saying it's a sequel to braveheart. It clearly isn't considering the king is alive in this movie but dies at the end of braveheart. Some people obviously looking for stuff to moan about. Anyway it's a movie that's worth a watch. Well done Netflix,Outlaw King
255,milosek,New-school history epic damaged by a single scene,7,17 November 2018,"Outlaw King does one thing more than anything.It displays that movies should be made with the story in mind, not the viewers. Or how the viewers are perceived that is.And director David Mackenzie followed that rule meticulously... until the mere end of the movie.What is a carefully researched, executed, stunningly filmed, gritty, muddy history epic became blemished with the ""movietization"" of the conclusion.A naive, unnecessary scene was jammed into the end to give a story more usual, uniformed ending, leaving a bitter taste in the mouth. A film that one couldn't wait to recommend to friends, became a ""you could see it"" type of movie.A single scene almost did enough to degrade Outlaw King from a historical epic to a ""sword and sandal"" movie. If not for the perfect castings, inspiring cinematography, and state of the art modern filmmaking.Another cut of the movie could save its legacy and turn it into a cult-classic among history enthusiasts.",Outlaw King
256,rclldc,Incredibly entertaining,8,26 December 2018,"I absolutely loved this movie. Netflix has a bright future. I originally scored this a 7 but after really thinking on it, an 8 is more acceptable. Chris Pine was absolutely phenomenal. I think we forget that he can actually act, and act well! For me I think The character of Douglas stole the show. He grabs your attention and gets you rooting for him immediately. Overall, you should watch and love this movie. If it comes onto Blu Ray I will own it.",Outlaw King
257,Gary-ks,Poorly written and crafted,3,19 November 2018,"This movie falls into most of the possible pitfalls of the genre and despite good cast and big budget doesn't succeeds in major categories like authenticity and entertainment.
It tries to depict a strong, willful medieval character who wears perfectly washed closes and shiny armor. There is mud but it never rains. There is love (is there) but it is not obvious to the viewer why the two have feeling for each other. There is hate, but it's very black and white type of hate where the villain is all vice and the hero is noble. And finally, there is almost zero amount of any characters development, which is unforgivable for a two hours long movie.
Besides this obvious flows present throughout the movie there are many scenes and dialogs which make you question the authenticity and the level of research and understanding the movie makers invested in it. Script writer and director of this kind of historical drama, in my opinion has major responsibility to bring people, maybe not objective but a full, reliable version of the events. I'm not very well familiar with the story but apparently some of the major historical facts were changed but haven't contributed anything meaningful to the story.
One of the most apparent examples to this is the presence of Edward 2 in the battlefield. Do they really need to put him there to make a one on one duel with Robert? The answer is obviously no. Not only it doesn't contribute anything meaningful, it raise your eyebrow and along with that many questions like - why Bruce didn't kill him? Why would kings troops leave the king behind? Why on earth Edward 2 would let it go after being humiliated like this (don't forget he was depicted as a sadist a psychopath).
Bottom line, I gave this movie 3 stars because of good performances of Pine and some other main actors who made this rather bad movie watchable.",Outlaw King
258,vici_rsa,I liked it very much!,8,11 November 2018,"A nice historical move. A theme which I really like. I take all the chances to watch a film based on real history events.

An average movie",7,10 November 2018,"The movie has great cinematography, but the story develops too fast and because of it there's no way to get emotionally attached to any character. At the end of the movie you don't feel like you wasted 2 hours but don't even feel like it was the best movie you've ever watched. The acting is not exciting nor bad.

However, it fails in very basic things. The script is poor and the narrative is slow. It lacks the power of a proper epic movie and to be honest, it's just boring. (Not to mention with a few awful clichés)
It does have some highlights though. Pine does a great job as Robert the Bruce, and although there are a few historical mistakes, the story is quite accurate.
I did enjoy the movie, but i struggled to keep focused on it. A real shame, a promising start and a very mediocre development.",Outlaw King
261,nicholaustin-93982,Can't Watch This,2,13 November 2019,"Normally a review comes after a movie, but my review of this movie is just that I can't watch it. From what I have seen the sets look good, the world created looks plausible (for the most part) and some of the Braveheart II elements are enjoyable. However I just can't get past the too strong female character pushing through scene after scene, it's just too much. Three times I have turned this off and twice I tried to go back because I read other reviews that convinced me it was worth it (the singing is good). If you don't mind feminists in your 14th century dramas then you may find this movie quite enjoyable.",Outlaw King
262,Millbags09,Great cinematography but little emotion.,6,9 November 2018,"Good direction, decent acting, beautiful cinematography but just not clearest story to convert into a movie. I'm sorry, understand that Robert The Bruce is a Scottish hero, but this movie has little heart. It doesn't have anywhere near the same emotional content that a movie like Braveheart does, which is always going to be the comparison (due to the chronology and the frequent mentions of William Wallace). All through the film you get the impression that Robert the Bruce is not fighting for worthy causes such as revenge, his country or even freedom, he's out for his own interests, just trying to grab power for his own purposes. He wants to be a king and now he has his opportunity to seize the crown. Which means it's difficult to get behind the character and be emotionally involved in the story. Overall, a decent effort from Netflix, but they could perhaps have chosen a clearer story for their historical epic. Even the last battle scene feels a little rushed and just kind of tails off with a weird and slightly uncomfortable one on one sword fight at the end. Perhaps a character like Boudicca, Alfred the Great or Owain Glendower would provide a clearer historical protagonist and a more emotional story arc.",Outlaw King

There's a good story in there struggling to get out but you are left unmoved by the characters because you learn so little about them.

And although the movie is no where near a comparison with Braveheart, the movie is surprisingly good. I have to admit I was little afraid when I knew Chris Pine was casted as the leading rule, but he did a good job given his abilities. The best thing in this movie was the costumes and locations, hey were picked up and made very well and realistic. Music wasn't that good also not that bad. The other actors did a very good job.

273,chris_shields85,A view from a nationalist scotsman,7,29 November 2018,"The movie is ok, a bit rushed and very little insight to why this war was even fought, not to mention it was a David vs goliath fight, Scotland had endured so much cruelty and suffering from English rule and this is what brought so little men with little fighting skills to the battlefield to take on such a large enemy,and adding this to the story would connect you more to the movie, the Bruce was not trusted by many Scots as his allegiance chopped and changed and he had to endure a lot to bring Scots onside to fight with him and put their trust in him, again for me these are key points that this movie failed to put to let viewers who may not really know what this war was really about have more insight",Outlaw King
274,Mark-hardy70,The dullest lead imaginable!,2,9 December 2018,"I love an historical epic, but a key requirement includes a charismatic and believable performance from its leading man - and the performance of Chris Pine was far, far from it.

Costumes, surroundings and sets are not distinguishable from something made for the big screen. The performances are also very good, which is to be expected with a cast like the one this movie has. Then there's something that I really admire: there's a shot at the at the very beginning of the movie that takes 8 minutes. Yes, a single, 8-minute long shot that takes us from conversations to a fight to a huge fricking trubuchet being fired, all without a single cut. From that moment on, this movie had my respect. The story is what is to be expected, it's not bad, but neither does it do anything extraordinary. This story is, however, weakend by its pacing, which is the worst aspect of this movie. It doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants, with some short scenes following each other up rather rapidly while there is actually quite a long period between them. The comparison with Braveheart is easily made, and the creators of this movie didn't try to avoid that. It is very much alike, but more of a continuation of that original story. If you loved that movie, you'll probably like this one.",Outlaw King

283,eya-7,True to life versus true,8,8 January 2019,"Instead of doling out a summary and overall analysis, I'd like to point out one thing that seems to be getting little attention in reviews, in general. I saw some nitpicking over the veracity of the story, e.g. Bruce had most likely planned the assassination of Comyn - even if legend says he might have botched the killing and someone else had to finish Comyn off - and Bruce might have gotten help from the bishop as early as planning the assassination; the subsequent move north was planned ahead of time and not a spur of the moment decision; the coronation did not happen in one night, Bruce got crowned a second time to make the coronation appear more legitimate; Elisabeth did not spend time in a cage, Bruce's sister and ally did, while Marjorie had a cage built for her but never made use of it; Elisabeth did return, in a prisoner exchange ten years after her capture; Bruce was shorter and stouter than Pine; Edward II did not participate in the ""final"" battle (of the movie, anyway) and was generally misrepresented; etc. And while Outlaw King may not always be true (I don't dispute most of the objections, a lot of them are backed by research), it is surprisingly true to life in many respects, something that's quite unique in movies.For me, the costumes were a pleasant surprise. Braveheart went the bareass naked, kilted way and it was wrong on both counts by a few centuries. The 1996 The Bruce movie (which is annoying as all get-out) went a strange, vaguely 1980s toga meets Elizabethan fashion way (including big hair). Outlaw King is very on-point in its fashion choices, beautifully medieval and simple. Even the battle gear part of costume design is generally spot on.Lighting. Oh my goodness - have you noticed all the fires and candles? The movie feels dark because it often is, and that's a good thing. No brightly lit halls, no really obvious spotlighting. In the 14th century, dark interiors were all the rage and the movie makes great use of the fact, just playing with small doses of light to make a point. You don't believe me, rewatch the church scene between Comyn and Bruce. Of course it's spotlighted, but look at the way light is used in that scene. It's brilliant. It's even used to make Pine look less pretty.Scotland feels poorer. Everything about the Scots is cheaper, less elaborate, less moneyed (I love Og's chain mail, all holey and torn). Clothing, mail, weapons, vehicles, and much else are all simpler, and they should be. Scots may have had the English beaten in grit and spirit, but not in funds. Scotland of the time was more rural, there was in fact less money. And even the wealth of the English is displayed with more modesty than is typical for movies. I may have mentioned this before, but this world is a lot more medieval than we've come to expect of historical TV and film.There are a few more, but I've already made this list long enough, so I'll finish with the most obvious one. Fighting. Typically, medieval fights tend to run spectacular, all horses and spears and shining metal. No one ever gets tired, no one ever falters, everything is pretty and choreographed and sanitized. Not in the Outlaw King. Most of the fighting is brutal and chaotic and you're often left wondering how everyone knew not to kill their own because they all look almost identical. The only really for-show action happens for a few seconds in the battle of Methven (the nighttime raid on Bruce's camp by Valence). Fictitious or real, the rest of the fighting is very close to what it really would have been like.Sometimes history has to give way to a good story but Outlaw King does really well with keeping the movie true to life if not always historically accurate.",Outlaw King
284,avezzanoandrea,An unexpected surprise,8,20 October 2019,"This movie is an unexpected gift for anyone looking for a good historical action/adventure drama. It's a shame such a movie is totally unknown, atleast in my country. The cinematography is really great, there is a scene right at the beginning, which goes along in one take as we follow the characters, and culminates with the astonishing view of a giant catapult shooting to a distant castle as we reach the climax of the scene. Really well done! Good photography, good script, my only criticism goes to the main actors, which, even if well casted, are not so invested in their role sometimes. Ah, and, for God sake, they should have hired a good swordmaster for the fight coreographys. However, the great battle scene in the end made me forget the sloppy swordplay of the beginning. In the end, even if not perfectly historically correct, this movie was a pleasant unexpected surprise after so many failing attempts like Ironclad and Robin Hood... 8/10 Go watch it!!",Outlaw King

286,viirek,Waste of time,2,2 July 2020,"To me, Outlaw King was an utter waste of time. The main character was so boring and tame, definitely not a hero material. I didn't quite understand whether it was bad acting or bad directing, but this film just did not take me with it. Slow-paced beginning, I couldn't care less about the main character, the anti-hero was so much more bad-ass. It was just as if some wannabe director was playing wannabe movie directing with wannabe actors and wasted the time of the rest of the crew, and - definitely - of all the audience.",Outlaw King
287,NotYourExAnymore,Confused Director,3,16 November 2018,"I am a big fan of historical fiction regardless of its genre, it'd be a movie, serial, or a book. So I was very excited to see this one. Apparently the director had a lot to tell about, but instead of putting efforts to form his ""story"" to fit in a standard movie narrative, it seems he just decided to shoot every scene he was thinking of in a chronological order. That's why a daily life in a fishing village and a decisive ambush shares the similar length of screening, or a family talk and a meeting for a rebellion... Obeying different kings twice, a death of a king, marriage, having ambushed twice, losing family members, etc all happens without ceasing, without any moment to give a background, to deepen the character. Acting was good, but since we could not have any time to relate with any characters, even acting seems funny some time.",Outlaw King
288,tutt55,Just simply not good,5,12 November 2018,"This story has all the makings of a great movie. However, this movie was an injustice to said story. The writing was not very good. The pace was atrocious. And the story was crammed into 2 hours when it should've been comprised of multiple episodes. It felt rushed like it was racing to see how soon it could get to the end...which wasn't really an ending and left much of the story of Robert the Bruce left untold. It seemingly jumped rapidly from one scene to the next, sacrificing any connection a viewer could have with the characters. Watching, I didn't really care if Robert succeeded or not. The movie didn't connect me to him. I didn't care about the relationship with his daughter. I didn't care about the relationship he had with his wife. They were distant acquaintances one moment. She said something Talia Shire-ish (Win, Rocky. Win.) and then they have sex a few scenes later and are separated until the end of the movie. There was nothing in the movie that showed she was an integral part of his life really. So, no character development. No connectivity with the characters. Rushed pacing. Shallow story telling. There was some good cinematography and some of the battle scene was ok. This was just a huge disappointment overall.",Outlaw King
289,jnucif2720,Netflix should've released this in a wide theatrically,10,11 November 2018,"The good news Netflix continues to impress with their movies, this is an excellent example. The setting centers around 13 th century England and their reign over the British Isles. The time that William Wallace and Robert Bruce challenged the throne for their independence . Historically it is quite accurate. As a production it excels in cinematography, acting and the cheography of its battle scenes which are spectacular and visceral . If you have a good sound system with a decent sized 4K screen you'll be impressed with this brilliant production",Outlaw King
290,anythinkfilms,It deserves your viewing,9,18 December 2018,"** SPOILERS**
James Douglas (Aaron Taylor-Johnson): I serve Robert Bruce; join us to free our land.Outlaw King begins with the beautiful shot of a candle burning which I believe is symbolic in the way it represents the continuing fire burning within the Scottish people to revolt against the occupying English army. This symbol could be likened to the context of Scottish Independence today in modern politics with Scotland's candle still burning.....
But I'm not here to talk about that! Lets get to it!
The film really commences with an incredible single take shot which follows from Robert bending the knee to Edward I up until its revealed this story initiates during the siege of Stirling castle and the unveiling of the massive trebuchet named Warwolf which is used on the castle. In this story this is what re-ignites the fire within Bruce.
Director David Mackenzie and Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (known for United 93, Detroit and Jason Bourne among others) use Scotland to their advantage (unlike the more famous 'Braveheart' (Robert Bruces' nickname) shot in Ireland, I will not talk about this again throughout this review) Mackenzie and Ackroyd employed lots of Drone shots which added to the beautiful aesthetic of the overall film making Scotland a character herself.
The casting was pretty much perfect apart from James and Robert being played by non-Scots. I didn't think about that too much when watching the film and completely became oblivious to the fact that James was played by an Englishman and Robert a North American. The standout though was Florence Pugh, the way she conveyed her emotions throughout and the chemistry she had with Bruce's daughter stood out to me. It's not the first role she has stood out in though check out 'Lady Macbeth', 'BBC King Lear', 'The Little Drummer Girl'. Pugh is definitely going places so keep your eyes peeled.
I must also say bravo to David Mackenzie and his attention to detail throughout the historical side of things. For example when Robert Bruce killed John Comyn, why did Bruce kill Comyn? He got in the way of Robert obtaining the Scottish crown. Roberts wife and Daughter both were taken by the English. His brothers hung, drawn and quartered (lovely, I know, but true) I'm not saying everything was accurate and happened at that time portrayed in the film but it was in there and with films you do have to respect that the director can employ some of their own artistic license to add their little intimate details which I agree with in bits and pieces as this film is about revenge and these events added fuel to his fire.
But.....the spider scene was cut.
While hiding in a cave for three months after being defeated in battle Bruce came across a spider, during this time he was at the lowest point in his life and apparently thought about leaving the country and never returning. Then he spotted the spider and it begun to build a web but time after time it fell down however it continued to build its web. This motivated Bruce to regroup with his men and reignite the fight. ""If at first you don't succeed, try and try again.""
Then there's the final battle which is at Loudon Hill. Everyone wanted Bannockburn but why Loudon Hill? At this point in the story Bannockburn will not have taken place just yet, that was much later. Loudon Hill took place not long after the small skirmish at Glentrool (not in the film) therefore making Loudon Hill the better and lesser known battle to take place.
Then the film does a time jump.........to after the battle of Bannockburn!!!! I didn't agree with this move because the director could've used that to his advantage. The film is all about revenge then why not continue that in a sequel make a trilogy take your bloody time, I dislike unnecessary time jumps to speed a film along or tv series it's fricken laziness (looking at you AMC) They could've finished up with Bruce planning his next battle while a candle is lit in front of him and he stares into the flame cutting to his wife in the cage over the water. Unfortunately due to the time jump that won't work unless they do flashbacks....ugh.
Overall I highly recommend this Netflix Film for its story, direction, the beautiful way the battles are shot, Scotland's portrayal, historical accuracy and oh yeah that not bad Scottish accent from LA Native Chris Pine.
I'd also like to acknowledge the fact that Hollywood is beginning to take a lot more notice in Scotland's potential which will be great if more and more productions begin to use her in the future or film makers want her beauty on the big screen. I guess the 'Outlander' effect is everywhere! Thanks for reading!

The Scottish brogue is a hard accent to perfect and I haven't heard one yet that is worthy. One Reviewer said that Gerard Butler should have played the part.

The movie had potential, good story, the scenery looked great, the mud and village environment looked realistic and the costumes looked good ... almost.So they got everything right on set except the dirt, all the costumes looked they had just got back from the dry cleaners, surely in the years of the 1300's and under those conditions the clothing would have been mud and dirt stained. Also why did everyone look like they had been to the hair dressers recently, and just had a hot bath, shave and put on face moisturiser!I can't get lost in a movie when it looks like a stage play.

305,karlkrogholt1,"Surprisingly good, but should propably have been a miniseries",7,12 November 2018,"Outlaw King is an entertaining and interesting movie. So much so that actually I think they should have made it a mini series in stead, because there are some things that felt a little rushed in the ending especially.
I think the acting and the cinematography is very nice! Chris Pine actually surprised me positively, for some reason I did not thing he would fit in here, but I think he did a great job. Even though the most memorable performance in my oppinion is Aaron Taylor Johnson who plays James Douglas. I would have loved to see this on the big screen though, because there are some fantastic battle scenes that would undoubtedly be spectacular on the big screen. I envy those who saw this at Toronto film Festival. (Here in Denmark I have nowhere to go to see Netflix productions on the big screen sadly)
This would have been an 8 or maybe 9 if it had been a little longer or maybe even had been produced as a mini series Instead. As I would like to have some of the characters stories expanded on a bit more, and I also think the beginning can be a little confusing if you have no prior knowledge about the whole Scottish-english conflict back then. All in all a good movie that most people will enjoy. Some scenes are really graphic and brutal though so it may not be for the family evening.",Outlaw King

They also didn't indulge in Politically Correct cliches like the Asskicking Strong Woman or The Token Black Guy, which is refreshing. When I hear people complain about how women are always weak damsels-in-distress, or how The Black Guys are always criminals, it confuses me...movies haven't been like that in at least 35 years.

But the movie is so rushed that it makes the story so silly.... If i hadn't known some of the details i would have thought it was a fantasy about a stupid man who risks it all and get his people killed for nothing then somehow regenerates his 50 man army to 500 and beat 10000 man army by using some half ass plan to kill around 1000 cavaliers.... If somehow someone managed to lift the statue of liberty.... His biography movie shouldn't just focus on that and forget the training and drama and joy of success.... Because the main focus would be too unbelievable even if assumed true.
If u can't show the 500 men beating the big army on screen then don't do it or at least don't focus on it.
Other than that the cinematography was cool. The characters were poor written but well played to the extent. Sound and music was good. Also costumes, makeup and overall production was great. So it's just the poor writing and the director's approach to the story that lowered the rating.",Outlaw King
332,floppy143,Choppy editing; zombie like main actor,5,30 November 2018,"This was a waste if a great storyline. The actors, apart from our main actor were pretty decent. What this movie suffered was a little choppy editing. They could have strung together the story with a good narration. You have a sense that things just happened. There was a lack in focussing on the strategy that Robert used. It was all over the place, and not one single aspect of it became excellent. And what was that obligatory nude shot of a naked Chris Pine got to do with the story other than to exploit his Hollywood leading man status? The supporting actors were great though. Aaron Taylor-Johnson managed to immerse himself in his role, you don't even recognise it's him until you read the screen credits. Florence Pugh was excellent as Robert's wife. Why oh why Chris Pine do you not have more facial expressions? Not even in the movement of your eyes? Did the cold weather in Scotland just froze them?",Outlaw King
333,KevinLangmuir,*Spoilers* (if history movies can have spoilers),8,11 November 2018,"I grew up 5 miles from Turnberry so a lot of the Scottish history has been ingrained since I was very young. The accents are pretty good, Chris Pine does a good non-colloquial west coast accent (as no recordings exist from that time, it is as accurate as you would expect a west coast nobles accent to be). The fighting is brutal, bloody and the film depicts the chaos of battle very well.I feel that the murder of John Comyn should have been off screen to make us wonder at the motivations and at the discussion held between the two. Edward II was not at the Battle of Loudon Hill, this battle in the film just appeared to be a cheaper compromise for the Battle of Bannockburn, as a result the timelines towards the end of the film get a bit muddled. I also wish we saw the personal combat between Robert the Bruce and Henry de Bohun in the film.Where Braveheart fell way short of being historically accurate (my history teacher in school fumed about his), this film does the Scots history a lot of justice, but it is not perfect.",Outlaw King
334,maxnizam,A must watch for history buffs,8,14 February 2019,"It's my first review so bear with me. Keep seeing the avatar for the movie popping up on my Netflix must watch list. One fine day, while I was feeding my daughter lunch, I decided to let my daughter have my phone while I watched this and told myself to stop it halfway so I can make it before the bank closes. Well that plan failed.
This movie kind of interlinked with Braveheart, continuation after William Wallace was given the whole lot of torture for treason (hanged, drawned and quartered). For historical buffs, this makes for an interesting watch.
The actors are good, albeit Chris being an American in a full British cast movie. He tries his best to sound Scottish but I guessed the others covers up as best so you don't take much notice. However, he's brilliant in this. Surprising to see Aaron of Kick Ass in it, his frame kind of give it away before I confirmed it by checking the cast of actors here.
The scenery is amazing, I think that's why it got me caught up and watch the whole film. The battle scenes after awhile looks almost the same and the gory detail was kinda explicit I had to shield my daughter's prying eyes. The work to make the scenes almost feels like it's the 15th century must be crazy hard because it's almost looks real from the ground (worned out due to the pacing of the horses inside and out) and the surrounding that you could almost smell the wood burning at the campfire.
The dreaded sense that the Scots gonna lose this war keeps popping up, seeing how the Brits was ruthless to everyone and it really makes you root for the Scots.
My only negative comment was the pacing, it was a bit rushed. The romance between the outlaw king and his queen made via an arranged marriage seems a bit fast paced. I would love to see the director's cut since the element of realism is almost close to the books. The director's attempt at making this film should be applauded for that, and its a fair value in trying to put on film the history of Scotland.
I hope Netflix's staff would read this and consider the directors cut, I think most viewers would like that. Give this a movie a try guys and a wet and rainy day with curtains close to almost get a feel of the movie. Oh and spoiler alert for you guys who's not into history, the Scots won!",Outlaw King
335,rolodojo,This aint no braveheart but that's only a good thing,8,10 November 2018,"Finally A film about Scottish history that doesn't make me want throw the telly out of the window or worse still look on Scots with disdain. A really really good film no blue and white face paint no aussicomeyanky halfbit actor shouting corny lines. Excellent acting as usual from Chris Pine and also the rest of the cast. If you put this film up against rob roy or braveheart it eclipses them by a long way.
Braveheart currently still scoring over 8 on IMDB just goes to show how useless the scoring system is when its scored by Americans who think they are Scottish or Irish even though the last relation was some 3rd cousin twice removed 8 generations ago and the Scots who simple scored it well because they tend to have a chip on their shoulders and a film about a Scot beating the english is going to be a 10 even if its a 1. The shame is this Film is superb in comparison I will bet it doesn't get to 8+ on IMDB though. Also for a film about the Scots beating the english it was good to see the English portrayed slightly better than the usual camp toffy nosed wimp they usually have when the english are the enemy of the Scots or the Irish.
I watched this film I actually think I like the Scots again the other 2 ""blockbusters"" put me off scotland for years.
Yep I am English with recent Irish and scots ancestry grandparents either side, too the Americans that doesn't make me either and i didn't score this film high simply because i consider it my patriotic duty to some ancestor from generations ago.

Quite a few shortcuts from the real story: it is made to look a lot shorter than the 8 years it took to unfold and for Scotland to get its independence. So , on that end, a bit « americanised » for a story on Scots!
Good performances from all the actors. Great picture, great landscapes, great light.
Script was decent too. Good effort really worth watching.
Thank you Netflix.",Outlaw King

Stupid scenes that slow the movie down, but don't tell the story. Fighting scenes that tell nothing and lead to nothing. Besides that they are historically incorrect and plain stupid.

And dare I say it, it's just as good if not better. Brutal, Bloody and Brilliant. Pine is outstanding, Dillane (Stanis Baratheon) as Edward I, tremendous.

The history is perfect from what i know, down to the smallest details. The beautiful British countryside is there meaning no green screen. Acting was incredible and i almost cried in a few areas despite having the knowledge of what would happen next.On top of this there is the camera work. The opening shot is an 8 minute one shot. Its phenominal. Throughout this whole film i felt both countries were at each others throats. There was a hunting game and then the feeling of the underdog spirit.Everything that you imagine what war would look like in this era came to life. Gory, life like blood is there the whole time and makes the depiction of war in the 1300's very real. I commend everybody who worked on this film. From actors to the fashion designers. Everything was perfect.This film is perfect",Outlaw King
348,gibtoe69,A great film,8,22 November 2018,"Once the narrative gets on a roll it really hits the spot, Glad it wasn't too much of a braveheart mirror",Outlaw King
349,alex-p-williams,Deserves greater praise,9,22 January 2019,"Much criticism of this film points at the 'cramming' of a good chunk of 3 years in The Wars of Scottish Independence, into a film less than 2 hours long. The film starts off in 1304 with the siege of Stirling Castle, which features the spectacular tracking shots that help define the exquisite use of cinematography throughout the films duration. Is it crammed? To an extent yes, but it is a film, and a historical one that requires prior knowledge; as a result, viewers are either gripped, in the story or emotionally tied to the characters, or not. The film does take certain liberties with historical accuracy, namely certain events either merged together or moved around on the timeline - all in aid of dramatic effect. Nonetheless this does not shadow the realism that does exist, especially in terms of the savagery of warfare and intrigue. As well as the superb set pieces and costume designs that accompany the productions heavy attention to detail.Although it is understandable how many get lost within the story, it skips much character building and connections between each fighting scene, in sacrifice for fitting in several important confrontations, especially the end pitched Battle of Loudoun Hill - in which Bruce achieves his astonishing victory. In this case, perhaps a mini-series or a two-parter would have quelled these disappointments. But perhaps not have matched the explosive, intense, almost breath-taking at times, nature of this film.Overall Outlaw King is a fine addition to the family of historical films, and perhaps one the best medieval ones yet. It should be taken for what it is, not what it could have been; a quick, brief search on Wikipedia would work a treat for anyone looking to get a better estimation of this film.

Some might find this film a little slow as it is a very long film but I found it good character/story building and was engrossed.
This isn't the calibre of Braveheart (but what is) and I did find that the scenes with Bruce and his betrothed wife was missing that real spark.
The action scenes were fairly gory and sometime missing some one on one hard fought battles but overall where very good battle scenes.Most definitely worth a watch!",Outlaw King

This is not his story or his heritage. NetFlix would have been better off with a lead who understands to his core what the story is about. Compared to The Last Kingdom, The Outlaw King lacks passion. I like Chris Pine in his other work, but this production reminds me of Robin Hood with Kevin Costner. Great cast, but the lead was miscasted.",Outlaw King

Aymer de Valence actually blew that battle. Does it matter that Edward finally confronted Robert at the Battle of Bannockburn 7 years later and did escape the field in the face of a complete defeat? Even if you ignore the historical inaccuracies and timelines, Outlaw King still adds up to kind of a ""blah"".

I was even more excited to see he wasn't portrayed like in the autrociously inaccurate film Braveheart. Like any movie, this movie isn't shot for shot historically accurate, but many of the plot points are in line to what actually happened. As historical and war movies go, this film is on the right end of the spectrum.My only gripe is how narrowly focused this movie is. Robert is a fascinating historical figure and one of the greatest guerilla warfare tacticians ever. The climax of the movie involves the Battle of Loudoun Hill and ends after that. There is many fascinating events that took place that wasn't a part of the story. At two hours, I can see why some things weren't included, but if Braveheart can steal 3 hours of my life...Chris Pine nailed the role; Nothing flamboyant or over the top. His calm and often quiet appearance spoke volumes to the tone of the film.

375,isacasauras,Hmm,4,21 September 2021,120 million dollars 5 writers. I really wanted to enjoy this but I seriously struggled with the what seemed to be a lack of complexity to story. Legitimacy to history was over artistically used backed by a poor effort of structure. I could hardly get past an hour before I gave up. Rushed acts and poorly knitted together plot continued to bore me. With incredible sets and huge detail to costume and technical shots I tried to continue. With so much history on these times it's a shame so little detail was put into the rushed twists and climaxes of acts. If you want to see some lovely artistic shots and stabbing to speed up the story and seemingly try to make it exciting you're in the right place. But this script needs a re-work.,Outlaw King
376,petyadpa,Personal opinion - the movie is no good,3,1 February 2021,"1. Chris Pine's fake accent.. it's good that he doesn't have that much lines in the movie though.
2. The story of Robert the Bruce is so intriguing, so captivating and yet, the movie doesn't seem to relay that feeling. It's a story better suited for a mini series than a single movie alone( maybe in a sequel..). Why's Robert's claim to the throne so strong, how about James Stewart,Robert Wishart.. so much is misplaced and even missing from the story. For someone who's not familiar with the history, the movie could be a way to kill some time, but for me it was just an irritating story that with the only good parts being the shots of Scotland.",Outlaw King

It seems to be the fashion these days to use actors who are not native to the character they are playing but the Scotts accent is not any easy one to do so again, why.Historically the research could have been better. Greek fire (used at the start of the film to bombard a castle) was never used by the English, ever.

One thing sure as heck isn't up and flying, and that's the lovemaking writing. It's a 137 minute film and it's pace is faster than Usain Bolt. Somehow the writers managed to pace the movie outrageously fast and still have space for some ""we-have-ten-pages-left-and-not-enough-story""-one-liners. Let me take you through some examples:
""We're stuck!"" Idendeed you're and I have eyes.
""It's an ambush!"" No lovemaking faeces.
""Douglas, Douglas, Douglas [...] Have you been told that he screamed a name?""If you look away for a second a prominent character will have fathered, some children and died of old age.

I think this could have been a very good series or event series to develop the timeline and flesh out certain events (such as John Comyn's betrayal), but this movie feels hollow.There are also a few production flaws: flimsy, floppy broadswords; Chris Pine's inconsistent accent; goofy, exploding CG blood.",Outlaw King
414,rgdw,Directors Cut Please,6,9 November 2018,"This film has so much potential, the scenery is stunning and the acting was strong (Pugh, in particular was excellent). The problem with this film is that it felt far too rushed. The scene with the queen's declaration of love after barely establishing a relationship between the characters on screen showcasing this problem.I'd love to see the full directors cut. It seems Director David McKenzie has been caught out by perhaps trying to appeal to the masses by cutting around 30 mins from the original screening in Toronto, following heavy criticism from the film critics. Critics often get it wrong, without proper screen testing it seems like a knee jerk reaction has been taken, which is a shame.Hopefully he releases a directors cut, the full, as intended Toronto screening, or a longer version of what has been released on Netflix, I would like to see if that solves the pacing issues, and if so, this could easily move up a couple of points on the rating.",Outlaw King

Keeping the same facial expression for over two hours of film is not acting. It's lazy. He lacked the same intensity Mel Gibson brought to to the role of William Wallace. Yes, his Scottish accent was far better than Gibson's, but he did not have the stature to play the man who was powerful enough to cleaver Sir Henry de Bohun's head in two.

And it was, indeed, it seems like the director didn't even bother to Google the battle, or worse, just didn't care the historical fact, because he wanted 500 men to defeat 3000 heavy riders in open battle in his film.Also, I'm sure Christ Pine put in tons of effort into this production, but he is just not the best choice for this role.",Outlaw King

It appears as though the director was hoping that people would not notice the total lack of character development and would take the distraction bait dangled (literally) by Pine's nudity and the overindulgent scenes of violence.

Unfortunately, it presents such a simple black-and-white scenario. On top of that, the characters are uninteresting and I felt no emotional attachment to any of them. Robert the Bruce being the dullest one of them all. He does things or refrains from doing things without any explanation. We never get to know him or any of his inner workings. It's difficult to fathom why anyone would follow such a bland man with so little of a commanding presence.Time and again, I noticed myself cringing at Pine's attempt at a Scottish accent. It was distracting and together with his American looks and unnuanced acting only added to him standing out in a bad way. It was Billy Howle in fact, who managed to shine just that little bit in a few scenes. Still, the character insights were practically non-existent, and the pacing was just terrible.

So some of the costumes might be a bit too new-looking. I'm no expert so TBD.The problem is that the story is pretty boring and linear. I'm sure it must have been traumatic to live through it but as a spectator, knowing that Bruce will eventually win, I find the lack of character development, of dramatisation and, ironically enough, the lack of gross inaccuracies (a la Braveheart) boring. IMHO, a series like Rome, by focusing on unknown characters and free to reimagine their interactions with known events, allow for far more entertainment while remaining relatively true to history.So, yeah, great effort, points for general and specific medieval accuracy but fail at the main mission of a movie : entertainment.",Outlaw King

436,ccflan,Surprisingly Good,9,14 September 2018,"I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival and was not expecting great things. Full disclosure, I thought Braveheart was idiotic and was expecting another Hollywood movie full of anachronisms, bad history and over the top performances. To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it gore and all and it deserves to be seen on a big screen to do its epic scope justice. The Scottish countryside is spectacular as are the battle scenes. The film takes some liberties with history, changing the timeline a little or merging characters and events, but generally the changes work to heighten the dramatic conflicts. Outlaw King tries bravely to lay out the complexities of the Scottish war of independence and the shifting alliances but some of the characters will get lost in the mix for those unfamiliar with the actual story. Aaron Taylor Johnson stands out as James Douglas, and Stephen Dillane is at his Stannis Baratheon best as Edward I. Florence Pugh made her relatively small role as Robert's wife stand out with the intensity of her performance. The soundtrack is haunting and music is used to excellent effect. In one scene where the Bruce has has suffered a devastating personal loss Chris Pine says nothing but begins to sing a traditional Scottish lament and the other men join in, which expresses far more emotion than any dialogue could, especially as he sings so well that he would be welcome at any ceilidh. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth watching? Definitely yes, preferably on a big screen.",Outlaw King

442,kkirk-81764,Netflix goes to Hollywood,7,9 November 2018,"With the struggles Robert the Bruce faced over many years and against all odds, his story is difficult to tell in only 2hrs. It therefore makes you wonder when so much more could have been added, coupled with some major historical ommissions that defined Bruce as a king and Scotland as a nation, that Netflix for once chose not to make a historical series, mini or otherwise, which might have done Bruce's story justice and been just as entertaining and dramatic as many other of their historical series based on fiction.To the film itself, apart from the obvious fact that the actual Battle of Bannockburn was fought on a much grander scale than the Gangs of New York style skirmish portayed in the film, the medieval battle scenes were impressive. However, as has been said elsewhere, the characters are poorly depicted and again no mention at all of Edward Bruce, who must again be wondering what he did wrong in being one his brother's main lieutenants and arguably the reason that Bannockburn happened at all, not to at least deserve a cameo role.While accepting that any movie based on historical events is at the mercy of artistic freedom, and which it only ever can be, it should still be incumbent on the producers to at least stick to the generally accepted version of events. Although not on such as grand a scale as Braveheart, historical facts have been distorted, particularly the storyline and events concerning the main battle itself. A reasonable yarn nonetheless, albeit very abridged.",Outlaw King
443,ORDO-AB-CHAO,Where were the Templars?,9,9 November 2018,"Both accurate and exceptionally well shot with beautiful period timepieces. But it misses the vital part about the Bruce meeting emigrating Knights Templars on Icolmkill (Iona island), when he was on the run from the English. How else did he come back to Scotland with plenty of galleys and win every single battle, using techniques he learnt from the Flemish inner circle of Templars? Another nice touch would have been the legend of Braveheart, which every Douglas family to this day has on their crest. That is, when the Bruce died, Douglas took his heart in an locket on crusade to the Middle East. They were ambushed and Douglas threw his heart into the battle, shouting ""Onward Braveheart, and Douglas shall follow..."" That is the real story of Braveheart, not the one in that other movie.... Read Ordo Ab Chao, Templar Blood for the real fascinating story....",Outlaw King

British actors given good roles and a chance to prove themselves on screen? $120 million spent well???Well you won't find any of that in this film.The concept is exciting. We follow Robert The Bruce, a Scottish Lord with ties to the crown having been on the defeated end of a civil war. After witnessing a quartered piece of famed rebel, William Wallace wages an epic war on the English to reclaim Scotland.However the way it is carried out it just... annoyingly bad. First off, the cast. We have Chris Pine (an american) plays Robert the Bruce and what I don't understand is the fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of British, white, male actors in the world. So why tf did they pick and American who can barely do a Scottish accent to play a famed Scottish hero?Florence Pugh falls a bit flat in this. She was good in Lady Macbeth (which I recommend over this), but seems to have only one face in her films. Evryone else apart from these two is fine, but they way some of them are portraying their characters is just... bizarre. The characters ruin this and make it unrealisitc.I agree with another review that this would have been better as a mini series, not a 2 hour film. Due to the fact it was a film it is edited rather poorly, scenes seem to jump randomly to the next one woth no transitions etc. Just right into it, I guess to save... time?The ending is the most disappointing thing in the world. Like getting a handjob from a girl and getting a call from a relative mid tug. I read what was supposed to have happened in the battle. None of that applies here apparently. It ends on a very weird cliff hanger and no one important dies except for a weird scrawny, emotional looking teenager who has some significance but no background/context to his appearance and none of the characters care that he gets speared by the main antagonist in the chest.This movie just sucks.

461,markludas,Braveheart for stupid people,4,1 December 2018,"I was excited to see a period drama that essentially continues the story of ""Braveheart"" show up on Netflix. However, based on recent historical and biopic films that try to be all things to all people at the expense of depth and humanity, I kept my hopes at bay. And I'm glad I did.
This movie suffers from wooden dialogue (""I'm a damned man."" ""Lower her down."") and endless battlefield order dialogue that does nothing but explain what the film is incapable of showing, or what it thinks the audience may not understand. Similarly, characterization is extremely shallow, and Robert's character is no exception. We see and hear virtually nothing that would inspire someone to fight a war for him. In addition, his first few actions, such as agreeing not to fight Valence on a Sunday, only to be horrifically ambushed later, almost demonstrate his ineptitude. Unlike William Wallace in ""Braveheart,"" he doesn't inspire or dominate at all. It is not that Chris Pine's characterization or presence is, of itself, weak. It is just that we don't see Robert actually DO anything inspiring or awesome, but rather things happen TO him. This lack of competence plagues others characters' developments as well.
As an example of a missed opportunity: there is a scene at the end when the dying Scottish boy gives Robert his crown, and the king looks into the boy's eyes as the latter passes into the next life. This shot, powerful on its own, would've been actually poignant if we ever got to know who this boy was or, more importantly, why he was inspired to fight for Robert. But we aren't. All we are given is an image, nearly devoid of content. This is the entire film, practically.
Along the same lines, Robert and his men are absolutely obliterated within the first third or half of the movie, long before we have gotten to know and care about either him or them. It is generally a mistake to saddle the protagonist with terrific challenges early in the film; it shouldve happened in the middle, after some successes. Perhaps the filmmakers were hueing closely to historical facts, but unfortunately it makes for an underwhelming trajectory.
Moments of extreme violence, perpetrated by good guys and bad guys alike, as well as an early sex scene, occur before we have really been given much context or characterization. Rather than incompetence on the part of the filmmakers, this appears to be more of an effort to make a movie for people who like gratuitous sex and violence rather than audiences seeking actual subtlety or historical perspective.
Without a doubt, ""Outlaw King"" has unbelievably gorgeous costumes and sets, and much good photography. Chris Pine is earnest and trying his best. Additionally, he is extremely handsome. But even his piercing blue eyes can't save this film from the grip of mediocrity, thrust upon it by the Netflix-enforced necessity for mass appeal. It would have been nice if it was a strong, rich, character-driven historical drama, but it was not meant to be.",Outlaw King
462,jkmclaughlin,Real historical event were not done justice in an otherwise fun and brutal film,8,7 December 2018,"This is a story I have been waiting for years to be told on film. Outlaw King is an entertaining film with some great acting and visceral grounded cinematography, but feels like the story is far too cramped into it's screen time. A mini series would have been more suited to the complex and incredible true story. The film premiere on Netflix further highlights the lost potential of longer form story telling.The gritty portrayal of 14th century Britain and of battle was fantastic. However much was lost from the true story. The narrative of the film was oddly less ridiculous than the incredible stories of the real historical characters.
Two particular events that would make incredible scenes in film that were missed out are:
At the start of battle of Bannockburn (the real event that won the war) an English Knight seeking glory charged at the Scottish line before the Battle begun while King Robert was giving a speech to his troops. The Bruce pretended not to notice the sound of charging hooves but at the last moment the dodged the knights lance and turned in his saddle to decapitate the Knight with an axe. King Robert's axe cracked in half with the impact and is now displayed in a glass case in the museum on the site of the battle.Another incredible true story would have perhaps not have been believable. The Black Douglas, who was portrayed incredibly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in this film, in real life single handedly took Edinburgh Castle from the occupying English army, by freehand climbing the cliffs and the walls to sneak in at night and then unlocking the gate from the inside.An entertaining film overall with a strong performance by Chris Pine and a stand out contribution by Aaron Taylor-Johnson.
