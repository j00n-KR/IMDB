0,JvH48,"Shows heroic activism bringing risks for family, friends and bystanders. Also shows activists and counter forces both employ equally nasty techniques to achieve their goals",8,7 January 2020,"Saw this at the Berlinale 2019, where it was part of the official Competition, for some reason marked ""out of competition"" hence no candidate for awards. Entertaining, despite the troubles I have with heroism as demonstrated here, implying ample risks for family, friends and accidental bystanders. Of course, such downsides of activism can all be deemed collateral damage, regrettable but necessary and unavoidable for The Cause (with capitals). When countering activists, The Powers that Be (TPtB) go to every imaginable length, often much further than we see here, to achieve their goal of fighting ""terrorists"", thereby disregarding the sacrafices and aftermath they cause on their turn. Escalation on both sides lurks around the corner, bearing logical and unavoidable consequences.Having said that, the fights and the successive phases the struggle gets into, are visualized very well in this movie. There are enough recognizable protagonists to feel along with the activists. A point this movie makes very well is that we are invited to reciprobably feel along with those tasked to fight them. Both parties use every means to their disposal, whereby the anti-revolutionaries are just a bit nastier than the revolutionaries. The revolutionaries may have our sympathy given the overreach of power coming from the state, but to throw a bomb into a police station or a government building, as we saw happening, is a sure way to kill innocent people. So, the activists are only marginally less nasty than their enemies who incarcerate, torture and kill as standard tools-of-the-trade to achieve their goal.History may have proven these activists correct in hindsight. We, fully aware of the outcome, can easily be convinced that the activists were indeed Good, and those fighting them were Bad (or at least Ugly). There are similar issues with the WW II period when judging people afterwards. More than one perfect illustration of this phenomenon can be seen in the movie Never Look Away / Werk Ohne Autor (2018), written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It makes us inspect our current opinions: who is with-us or against-us or something in between. Initially, the genre label ""Action"" on IMDB was too limited, but it is deservedly replaced later by ""Action Drama History"", as the movie has more to show than just heroic activism.All in all, thought provoking elements embedded in the story make this movie more interesting than reading the synopsis did assume beforehand. Each coin has two sides. Who is ""good"" is only clear in hindsight, which is easy for us but not that easy at the time. On the other hand, a superficial viewer can easily be lured into the trap of heroism from the side of the activists, and dismiss the reactionary forces as bad or even criminal. Such rapid conclusions do not show this movie the respect it deserves.",Marighella
1,pedro380085,Excellent long movie depicting Brazilian military regime,9,17 October 2021,"A great movie, written with great actors and scenes.Wagner Moura is becoming a very fine person of the arts in Brazil, moving from very early successful action movies such as Elite Squad and starting to create always movies that show critical thinking in its best form.Ratings can be lower due to a political issue in Brazil where most reviewers were right wing voters automating low reviews on the platform. I believe the actual rating would be something between 6 and 8.The question when watching this movie is not whether you are left or right, but understand if you can be open minded to review critical thinking from a different point of view, its different perspectives and depiction of reality as it was played in real life.The movie action scenes are well acted out and exciting, they providing some entertaining moments through the almost 3 hour long flick.I recommend this movie to everyone that wants to learn more about a critical moment of the Brazilian recent history.",Marighella
2,david-brun,"Great movie, rating affected by far right Brazilian raters",10,12 May 2021,"This is a great movie, an eye opening bio-pic detailing the story of this controversial figure in recent Brazilian history.It's full of historían approved data, biographically irrefutable events, a story that makes sense from beginning to end and an amazing cast delivering great interpretations and emotions.Now, how come the low score? Well, that's because of the political situation in Brazil, the divisiveness between left and right, with a far right ex-military president who actually defends the dictatorship against which Marighella fought and was a victim of. His supporters come here, without even having watched the movie, since way before the movie was officially released, and trash it in the reviews.I'm giving it a 10/10 to help raise its score, but truthfully it might actually deserve something like an 8/10, because it does suffer from some overly emotional or dramatic parts that most Brazilian movies do.Still, a great movie worthy watching.Think about it: If it raised such an enormous response, that far right supporters had to come and trash it on the reviews, like little keyboard activists, there's something there...",Marighella
3,aldias-93620,Lost hours,1,11 November 2021,"Well then... after watching the movie, I could only feel the regret of the hours spent in the endeavor.The film boils down to just an ego trip of a weak production, showered with less than brilliant acting, a weak plot and messy editing.It is just a highly pretentious film, which uses the political pamphlet robe to mask its truth as a film.",Marighella
4,socarrasjorge,An important story passionately told,10,28 February 2020,"This is an important story in the history of Brazil, passionately told via expert filmmaking and excellent actors. It's brutal at times because we know that the horrible acts perpetrated in the film really happened, and that there are those who would silence the film even now makes it more important that it be seen. A remarkable film on all accounts.",Marighella
5,hztomassi,"Good cinematography, poor history lesson",2,8 November 2021,"The movie is based on historical events, but the screenplay tuns out to be biased and distorted in favor of a specific political view. It was an wasted opportunity to tell a dense and interesting period of Brazilian history, if unbiased and properly made.",Marighella
6,augustodorval,"Good movie, but lacks contextualization",7,5 November 2021,"Marighella, despite Seu Jorge's brilliant interpretation, seems like a character suspended in the air; the Brazilian situation and the dictatorship that he was fighting, a fine background, almost unimportant. The acts of the guerrilla and his organization, the Ação Libertadora Nacional (ALN), seem self-motivated, as do those of repression. And so, the film about Marighella thus becomes an action thriller of heroes against villains, without historical support for the heroism of some and the villainy of others: they are on opposite sides, but their reasons are hardly touched. This ""hang in the air"" is also notable in the ideological field. There are several references to communism, it's true - but almost always from repression, in the form of insult, and almost never from the guerrillas, who only describe themselves as ""communists"" at the beginning of the film, when Marighella confronts a member of the "" The party"".It is also notable that the guerrillas - who in real life suffered defeats, it is true - hardly have their victories explored in the film; they are constantly up against the wall, trying desperately to react and being crushed, almost as if martyrdom is for the guerrillas a choice, not a possibility. The exception is the takeover of Radio Nacional, but events like the kidnapping of Ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick, for which 15 political prisoners living under torture were released, are just another brushstroke of the background. This made the ALN seem like a small group, completely cut off from the masses (which do not exist in the film, except as an expectation, a dream of Marighella) and from the political disputes that, despite the dictatorship, unfold in the country. Anyone watching the film cannot imagine that, in 1968, the ALN had at least 50 militants in São Paulo (not to mention other states), that it carried out agitation and propaganda actions among the masses and that it still had some inherited bases of PCB (Brazilian communist party), especially between metallurgists and railways.From a strictly artistic point of view, Marighella is a great movie. In addition to exquisite photography, interesting shots and an exciting soundtrack, there are sensitive details in the choice of actors - shepherd Henrique Vieira as Friar Fernando, for example, or Maria Marighella, the guerrilla's granddaughter, playing his first wife. However, none of this reverses the fact that the script leaves Marighella's story still untouched in the list of ""stories that history will someday tell"", just when, perhaps, we most needed it well told.Review adapted from: Histórias que a História qualquer dia contará: Crítica de ""Marighella"", Revista Opera, by Pedro Marin.",Marighella
7,mrcnalin,One of The Most Important Brazilian History,9,13 May 2021,"The movie shows a terrible part of Brazilian history. A coup that removed human civil rights, democracy, press independence, and mainly, the right of the people of deciding who should be the leader of the country, and other damages for 21 years that we still feeling up to now with the fascist Bolsonaro´s Government. The coup received support from the US as showed by the movie that financed other dictatorships by Latin America in the '60s and '70s. Marighella led the resistance against the dictatorship and he had a big importance in Brazilian history.",Marighella
8,tvaz,"Amazing movie, too bad for those who can't stand with their own history",10,27 October 2019,"As I'm writing this short review I see that it has more than 40k votes already, most of them giving 1 star for this master piece. And the movie hasn't even been released in Brazil!!This just shows how good this movie is! Recent far-right political movements in Brazil can't tolerate the truth about their own history of oppression, torture and murder against those who fought against their coward coup on the 60's.Marighella is a must see. And that for many reasons: it's a great movie per si! It's original, dense, poetic, emotional. It completely destroys the current fake narrative of a ""revolution"" by the army at that time, inviting people to call back all that political mess by its real name: a bloody dictatorship.",Marighella
9,alextanischang,Old fashioned biopic made with conviction and passion,10,9 February 2021,"My guess is many among us reviewers on this title don't usually leave review, and are prompted to do so feeling this swarm of 1-point reviews so unjustified that we have to react.
This film is not perfect, not immune to typical shortcomings seen in biopic. However, I admire and enjoy its passion and conviction, also agreeing its message especially just to counter hooligans like Bolsanaro, just to this minimal degree.",Marighella
10,felipefeper,Great movie,10,3 November 2021,An important film that tells facts that many people try to erase. Films like Marighella remind us of the atrocities of the Brazilian Dictatorship and bring a past that we must never forget so that it will never be repeated.(Rate was affected by brazilian far-right raters).,Marighella
11,ndfilho,"Wagner Moura and Seu Jorge, two formidable actors, but the film doesn't tell the true story.",3,4 November 2021,"The movie tries to distort the image of the terrorist by making him a hero. Sells that the terrorist Marighella's objectives were commendable, that he only wanted to free Brazilians from oppression, so that their barbarities could be justified.The truth is that Marighella did fight against the military regime, being part of the ALM, a terrorist group that faced the military, but not with the intention of establishing a democracy so that we could choose our rulers through the vote, but for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, along the lines of Cuba and North Korea.Marighella has also written a book called MANUAL DO GUERRILHEIRO URBANO (The Minimanual of the Urban Guerilla), which teaches the use of violence and terror, with detailed instructions on how to carry out ambushes, summary executions, robberies, bombings and also kidnappings.He excelled in the murder of members of the armed forces as well as members of the US government who were in Brazil, which made him a killer psychopath and not a ""controversial hero"" as the film tries to sell.Many people died or disappeared during the military regime, most of them misdemeanours, terrorists and spies who wanted to take power, but the movie fails to mention that half of them were killed by the revolutionaries themselves. Guerrillas who died at the hands of the guerrillas. Marighella himself executed in cold blood the ""traitors of the movement"".Another important point: Marighella was not a black man but a white man.",Marighella
12,joaommds,"as a brazilian, that's so UNBELIEVABLY relatable to me",10,11 May 2021,"Revolutionary people during a repressive dictorship are thought as terrorists by most of brazilians, and torturers are glorified, and faced no consequences when the country became a democracy, that's the context we are in here in Brazil.If you didn't watch this movie, and saw the bad ratings here, bear in mind that this movie was pretty much censored in Brazil, YEAH a movie about the dictorship being CENSORED, it couldn't be aired on theaters because of the actual right-wing extremist government, its supporters made a collective kinda ""protest"" against the movie, and had rated it pretty low without even seeing it, now the movie's leaked and everyone should watch it, it's very important to Brazil, and democracy. Give it a try, the acting is perfect, the photography is amazing and the movie is touching and heartbreaking.",Marighella
13,karenkgs,"Great movie, makes you learn and reflect a lot.",10,11 June 2019,"This movie is really good, I watched it at Sydney Film Festival and it had a full room, everyone applauded at the end.
This movie tells about the true history of Brazil and it's really a punch to make us think and learn more.",Marighella
14,thaisbignardi,"Don't fall for the 1 star review bs, this movie is solid",10,4 November 2019,"An incredible motion picture, based on the story, and political trajectory of the Brazilian national hero Marighella. Soundtrack and photography are incredible, an overall masterpiece by the director Wagner Moura. It's really ridiculous that some user reviews are dictatorship-worshiper-far-right motivated. The movie was censored in Brazil, making very unlikely that these users actually watched the movie. Don't believe the hype!",Marighella
15,luaninha_nascimento,marsterpiece,10,9 May 2021,"I'm brazillian, and this film being censored in here just proves that it was too powerful, could make people react against the government of Jair Bolsonaro.

16,laryssaracquell,"It's ok if a film is not committed to reality, the problem is to romanticize the acts of a terrorist.",1,8 November 2021,"Extremely problematic movie. I feel bad for those saying this movie is educative, because it's a complete lie. I'd rate this 0 if I could, because it is insane how much Wagner Moura wants to make Marighella looks like this ""national heroic figure"", when in reality he was just a despicable terrorist.",Marighella
17,amandasduarte-61959,👏 Bravo,10,28 October 2021,"Loved this movie! Well done Wagner Moura, the cast and crew were brilliant 👏 I truly recommend this film for those who like to know the truthful side of Marighella's story.",Marighella
18,aamalovini-84206,"Very well done film, about the military dictatorship in Brazil.",7,3 November 2021,"I didn't know anything about the dark history of Brazil and the film does a good job on presenting a very complex character, and the people around him, on a bloody flight for resistance. In the intention to bring democracy back to the country!The film cinematography is beautiful, and the sound is incredible. The film could do with some extra editing, as it's feels too long. They're very impressive dramatic scenes, but there's also some very unnecessary ones.Overall it's a very well done film. A deep look at how violent and horrifying a dictatorship look like!",Marighella

21,andrecalle,Among the most captivating films I have watched in my life!!!,10,5 November 2021,"Captivating, brilliantly executed, spot on!For those who wish to understand Brazil's past of repression and see it's parallels up until this day, you must watch this movie.Wagner Moura, the production and cast fought against all odds, more specifically the B...onaro government and it followers in order to make this Jewel possible.Two years ago the Ministry of Culture in Brazil was dismantled and became a small office subject to the ministry of Tourism! Almost all the funding for projects, films and so on was cut by federal government. The head of the office, the secretary of culture, walks through the office with a gun in his waist.I have no idea how they pulled this off...What an incredible movie!",Marighella
22,juliana_brasil,Very important to watch on Bolsonaro era,10,5 November 2021,"I am Brazilian, watched this movie at the movie theater and was very touched by this masterpiece. There were times I cried. Wagner Moura did an excellent job showing how it was like the dictatorship my parents lived in and actors were perfect. Unfortunately the current government thinks it is good what happened here in 1964 and many of Jair Bolsonaro's supporters are coming to this website to give this movie a bad review. Don't fall for it! The movie is great and very important to watch on this terrible Bolsonaro era. It shows how cruel the government can be.",Marighella
23,fdjcristina,It's amazing!,10,7 November 2021,The movie shows a very important story about the fight against the Brazilian government in the 80s. It's really breathtaking and makes you want to research about Marighella even more after you leave the cinema!,Marighella
24,materialestudoalexandre,best Brazilian film in recent years,10,7 November 2021,Great Moviie it portrays the state fascism and part of the society of this country that lives and lived in cowardice in the face of these murderers. Portrays the ills of an extremely racist country.,Marighella
25,cinthiasgama,A punch in the stomach - Great film 👏🏻,10,7 November 2021,"A truly history about Brazilian dictatorship. Wagner Moura's movie is brilliant. This movie shows events in the dictatorship time that are being repeated with the current government. Unfortunately, it's true and sad.",Marighella
26,doublecaliel,The story changed a lot... Starting with the actor...,1,8 November 2021,"Reality escapes, sequential attempts to change the viewer's opinion in a basically unimaginative way.Totally fleeing from reality, the biography is lacking, unreality from beginning to end.I was left with the feeling of having been deceived... Or with the attempt to deceive me. I wanted to see a gangster movie showing the rottenness that is an environment experienced by the character. Not a lot of unreality.I didn't like it.Sorry, try again.",Marighella
27,lagedinho,Great movie,10,9 November 2021,"It is worth it. Nice potograpty, just great actings and treats this period of the Brasil history whitout fantasy. In my opinion, Wagner Moura could just show us a little of the Marighella life before the begining of the dictatorship.But its a great movie though. Go for it.",Marighella
28,ddanesi,Great movie: hero or anti-hero its a matter of point of view,9,10 November 2021,"Great movie. So good acting. Usually, this theme leads to a kind of politicized youth cinematography. It's not the case. Politics, of course, is what drives the real story and director's narrative. Despite that it's a film about love, surrender, convictions and how it creates parallel universes. It is also a narrative about the struggle for convictions and the consequences. How this fight can creates a very tinny line between heroes and anti-heroes and how its passions move you between heroic surrender and immoral acts. At the same time, it challenges you to think about how subjugated minorities can face the horror of oppressors.",Marighella
29,sellaro,One of a kind in so many aspects,8,22 December 2019,"This movie is one of a kind in so many aspects. First, it tells an important story about a movement that resisted the dictatorship in Brazil from 1964 to 1985.Sadly, it is also remarkable by being one of the first movies target in this new cyberwarfare sponsored by the alt-right in Brazil. The movie has a few reviews in IMDB (written by actual people), yet it has a very low score. The score has less to do with the quality of the film, and more with the story it tells. It bothers a lot of fundamentalists in the far-right in Brazil to have a movie that tells an uncomfortable truth about the recent history of an authoritarian country that tries hard to portray itself as a nation of kindness and liberty.",Marighella
30,vana-vana-vana,"Must watch, specially during the current Brazilian political crisis",10,12 June 2019,"Had the pleasure of watching this movie during 2019's Sydney Film Festival, followed by a Q&A with director Wagner Moura.Even though it's a long film (2h35), it keeps you on the edge of your set for the entire time. Extremely well written and a fenomenal effort from first time director Wagner Moura, ""Marighella"" manages to draw a bit of laughter despite dealing with heavy and dark subjects (the brazilian dictatorship years).Seu Jorge, as per usual, gives the audience a fantastic performance, overshadowing weak and tacky acting from some of his peers, like Bruno Gagliasso.Moura made the conscious decision of focusing the narrative on the characters personal nuances and lives, instead of delving into historical details about the dictatorship period. The director had the help of Marighella's relatives during the production.""Marighella"" also invites us to reflect about the use of violence during revolutions - is it or is it not necessary? Can we really be the judges of that?The last scene of the movie gave me shivers. In Brazil's current grim political and social crisis, this movie is an absolute must watch for everyone who still denies the horrors of totalitarian regimes.",Marighella

32,joana-pedroso15,"Amazing movie, educative and instructive",10,22 May 2021,This is my first IMDB review ever and I am doing because the fact that this movie has a rating of 3.4 and was still not exhibited in brazilian cinemas (current time: May 2021) is an act of censorship.The movie had excellent acting and was educative about the revolutionairy life of Marighella. I did not know about him and I am glad I watched this movie. It's not only about the story of fighter who is willing to give his life for a cause. It's about a BLACK educated fighter grandson of slaves.Viewer from Portugal.,Marighella

Unfortunate, due to ignorant people that put idealism in front of reality, Science and world's history and, of course, Jair Bolsonaro's robots and fake profiles, it has a low rate.

The movie has its limitations for sure, it alternate good and not so good scenes and actuations, but for a country where cinema isn't take seriously, the movie is overall pretty good. The fella who gave it one star and said Wagner moura need directing classes clearly doesn't understand anything about cinema. I'd give it 7 stars but after seeing the amount of low ratings that were giving to this movie without even an review I couldn't help my self to give it a 10.",Marighella

Set in the dark ages of the Brazilian dictatorship of the 1960s and 70s, Moura's debut film shows a defying look at a historic figure that set the tone to the armed resistance against the violent and bloody regime that took over the country and rears its ugly head again 60 years later.A must-see.",Marighella
42,Rvmmmm,"Poignant, relevant and necessary",10,19 November 2019,"It's not really a 10/10, but it's a gripping movie which tells an important story that is especially relevant in a world that is flirting more and more brazenly with fascism.For those who think this movie serves as propaganda, that is simply not the case. The main characters aren't glorified or lionized, at least not to the standards of the genre. They're distinctively human and they commit some terrible actions. Their flaws and mistakes aren't hidden, but they are given a context that allows you to comprehend the situation.The acting is stellar and it's very easy to forget that the main character is a well-known singer. In fact I found myself questioning several times whether it was really Seu Jorge, or if it was perhaps only his brother.I did feel like some scenes didn't flow that well into each other and that is my main criticism. The two and a half hours flew by very quickly due to how intense it is and I honestly wouldn't mind an even longer version that flows a bit more naturally.",Marighella

47,kansasnorton,Reasons not to see this movie,1,5 November 2021,"1- The director makes his debut in the wrong way, when dealing with important issues for Brazil. The historical and political portrait is ignored, to emphasize an agenda.2- The director gives up the historical truth to pursue the justification of a Latin American utopia, ignoring and hiding important facts of history.3- Seu Jorge's worst performance, which ends up portraying a man who doesn't exist, being the pure result of his director's imagination. Man in real life is not portrayed with his true nature.4-4- The poor public reception of the film demonstrates the crisis of Brazilian cinema, which since the 1960s has moved away from the public and started to portray the people in a caricature way, with a lack of imagination and an attempt to create a type of Nouvelle Vague tropical.5-The political polemics surrounding the film is a demonstration of the worst deformity of Brazilian cinema. In Brazil there is no cinema market. Most of the industry
it is financed by the high taxes levied by the state. People don't see the movies, but they pay for the industry's movement.6-The portrayal of the film's facts is a cultural point of view of political parties and terrorist movements that have produced the culture in the country in the last 70 years. There was no space to produce a creative and sustainable cinema. With the advent of new technologies, the film seems to want to maintain the hegemony of ideas and prevent any kind of questioning about the country's history.",Marighella
