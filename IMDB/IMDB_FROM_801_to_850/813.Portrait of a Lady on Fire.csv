0,MartinHafer,"Too artsy and slow....and the relationship, sadly, seemed unreal.",6,23 October 2019,"""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is not a film for everyone. After all, it's about lesbianism in the 18th century and not everyone is excited about seeing such a picture. As for me, I applaud the lesbian subject matter....but I think the film itself left much to be desired.The film clearly is intended as an 'art film'. In other words, instead of telling a story in a normal way, it's very, very slow and deliberate....too slow. Oddly, however, despite the glacial pacing, when it comes to the relationship between the two women is the opposite. They go from not even talking to each other to lovers...and you cannot help but think something is missing. There is simply little chemistry or joy between the pair.Overall, the film could have been very good. Instead, it just looks nice but that's really about all there is to it. Worth seeing? Perhaps...but far from a must-see.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

In so profound sense than you can not explain , in fair way, this kind of beauty. An island, portrait behind wedding, love, dance, fires in different senses, memories and admirable cinematography.

2,boblipton,What Women Do When Men Aren't Watching,6,16 February 2020,"When Noémie Merlant arrives to paint Adèle Haenel's portrait so a prospective groom can look her over, Mlle. Merlant is informed she is the second portrait artist hired. Mlle. Haenel refused to pose. As time goes on, the two ladies develop a challenging lesbian relationship, and a regard for the house's maid-of-all-work Luàna Bajrami, who initiates them into the local branch of la vecchia religione.There are some very good parts to this movie, but it seems fairly erratic to me, with no visual consistency - when you're doing a movie in which painting is a key point, that seems important to me, and given a look that wanders from 17th Century Flemish to 19th century Impressionism, with Mlle Merlant's portrait work looking like mid-20th Century portraiture, I am dissatisfied with that. For almost the entire length, there are only women to be seen. There seems to be the implication that this is what women get up to when men are around, in nunneries and garden clubs and such, instead of being thrust into domesticity, worrying about dinner and the kiddies, and isn't it terrible that women aren't given choices.Yes, it is. Judging by the IMDb rating (8.2 out of 10 on more than 15,000 votes) and Rotten Tomatoes rating of 98%, are we supposed to be impressed? Given such unanimity of opinion, can this be such a ground-breaking movie? Am I asking too much for a movie set in the 18th Century, concerning itself with a painter, to have the look of the movie - and of the paintings - reflect that?",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
3,Horst_In_Translation,La vie d'Adèle two centuries back,6,11 December 2019,"""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"" or ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a French movie from 2019 that is also almost exclusively in the French language, just 5 seconds of Italian or so on one occasion. Writer and director of these over 2 hours is Céline Sciamma, in France already a really established filmmaker, but this could turn out to be her international breakthrough because this film is really garnering awards recognition left and right on the entire planet and most recently the Golden Globes nominated it in the Best Foreign Language Feature category. And the prestigious Cannes Film Festival loved it too. This is a big success, especially as the film will not have a chance to get in at the Oscars at the Foreign Language Film category because France picked Les Misérables this year to represent the country, a film that by the way is nominated for a Foreign Language Golden Globe as well. But of course, this movie here does have Oscar chances in other categories, at least in terms of nominations. I think for the costume, cinematography and production design. We will see. I think it wouldn't be undeserving, but maybe it is still a bit of a long shot. However, one character's special green dress stays in the mind especially for me here, so maybe Costume is most likely or Cinematography because there some awards bodies nominated it already, more than for any other production aspect so far.Okay, now let's take a look at the film at hand in detail, especially in terms of the story. We have a young painter here who comes to a remote mansion and she has the task to make a painting of the young woman living there with her mother. The young woman does not want it though because she feels she is not at a good place in life right now and does not want it to be documented because she has to marry a man she doesn't love at some point in the near future. And she already chased away the previous painter because she would not give him a look at her face, let alone her smile. So quite a challenge. The woman thinks the new woman is there to provide her with some company during walks, but the truth is different and the central character (I think the painter is slightly more central than the young title character) has to paint the title character from her imagination. Well, this is only half the truth. After she is finished with the painting she tells her model what she did and gets a very negative reaction when she sees the painting, so bad that she destroys her own work immediately, which shows she thinks very highly of the other's opinion. However, to the surprise of the really unhappy mother of the title character (she initiated it all) all of a sudden she agrees to get drawn by the artist and they start from zero again, but this time on equal terms. From this moment on, however, the film moves further and further away from the painting idea. Instead we see the two spend time outside, take walks, play games also with the young servant and try to help the latter with her pregnancy. I must say that lead actress Merlant here sometimes looked a lot like a dark-haired Emma Watson to me and Haenel who I have seen in other films as well reminded me a bit of Léa Seydoux, which explains the reference I made in the title of my review. It is a lesbian drama. There are no explicit sex scenes in here of course, this clearly wasn't the time and century for that, but we see bare breasts here and there and it certainly helps the girls that the mother is out for days.There is also a frame to this movie. This frame takes place a few years later at an art gallery. We have a group of students paint the central character in an almost modern fashion and one of them found the painting referenced in the title and so the main character tells us the story behind it, although I really wonder if she was this explicit about her romantic relationship with the girl on fire. Anyway, just like with Adèle (not the Adèle in here) there is no happy ending here because time wasn't ready of course for the two being a couple. The final scene at the opera was pretty good though, even if maybe at the end the camera was a bit too long on Haenel's character. But it emphasized how hard she was struggling. She seemed to be deeply unhappy (despite being a mother) and her smile seemed forced and she also looked as if she had aged a lot unlike her painter. I would say that it was these specific scenes that made this film worth seeing. Another scene I remember fondly, maybe my favorite from the entire film, was the one when they talk about each other how nervousness, insecurity and anger showed in the other person, in the sense of through which physical signs like biting one's lip. This one was really well-written and well-acted. Sadly, the scene that includes the photo here on imdb as well as the title, namely the one where one character actually catches fire was not as memorable to me as I would have liked it to be. And I am also still undecided on the moments when the title character is a bit of an apparition to the main character. I initially did not like them, but when they see each other the very last time and she actually looks like this and is not an apparition anymore, this was a nice bit of closure.Finally, a few words on the visual side. I already said that there they did almost everything right. The cliffs on the island are haunting and I kept wondering if eventually the title character would also jump down, but like she says early she wants to courir and not mourir, so this was not an option for her it seems. Instead she lives an unhappy life as the wife of somebody she doesn't love as we find out at the end. The other central female character is luckier. And happier despite not being born into a wealthy family. Or maybe because of that? It would be exaggerated to call her emancipated or so, but you get the message. She has a better chance to follow her dream and live the life she aspires, even if obviously there are obstacles for her as well, just like there are to all homosexual people who lived during that time. You also hear about how she is not allowed to draw men, at least naked men. Speaking of men, there are virtually no male characters in this film at all until almost the end and those you see or hear about, like the guy who got the servant pregnant, the man the title character is supposed to marry and others are really no additions who bring happiness to any of the several female characters in this movie. I don't mind the absensce of men here. It makes sense story-wise, but you also need to be careful because I am sure feminists would advertize this film in the sense that it is a pro that there are (almost) no males, but it is just a fact and should not be said it is good or bad because this film is too good to be pulled down by anti-male propaganda. So yeah, overall I would not say it is one of the best films of the year, but a pretty good and enjoyable one that did not feel like 2 hours and that is always good. It needs to be said though that this is an extremely slow movie that lives through the artistry of the individual scenes and not through a lot happening. Honestly, in terms of the action you could have fit it into a 20-minute short film. Also I don't really like gender statements, but I feel this is a film that maybe women will appreciate more than men and gays more than straight people. Overall, it's a thumbs-up for me. Certainly worth seeing.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
4,classicsoncall,"""There are rules, conventions, ideas.""",8,4 August 2020,"When Marianne (Noémie Merlant) spoke those words to Heloise (Adèle Haenel), she could just as well have been describing the passionate nature of their relationship as much as the technique she used in painting Heloise's portrait. The film explores the romance that develops between two passionate women who due to their isolation on a remote island in France, experience a serene, yet potentially volatile connection that will surely terminate when Heloise must commit to an arranged marriage. Writer and director Céline Sciamma could have smoldered the story with graphic sexuality, but instead decided on a slow, methodical approach to bring the women to an understanding that might have endured in another time and place, but was destined to end in disappointment and sorrow. There was a moment in the film when the women studied the almost completed portrait, and Heloise asks how Marianne would know the painting was completed. It was a poignant moment, and Marianne's answer was a harbinger of their final moments together - ""At one point we stop"".",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
5,jboothmillard,Portrait of a Lady on Fire,8,21 December 2020,"When the new 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was released, which I had previously finished every title from, I had a feeling I had have a low number of new titles added to watch, and I was relieved there were only two, this French film was one of them. Basically, set near the end of the 18th century, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), a young painter, is teaching painting lessons in France. One of her students asks her about one of her paintings, Marianne calls it ""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"" (""Portrait of a Lady on Fire""). Years previously, Marianne arrives on a distant island in Brittany. She has been commissioned to paint the portrait of a young woman of the gentry named Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who is to be married off to a nobleman from Milan. Marianne is told by Héloïse's mother, The Countess (Valeria Golino), that her daughter has previously refused to pose for portraits, as she does not want to be married. Héloïse previously lived in a convent before the suicide of her older sister resulted in her return and her betrothal. Marianne acts as Héloïse's hired companion, to accompany her on daily walks along the rugged coastline. During these walks, Marianne tries to memorise Héloïse's features to be able to paint her in secret. Marianne does eventually finish the portrait but finds herself unable to betray Héloïse's trust and reveals her true reason for arriving. Marianne shows Héloïse the painting, she criticises it for not portraying her true nature, so Marianne smudges the face, destroying the work. Héloïse's mother is shocked when Héloïse says she is willing to pose for Marianne. Meanwhile, the Countess will be away over the next few days on the mainland. During this time, Marianne and Héloïse build a more intimate bond, reading stories, including Orpheus and Eurydice, and debating about it, and helping housemaid Sophie (Luàna Bajrami) have an abortion. Marianne is haunted throughout the house by visions of Héloïse in a wedding dress. One evening, Marianne, Héloïse and Sophie go to a bonfire gathering where women sing, during which Héloïse's dress briefly catches fire (inspiring the painting years later). The next day, Marianne and Héloïse, who have become much closer during the process of the painting, share their first kiss, and make love later that night. Over the next few days, their romance grows stronger. However, it is cut short by the inevitable return of Héloïse's mother, who approves of the now completed portrait. The evening before her departure, Marianne sketches a drawing of Héloïse to remember her, and Héloïse asks Marianne to draw a sketch of herself in her book on page 28. The next morning Marianne bids farewell; as she leaves, she hears Héloïse say, ""Turn around"", to which she turns to see Héloïse in her wedding dress. In the present, Marianne reveals that she saw Héloïse two more times. The first time was in the form of a portrait at an art exhibition, where Héloïse has her child beside her, and is holding a book showing the edge of page 28. The second time was at a concert in Milan, where Héloïse sat in a theatre balcony across from Marianne. Héloïse does not see Marianne as she observes her becoming overwhelmed with emotion and coming to tears. The orchestra play the Presto from ""Summer"" from Vivaldi's Four Seasons, the music that Marianne had played for her years before. Merlant as the beautiful, talented young artist and Haenel as the equally beautiful, troubled aristocrat bride-to-be both give splendid performances, and there is good support from Golino as the slightly scary mother and Bajrami as the amusing maid. It works really well as a story of a developing mutual attraction between the painter and her subject, and the countryside locations and the painting scenes are terrific. The subjects of suicide and abortion are hard-hitting, but with good pacing, great costumes and scenery, and an interesting unfolding story of passion (for art and a person), this is a most recommendable historical romantic drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
6,Quinoa1984,Portrait of a Filmmaker with Something to Say (I mean that as a compliment!),10,4 March 2020,"Well, that was.... incredibly satisfying (you thought I'd say lit, didn't you?)I don't know how long I could expound about how Portrait of a Lady on Fire completely took me in and made me awed by how writer/director Céline Sciamma slowly (and it may be too slow for some, certainly not for the majority of critics) develops this relationship between an artist and the figure of her focus, what it means for anyone with creative aspirations to open oneself and find what *you* see, with a laser focus, on how faces and eyes and bodies and just these two amazing women look at each other on screen - Merlant and Haenel have some of the most electric chemistry of any performers I've experienced in a film, it's that damn good - or how she has the bravery to bring in moments that may confound a little (that feast where all the women start singing a hymn or some type of song out of nowhere, leading to a practically literal representation of the title) and disturb (what happens with Sophie about two thirds of the way through somehow made me shocked by how simply Sciamma shows what happens to her), while her camera is so focused on getting us to see HOW art and that process needs time to develop when it comes down to the soul, but.... What I'll try to bottle up in this is to say this:You know the term ""Male Gaze"" when it comes to certain (a lot, too many) filmmakers? Sciamma showed me what the ""Female Gaze"" is like in all of its uncompromising hues. More importantly, this is just an artist with a vivid, sometimes surreal and harrowingly romantic point of view - not to mention, these two women are just staggering in what they're able to achieve here.It made me feel like I've seen the rebirth of the French New Wave - the New-New, more precisely. Ok, I'll stop now.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
7,CinemaSerf,Gorgeous performances all around....,8,10 March 2020,"""Marianne"" (Neómie Merlant), the daughter of a famous artist travels to a windswept island off the Brittany coast to paint the portrait of an unwilling young lady ""Héloïse"" (Adèle Haenel); the purpose of the picture being to demonstrate her beauty to a Milanese gentleman to whom she is betrothed but has never met. Having little interest in the prospect, our model refuses to pose, so ""Marianne"" must find more devious, novel and difficult ways of garnering the images she needs to create her art. What follows morphs into a love story. Initially cold and distant, ""Hèloise"" warms to her new colleague and soon trust and more develops. There is a lovely sub-plot featuring the maid ""Sophie"" (Luàna Bajrami) who has become pregnant and they try to help her - sometimes rather comedically - to have an abortion. The writing is gentle and penetrating and the cinematography is beautiful: the light during the day, brilliant; at night eerily but gloomily authentic and atmospheric. Also outstanding is the use of audio - the howling winds; rain on the windows; the sea crashing - frequently a far more effective method of communication than dialogue. Sadly, there isn't much jeopardy with the story itself - the inevitability that all will follow the pattern set by her mother - a kindly, but determined Valeria Golino - is never questioned and merely reinforces the almost chattel status even high-born women were accorded in the 18th Century. A really sophisticated piece of work with two sterling lead performances and of which Céline Sciamma has much to be proud.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
8,grantss,Beautifully filmed but otherwise dull and unoriginal,4,29 January 2021,"18th century France. A young painter, Marianne, arrives on an island to paint the portrait of Heloise, a woman soon to be married. Heloise does not know a portrait is being made of her. Over time the relationship between the two young women deepens.A fairly predictable French arthouse offering. Being French, being arty, involving two beautiful young women, you pretty much know where this is going to go. Hardly revolutionary - there have been plenty of same-sex romantic dramas before and this is no different. In fact, it's just another romantic drama, full stop.On the plus side, the cinematography is excellent. Every shot seems like a painting itself and the 18th century outfits complete the impression that you're watching a classic oil painting in motion.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
9,evanston_dad,The Gazer and the Gazed,8,11 May 2020,"It was hard not to come into ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" with really high expectations, given its idolatrous critical reception last year and the fact that I saw it long after it had already appeared at #1 and #2 slots on numerous best-of lists for 2019. So maybe that accounts a bit for the fact that I liked it very much but wasn't moved enough by it to include it on my own personal favorites list for the year.The film is sumptuous in its design, and it's deeply lush and romantic in its themes. It reminded me a bit at times of Jane Campion's 1993 film ""The Piano"" in its exploration of forbidden love and of the deep intimacy that can develop between two people who connect through a mutual understanding of one another's passions. It's about the gazer and the one who's gazed at and the way those roles can switch depending on perspective. One of the more thought-provoking (to me) themes it develops is the degree to which the artist is as scrutinized as the subject she chooses for her art.The film is also about women's choices (and the lack of them), and pointedly about the right to decide what happens to their own bodies. It's an anthem of female solidarity and empowerment in a cultural moment when people are craving stories like this, so I'm not surprised that it caught the attention of critics and audiences. It didn't resonate quite as much with me as it clearly did for others, but there's no doubt that it's a quite accomplished and at times beautiful film.Grade: A",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
10,morrison-dylan-fan,Self-Portrait.,9,17 February 2020,"Taken by her performance in Deerskin (2019-also reviewed) I decided to check Adele Haenel's credits, Having heard praise for the title but no knowing what the film was about,I was thrilled to discover that Haenel was one of the leads, which led to me going to the gallery to see the portrait.View on the film:Drawing in the audience,Adele Haenel gives a exquisite performance as Heloise, whose growing love for Marianne is expressively captured by Haenel with a brittle fragility on keeping a guard to her personal space raised. Only allowing Marianne build a portrait from passing glimpses, Haenel brilliantly entwines curiosity from the quiet passion which peaks out from Haenel's regal-shield face.Painted into the life of Haenel with the knowledge that not only does she not want a portrait done,but that Haenel is also against the planned marriage, Noemie Merlant gives a enchanting turn as Marianne, whose nervousness over being spotted making the portrait, is threaded by Merlant as a bonding, via them each wanting to retain a personal space, until Merlant has Marianne unveil a portrait of her true feelings.Continuing to build on her minimalism stylisation motif, writer/directing auteur Celine Sciamma tears the score off from the screen, leaving a magnificent sound design of shallow footsteps from Heloise and Marianne running to each other, tapping to a rhythm of scratched pencil lines against paper and sharp intake of breath.Closely working with cinematographer Claire Mathon, Sciamma presents a striking portrait of refined tracking shots on the grounds of the household running to the growing romance, which shimmer into ghostly shadows lining Heloise's house.Building on the themes of coming of age and sexual identity which span her credits, the screenplay by Sciamma peels away the self-importance of the Costume Drama to lay bare Heloise and Marianne's romance in raw dialogue which crackles with them sharing a awareness of only having a limited time,before the lady is on fire.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
11,christopher-underwood,Looks pretty enough but rather shallow and predictable.,6,11 February 2021,"I guess this film really wasn't intended for an ageing heterosexual male but I was vaguely intrigued at the prospect of exploration of the relationship between the painter and their model. As it happens director Celine Sciamma's interests are almost exclusively elsewhere. Even this might have been fine but though it becomes obvious where this is leading, it takes a very long time. Also, the gradual development of a relationship between the two young women is set against a rather drawn out abortion process being suffered by the maid and I can only assume this was there to emphasise what a grubby business a relationship with a man can be. Never mind that this whole portrait business is so that an Italian gentleman can get a sight of the ex convent girl before he commits. Looks pretty enough but rather shallow and predictable.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

13,MOscarbradley,Everyone should see this; a masterpiece.,10,5 December 2020,"You could best describe ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" as an art movie, as opposed to strictly an art-house movie, and 'a women's picture' since it deals both with painting and the very deeply felt relationships between women and it's one of the most beautifully made movies ever made on either subject. The period is the 18th Century, the setting an island off the coast of Brittany and Marianne is the young artist employed by La Comtesse to paint a portrait of her daughter Heloise but without Heloise knowing she's being painted. Both women are exceedingly beautiful in that plain, simple way women were at a time before Hollywood glamour distorted our image and both actresses, (Noemie Merland as Marianne and Adele Haenel, the director's partner, as Heloise), perform with so much simplicity and grace as to appear not to be acting at all. Naturally a bond grows between them and they fall in love.Celine Sciamma's film, (she made ""Tomboy"" and ""Girlhood""), is not a conventional LGBT romance any more than Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" was a conventional heterosexual romance. Yes, it's a love story between two women but it is so much more; it's a film about female friendship, trust and the ability of art to break down barriers. Heloise, first seen from the back in a blue cloak, (she could be Sarah Woodruff in ""The French Lieutenant's Woman""), thinks Marianne has been hired purely as a companion and initially treats her curtly, (she most certainly doesn't want that portrait painted), but in time they grow closer. Marianne has found her perfect subject while Heloise has found her truest companion.There is also a third main character, a young maid, also beautifully played by Luana Bajrami, who becomes Marianne's confidente and her mistress' friend. This is a movie made by women about women that is both delicate and strong and very modern in its outlook. It's the decor and not the dialogue that tells us we are in the distant past and like a good, post-modern look back at history isn't afraid to be funny now and then. Aimed perhaps at an art-house audience this is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone; a masterpiece.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Burning desire.,8,12 April 2020,"'Portrait Of A Lady On Fire (2019)' is achingly beautiful, from its wistful narrative to its painterly aesthetic. It's a quiet, contemplative drama that never feels burdened by its genre. The romance at its core is evocative of a wider sense of freedom. Indeed, it's as much about love as it is about art, taking a wonderfully feminist approach to both subjects and rendering them with an eye keen enough to make the most profound of portraits. The film is consistently engaging and often affecting. It's also incredibly well-written and rather poignant, too. It's mature, layered and impressive in its every aspect. On top of all that, it's absolutely gorgeous. Its piece-of-art framing and luscious cinematography are soaked in subtext, as apt at capturing the amazingly subtle acting as the wind-swept environment. The film, in general, is brilliant. It's confident, compelling and emotionally affecting. Like I said, it's beautiful. 8/10.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
15,dromasca,art and love in difficult times,9,20 November 2019,"Feminine and feminist cinema. Is there such a thing? If there is one, I think 'Portrait de la jeune fille en feu', the film written and directed by Céline Sciamma, which received the best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival, would be the best example. The film is designed, made and played almost exclusively by women, actually there is no consistent male character, and in fact almost no men show up on screen excepting the introductory and the final scenes. Although the action takes place sometime, at the end of the 18th century, in a world of men, where those enjoyed almost exclusively political and economic rights, it describes a mini-universe of women and their struggle to be at least in part master on their fate, and to assert themselves socially and artistically. If anyone is shocked by this concept of an exclusively feminine movie, they should think about the countless war or action movies, or about westerns in which the heroes are exclusively or almost exclusively men. 'Portrait de la jeune fille en feu' is also a contemporary response to the misogyny that dominates part of the history of cinema. But first of all it is a beautiful film with expressive and important messages.There are four main characters in this film, all women, all forced to fight the rules and prejudices of the time and society in which they live. The Countess (Valeria Golino) lives on an island in Normandy and dreams of returning to her native Italy, which she had left behind by marriage. The only way that is accessible to her seems to be the marriage of her daughter Heloise (Adèle Haenel) with an Italian, but for this she needs a marriage portrait. After a failed attempt, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), an artist independent in character, with apparently a little more life experience, is invited. She also feels constrained in her art by the limits imposed by the society to women artists. The quartet is completed by the servant Sophie (Luàna Bajrami) who also has her secret - an unwanted pregnancy, which was very difficult to get rid of in those times. Between Heloise, just out of the monastery, forced into a future marriage before she could taste life, and Marianne, the artist who sublimates her feelings in art, a relationship starts, a relationship that will evolve into something that has no chance in the times in which the story is placed.There are many interesting things in this film, but I think its charm comes in particular from the sincerity and lack of emphasis with which the relationship between the two girls is described - the discovery of the other but first of all the self-discovery of each one, the hesitations and the joy of being in each other. find in the other. Beautiful and convincing. The image is beautiful, almost every frame is elaborately elaborated in color and composition. The source of inspiration is the art of the period in which the action takes place, the avant-garde art of that period I would say, because it iuses the palette of artists who would dominate French art until the middle of the 19th century - Gericault, Millet, Corot. The film does not have a music soundtrack, but the music itself plays an important role, which deserves to be discovered when watching. The political message is clear and assertive, and we cannot help but sympathize with those women, each forced to face her own destiny alone, a century before women's rights became a topical issue in Europe. 'Portrait de la jeune fille en feu' is a film about art, about love, about the place of women in the world. A movie that deserves being looked for and seen.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
16,Cineanalyst,"""Manifesto on the Female Gaze""",10,9 April 2020,"""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is one of the most romantic movies I've seen in some time, and one that is all the more affective because it's thoroughly intertwined with art and is a piece of art itself. Part of this is that the protagonist, Marianne, is an artist, commissioned to paint a wedding portrait of the lady in question. The main narrative, moreover, is framed by the titular painting: a picture within a picture. Another aspect is the natural landscape of rocky cliffs and crashing waves beside the beach and the seemingly continually brewing storm, as underscored by Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons."" The house, with its vanishing wedding-dress premonitions, the mirror motif and, especially, the flickering of fire work well in framing the images. Best of all is equating art and love, as both creative and destructive, but, most importantly, through the gaze. Both the artist and the spectator are fundamental, the loved and the lover, the one looked at and the one looking, and they overlap in a series of returned and shared gazes. The third artistic form featured here, in addition to painting and music, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice highlights the importance of the gaze and its traditional gendering as male.Much has been written in film theory on the gaze--and usually ""male gaze""--including Laura Mulvey's seminal essay. Essentially, the spectator's gaze (i.e. our, the audience viewing) upon the screen is associated with that of the camera and what it shows us, as guided by the filmmakers. This cinematographic gaze may be further associated with the gaze of a character--usually the hero or protagonist. Appropriately, then, the association here is, primarily, with the look of the artist on screen, Marianne, as a surrogate for the filmmaker. Women remain as the gazed upon, the to-be-looked-at, as initially represented by the portrait's subject, Héloïse, but this gaze upon her is returned on the artist and, thus, us. This female gaze, Marianne and Héloïse on screen, writer-director Céline Sciamma, cinematographer Claire Mathon and company behind it, is why the politics on patriarchy here, the marriage, witch stuff and abortion, otherwise dismissed by a few as agitprop, is effective--because it's supported by style, as well as artistic reference.A criticism of the male gaze, as told by Orpheus looking at Eurydice and argued by Mulvey and others, is that it's a deadly sort of objectification. Likewise, Marianne's initial portrait is a failure without the return gaze, the subjectivity and shared love of Héloïse. Her absence destroys the art. Her false returned gaze is literally smeared and wiped off the paintings. Simultaneously, then, looking is inspiring and dangerous, for art and love. This is further referenced by Marianne looking back, like Orpheus on Eurydice, which Marianne also paints, upon Héloïse in her wedding dress. These loving looks also literally burn Héloïse, too, as her dress catches on fire in one of the most remarkable of the picture's many gorgeous compositions. Moreover, the first time Marianne gazes upon Héloïse's face, it is when she turns around, removing the image of the back of her head with the return gaze. The system of looking is further highlighted by the scarves they sometimes wear for their walks on the windy beach, masking much of their faces except for the eyes.The epilogue is fantastic, too, because the power of the female and return gazes here imparting a continued presence of the couple through art. Marianne relates how she saw Héloïse twice more, one of which is in another portrait and the other at the theatre. Both scenes demonstrate that Marianne's presence is felt by Héloïse, as well, even though she does not notice Marianne's literal placement. We see this by the page number revealed for Marianne's self-portrait and by Héloïse's emotional response to the music Marianne introduced her to in the orchestra for Vivaldi. This final long take, then, is but an extended gaze from Marianne, the cinematographic apparatus, the artists behind it, and by us, the spectator, upon Héloïse remembering those shared looks, love and art. This is a beautiful and powerful picture, emotionally and artistically.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
17,gbill-74877,Beautiful,8,18 January 2020,"I loved how the film immersed me into this little part of the 18th century especially early on, with the crackling of the fireplaces, dim lighting, and the sound of wood surfaces indoors (listen to it with headphones if possible; it's pretty amazing). Those scenes on the coast are damn nice too.It touches on the state of women's rights at the time, such as the bias against women painters, the lack of freedom in choosing a husband, same sex relationships being forbidden, and abortions needing to be performed in secret. It's all so incredibly limiting, and yet the film has an empowering aspect to it in the way the three women bond with one another to make the best of it. The lovely scene where they're at a bonfire with a group of other women who break out into song also underscores this aspect.At its core though, it's a love story between the two principal women, told with restraint and a slow burn. Maybe the deepest love involves this kind of patience and enjoying the process of discovery while looking at someone in minute detail for so long. The painter (Noémie Merlant) and her subject (Adèle Haenel) have such quiet passion, but that makes the emotional scenes all the more powerful.There were a few moments that seemed like the film was injecting too much of a modern feeling (the painting of the abortion which seemed improbable, and the drug use which seemed just kind of thrown in there) which undercut the authenticity a little bit, but it wasn't a major problem. The scenes towards the end - the #28 bit and that concert - more than made up for it and were truly heart-stopping, and the ending itself was just fantastic. I'll have to keep an eye out for Luàna Bajrami too; she had quite a bit of screen presence in her role as the maid. A near miss for an even higher rating.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Its a slow burning drama, with basically two leads and one side character. Both leads were so good that you won't be able to take your eyes of them - the chemistry is there. Directing of this movie was amazing - film is slow but very methodically paced - you have to be in a pace with this movie yourself because this is a drama from start till finish with no splashy things happening - but its a fascinating one.Overall, i'm not really a fan of such romantic drama's, but this one i really liked. Its all there - amazing acting, amazing directing and cinematography - this is a first class cinema.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
19,westsideschl,Special Features,10,1 October 2020,"Yes, the movie was great (GREAT) in all respects - acting, of course; dialogue (importantly, for this particular script, not much needed); cinematography; location & sets. But, the interviews in special features (particularly of their hired painter) were quite interesting, parts of which I wish I had watched before watching the movie. C'est la vie!
Note: Ending scene of two paintings. First, I liked the Eurydice & Orpheus painting's interpretation of their parting, and especially as it relates to our two lead characters. Second, the painting where we focus on the female child must have significance, but what? Also, 4 Seasons by Vivaldi must be in season; plays here and in Grantchester (season 5, ep. 6).",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
20,briancham1994,Art film in the truest sense,8,27 August 2021,"This film is the best of example of cinema as an art form, capable of symbolic imagery that no other storytelling medium can achieve. In fact, it revels in an extreme form of purity where it relies only on this cinematographic imagery. The film has no pretense of a compelling plot, witty dialogue or rousing soundtrack; it deliberately defies these for the sake of pure visual experience. Every frame is a masterpiece of composition that brings to mind the paintings of old. It is too slow to be called ""entertaining"" but the lingering pathos imbued in every image and interaction simply touches the viewer in a deep way. The inner experience of the characters, contrived as it may be, become one and the same with the viewer's viewing experience.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
21,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,26 January 2021,"""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a female painter going in an isolated island to create the wedding portrait of another woman without her knowing. The painter has to observe her and remember her details in order to make her portrait, something that is very difficult for her.I had high expectations from this movie but I was disappointed by it because it was not interesting and I believe that it's a very overrated movie. The interpretations of both Adèle Haenel who played as Héloïse and Noémie Merlant who played as Marianne were good but not enough to save this movie. All in all, I have to say that ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is an average movie and not a masterpiece as it is presented here. You can find and watch many other movies which can present the same cases, problems or issues with a far better way.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
22,Red-125,Don't miss this extraordinary film!,10,21 October 2019,"Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (2019) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title, Portrait of a Lady on Fire. The film was written and directed by Céline Sciamma.This movie takes place in Brittany, France in 1760. A young woman named Héloïse (Adèle Haenel) lives with her mother and her maid in a large chateau on the shore of the Atlantic. Another woman arrives. She's Marianne, portrayed by Noémie Merlant.Marianne is brought to the chateau ostensibly to provide companionship for
Héloïse. However, we quickly learn that she is there to observe Héloïse, in order to secretly paint her portrait. The portrait is needed because Héloïse is destined to be married to a Milanese nobleman. He wants to see her portrait before he consents.This is an outstanding movie for many reasons. One is the complex, intriguing plot. The second is the outstanding acting by the two lead actors. The third is the wild scenery on the northern French coast. The fourth is that we actually see a painter painting. Most movies about painting show you the artist working, but you never actually see the painting coming together on canvas.Worth special mention are Luàna Bajrami as Sophie, the maid, and Valeria Golino as La Comtesse, Héloïse's mother. (Incidentally, in the film and in fact, Bairami is Italian.)This is the movie I enjoyed most at Rochester's wonderful ImageOut LGBT festival. It was shown in the excellent Dryden Theatre of The George Eastman Museum. The screening took place just one month after the film opened in France!I consider this film as the best of the 13 movies we saw at the ImageOut Festival. (That's saying something, considering the high quality of films at the festival.)This is a film that will work better on a large screen. Try to see it if it shows at a festival near you. My guess is that it will achieve theater distribution in the U.S. When that happens, don't miss it.Portrait of a Lady on Fire has an extremely strong IMDb rating of 8.4. I think it's even better than that.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
23,howard.schumann,The male presence still dominates,10,27 February 2020,"There are no men in Céline Sciamma's (""Girlhood"") Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu) but the male presence still dominates. Set in an isolated home on the Brittany coast in the eighteenth century, it is the story of an ""impossible"" relationship between two women in an era that rejected their form of sexual expression. Told with an understated passion, the lovers, Héloïse (Adèle Haenel, ""The Unknown Girl""), the daughter of a countess, and artist Marianne (Noémie Merlant, ""Paper Flags""), are bound by the rules determined by the patriarchal society in which they live, and the full expression of their love is burdened by the knowledge that it is doomed to end.Though the film is without stories of taboo, struggle, and self-abnegation and the language often feels contemporary, Sciamma says, ""This movie is not about wondering if such a relationship would be possible - it's not, and they know it. But I wanted to show how luminous and how satisfying it could be. We all know what society thinks - I don't need to repeat it."" Powerfully supported by cinematographer Claire Mathon (""Atlantics""), Portrait of a Lady on Fire begins in present time and unfolds in flashback. When a student of art instructor Marianne discovers the painting of an elegant young woman with fire consuming the bottom of her dress, the film takes us back to the circumstances that generated the mysterious painting.Dripping wet from having to rescue her pallet that fell overboard on her voyage to Brittany, Marianne waits in the reception room of a large chateau, placing her wet canvas near the fireplace to dry, smoking a pipe, and helping herself to bread and cheese from the kitchen. She has been commissioned to paint a portrait of Héloïse, but her subject's angry refusal to sit for a portrait reflects her defiance of her mother, La Comtesse, (Valeria Golino, ""Daughter of Mine"") and her wishes for her to wed a Milanese nobleman (whom she has never met) if he approves of her portrait. She is told by the young servant, Sophie (Luàna Bajrami, ""Happy Birthday""), that Héloïse's younger sister had been promised to the same suitor, but has just fallen from a cliff and died, an event Sophie considers a suicide.Pretending to be her walking companion, Marianne joins Héloïse on her daily walks, closely observing her every feature, then painting her at night from memory in a hidden corner of a room illuminated only by candlelight. During their first walk together, we only see the back of Héloïse's head until she suddenly begins to run towards the cliff, swiftly pursued by Marianne who is uncertain if she is going to jump or just admire the scenery. Upon reaching the edge, however, Héloïse turns towards the camera, her hood blown off by the wind, revealing her blond hair and the sublime expressiveness of her face, alive with idealism but burdened by the sadness and lack of freedom that defines her life. ""I've dreamt of that for years,"" she tells Marianne. ""Dying?"" Marianne asks. ""Running,"" she responds.The attraction between them is obvious from Marianne's furtive glances, but it is uncertain how - and even if - it will make itself known. According to Sciamma, ""The journey of the gaze, the fact that it's stolen at first, then consensual, then mutual, then . . . we don't even know who's looking at who makes it really physical and organic."" Marianne, however, must comply with the artistic rules, conventions, and ideas of the day even if they render her portrait inert, which Héloïse is not reluctant to point out. Their relationship only begins to grow when the subject begins to return the artist's glances and surprisingly agrees to pose for her.Discarding her first painting, Marianne begins again, and it is clear that her new painting will be transformed by their growing bond. Obligingly, her mother goes away for five days, leaving the two alone with Sophie. In a telling sub-plot that reinforces Sciamma's theme of a women's right to choose, Sophie is found to be three months pregnant and Marianne and Héloïse deal with the choice she has made with loving care and concern for her well being. Music also plays a large role in the film. One day, the three encounter a large group of village women who are participating in a feminist community ritual, singing the Latin lyrics, ""fugere non possum,"" which means ""I cannot escape,"" a metaphor perhaps for the plight of women in that era.Though the fate of her relationship is sealed, like Elio's tears by the fireplace in Gaudagnino's ""Call Me by Your Name,"" Héloïse's reaction to hearing Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" for the first time at a concert is a poignant moment of beauty and power. If Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a heartbreaking film, the pain is rewarded by the knowledge that happiness lies not in months or years but in indelible moments that will always remain with you. The film may or may not allow you to come to terms with these moments, but the tears it evokes can be healing.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
24,TheMovieDiorama,Portrait of a Lady on Fire paints a sumptuous masterpiece of scorching zealous romance.,10,22 June 2020,"Eurydice and Orpheus. Fateful love bounded by tragedy. Her solemn death inflicting immeasurable amounts of sorrowful melancholia upon Orpheus, harnessing melodious musicality to signify his eternal grief. Love overpowered. Orpheus confronts the God of the underworld, Hades, hypnotising all with his lyre. The God offered Eurydice's soul under one condition. To not stare upon her spirit until they reach the light once more. Orpheus' empyrean patience would be rewarded. Unable to hear her footsteps, Orpheus nervously persuaded himself that he was fooled by the Gods and begrudgingly rotates his visions unto her after losing his faith. Her ghostly form whisked back among the dead. Forever. Their love, however fleeting, blossoming from within. With only their physicality extinguished. A romance that was not meant to be.The ancient legend corresponds to the artistic emancipation of Marianne, a young painter commissioned to produce a portrait of the equally youthful Héloïse whom is to be married off to a wealthy nobleman, with an illicit romantic affair igniting between their sumptuous female entities. Exoticism that expresses the forbidden humanity that was repressed within eighteenth century France whilst celebrating the female anatomy upon every soul-gazing stare. Marianne focussing on every precise characteristic that Héloïse elegantly discharges, painting the initial apathetic stance that shrouds her subject's opulent lifestyle. Her hands positioned with insurmountable grace, her indomitable complexions angled to perfection. The more Marianne confidently paints, the further her unflappable emotions progress. Offering supplementary ardour. Each passing day, as Marianne acts as Héloïse's walking companion after the apparent suicide of her sister, the two increasingly concatenate their infatuations. Each longing stare into each other's eyes, further alluring than the last, beckoning the compassionate lust that overwhelms. Their breathing simultaneously growing stronger, beseeching the infatuating oxygen that shrouds their authentic corsets.""When you're observing me, who do you think I'm observing?"", asks an apprehensive Héloïse as she comes to terms with her true feelings. With only days left before Marianne's contract ceases, the two flee to a desolate cave by the beach and subject themselves to a passionate kiss. A forbidden kiss that echoes throughout the cavern, with their hearts beating as one. ""Your presence is made up of fleeting moments that may lack truth"", Marianne declares. Saddened by the eventual disappearance of their lustful endeavours. ""Not everything is fleeting. Some feelings are deep"", Héloïse replies. Visions haunting Marianne of an ethereal version of her lover before dissipating into the darkness that engulfs her. A fleeting representation of Orpheus' fateful love, metaphorically symbolised in the inflorescence of youthful lust. An ember growing into a respiring flame, as it singes Héloïse's aquatic dress whilst bestowing an unflinching look upon Marianne. Get too close to the cinders, and one may burn their soul beyond repair. An option Marianne consumes as she ""chooses the memory"" of Héloïse whilst acknowledging her cataclysmic consequence.Yet, much like with all fires, a beauty exudes from its ashes. Reborn into a rejuvenated benevolence. For the bond these women have fabricated can never be smothered, even if society prevents such romances from blossoming. Immortalising true feelings onto a canvas, with each stroke of oil paint surging with endearment. From the surreal titular masterpiece ""Portrait de la jeune fills en feu"" to a future portrait of Héloïse surreptitiously clinging onto a vivid memory. Art enshrines all with timelessness, serving as conduits for equality and vivacious memories. A simple rendition of Vivaldi's Presto (""Summer"" composition) on a dainty harpsichord embeds itself into the soul, nestling amongst the serotonin. To hear the same piece again, this time as an orchestration, an emotional weight anchors the body. Subconsciously, memories of old come flowing back. Art, in all its forms, subjugating the human psyche. Harnessing the ability to relate dexterous artistry with emotional control.Sciamma's historical drama is that representation. It subverts the artist-muse relationship, common in ancient legends such as the aforementioned tale that assimilates itself within Sciamma's flourishing screenplay, by reversing the perspective onto Eurydice's viewpoint. To see the subtle eroticism through the glistening eyes of the muse. To animate the urgency of female relationships, whether a mere bond or romantic interest, by excluding prolific male characters from the story entirely. Through sheer focus upon the female entirety, both mind and anatomy, Sciamma produces a tale of passion that radiates gravitas upon each line of dialogue, facial expression and inevitable conclusion. Marianne concedes to the realisation that their intimate solicitude can only exist in their memories, and it's through art that these memories are imprisoned. A form of self-communication. Sciamma, alongside Mathon's exquisitely sumptuous cinematography that paints every frame of film as if they were individual masterpieces, decoratively directs the love affair bounded by the art that surrounds it. Each stroke of Marianne's paint brush or fine line drawn from a stick of charcoal is intensively therapeutic and central to the romance. The exclusion of a traditional score, with only Vivaldi's strings and women chanting echoing the extremities of repression, allow the burdensome breathing to infiltrate the audience.Haenel capitalising on the intensity of arduous respiration whenever her character, Héloïse, interacts with Marianne on a physical level. Her eyes moistened as her soft lips touches Marianne's. Merlant equaling Haenel's ferocity by presenting fragility, especially when running towards her stoic lover begging for forgiveness. The crashing waves of the sea acting as a symbolic backdrop for their turbulent bond. Sophisticated one-take sequences of dialogue exchanges with both Merlant and Haenel, rarely blinking, staring into each other's souls. Supplying incalculable amounts of chemistry. Yet, one scene had the ability to fully entrance, staring into the silenced void of the credits. Haenel's multi-faceted emotionally explorative climactic scene, as a flood of feelings pour into her heart when listening to Vivaldi's masterpiece. To confidently alter between sorrow, regret, happiness and sadness in the space of two minutes, was nothing short of perfection. Vivaldi's staccato notes exemplifying the relentless austerity of their relationship, whilst the calmer strings providing solace. In just a one-take zoom-in, Sciamma concludes her female love affair by, once again, linking to art.Portrait of a Lady on Fire is intimidating. Not for its stupendously celebratory subject matter or personable symbolism. It's intimidating because it is unequivocally perfect film-making. There is not a single frame out of place, nor a single word of dialogue. For years, one has persuaded others that the ""perfect"" film does not exist. Art cannot achieve perfection. Yet, Sciamma has somehow achieved the near impossible by delving deeper into the manifesto on the female gaze. Through the embellishment of queer cinema, the prosperity of female empowerment and contemporary astuteness of arthouse productions, she has painted a perfect masterpiece. Not only achieving the perfect score, but quite possibly the single greatest piece of cinema that has acquired zero flaws. Not one. It may just be the best film I've personally ever seen. Love is not scripted. It is an original work of art.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
25,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Classic Cinematic Portrait of Love beyond Gender and Regret beyond Sacrifice,8,16 July 2020,"Portrait Of A Lady On Fire (2019) :
Brief Review -A Classic Cinematic Portrait of Love beyond Gender and Regret beyond Sacrifice. Hold on guys, this is something only understandable to the people who have cinematic sense and understanding of profound art so if you're looking for any popcorn flick or entertainment then just get the hell out of here right. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire is now my favourite Woman Oriented film of the Decade for many reasons. First reason is the writing of the film which has subtle meaning and pain till the the core but you only have to keep your eyes open to acknowledge it. Second reason is artistic vision of bringing this great writing on screen in the form of painting. The uncompromised vision of the director is the third biggest reason that why this film fulfills its taboo context. And last but not the least acting and dedication of Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel. Coming to the story without giving any spoilers, a female painter is obliged to paint a wedding portrait of a young woman, they form a deep bond of love and intimacy but gets separated to regret and live with the memories of thier passionate Romance. It begins on a slow note and doesn't come to the point for almost an hour and then the second hour explores everything so beautifully and the climax is extremely poetically driven. Just don't blink in the last 3 minutes of the film or else you'll miss a pure form of Art. I didn't know who is Céline Sciamma but now i want to remember her name for exposure of bisexual love, intimacy beyond gender and giving a perfect artistic touch these taboo subjects. In little misleads, the film fails to answer some important questions about the main two characters such as thier sexual identity, thier current positions and thier regret. However, you can neglect those little faults for such a Great Cinematic Portrait having abstruse soulful meaning.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

27,paul-allaer,Exquisite study of two female characters,8,16 March 2020,"""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019 release from France; 120 min.) brings the story of Marianne and Heloise. As the movie opens, Marianne is asked by art students about a certain painting. ""Yes, I painted it many years ago. It's called Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu."" We then go back in time, as Marianne arrives on an island off Normandy in what looks to be the late 18th century. Marianne is there to paint the portrait of Heloise, who refused to pose for the previous painter as a sign of refusing the marriage that has been arranged for her (to an Italian business person). How will Marianne be able to gain the trust of Heloise? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from French writer-director Céline Sciamma (""Water Lillies""). Here she looks at the complex relationship between these two women, with additional subplots involving Heloise's mother as well as the live-in maid. Given that the movie is plot-heavy, I really can't say much more that relates to the main story lines, sorry. So let me make a couple of comments on the movie's style. The movie is minimalist, as can be expected from Sciamma, purposefully slow-paced (in the best possible way) and nuanced. While of course physical portraits are painted and are at the core of the film, but that can be said as well for how the film studies these characters. The two leads, played by Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel are absolutely outstanding. The photography is likewise (with seemingly only natural light, and hence lots of candle-lit scenes in the evenings. Bottom line: this movie is not for anyone in a hurry.""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" premiered at last year's Cannes film fest to immediate acclaim (it won the prize for Best Screenplay), and not surprisingly is currently rated 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The film opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people) but keep in mind that was the weekend where the coronavirus was declared a national emergency. If you are in the mood for a slow-moving French relationship drama set in the late 18th century, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it at the theater (if you still can), on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Few pieces of media have ever explored the relationship between love and art as this movie does: this is less about a forbidden love affair and more about how the artist uses her (or his) experiences to create.The whole thing is hypnotic and sensual, with an understated eroticism I rarely see in other ""erotic"" movies.

36,I_Ailurophile,A masterpiece of cinematic art,10,7 May 2021,"I can't remember the last time I watched a movie quite like 'Portrait of a lady on fire' - a film in the absolute spirit of cinematic artistry. Where every single shot, every smallest detail, is so carefully considered and crafted that each frame tells a story of itself, and would not be out of place hanging on a wall. This is a stunningly beautiful feature.The story being told is relatively simple and straightforward, but it's told effectively, and is deeply entrancing. That it is so intensely grabbing is in no small part thanks to that very same construction of the picture. Hair, makeup, and wardrobe are just exquisite, and it's difficult to remove our eyes from even those small aspects to read the subtitles. The setting is stark and visually arresting, and together with the props and set pieces fully immerses us in this period piece.Every line of dialogue shared between Marianne and Héloïse - every look, every gesture, the complex range of emotions - is as deliberate and painstakingly designed as the brushstrokes the artist makes on her canvas. Writer-director Céline Sciamma deserves every accolade. So too do stars Noémie Merlant (Marianne) and Adèle Haenel (Héloïse), who are so in tune with each other and with Sciamma - the artistic vision shared, the unspoken language of the screenplay - that 'Portrait' gains a sense of vitality unlike any other film that immediately comes to mind.For as purposefully and well made as most movies may be, I simply can't remember the last time I watched one that had me so completely enraptured that I wanted to plaster it all over my walls.

37,jadepietro,Romantic Sparks,8,2 March 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An absolutely beautiful enchanting film.JIM'S REVIEW: Now onto, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, another gorgeously filmed tale, has finally arrived at a cinema near you. The wait was indeed worth it.While The Academy is touting its openness and acceptance of international films by awarding the Korean film, Parasite its top honors, let us also look at their grievous omission of another foreign film that could have been nominated, Portrait of a Woman on Fire. For some unknown reason, this film was completely shut out of any nominations, despite its fine acting, strong direction, and top-tiered production values.Essentially a high class lesbian love story, the film is given the royal treatment. Sumptuously photographed by Clair Mathon, the film is deftly directed and written by Céline Sciamma,. The filmmaker spins her tale of forbidden love and passion set in the 18th century. An artist, Marianne, is hired to secretly paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse, a wealthy but unhappy noblewoman on the eve of an arranged marriage. Their relationship grows as both women begin to feel an attraction to each other, despite their different class status and same-sex-gender.This French historical drama stars Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel as the doomed lovers. The central plot involves their forbidden affair, although a sub-plot involving Héloïse's maid adds little to the film narrative. Their chemistry ignites the screen with such palpable sensuality and unleashed desire. Both actresses are wonderful in their contrasting roles as seductress and enabler. The sexual scenes between the two actresses are rather tame, more artfully composed than explicit. The nudity also appears completely natural, not the least bit gratitious.The story may be a tad simplistic with its predictable tinge of tragedy about a love that could barely speak its name. One quickly realizes their hidden consummation is inevitable due to the flashback structure of the film. But Ms. Sciamma creates such vivid characters that one is immediately drawn into the story and their dilemmas. The film is very atmospheric and lovely to behold, if a tad too slow. The site location off the coast of France adds to the film's mystique and authenticity. (I was reminded of Karel Reisz's beautiful The French Lieutenant's Wife numerous times.)Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a rich period drama that captivates its audience from the start and keeps its romantic spark aglow due to the craftsmanship and vision of the talented Ms. Sciamma (another female director overlooked for an Oscar nod) and its superb cast.NOTE: Since both films were finally released to most filmgoers this month, I will be counting these films in the 2020-2021 movie season line-up.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
38,Amyth47,An interior rebellion of young love.,9,1 January 2020,"My Rating : 9/10A true wholesome artistic portraiture in the cinematic sense, 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' delivers earnestly. The painting by Jean-Antoine Watteau 'Pierrot' comes to mind as an influence along with Bresson's flair for capturing human interiors in minimal settings though they are part of a much larger canvas of humanity in which they have been placed through fate. The 'Orpheus and Eurydice' parallel deepens and makes the viewer further understand the inner drama. The film is poetry-in-motion employing the trope of proliferating desire and the spirited rebellion from either characters is shown to be ultimately futile and unfulfilled.The use of Rococo-style ornamental composition of cinematography adds to the illusion of fire, motion and drama within the characters.The film rids the viewer from the modern world and transports them to a much different time and place - truly a sacred refuge for the senses.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
39,richard-1787,A feast for the eyes,9,17 October 2019,"The acting by the two principle actresses in this movie is first-rate. The direction, though it moves slowly, is very good.But what made this movie remarkable for me was the cinematography. The most striking scenes feature the blonde character walking along the shore against a relatively light-blue sea. You have to see it to experience how beautiful those scenes are.But some of the interior scenes have face lighting that will make you think of Rembrandt. (The movie is about a painter, so it's not surprising that the lighting of faces should be very important.)There are other scenes where you have one deep red dress against a white background, again to very striking effect.I just saw this movie in France, so with neither dubbing nor subtitles. I don't know how it will work with either of them.But if you can understand the language - which is very clear, very classic standard French with little background noise behind it - you will discover a remarkable study of two women photographed in a truly astounding manner.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The film's end sequence is incredibly sophisticated, set to the music of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Original screenplay-writer and director Celine Sciamma has made an outstanding film revolving around the subject of painting portraits. Definitely one of the most rewarding films of 2019 for me!

It was nothing more than fleeting lesbian fling between an aristocrat and a painter/tradesperson.The main focus was the sumptuous styling and ravishing cinematography.

42,frankde-jong,Orpheus and Eurydice helping to interpret a lesbian relationship,7,10 September 2021,"""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"" evoked various associations in me in the first couple of minutes. The opening scene is a lot like ""The piano"" (1993, Jane Campion), a woman being put ashore with a small rowing boat carrying something that is very precious to her (precious enough to jump into the water when it knocks overboard).The precious thing in this film is however not a piano but painting equipment. The arriving woman has the assignment to paint a portait of another woman, meant for her future husband. A painting playing an important role in a movie reminded me in turn to ""La chute de la maison Usher"" (1928, Jean Epstein) based on a story by Edgar Allen Poe.Associations can however be superficial or even deceptive. In essence ""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"" is about the developing lesbian relationship between the painter (Marianne played by Noémie Merlant) and her subject Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). The greatest difference between this film and ""La vie d'Adèle"" (2013, Abdellatif Kechiche) is not that this film is in the eighteenth century and ""La vie d'Adèle"" in the present. The greatest difference is that ""La vie d'Adèle"" was made by a male director and ""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu"" by a female director. The eroticism is thence less explicit but certainly not less intense.By the way, the association with ""La chute de la maison Usher"" may be less deceptive after all. The setting of a secluded country house and Héloïse who at first hides her head in a hoodie (she doesn't want to get painted, because she opposes a pre arranged marriage with a man she doesn't know) is definitely mysterious and Poe like. It is also functional because in this setting the lesbian relationship is ultimately doomed (in the 18th century) but temporarely not forbidden (in the secluded countryhouse with only female inhabitants).The painting that is made in this picture may not have mysterious powers (as in ""La chute de la maison Usher"") but it certainly is a metaphor for looking at and be looked at, where Héloïse as the model is initially the passive one, but during the film the roles gradually change. The metaphore of looking at and be looked at is then elaborated upon when the females in the house discuss the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. This myth also accentuates that the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse ultimately is doomed.The cinematography of this costume drama is marvellous, especially the beautiful dresses in green and reddish brown. Colors which we also encountered in ""Beanpole"" (2019, Kantemir Balagov), but that is a very different story about two women.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Outstanding performances all round, painting an incredibly enchanting story, the canvass masterly transposed into film alongside the dialogue, the sheer poetry of heartache and love - and a chance to reflect on all those in the past who were denied their opportunity to express who they truly were, because society and religion and government knew better.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
44,jromanbaker,"Visually beautiful, cold film",6,5 June 2020,"There are moments of Vermeer and Caspar David Friedrich in this film, but despite the fact that it is definitely a Lesbian love story it has a certain coy, but limited passion to it. It has enough in its subject matter to alienate some heterosexual homophobes but not enough in my opinion to ignite a fire in the audience. It has a very observing, distancing feel about it and only once in a card game did it come truly to life and cast off its chilly feel. I do not want to give spoilers but the situation and story of the working woman in the house interested me more than the two central characters. The film is remote in all senses of the word; an enclosed world where three women can be and exist for themselves. I can see the necessary point of that and given the historical vantage point of the 18th C. it has a certain poignancy. There is a moment when a door slams shut and for me the film should have ended there. The opening up into society at the end put two coincidences together that though perhaps believable were not in the same world as what had gone before. The male critics in the UK have bent over backwards to not highlight the homosexuality, avoiding the core subject matter and the shame of that is on them.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
45,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Slow but rewarding, while making me thankful for the cinema experience.",8,21 January 2020,"I'll come right out and admit it: my attention span is worse than it used to be. My tolerance for slower paced, artsier movies was better 5-10 years ago than it is today. I wish this weren't the case, but there are more things to distract me. Life has gotten more complicated as I've gotten older. There are more things to think about, to the point where I can't always get totally lost in a movie. More and more things are done online. I have multiple screens that are very distracting. I get more and more notifications on my phone every year, and there are still so many social media apps I don't even use.The movie theatre is, for me, more of a blessing than ever before. I'm fortunate enough to live in a fairly populated area that has a variety of cinema complexes, including a few that will play many (but of course not all) indie and foreign films in any given year. When I'm in that room- when the ads end and the lights are all out- there's a certain atmosphere that tells me I can't be distracted. My phone is always off, and I wouldn't dare pull it out because I know how annoying that would be for everyone else in the theatre. I don't talk to whoever I'm there with, because I similarly don't want to distract others, but I also don't want to distract myself.Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a movie I needed to see at a cinema to appreciate. If I'd watched this at home, as embarrassing as it is to admit: I would have likely gotten distracted. Paused it, gotten up and checked something else, taken more snack breaks than necessary... I would've gotten to the end of it and likely appreciated it, but not really have felt immersed or even particularly impressed by it.Watching it the way I did, I had no choice but to pay full attention for all of its two hour running time. And at the start, that was challenging. The story is simple and also take a while to get going (intentionally so of course, as it builds tension and does ultimately succeed in getting you to care about its main characters). But once it does really get going, and once you realise what it's about and what kind of movie this is, it's hard not to get at least a little bit sucked in. By the time it finished, I was satisfied and glad I'd watched it without distractions.The images presented on screen, with stunning lighting and colours, deserve to be studied and gawked at for the entire running time. The two lead performances are subtle but incredibly effecting; the characters in many ways are repressed and downplay their feelings, so that when they do start showing more emotion, it just packs even more of a punch. Some of the tension derived from the feelings they experience is palpable, and just as visceral as the fantastic visual imagery.It's probably not for everyone, and it's not a film I loved unconditionally. As I said, my attention span isn't fantastic, and I think I'm predisposed to love movies that aren't as subtle or nuanced (hey, at least I admit it). But I'm glad movies like Portrait of a Lady on Fire exist, and I'm glad there are still cinemas willing to screen such movies. It's undoubtedly worth a watch, and deserves your attention. I can see this resonating more with other people than myself, but ultimately, it is still nice to see a different kind of movie, where its deliberate pacing, simple but moving story, and subtle but powerful performances all gel together to create a challenging but ultimately unique and rewarding experience.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The story is about a female painter who goes to stay temporarily with another woman engaged to be married in order to paint her portrait. However, the woman to be married is very apprehensive about the whole thing so the painter has to do her work in secret while pretending to be a walking companion. As you can imagine, working like that is very difficult but that frame is only an entry into the film's larger themes of self-discovery and finding authentic connection with another person, even if the nature of that connection is socially proscribed. Everything in this film radiates with color and pulsates with tender emotion, and the central performances are the best I've seen in quite some time. That being said, this isn't for everyone. Unless you have a taste for slower-paced art films, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. In the end, though, I found this a thoroughly captivating romance that will most surely take its place in the pantheon of the timeless.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
48,proud_luddite,Exquisite,8,2 August 2020,"In the late 1700s, Marianne (Noémie Merlant) is a painter who has traveled to an island on France's Brittany coast with the assignment to paint a portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). Heloïse is of an aristocratic family who intends, against her will, to have her marry a Milanese nobleman. In time, the two women connect romantically.Director/writer Céline Sciamma clearly knows much about visual art. Each frame of her splendid film could easily resemble a beautiful painting of the time period of the film. The sequences of the artist at work are also in clear, fine detail. Whether scenes take place in a sparsely lit chateau or a cliff by the sea, the cinematography by Claire Mathon is breathtaking.Sciamma has succeeded in applying a modern feminist perspective in her characters during an era long before feminism existed. This is reflected in three situations: an arranged marriage in which the potential bride has no say regarding the marriage (while the potential groom does); a love connection between two women that must be kept secret; and an unwanted pregnancy of one of the film's other characters.An interesting twist on class is also covered: Marianne is middle-class and yet she has more autonomy and independence (at least where marriage is concerned) than Héloïse who is of a higher class. It was also interesting in that, even after the two main players have connected as lovers, they address each other using the formal French word ""vous"" instead of the familiar ""tu"".Merlant does a fine job as the main protagonist - a smart, educated woman of many talents. Yet Haenel truly stands out as a mysterious ""muse"" whose facial expressions convey so much emotion particularly envy and love. Her extended close-up in the final scene is mesmerizing.It is inevitable to compare ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" with ""The Piano"" released in 1993. Both films deal with forbidden love with the matching metaphor of crashing waves in the background. Each also begins with an artistic woman arriving by a rowboat to a place where she has never been before. There are other similarities as well as clear differences between the two but this is certain: each film deserves very high praise. - dbamateurcritic",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
49,blott2319-1,Just another dull romance,4,9 June 2021,"I have to get this off my chest because it was literally the first thing that happens in Portrait of a Lady on Fire... I'm done with ""sometime in the future"" framing sequences! Every single time I see one I'm instantly asking myself if it was necessary to tell the story, and I would say that 9 times out of 10 it is not. I don't even see the value in starting this movie in that fashion, because it establishes nothing other than allowing the main character to drop the title of the movie in the first five minutes. Now that I've got that off my chest, let's talk about the story presented in the film. To be honest, I'm kind of bored by plots of this type. I can tolerate some romances, but I like a bit more to the story than just the romance. It seems the only reason movies of this type resonate is because they are about homosexual love in a time when it was taboo. I just need more to connect with me than just societal norms of the time creating a rift between two lovers.I can say, at least Portrait of a Lady on Fire feels more like the two are forming a true bond with one another rather than something as basic as Romeo & Juliet. However, where that story lacks in the believable romance, this movie lacks in the drama created by their love. I was genuinely shocked by how little tension was created in this film. There were never moments where they made me fear the romance would be discovered, in fact there was little indication of anyone caring that the two women were so close. I'm not sure I'd be all that fond of a movie where it was all scandal and outrage either, but at least it would feel like there was more story. However, aside from the frustratingly pointless framing sequence, there was nothing in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that irritated me. It is a mild movie that I'm sure will delight fans of deliberately-paced emotional dramas. For me it was just underwhelming and never did much to grab my attention.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The slow camera movements and angles on the paintings and the scenes between the characters were also masterful.The theme about the power of love was beautifully displayed. Even though the moments spent were short, the strong love made from those precious memories can linger and even evoke real emotions long after.

53,tm-sheehan,Beautiful visually A historical forbidden romance,8,24 August 2020,"My Review - Portrait of a Lady on Fire Portrait de la jeune fille en feu
My Score. 8/10I thought visually this was the most beautiful film I've seen in years I had to pause it a few times and each freeze frame was like a painting by Vermeer or another Dutch master. I read that the paintings and sketches in the film were made by artist Helene Delmaire. She painted 16 hours every day during the course of filming, basing her painting on the blocking of the scenes. Her hands were also featured in the film. To mark the release of the film in France, Delmaire's paintings from Portrait of a Lady on Fire were exhibited at the Galerie Joseph in Paris from 20 to 22 September 2019.
Portrait of a Lady on Fire or Portrait de la jeune fille en feu, is a 2019 French history romance film written and directed by Celine Sciamma . Set in France in the late 18th century, the film tells the story of a forbidden affair between an aristocrat and a painter commissioned to paint her portrait. Portrait of a Lady on Fire was selected to compete for the Palme d Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The film won the Queer Palm at Cannes, becoming the first film directed by a woman to win the award. Celine Sciamma also won the award for Best Screenplay at Cannes. The film was theatrically released in France on 18 September 2019.
The Principal photography began in October 2018 and was completed after 38 days. Filming took place in Saint-Pierre-Quiberon in Brittany and a chateau in La Chapelle-Gauthier, Seine-et-Marne which is perfect for the interior scenes evoking the late 18th Century perfectly.
It's a glorious rugged seaside location and I wondered if the opening scenes of the young painter Marianne's arrival by boat may have been inspired by Jane Campion's film The Piano in fact the film to me had a Jane Campion feel about it .
There's hardly a male presence in the movie, which is fitting as it's a very feminine film and the attraction and ultimate consummation of Marianne and Helloise's affair is the substance of the film. The two main stars Noemie Merlant as Marianne and Adele Haenel as Heloise are look beautiful ,act beautifully and suit the era perfectly .
The two Supporting actresses Luann Bajrami as Sophie the housekeeper and Valeria Golino as La Comtesse the mother of Heloise add so much to this film .
The Composers Jean-Baptist's de Laubier and Arthur Simonini have composed a very effective music score for the film.
Dorothee Ghirard has done a beautiful job on the costumes they're soft and feminine and make the cast look as though they're characters that have stepped out of a painting.
This movie may not appeal to everyone it's slow in action ,a relatively simple but intense tale of obsession forbidden desire and great beauty it's a film I want to see again.

Marrianne is a young painter who is hired to paint a portrait of Héloïse, A woman about to get married. However, Héloïse does not want a portrait of herself being made so Marianne pretends to be her companion and paints her secretly.What writer-director Céline Sciamma has achieved with this movie is astounding. This movie is visually stunning. Cinematographer Claire Methon has done an excellent job creating the 18th Century look and each scene is bursting with colour. There are some gorgeous shots that look like they're straight out of a painting. Through this, the atmosphere created feels very artistic and poetic even. The sound design of this film is really well done. The absence of a background score adds to the realism as we only hear natural sounds from the location. The sound of waves crashing and fire crackling heightens the atmosphere. I would highly suggest watching this movie in the cinema and the big screen and speakers enhance the viewing experience by capturing the beauty of its visuals and sound to the fullest.The two lead actresses (Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel) are fantastic. Their acting is really good and have beautiful chemistry with one another. This movie won Best Screenplay at Cannes and I can see why. The dialogues are very interesting and build each character really well. The relationship shown has been developed really well due to Sciamma's writing and the work done by Merlant and Haenel.This movie may test your patience. It's a very quiet film that moves at quite a slow place and the characters don't rush to get out every single word. It did not affect my experience as I was fully immersed into the film but some may find it boring.Portrait of a Lady on Fire is one of my favourite films of 2019.

61,garethcrook,Sparse and evocative.,7,9 May 2020,"Brittany in the 18th Century. Marianne (Noémie Merlant) is a painter, central to this amazingly sparse, subtle and evocative film. Landing on at remote location by tiny paddle boat to paint Héloïse (Adèle Heaney). She spends the opening scenes largely fending for herself in a stately but barren and echoey house, lit by candle. Removing dust sheets from mirrors and furniture. It's seemingly a fresh start for everyone, a blank canvas if you like. Except there's history, Héloïse has returned to this quiet home from a convent. Her sister has recently died and she's to be married. The idea being that the painting will entice a suitor in Milan for her. It sounds rather ridiculous to modern ears, as it does to Héloïse, who resists. Opposing the potential marriage and the commissioning of the portrait. Another painter has attempted the portrait recently... but failed. The task therefore is for Marianne to paint Héloïse, without her knowing. It's a patient film. Much like painting I suppose. Minutes go by with barely a word. Creating a peaceful world within what appears to be a vast house and a wilder world outside on the coast, exposed to the elements. Héloïse likes to take walks on the beach, which looks stunning and by the cliffs worryingly, as it seems jumping from one was how her sister ended her life. These walks are the ruse for Marianne being there, she's company and these moments are her only chance to study her model. It seems impossible, but the painting itself doesn't feel all that important. It's the relationship between Héloïse and Marianne that's revealing itself. Marianne understands Héloïse, understands her sadness, her reluctance and upon completing her first attempt at the portrait, confronts Héloïse with the truth. The painting doesn't tell the truth, Héloïse sees it and Marianne too knows that she must dig deeper. What transpires is a wonderful account of friendship and perhaps something much deeper. Héloïse's mother, the architect behind the painting and the potential marriage leaves on the understanding that Marianne has one more attempt at the portrait. And so the two women are left alone, with only the young housekeeper, who it turns out is pregnant. Very much a side plot, but evoking further the need for the women to stick together, finding strength from each other. Fire is a constant. Cooking, warmth, light. It feels like the elephant in the room. On a rare foray out of the calm isolation of the house, the three women join others from an unseen village at a nighttime gathering on the moorland. There's fire once more and striking a capella singing that really makes me wish I'd been watching this in a cinema. This scene is pivotal. Cementing something within Marianne, something inevitable. A touching story of forbidden love. I'm not sure it would stand up to much repeat viewing, but on first watch it's pretty arresting. A final coda rounds the story perfectly, without being obvious, yet remaining satisfying and I must confess I really fancy a visit to Brittany.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

This is slow cinema at its best. Long scenes invite the viewer to watch as if you would watch a painting in a museum: paying attention to small details, enjoying the craftsmanship of the painter, and admiring the subtle and thoughtful way it has been made.From the beginning, it is clear that this movie tells a lot without words. In one of the first scenes, the painter travels in a rowing boat to an island off the coast of France. When the crate containing her painting gear falls overboard, she doesn't say a word to her male travelling companions, but immediately jumps into the water to save her things. This small scene tells the viewer that she is a fiercely independent woman, very much attached to her painting equipment, and that she prefers doing things her own way.The story is simple: the painter is invited to the island to paint the portrait of a young woman, about to be married. The only difficulty is that the young woman doesn't want to be painted. Slowly but inevitably the two women grow fond of each other and even start a love affair.Not every director can turn these seemingly straightforward events into a movie that captures the viewer from beginning to end, but Sciamma pulls it off. Although there are no really spectacular events (unless the unwanted pregnancy of the maid counts as such), every scene sizzles with restrained emotion and visual power.This is not a film for everyone. For some, the lack of pace might get on the nerves. But for those who can appreciate the intensity of slow cinema, this is a treat.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
64,andrewroy-04316,Sciamma is completely in control of her craft in this sumptuous period romance,8,23 November 2020,"Emotionally-driven romance movies are not my cup of tea, but Portrait is simply exquisite. My immediate point of comparison was The Handmaiden (another foreign language forbidden lesbian romance), but Portrait is more of an emotional story than an idea-driven one. That's not to say that the film isn't thoughtful; on the contrary, to the extent that Sciamma ponders the nature of art and women's autonomy, the script works well. This is a subtle and patient film, though, and one whose core is the emotions felt by the women at the center of it. Both performances are excellent, and especially given the laconic script, it is essential that both leads convey their emotional states and reactions clearly through body language. It feels like a classic tragic love story, but it still feels fresh and the emotions of the characters come through strongly. The biggest reason I consider Portrait a great movie, though, is due to its gorgeous visual production. The camerawork and editing are fantastic, with limited movement in shots and seamless cuts that make the audience feel present. The lighting is amazing, with a stark contrast between the beach scenes, the daylight painting scenes, and the evening fireplace scenes. The camera also ensures the audience is carefully attuned to Heloise and Marianne's reactions and facial expressions. Maybe Portrait will drop to a 7 for me as I don't know how much the emotions of the film will stay with me (the limited development of big themes and sparse dialogue restricting how well we know the characters play major roles in that), but I do think Sciamma achieved precisely her aim with this film: a gorgeous movie that captures the emotional tragedy of a beautiful lesbian relationship that will inevitably slip away.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

67,CineMuseFilms,The nearest thing to cinematic art in years.,10,28 December 2019,"Every now and then a film comes along without a big story to tell but an extraordinarily beautiful way of telling it. Last year's Oscar-winning Call Me By Your Name (2017) is one example, and now the French period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019) is another. Both give weight to the stylisation of social context rather than narrative, inviting the viewer to slow right down and feel the moment.The plotline is simple and its action-curve almost glacial. We meet a young painter Marianne (Noémie Merlant) teaching art to a class of female students. She is the epitome of an 18thCentury feminine portrait, passive and elegantly composed. A student asks her about a painting standing at the back of the room. In her wistful response, the film flashbacks long ago to her arrival on a lonely island in Brittany where she was commissioned to secretly paint a pre-wedding portrait.Her subject is Héloíse (Adéle Haenel), a young woman who refuses to pose for a traditional portrait in the hope she can delay an already arranged marriage. Marianne is hired as a walking companion to surreptitiously observe Héloíse, then paint her from memory. An imperfect portrait is produced, and Marianne confesses her duplicity. A second portrait is painted, this time with cooperation. The relationship intensifies and they become lovers. With the work complete, the forced marriage becomes possible.
Capturing the slow-burn of forbidden lesbian love on film is no longer transgressive or novel, nor are we shown new insight into the social entrapment of forced wedlock. But there are so many layers of exquisite beauty and pathos found in this film. For a start, the two principals are mesmerising in their roles, each with an expressive and penetrating gaze that speaks volumes without words. The score is loudly absent for almost the entire film, leaving empty space for sounds like a paintbrush caressing canvas, crunching footprints on sand, heavy fabrics rustling, and wave crashes to echo a spectrum of emotion. It takes fine artistry to convey sensuality and sexuality through a sigh, a glance, a light touch, without resorting to gratuitous nudity or intrusive camerawork.The portrait theme is reflected throughout in lustrous and visceral cinematography. Many individual shots are a masterclass in filmic composition, often using shallow depth of field to isolate, alienate, or sublimate subject and place. True to the history of women in society, the film is without false hope or a fairy tale ending. In its honesty, intimacy, and artistic expression, this film is the nearest thing to cinematic art in years.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

I know this is going to be a cliche and expected thing to say, but, it is so fitting that the movie is about painting because this is the closest film equivalent I have ever seen to ""watching paint dry"".First, the positive things: it was quite pretty to look at.Now, the negatives: it is actually mindblowing to me just how boring this movie is. Like, one would have to purposefully write, cast, and edit this exactly as it is with the intention of making it one of the most stagnant films of all time. The characters are all completely drab and lacking any hint of unique characteristics, or even the most base level of charm. It is not at the fault of the cast, as it is clear that they are all very capable actresses, however the script does not allow them to do much with their performances, considering all the characters are so lifeless that it drains them of all likability by default. A love story intended to be emotive simply does not work when the characters are so unlikable. I did not care for any of the characters and by the time it was halfway over I really just wanted them to get whatever it was they were trying to do over with so I didn't have to see them anymore. I understand it was relevant to the era, but their inability to be honest with themselves or take ANY sort of action whatsoever, for so long, was slightly irritating to watch. Though I'm often a fan of slow-burning films, the snail's pace of this one does not do it any favors, considering there is almost zero pay off. The dialogue is so bland and empty, it feels lobotomizing. So much could have been cut from this dismal offering. I understand the film is about painting, but I could not find a purpose for the many long shots of brush strokes which all looked the same, and by no means represented anything symbolic. It did not help that the movie had almost zero music score, outside of a few scenes where music was relevant to the story (some of the only stimulating scenes in the entire film). The movie was so quiet, basically silent for half the time, and because of this I could hear the sub bass and epic soundscape scoring from The Invisible Man in the next theater over, and naturally, wished I was watching that grippingly entertaining movie again instead.

75,jayjaycee,Stunning and indescribably wonderful piece of art,10,9 November 2020,"""Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait Of A Lady On Fire)"" is a 2019 French romantic drama directed by Céline Sciamma starring Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel.
⚪
All in all, this fine French feature ignites a touchingly passionate and sensitively narrated romance that is defined by its sheer emotional intensity, rawest of emotions and unadulterated and genuine feelings, and thanks to outstandingly performing lead actresses, overwhelmingly gorgeous and wonderfully picturesque cinematography and empathetic direction it becomes a breathtakingly beautiful and terribly affecting love story that can only be described as an absolutely stunning, slow-bruning and moving piece of art that lives up to its reputation.
⚪
Many colleagues in this community, some of them even being the harshest critics I know, recommended this movie to me, and encouraged me to give it a watch, for they have bestowed it a perfect rating. When many of the people whose opinions you appreciate tell you that they gave it a perfect ten out of ten, then the film has to be of great significance. But what is this French phenomenon that apparently everyone is talking about? Well, it is a romantic drama by French director Céline Sciamma about a young painter, Marianne, taking place at the end of the eighteenth century, who is supposed to capture the daughter of a wealthy woman as a gift for her fiancée, only that they ultimately fall in love. Sounds quite simple, but what Sciamma created is nothing short of true art. Seriously, every single frame of this film looks like a masterfully painted portrait, and it knows to use this as its biggest advantage. If you look for eloquence and long dialogues you are at the wrong address, because the touching story conveys what it has to say through its stunning visuals and outstanding actresses only. I for one sat there, the entire two hours of runtime, and was bedazzled throughout. From close-up shots of brush strokes to long shots of the churring sea - it all feels so indescribably breath-taking all the time. And that is not even all. The chemistry between Merlant and Haenel is so incredibly genuine. Honestly, this passionate and deep love they both share is something I have never seen before in a feature film. The thing is, it doesn't show itself in kissing in the first place, the way they look at each other, how they effortlessly complete one another on screen and how they feel palpably imperfect when their counterpart is not in the same scene as the other - this is how you create a pure and absolutely natural kind of love. It oozes raw and undiluted emotions, a subtle but palpable fervency and an ardent sexual tension - and none of it ever feels out of place or exaggerated, because it is all so inexpressibly authentic, the most natural form of equally returned love you will ever see in a work of fiction. However, as almost every romantic drama, there is also a conflict that makes it so utterly heart-breaking as well. Since they are two young ladies living in France at the end of the eighteenth century, the society would never approve of their relationship. Marianne, as soon as she finishes her job, is supposed to take over her father's shop, and Héloïse is about to get married to nobleman from Milan. They are both aware of the fact that they will never see each other again, let alone be able to live out their true natures. Arranged marriage and social norms prevent this, and you can see it in their faces that they are utterly shattered about that. Those few days of independence, equality and emancipation will never come back. There won't be another opportunity to make love without the fear of getting caught, to play and eat at the same table with the maid and to help letter getting an abortion. Sadly, that is not how it works in the real world, and Sciamma knows to depict those to completely different worlds in one of the most shattering ways possible. A key element to this symbolism is the scene when Héloïse is reading out the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In a nutshell, the ancient story is about the former leading his beloved out of the underworld, on the condition that he is not allowed to turn around and look at her until he sees the light of day. For unknown reasons that the author himself didn't even further elaborate, he turns around just before he reached the end. Why did he do this? In my opinion, simply because he couldn't wait any longer and wanted to see her so badly. Kept in perspective, it is probably one of the dumbest things one could do in such a situation, but the crucial factor of this one simple thing: love. Yes, he loved her so much that he couldn't resist any longer, even if it meant that it would be the last time he would be seeing her. To some degree, this scene is somewhat recreated in the end, when Marianne turns around to her beloved to see her one last time, even if it would be the last time. This is what true love causes - it makes us do things we would consider pointless in general. And this is also the devastating conclusion this film draws in the end: true love comes with a prize you can never pay. The last shot, two minutes of Héloïse crying to the orchestral music, is what reminds her of what she has had but will never have again in her life. And that hit me right in the guts. In the end, this film seriously deserves every bit of praise it has received, and it is a downright shame that it hasn't been acknowledged by the Academy in the slightest, because this is probably one of the finest and most beautiful films of the past decade. It left me speechless, devastated and stunned, and I know that I use this term quite often, but this feature film truly is a piece of art.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Best comes last, right?I went into this movie with really high expectations because of the really high audience and critic ratings. Something I don't normally do and something I wouldn't advise others to do. But this movie surpassed my expectations on every level.Is it slow? Yes. But if you've seen the trailer before watching the movie that's what you expect. It has to be slow. This is a movie about emotions. There isn't alot of real ""story"" to it. And not every movie has to have the thickest story.
But when you don't have story, you have to get everything right that you're going for. This movie went for a powerful atmosphere and a heartbreaking but beatiful lovestory.When you watch the movie, after 20 minutes you will know that it does not have a happy ending. It takes a look at arranged marriages and how women of that time couldn't really do anything against it. It was just normal. Noone cared about what they wanted. So it is very clear, this movie will be sad.But is it though? Not as much as you might think. This movie is alot about remembering. About up upholding memories.The ending of the movie left me with some of the longest goosebumps I have ever had. It is so beautifully done and with such attention to detail.
But the ending would not work as well without the fabulous acting of the two young actresses, they really carried this movie. And they had to be good.
This movie has alot of silence, alot of not talking, it's very raw, but never boring. And the reason why that works is 1) the fabulous script, but 2) mainly the actresses performance.Truly a movie I will not forget any time soon.

84,Michael Fargo,Portrait of an artist,10,30 April 2020,"I've been lucky to have seen a lot of movies in my life, and few approach the originality--without effort--of this beautiful and devastating film. Using a familiar trope, a stranger in a strange land, it verges into the mystery or thriller genre, and then morphs into something else, something surprising altogether.Winner of the Best Screenplay at Cannes, that is one of many of the film's strengths. The performances, of course (since this is a very intimate film), the restraint of the director to not intrude into what is revealed, and cinematography which is strikingly beautiful without artifice or mannerism. The subject matter, how women are alienated from a full life through the construct of patriarch is a common theme, particularly in late 20th & 21st Century film, but what is rare is the absence of men in this story. The suppression and oppression is, more or less, self-imposed by the characters since they are living in a space where no male is dictating their behavior...at least directly.And for an award-winning screenplay, there's surprisingly little dialogue through about two-thirds of the film, where everything is communicated by a look or a physical action (one example is a thrilling scene about running, where we and the main character are confused by the intent). Men often fantasize about what women do in private, projecting their own misunderstanding and fear of the female psyche. Here it's revealed on screen...or at least one version of it. It rings of such truth and sadness and regret of lost opportunity that ""liberation"" from it is not just a political imperative but a human one as well. ""The right to..."" has long been denied women, and the urgency of being freed from it, has never been so poetically and gracefully revealed. The ""elegance"" of the characters keeps it from becoming a screed. Their needs, their hopes, their fears are vividly defined and, for a brief time (very brief) explored. And the memory of that freedom stays with them throughout their lives and is referenced time and time again. The breadth of time revealed in the film is surprising. The urgency and call for that liberation never leaves them even while they revert back into their limited roles proscribed by society very quickly.The lack of ornament in the film is also surprising given the time of it's setting, the late 18th Century where adornment and excess is rampant. Only in the final scenes is that world shown. The majority of the action is set in a cold, isolated place with very hard even threatening surfaces where not only the fire of the human desire is the motivator of keeping people connected, but literally fire itself that is both danger and salvation. While the majority of the film uses the graphic arts as it's metaphor, music is used at the culmination of it. The young innocent, Héloïse asks what orchestral music is like since she's never heard it. At a loss, the more mature and worldly Marianne attempts to describe--admitting it is impossible to communicate--that on a harpsicord using a famous Vivaldi piece she can't really remember clumsily using a clavichord. (It's telling of the director's scheme that this elaborately ornately decorated instrument is left draped while it's played.) In the final sequence of the film, we're given an unexpected--2+ minute shot--the references this earlier strangely awkward moment in a glorious, though voyeuristic way. And memory, as is Orpheus' fate, is all that is left. And while the memory is significant and life's only non-fleeting joy, it has to be--and usually is--enough to last a lifetime.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

87,blrnani,Very different and far superior to what the reviews led me to expect,6,2 August 2020,"The entire cast were excellent, but the most difficult scene was the last one, masterfully handled by Adèle Haenel.
I'm afraid I have to explain the development in order to do justice to the film, so sorry about the SPOILERS.
It begins with an artist (Marianne) on her way to a remote French island to paint the portrait of the younger daughter (Héloïse) of a noble family. As a woman in a male dominated profession, Marianne is already resentful and it doesn't help to learn there had been an earlier attempt by a male artist, whose work was rejected when he failed to overcome the challenge of Héloïse's refusal to sit for him.
Héloïse is an even more tragic case, as she's been hauled back from her life in a convent to replace her older sister, who jumped off a cliff rather than be married off to a Milanese noble she knows nothing about. Indeed the portrait is to send to him to see if she's acceptable to him, making it even more of a challenge for Marianne to fulfill her mission.
One can nevertheless understand Héloïse's mother, who needs an heir to continue the family line and believe's her daughter will be happier in the rich cultural life of Milan - from which she herself originates and is desperate to get back, away from her cold draughty manor.
The other major role is that of the maid Sophie, very nicely played by Luàna Bajrami.
And so the ruse plays out, with Marianne accompanying Héloïse on walks and the two of them slowly drawing closer as the barriers break down. Without going into too much detail, when the countess goes away for several days it allows freedom for the relationship to extend into the physical realm (though the film doesn't show any sex; as always with genuine love, it's portraying the emotional feelings that is important) in a natural way that doesn't seem at all contrived.
But of course, when the mother returns, it is expected that the painting will be ready and Héloïse will perform her family duty and marry the nobleman.
I'll leave you to seefor yourself how that plays out...",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

92,ilovesaturdays,When the muse is more fascinating than the artist!,8,22 July 2020,"A slow burn of a movie which is quite fascinating and utterly beautiful to watch. A young painter (Marianne) is commissioned to draw the portrait of an aristocratic young woman (Heloise) who has just been pulled out of the cloister and is thus unwilling to pose for the portrait which is to be sent to her would be fiance. With this simple premise, the movie addresses some very important issues like yearning, love, familial responsibilities, freedom, individualism and art. It is one of those rare films that have managed to fascinate the critics as well as the regular reviewer like yours truly.Before watching this movie, I believed that the artist is always more talented, sensitive and intelligent than the muse. To me the role of the muse was to provide only the basic premise to the artist and thus I used to confuse the muse for a mere model. However, after watching this movie, I stand corrected. I now acknowledge, without any reservations, that the relationship between the artist and the muse is more of a give-and-take than I had previously imagined. I liked how Heloise's character was portrayed and fleshed out in the film. Even though she was uninitiated into the matters of the world, she showed more sensitivity and emotional intelligence than the worldly-wise Marianne. Early on in the film, she showed the strength of her character by pointing out that some things are permanent and do not fade away with time. Her reluctance to be painted without her personality showing through in the portrait showed that this little initiate understood art and its purpose better than professional painters. Although she was angry at having been uprooted from her structured life and purpose, yet responsible and practical enough to honor her familial obligations. I also liked her interpretation of the Eurydice-Orpheus story wherein she postulates that it might have been Eurydice who caused Orpheus to turn because Eurydice wanted to immortalize their love and thus it was she who chose the poet's way rather than that of the lover's.What I found to be missing in this otherwise intelligently made movie was that it was never even considered that the affection and attraction that Heloise felt for Marianne could just be the result of never having shared any kind of friendship with anyone in her cloistered life. Even after being pulled out of the cloister, she lived a very isolated life with just her mother and the servant girl for company, both of whom hardly know her at all. The fact that Marianne was never really concerned about that aspect was unsettling to say the least. Before sleeping with Heloise, should she not have been worried that she could simply be preying upon Heloise's vulnerability? This omission on part of the creators made Marianne a less sympathetic figure to me.Overall, this is movie has a soothing quality to it that makes the world stand still for a while. The film is rife with symbolism which is easy to understand and isn't pretentious in the least. The bonfire scene and the music being chanted are both mesmerizing and hauntingly beautiful. Both the actresses are quite beautiful but I preferred Adèle Haenel's performance. In some scenes, Noémie Merlant's expressions made me feel like she wasn't really connected to her character. The cinematography is simply fabulous. All the scenes with the sea are particularly breathtaking, although I must confess here that this opinion of mine could have been colored by my love for the sea!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
93,gcsman,"Beautifully rendered film, with scenes that will stick in your mind",8,19 July 2020,"One thing I didn't quite expect was that a female-centered movie all about love and relationships would be rated just as highly by male reviewers on IMDb as by females (no statistically significant difference). That, I guess, is because this movie is unarguably so well done and so watchable. The plot (such as it is) is paper-thin, at least on the surface. In the 18th century a portraitist (Marianne, played by Noemie Merlant) is commissioned to paint a young, reclusive noblewoman (Heloise, played by Adele Haenel). They are both women in early maturity; in the short time they have together during the commissioning, they cautiously size each other up, then become friends, confidantes, eventually lovers. And that's about it. They necessarily separate because Heloise is being given away in an arranged marriage (to a nobleman we never see) and she has no choice but to leave and fulfil her duty. The movie is built entirely on the intense interlude they have together in an isolated villa on the seashore.The cast is quite small, and includes no men at all: the focus is utterly on the two leads and how their relationship evolves from a few gentle sparks into a fiercely burning fire. Marianne is skilled, confident, clever. Heloise, by contrast, is quietly frustrated that she has nothing to offer but her marketable beauty and a love of music. It's all beautifully filmed but a great deal of camera time is close up on the two of them (and mostly from the neck up): nuances of expression, unspoken emotions, mercurial changes all captured. I wouldn't call either actress classically beautiful but they are all the more interesting for that. The dark-haired Merlant has finely drawn features with a gorgeous long neck and at times looks uncannily like Emma Watson, while the blonde Haenel has more of a lower-key demeanor that grows on you as the film progresses. The whole experience of the story is almost claustrophobic, so closely are we pulled in to the world of these two women. And the obvious message is that during this one brief time each of them becomes the world to each other, all the more precious because it cannot last.The main reason why I don't rate this higher than 8/10 has to do with the flow of the story, which feels a bit choppy -- it goes by as a series of often-fascinating individual scenes or set pieces rather than a smooth story arc. But many of these scenes are very arresting indeed, and stick in the mind long after. Well into the story, the two friends take a break one evening down on the beach and join in with a somewhat mysterious group of older village women around a bonfire. In the darkness, we hear an eerie, low music and realize it is from the old women humming as if casting a spell. The hem of Heloise's dress catches fire almost unnoticed (hence the title) and her servingwoman calmly puts it out.Maybe the strongest scene, though, is at the very end. Years after their white-hot encounter, Marianne happens to attend a concert and sees accidentally that Heloise is there too, in one of the premier boxes as would befit her aristocratic status. (Heloise does not see her in return, however.) The orchestra starts playing Vivaldi's ""The Four Seasons"" with a penetrating, driving energy that practically fills the screen all by itself. Heloise becomes more and more absorbed, eventually listening with breast heaving and tears rolling down her face. What message? I take it that Marianne goes home with some consolation that, though Heloise went off to a life that wasn't of her choosing, there are times when it affords her some pleasure and a measure of grace.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

But I was not convinced by the relationship of the main characters. I was always conscious that they were actors playing roles and I think it was the way they were placed on set to make appealing images that contributed to this.

Not for its merits on exposing 18th century deviances of sexual orientation or its beautiful and well thought-out cinematography.
But because the director made me feel like I was on the island in the time period with those people. The shots, the editing, the directional choices made this film highly engaging, not to mention the electric chemistry between our two lead actresses.Story and writing-wise, I cannot sat I was impressed.

99,rmirchandani,Beautifully shot and acted,9,16 March 2021,"The 2019 arthouse film ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" focuses entirely on a forbidden same sex romance between a painter, Marianne and a mistress, Heloise. Throughout the film, it becomes quite clear that there is sexual tension between the two women. The title has both a figurative and literal meaning. It represents Heloise's self-doubt and journey of self-discovery, whilst also foreshadowing her being literally on fire during the second act of the film. Heloise is an enigmatic woman trying to figure out what she wants and contemplating whether she should commit suicide like her sister did. While the film does emphasize on the 'here and now', it does contain brief scenes where Heloise is looking out at the sea and trying to grasp something that is beyond her understanding.
The first thought that comes to mind when watching the film is that it takes inspiration from famous 18th and 19th century feminist authors like Charlotte Bronte. Makes sense because it takes place at the end of the 18th century. Heloise is expected to marry a Milanese man, even though she is not in love with him. The flashforward sequence at the end showcases a married Heloise with a daughter. Although, Heloise does not see Marianne at the opera, she still reminisces of her time spent with her when the orchestral sound starts to play. She even continued to pose for self-portraits, but this time with her daughter. Her most recent self-portrait contains a hidden message for Marianne. The number 28 (to infinity) is showcased, connoting her everlasting love to Marianne.
Celine Sciamma's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a quiet and slow film that builds slowly to a deeply moving ending. The slow pacing actually works in its favour. It does not have a dull or pointless moment. Every scene feels like it needs to be there and moves the story forward. Especially, the scene where Heloise tells Marianne and Sophie the story of Eurydice and Orpheus felt to be particularly relatable to Heloise and Marianne's own story. Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a deeply poignant film with vibrant costumes, exuberant mise-en-scene, stunning cinematography and rich characters.Final verdict: 9.4/10",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

This is, from what I have seen so far the second best film of 2019 behind only Parasite, it is an absolute masterpiece.
The cinematography is gorgeus, almost like a painting, in fact 2019 was probably the year of great cinematography, we have this, 1917, Parasite, The Lighthouse and probably even more that I just haven't seen yet.
The acting is magnificent and the 2 main characters are very well played, especially Helöise.
The story is great, getting progressively more interesting as the relationship between Helöise and Marianne develops and the bonfire scene is legit one of my favourite scenes in cinema.

101,nikitalinivenko,A Test of Patience,4,10 February 2020,"Two chicks spend the summer together and get real intimate when one is hired to paint the other. There, I saved you two hours.
Portrait of a Lady on Fire is certainly a very fine-looking movie, and painfully, excruciatingly boring. Not only is it a rehash of The Favourite from the previous year (period piece about lesbians, just to name the obvious), just shot prettier, like Barry Lyndon with soft earth-tones and crushed colors, but there's also a lot of The Piano in there as well - it starts on a boat with the portraits going overboard and the lead diving after them, instantly reminding me of the ending of Jane Campion's movie. Also, I just realized, it's a period piece version of (the far superior) Blue is the Warmest Color (French lesbian movie where the two leads sadly do not end up together in the end) on top of everything else. There's no end to better movies, and not-so-much-better movies, you can compare this to.

102,Camoo,One of the great films of the 21st century,10,4 February 2021,"I haven't written a review in a while because frankly there haven't been too many great movies in recent years to warrant any. But then I watched Portrait de la jeune fille en feu, and found it so revelatory and refreshing that I thought I would add my dollop of daisy to the ocean of praise this film has rightfully been getting.The film is about a love affair between a painter and her subject, both women, and in a sense it is as simple as that. There is a backdrop of male dominance overhanging the period in which the story is set - the film contains few men, and when they are seen, they appear as benevolent figures. But repression pervades each scene - the subject of the painting is an aristocratic women who is on her way to be married, and yet she isn't thrilled at the prospect and she might not have a choice in the matter. The painter, a young woman, at the end of the film displays her work under the name of her father, unable to present her work under her own name. So the specter of control is injected throughout, although this theme is only hinted at. This subtle touch gives the film an essential underpinning to what is otherwise a beautiful love story.Some thoughts about the film-making. First: what a beautiful thing to behold. Such refined artistry is a rarity in the days of quick-consumption digital, and it goes to show how the technicians that work behind the camera are as important as what is happening on screen. Each frame is a thing of aesthetic delight, of color coordination, of subtle lighting and design elements all married into a whole. The fact that it was shot in digital rather than a traditional film look for a period piece somehow heightens and modernizes the proceedings in a way that made its most visual moments feel fresh and completely new.Second, the respect for the audience, to not settle for petty narrative cliches when there were so many opportunities in this story to resort to them. It is one of these very pure and true stories, told with love and respect for the characters as well as those watching them breathe, yet we keep waiting for a moment of emotional violence between the main players, which doesn't occur. When I became aware of how delicate this story was as it unfolded to its end, I was moved to my core.This is a revolutionary and passionate film on many levels, and I believe those who have seen it can only attest to that. It kind of defies criticism beyond that fact.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

108,Dello_,Slow but rushed,7,11 January 2020,"NO SPOILER TILL THE WARNING""Portrait of a lady on fire"" is about a paintress who is charged to portray the daughter of an important family in order to send it to her future husband. However this lady doesn't want to be portrayed because her wedding would have been combined, which was the tradition between powerful families in the past. And from this premise the movie develops in an (on paper) interesting way. But even if the idea was great I found the realisation very disappointing, and not because of technical problems but for the story itself. Indeed the movie has a solid direction, a memorable cinematography and no score, which I found strange but it was functional to the film. The same praise can't be moved to the dialogues because they are inconstant: some times they were rich and powerful, some other times empty but presented like big deals. Notice that they are not bad by any means, it's that sometimes they seemed a little forced but nothing too serious. Than the pace was really slow but for me it wasn't a problem. What I couldn't stand was the relationship between the protagonists, I felt like it was rushed and implausible (I'll talk about this in the spoiler section). And from the moment that the movie is based on this relationship there's where the film doesn't properly work for me.
""Portrait of a lady on fire"" is a good movie, even if you can't buy all of what is happening on screen. It's not for everyone because of its pacing but I suggest a viewing even because you can love it since almost everyone loved this film. So probably the issues were mine and of a small minority of the viewer, I don't know.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERLike I said I found the relationship between Marianne and Héloïse fictional and not plausible. At the beginning they clearly know nothing about each other, except for the few informations that Héloïse's mother gave to the two. Than in their first meeting Marianne gives some looks to Héloïse because she has to portray her and she is stealing her lineaments by these looks. Than at their second meeting Marianne starts to have a more malicious way to observe her mate, and Héloïse is a little more open but nothing too drastic. At their third encounter you can tell that there will be something between them because the expressions, the way they speak to each other is too passionate and profound for them only to be friends. And all of that after only THREE DAYS. But at this point isn't yet a problem. Then the fourth day they had a super quick encounter. The day after Héloïse's mother goes away and they ""make it official"". And from that moment I think the mother comes back 5 days after and it is the moment in which they had to break it up.
Now I don't have any issue with the passion and the physical attraction because it can explode even in ten minutes. It's that this relationship is shown as a platonic love, as if they were meant to be one thing and they were undoubtedly the love of their lives. In 10 days? Come on. Even because they knew all along it has to be something quick because Héloïse's faith was already written and they lived it with this idea in mind. So I comprehend the passion and also the regret of what maybe were the greatest days of their lives and the sadness of Héloïse that knows she can never had freedom to live like she wanted. But the platonic aspect was too much. In 5 days they go to unknown to mates and then lover, and in the next 5 to the ""love of my life"" status. I felt it too rushed to be credible. If the movie was almost the same with the difference for example that Héloïse's mother went away for like a month giving the two more time to explore their relationship and cultivate it (I didn't have to see it, even a time jump would have worked form me), I would probably have a different idea and then I think I would have loved the movie. But that's not the case and so I felt quite disappointed.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

115,marydm-43470,Waste of cinematography,3,7 February 2021,"I waited for a while to write this review because I was totally conflicted while watching. Cooling off period to try to be fair. Still feel conflicted several weeks later.
The cinematography is superlative. But then the majestic natural landscapes which form so much of the mise en scene, the Atlantic Ocean Britanny coast, would look good in a smartphone video shot by a preschooler. Still, credit where credit is due.
The themes are unfortunately a tad on the trite side: a brief lesbian liaison, so what? A patriarchy keeping down female artistic talent? Yeah, we know. Even though this theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative structure, it somehow doesn't feel momentous enough for all the work the editing has put in.
Haenel is absolutely superb. She has enormous screen presence and an understated acting technique, so infrequent in French cinema. She is mesmerising.
Mantel is unfortunately not so suitably cast. She has a gazelle's physicality, both the lean long limbs, the doe eyes and rather pinched facial features overall. And she does come across as a deer caught in the headlights, rather than an artist confident in her artistic powers and self possessed. She is really no match, in terms of character strength for Haenel. This is a serious lack of balance in the two co-protagonists, the core of the film.
It's easy to see what the ""artist"" sees in Marianne, not so easy vice versa.
Then there's the most self-sabotaging and subversive plot development that brings the whole thing undone: the lesbian affair lasts only as long as Marianne's mother is away on business. As soon as the cat's back the mice scurry away into their conventional little lives, never mind the secret signs
they send to each other to reaffirm their undying love.
Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Isolde, etc, those are tales of two lovers bound to each other till death. The ending here merely suggests these two were naughty children indulging in playacting while the adults were not looking.
As for the subplot of the maid's unwanted pregnancy etc it's pretty forced on the storyline to stress the feminist perspective. Not all that subtle, though the young actress playing the maid is one of the stellar aspects of the film.
Pity then that the glorious cinematography neither serves nor is served by the thematic preoccupation of the film. More's the pity, because it's a visual feast. Three stars for that.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

I just gone with her. Still my mind thoughts with her only.Painting isn't the only art form Sciamma mines for ideas and analogies. There is literature and also music - not an added score, but a few moments of listening. The most powerful comes at a local village festival, where women gathered at a bonfire weave intricate harmonies around a simple Latin lyric. The words they sing - ""fugere non possum"" - translate as ""we cannot escape,"" expressing both fatalism and faith. They resonate through this smart and sensuous film in complicated ways. Héloïse and Marianne can't escape from their feelings for each other, or from their socially dictated roles. But at the same time it's impossible to see them as anything other than free.#portraitofaladyonfire

The painting that burns Héloïse's skirt is named ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"", which means that women who are forced to marry can get rid of the restraint of ethics. Portraits represent unfree marriages and oppression of women. She always wanted to destroy the portrait, so she lit the fire of hope and burned the ""portrait of the woman"". The female in the 18th century was materialized, and her beautiful appearance and fertility were her greatest value. Nowadays, stereotypes and constraints still exist. Gender opposition is not necessary, women are just fighting for the power that should belong to her. Both men and women want equality, but equality does not mean only enjoying power without taking responsibility. True equality means that everyone does what they are good at without worrying about being criticized, and take one's responsibility bravely without waiting lovers to save.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

127,Metaflix,A Hypnotic Mood Piece,8,18 March 2020,"Nearly every scene in Céline Sciamma's 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' can be frozen in time, mounted on canvas, and hung on a wall for display. There's a deep, rich luxuriousness to the film, from the cinematography to the acting to the story itself, making it ever so deserving of winning the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.The ethereal, hovering camera work evokes the essence of a Terrance Malick film. Considering Sciamma both wrote and directed 'Portrait,' her budding career shows no less promise.Noémie Merlant plays protagonist Marianne, an artist tasked with painting the wedding portrait of Héloïse, played by Adèle Haenel. Héloïse mustn't know Marianne's true intentions as the bride-to-be is emotionally fraught, having suffered through the recent suicide of her sister along with a stint in a convent. The notion of being married off to some Milanese nobleman in a sudden and emotionless marriage may simply be too much to bear.As the cat-and-mouse interplay unfolds, Marianne and Héloïse bond, creating an emotional connection flecked with romantic leanings. It's within this raw passionate atmosphere that the story lingers, offering the audience a meditative mood piece that draws our own emotions into a deep, sensory-rich trance.Though the pacing of 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is slow, it is necessary to achieve the hypnotic nature of the film. In capturing this deliberate rhythm, which is essential to the period and plot, Sciamma is able to fully realize the lingering memory of lovers long past into something vibrantly and excitingly new.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
128,nikxatz,A truly beautiful movie,8,14 October 2019,"This film is a luxurious feast for the eyes. Even single shot is fantastic, the colour choices were amazing, there is a great balance between the primary colors and the red and green dresses of the protagonists really bring a lot of power and life to the movie. The wide shots of the sea are gorgeous and the sound design is so well-done, The sound of the waves and the footsteps add so much to the experience. The camera work is brilliant. The way they director has set the camera in the drawing sequences is really clever and aesthetically nice, as it is maintained in the whole film. The whole film has a great personality and atmosphere, one that made it really interesting to watch and I definitely want to rematch it.The actresses did a really great job. Their expressions and reactions feel so real and there is the protagonist's eyes are gorgeous and so captivating, It is not a plot-oriented film, but the plot actually manages to be really good, though it is probably the films weakest element,The dialogues, especially during the first half, were so cleverly written and brought out both emotion and things to thing about, It is a film that is basically a love story, but manages to talk about the position of women during that particular are, how their whole life was designed by others so they want to meet other ideas and emotions, like how does music feel or what is love, what is freedom, is freedom a state of living that we can have forever?
My only bag with the film would be that the actual story is kind of a ripoff of other films that talk about love? For instance, I felt that it actually had the same story with Call me by your Name, a film which I really really love. Two strangers meet and fall in love, they keep it as a secret and time is the story's enemy. There is an actual scene where the characters say they lost time and should have been together earlier and there is a similar piece of dialogue in CMBYN, so I felt that it was not such a breathtaking story, although i was never really bored and the relationship between the character was explored nicely.
There are a lot of beautiful shots and scenes in the film, one of them is in the poster and really brought a sense of joy to my heart, there is a scene where the characters are playing cards and it feels so real and fun, the painting scenes were lovely and the last scene is actually perfect and the acting in this scene is phenomenal.Watch this film, it has a beautiful scenery and tone and I give it an 8/10

And for all those hoping to see a blossoming of a relation between two beings were robbed of that experience.Boring exactly like a painting one puts up on a wall and stare at one and the same scene till the day one dies...Boring to tears!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
130,canadude,A Great Film,8,26 April 2020,"""Portrait of a Lady on Fire,"" for most of its running time, is directorial perfection. It deliberately, concisely, quietly, and creatively unravels its story and builds an atmosphere of illusively frozen time and growing love. The performances, from the two protagonists to the supporting cast of women, do magic in the film's many wordless sequences, where the camera simply settles on faces and observes looks on the richness of which the bulk of the film hinges.Like ""Call Me by Your Name"" before it, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is after capturing the feeling of falling deeply in love, perhaps for the first time, and so ultimately, despite its formal minimalism, goes after poetry. Indeed, there are stunning visual constructions in the film, including a first kiss involving covered faces; a shot of two faces, one obscured by the other, and we only see both when they glance at one another; a card game portrayed only through the facial reactions of the players; and, of course, a young woman on fire.""Portrait of a Lady on fire"" is also about women carving out a space of freedom of movement, action, and feeling, however temporary, amidst social expectations and constraints imposed by the invisible, but ever-present patriarchy. It is no coincidence that the film takes place on an island, and we only see a handful of male characters with only a handful of lines.So, spoilers. The film falls short in a few instances where it fails to trust itself and the strength of its own construction. A few of its moments feel contrived, Symbolic with a capital ""S"" in that they call undue attention to themselves. One involves an abortion sequence, tastefully done, with the pregnant woman lying on a bed next to an infant who comforts her. The juxtaposition between what is happening and the child is too overt, too obvious, and too clearly ironic and contrasting, and so it sticks out in an otherwise carefully managed visual landscape. Indeed, the entire abortion subplot is clearly a metaphoric device here, but one that feels tacked on rather than natural to the story and its mood. There is nothing wrong with it on a rational level - but it simply feels out of place. Moreover, a brilliant sequence of the heroine, Marianne, who jumps out of a boat navigated through a sea by silent men to save her canvasses which have fallen overboard, as not one of the men helps her, communicates in a minute much more than the entire abortion subplot can, and with more subtlety.The portrait of Heloise with a daughter and a thumb on a book that communicates to Marianne that she never forgot her, like the final shot of Heloise crying to a performance of a Vivaldi piece Marianne once played for her is overkill. The two sequences are saying ""Look! What they had was real and it never went away! Look again!"" These final scenes are about hammering what the film has so beautifully communicated without obviousness. Again, there is a scene in the film, from which its title is drawn, that so stunningly captures the depth of feeling between these two characters, while communicating it in a poetic image the audience has never seen before, that makes the aforementioned scenes seem cliche and unnecessary. Moments like this deplete oxygen from the otherwise careful construction the director builds here.These are minor complaints, overall, because this is a great film, whose pleasures are emotional, intellectual, and visual. For most of its running time, it is a stunningly calibrated poem about falling in love.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Sometimes art is the only way we can express these complex feelings, crystallising the bond between two forever.

One of the great pleasures of the film comes when Héloïse steps more and more into the world of ""the help"" to discover who she is and what she truly wants which truly pushes the film, particularly for the first hour or so. Art, as always, is the great leveler. Of course, true equality for queer people did not exist in the 1700s, so it would feel disingenuous to assign a happy ending here. What we get instead leads to a final shot of such raw emotion and power, we can't help but think of Portrait Of A Lady On Fire as a magnificent work of art.

135,t-81966-84968,a brief evaluation,8,28 April 2020,"Personally, the difference between paintings such as portraits and modern photographs is that portraits contain not only the painter's personal style, but also her subjective impression and opinion of a person. So the burning her portrait they use of the characters in the picture delicate description from the first meeting, loving bud to confirm the relationship between each other, let Mary Ann put her eyes ellroy's painting on the canvas at the same time, also to present women in social bondage is difficult to see the glare, bring the whole piece of quite rich level and emotion.

Through the indoor candlelight and the sound of burning firewood, they can only enjoy this brief happiness in this small world hidden from the outside world. They yearned for love, for the freedom of their own lives, but just as in call me by your name oliver ended up engaged to another girl, so in the closed and conservative society at that time, the yearning for love in portrait of a burning woman was still hard to achieve.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Heloise is to take her sister's place in a marriage to a man in Milan, Italy. Her sister committed suicide. The painting is to be sent to the perspective suiter.To secretly paint Heloise, La Comtesse has told Heloise that Marianne is there to be her companion for walks. On their strolls, Heloise is brooding, inquisitive, and sullen. But the audience knows there is something deeper brewing.The side story with Sophie being pregnant and wanting an abortion is well done. The moment she subjects herself to a procedure in a home, with a baby by her side is enormously powerful and thought-provoking.The lighting and sets are both stark and dark but they create a beautiful space for love to flourish.Merlant is terrific and compelling as the artist whose job it is to capture the essence and beauty of Heloise. Hanel is a smolderingly sublime reflection of beauty in this role. As a woman who is slowly falling in love, she perfect. Bajrami is divine as the pregnant housekeeper.

137,sarcasm_for_free,Portrait Of A Lady did something I thought was impossible...,8,23 May 2020,"...It made me care about art. Never again will I just think of a painting as a collection of squiggles and dabs, now I see the preparation and loving attention that goes into every detail.The same thing can be said for the heartbreaking romance between the artist and the subject here, during the 18th century when same sex relationships were obviously frowned upon. As the portrait comes to life, so does the growing affection and understanding between the pair: we want so much for there to be a happy ending for these two soulmates but alas, chances are that this is impossible.The acting is beyond sublime: this is a very slow-moving film, but like good poetry, there's not a dull moment as we're taken into the women's private little world and enraptured by it. There is pure onscreen magic evident in every chaste look, every loving smile, every fond embrace. This is far and away the best gay-themed relationship I've seen in media to date, which makes it all the more devastating when you remember the time period and conclude it was not meant to be.There is only two male characters in the entire production, and with a couple of line apiece it's safe to say they're not integral to the storyline as a whole. What we do recall though, is a lost romance that could've been one for the ages, and those wonderful, wonderful paintings. C'est magnifique. 8/10",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

140,legonerdy,A Standout Film,9,18 April 2020,"I finally got around to watching this movie in April 2020, and I have to say I was pleased. Most movies of the artsy romance genre go some direction to make the relationship more of a hook. Call Me by Your Name, though a good film, is centered on a romance between two people that don't have equal dynamics. All to often, a film will make it a hot and fiery forbidden romance like Disobedience. Also a well made film, but much more about fire and passion. Portrait is about two women who fall in love and then part ways but never forget each other.To get into what I really appreciated about this movie, there's a lot to say for subtlety. I've seen many say that the movie is poorly paced, but I disagree. From very early on in the film, you can see the main plot developing. It's a very real romance. They start with stolen glances and lingering gaze. At first these are simply by mechanics of work for one and suspicion for the other. Then, as the movie progresses, these are accompanied by smirks or smiles. The glances get longer. The proximity gets smaller. There are moments when one woman looks at the other and has nothing but pure adoration. There isn't lust in those eyes - this isn't leering - it's pure happiness. Though it does eventually get genuinely romantic and even sexual, this foundation of simply loving the other person's presence carries the relationship.Beyond plot, I want to briefly praise the shot composition. You could tell that people who actually understand art - such as painting - helped block this movie.In the end, I don't believe this was perfect, but I do believe it was very, VERY good.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
141,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,ART AND DESIRE,9,1 May 2020,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire includes itself in that category of films that go beyond the script and acting and is consolidated as a work of art. Clair Mathon's exquisite cinematography anticipates scenes through sketches on paper and canvas textures.Anyone who is in a hurry to draw conclusions about the plot should be attentive to the words of Marianne (Noémie Merlant) to her students in a portrait painting class: ""Take time to look at me."" A student brings to the ambiance a screen that was in stock: it is the story we are going to watch.Sometime in the 18th century, Marianne crosses a bay in a boat driven by rowers towards the coast of Brittany. Her materials fall into the sea, the men do not move, and she jumps into the water to retrieve them. She arrives at her destination, wholly soaked and tired.The artist's mission is, in one week, to paint a portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), the second daughter of a wealthy merchant. The painting must be sent to the appreciation of a suitor in Milan who may if he likes, marry the girl. Héloïse's older sister does not seem to have agreed to this fate and chose to kill herself.The younger sister's strategy is different: she refuses to pose for the portrait. Therefore, Marianne should do the painting from memory, presenting herself as a chaperone, assisted by the maid Sophie (Luàna Bajrami).The two young women start walking together and exchanging experiences. At the end of the week, Marianne reveals that she is a painter and shows the painting to Héloïse, who rejects for considering it lifeless. The painter feels extremely frustrated and ends up burning the painting and asking for another week to complete the work.What follows is a love story. Marianne explores all the intimacy of Héloïse, and she surrenders with calm pleasure. There is no space for male conventions.

Surprised by the musical moments when they occur, as this is a visual delight; a film about artists and the use of art to capture moments, the very soul of a person (who wishes to be captured.)
Sadly like many great 18th century love story films, its characters cant get everything they want as they are all women; each burdened by their position in society. It blooms nicely and has steady performances. A great film to recommend. Nothing complex just love, passion and the cruel brunt of reality to make a tale worth telling.

149,kaneeddy,One of the best this year,9,8 October 2019,"Portrait of a lady on fire is one of the most deepest, thought provoking and beautiful films that have been put to screen this year. There were many artistic choices made throughout the film such as, removing the score, that really worked in the benefit of the film. It made the scenes feel more honest and vulnerable at times as the film depends on great acting and a fantastic screenplay to make you feel something without the score. This film executes that exceptionally well. The two lead actresses: Adele Haenel and Noemie Merlant give two powerful performances, and are some of the most memorable this year. The screenplay is so superb it has to be one of best written this year, it is so deep that you will most likely be thinking about all the connections the film makes even days after watching. Certain shots and cinematography are also of the highest standard giving us some of the most beautiful shots i have ever seen.While this movie is fantastic it does have one glaring flaw and that is the film does start off very slowly to the point I was quite unengaged in the beginning, however once the film picks up its momentum it becomes amazing in every sense of the word.Celine Schiamma gave excellent direction to one of the best films this year: I believe Portrait of a Lady on Fire is one of the best foreign language films of all time and will be something that will be studied many years from now due to the fantastic performances, direction, cinematography and screen writing.

I've never been so instantly nor so powerfully drawn to a single image.You'd think that going into the film with such high expectations would end up in disappointment but no. That first glance at the film's beauty was indeed representative of the whole. You'd also think that something so beautiful may be lacking in other respects, like storytelling, but no. It's just as much engaging in terms of storytelling and character portrayal as it is visually haunting. It's poetic and intriguing and empowering...

Just staring at something beautiful and watching it change every second, and just experiencing how it makes you feel? Anger, tension, sadness, happiness. That's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of describing Portrait of a Lady on Fire. This film brought me to tears, emotionally destroyed me and sent me into a fit of sobbing in ways I never imagined could. It's an emotionally devastating cinematic masterpiece. There are multiple scenes I can't and probably won't stop thinking about for a long time. Everything about it is beautiful. The cinematography, the script, the story, the actresses and their performances, the chemistry that they have, the soundtrack. The complete precision and perfection in the directing by Céline Sciamma, made this a gorgeous film, almost every shot in the film could be a beautiful painting you would see hanging on a wall. She manages to capture this experience in the most authentic and visceral way possible, to the point where I was so gutted emotionally that it was hard for me to watch. It's amazing how she was able to just ravish me with every single shot. The story is one we can universally relate to, because we all have beautiful experiences in life that we know have a time limit going into it. This is a film about not regretting the things we do in life, because of the pain/sadness it brings us, but to instead look back on them fondly and be happy that those memories will never leave. The relationship that develops between the two characters is so painfully real that it evoked feelings in me that most films could never do. You feel their love, pain, and heartbreak and that feeling stays with you long after the film closes. And you can feel the sting that continues to exist in the character's hearts after their inevitable departure, almost like the ghost of ""longing"" is haunting you. The characters are so well written, and truly connects you with them to the point where you're sharing their experience, emotions, and the pain they feel. The reason why is because of how attuned the film is to them, and how it really takes it's time to meditate on what it is they are saying. They sometimes speak slowly and quietly with some pauses in between. Which evokes intense feelings of isolation due to the limited amount of characters. As well as the absolutely mesmerizing performances. I'm shocked that more haven't discussed how great the acting was. This is a film that is a prime example of ""show don't tell"". The film never explains it's characters to you, it just presents them and leaves you to interpret the characters, how they feel, and what they are thinking. This is one of the best scripts of the year. The dialogue is just so crisp and well-written. The way the characters ask each other very mentally challenging questions, it almost feels like they're playing a game of chess in terms of how they speak to each other. The script by Céline Sciamma won Best Original Screenplay at Cannes Film Festival, and I think it absolutely deserves to get nominated at the Oscars even though it most definitely will not. If it did though, it would have some tough competition with Marriage Story. I don't think it's better than Parasite, so it probably won't win Best Foreign Film either, but I hope it gets some kind of recognition. This is an unforgettable film and an unforgettable experience that immerses you until the final shot. It's a magnificent love story about how formative romances can shape us as human beings and help us moving forward. Please see it if you can.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

158,Lepidopterous_,"""The higher we soar, the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly""",9,3 November 2019,"I've dreamt of that for years.Dying?Running._____________________________And so begins our introduction to the titular character and her nascent growth into being--a growth beyond the canvas, beyond the parameters of physical isolation, beyond the inescapable predicament of social and family burden. It is a taste of freedom. The beginnings of a liberating journey to find an existential peace from the inner turmoil that, as we learn early on in the film, likely took her own sister's life.Céline Sciamma's Portrait de La Jeune Fille en Feu is a remarkable film. It is Call Me By Your Name in its judgement-free paradise, palpable sexual tension, and look-into-the-flame Élio catharsis. It is The Favourite in its female-centric, lesbian-tensioned period drama with Vivaldi as a centerpiece (but with a mood far more romanced than Yorgos' unique lavish satirical darkness). It is Persona in its framing of duality and Abbas Kiarostami in its lunar pacing. It is unapologetically feminist: a love story between two souls who happen to be women on an island free of men, including but not limited to an abortion, the subsequent painting of said abortion, and the gentle caressing of armpit hair at center screen.While not entirely its own, the film is nonetheless brilliant in almost every regard. Cinematography, including framing, color palette, and the dream-like landscape, is stunning. There is a visual language of unspoken glances and facial beauty through close-ups and lighting that parallels the script and brings out the mystique of the enigmatic Héloïse. The story is unveiled so poetically, as if watching the long-restrained passion of the female artist slowly burst from the seams of her oppressive corset of objectification.'""The ""muse"" is this fetishized silent woman who is inspiring just because she is beautiful. One of the manifestos of the film is to get rid of this idea of the muse-which is a nice word that actually hides the participation of women in artistry.""
Céline Sciamma, Writer/DirectorThe nine muses of the Greek Mythology were deities that gave artists, philosophers and individuals the necessary inspiration for creation. One of the nine muses, Calliope, had a son named Orpheus... Sciamma's thought-provoking commentary on women and art is gently told but powerfully received, and it does not go unnoticed.This film, like a majestic portrait, will remain echoing in your mind like the haunting hymnal Latin chant, ""Fugere non possum"": I cannot run away.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Its images speak louder than word ; you see what you have to know.Everyone involved with this picture seems to have done an astounding job - may it be through directing, the actresses, the set, the photography, the costumes - everything is astounding and very well done.When we saw this in theatres with my colleagues - mostly male -, we came out speechless. At the end of the film, there was a girl crying in the same row as I - the first time I see anyone crying to a movie (really crying from bing moved). With my colleagues, we walked out, and none of us spoke or said anything for at least 5-10 minutes, as we all obviously were affected by the nostalgic beauty that the picture captures. Finally someone broke the silence with the only thing that could break the spell - a banal exclamation ""it was well done"", as the only thing to be done after such a film is ""a return to banality"".

162,maue-19674,EXTRAORDINARY AND EMOTIONAL - Best Film of 2019,10,14 September 2020,"Sometimes you view a Film that is pure Cinema, beautiful images, an emotional story and a delight to the senses. I am not sure what I thought this film would be like - maybe 'Carol'? But, no, this is a visual masterclass from start to finish. Given the Painting and Art theme it is little wonder that the film looks astounding, the cinematography is gorgeous and the backdrops carefully chosen to enhance the story. This is a pure love story involving two women utterly stuck in the rigid and stifling conventions of late18th Century France. An Artist is hired to paint a portrait of a woman so that she can be married off to a rich Milanese man. The Portrait must be undertaken in secret as the subject is unwilling to pose as she realises that, once completed, she is likely to be married shortly afterwards. The two woman slowly begin to understand each other and their relationship develops.
The two leads - Noemie Merlant and Adele Haenel - are absolutely superb and carry the emotional weight of the film. The reserve and stiff encounters of the time slowly give way to other feelings, not just love, but frustration, resignation and rage. The Writer/Director Celine Sciamma has captured perfectly the severe restrictions facing women of that time and the sad realisation that their forbidden love affair will only be a brief one.
The final scene requires absolutely no subtitles at all - Adele Haenel's Heloise sits in a concert hall - her face carries all of her painful emotions and regrets and memories. She is so engrossed that she fails to see her love staring at her from the other side of the hall - never has a cinema audience wanted more a character just to look to her left....
This Film is an extraordinary and emotional piece of 'Art' in every sense - and my personal choice of Best Film of 2019...",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
163,mick118,Beautiful but a bit boring,7,26 December 2020,Outstanding cinematography where most scenes are like a painting but the movie is slow and long and the story a bit boring. Good if you enjoy nice paintings.,Portrait of a Lady on Fire
164,LansTaylor,Page 28,10,28 March 2020,"I want to start off by saying that the final 10 minutes of the film is one of the best I've seen all year and 2019 had a lot of good ones. Heloise portrait with her kid and her finger on page 28 got me feeling some type of way. And then the emotions that Heloise was displaying while she was watching/listening to the orchestra was devastating. I'm not sure if she knew that Marianne was there or not, but for sure she remembers her old friend/lover. She doesn't regret the pain she's feeling about losing her lover but she remembers the first time Marianne played that piece for her on the piano (harpsichord?). The way Heloise looks at Marianne while she was playing was when, I believe, was the first time she wanted to kiss Marianne.
The ending scene was my favorite but a close second would have to be the bonfire scene; the cinematography was so good here. We follow the three characters and Heloise slowly falls behind the flames of the bonfire and now we are left with Marianne and Sophie. We see other girls paired off talking to each other, Sophie acknowledges one of them. Sophie and Marianne get to the nurse(?) and receives the news that she is still pregnant. Sophie follows this by downing a bottle of wine; I love the comedic relief that has for this tense sequence. Out of no where we hear a tension filled humming that sounds like a string was about to snap. This is the second time all movie that we hear music (there's only 3, I think). Heloise mentions earlier that she doesn't get to hear a lot of music at this place; I'm guessing the director wanted music to be sparse so that the audience could relate to Heloise when hearing music. Anyways, the humming gets louder and louder (right now my heart is racing) then two of the girls start singing, followed by two more, then three more. We finally see Heloise again on the opposite side of the flames and she locks eyes with Marianne; her dress catches on fire but she doesn't seem to care/notice. Fire is the universal symbol for love/passion and they both realize that they are in love with each other. The dress on fire implies that Heloise knows that she's in love but doesn't care about the consequences (she's to be married in a few days) and how their love is inappropriate and that this can only end one way, pain.
The Orpheus/Eurydice is the call back for the film's story. After Marianne hugs Heloise for their final goodbye, she immediately makes the poet's choice and runs out to keep her lovers memory pure. Before Marianne could make it out of the door, Heloise calls for Marianne from the steps above. Marianne is forced to turn around and make the lover's choice and see's Heloise in her wedding dress; throughout the film we see Heloise in her wedding dress but every time Marianne turns around, Heloise would disappear, she finally see that their relationship is over and Heloise is really going to get married.
I'm disappointed that France did not put this film up for nomination in the Best International film category for the Oscars.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
165,dtporter-886-883020,Pretentiously Beautiful,7,19 February 2021,"As a professional photographer and a pedestrian movie consumer, I found this film disturbing. The story touched me, but the exquisite photography distracted me. The photography enthralled me, but the story interfered with my viewing. I kept wanting to pause and enjoy, yet when I did: plot chaos ensued. I need to watch it twice, once for the story, and again for the virtual art gallery. But great art, and this Portrait Fire is great art, often dissolves with such bifurcation.It was a good lesson nonetheless. In this case, the visual art ascended the verbal art. I once attended a ballet where the music was written to underwrite the dance choreography. Until then, I had assumed dance must be fashioned after the music. How bigoted was I. Now I see the bigotry challenged again. Perhaps the story serves the photography...This portrait created a fire of discontent: aloneness, remembrance, and passion.

167,asen-75377,Took the artistic nature of cinema to a new height,9,25 December 2019,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a French historical romantic drama which takes dynamic of world cinema to a higher level.This movie implies that her disruptively seductive film will focus on the subject of its titular painting - an 18th-century woman Héloïse (Adèle Haenel) who refuses to pose, in defiance of the arranged marriage into which she's being forced - and a woman Marianne (Noèmie Merlant) who is hired to paint the portrait...this movie basically shows the story of a forbidden affair and how they fall in love but impel to be separated.After all Cèline Sciamma's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is a film about women made by a woman for women, which invites male and female spectators alike into the female gaze. This film is a moving painting and goes beyond just painterly beauty and hits hard into your emotional state of consciousness ..this movie is nothing short of a marvellous feat and one of the best movies of this year.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

172,mnogogaloshi,Portrait of a romance,7,20 May 2020,"Visually stunning with great screen chemistry between the leading actresses. I really like the distinctive vibe each character has and i believe that if you like to see personal movies, this one will be for you.It seems like the close up shots play an important part in the artistic vision of Sciamma. I feel like after watching the film i will have the faces of the characters in my memory forever. The camera loves to show us their every expression and this is how we understand a lot of whats happening inside of them. Words dont seem to be that important, because they are often deceptive and only lead to more confusion. The girls want to say a lot to each other, but arent really sure how to and this is recreated very well with the tempo of the story. Sciamma never rushes with the establishment of the different subplots and takes her time to make sure we are really into the atmosphere of the story.The movie tackles important issues of the 18th century that today seem to be just as relevant. We dont see men on the screen for the exception of a brief appearance at the end of the film. But nonetheless the influence of men is constantly present on screen, shaping the lives of our characters. They suffer from the constraints of being a woman in an age dominated by men.I enjoy the style and really like how truly artistic this movie is. Every shot is precise and every scene is a little piece of the bigger puzzle. The metaphor with the finishing of the portrait and finding love is great and works very well. I was truly curious to see what its going to look like in the end.But at the end i was left a bit conflicted. My issue with the film is that after a while it starts to feel a bit hollow and deprived from any direction. One one hand the story itself is worth telling and definitely has a lot of elements that deserve to be explored, but on the other i really dont think we see something we arent aware of. Here the circumstances of the story are more important than the story itself. Remove the painting process and youre left with an Impossible Romance. The subplot with the pregnancy and abortion feels very distant and somehow trivial and i feel it shouldve been more integral to the story.One of my favorite things about the film are the visions that Noemie is getting of Adele. It shows us how original and artistic Sciamma can be with the symbolism of the story.Overall stunning visuals with subtle, but powerful performances from the leads with a great amount of creative vision behind it.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

174,redcanofevil,Simply mesmerizing,9,24 December 2019,"When I finished Parasite(2019) I was so sure it was going to be my favourite foreign film of the year considering my negligence to foreign films. But what do you know it probably just got beaten.Portrait of a lady on fire is definitely not everyones cup of tea. It's quite slow, the plot isn't otherworldy, the pacing isn't satisfactory and it loses its charm at it's climax by a considerable amount.But what it is, is absolutely mesmerizing. It was so beautiful in fact I felt I was doing a disservice to the talented group of individuals that made the film by watching it in a dodgy print in a small monitor. It was so beautifully shot that I didn't feel bored even at the slightest at what should've been a very boring part of the film. The setting is picturesque and the cinematography is luscious. The score is absent but as I went and googled I found it was done for a reason. Truly and ""art film"".The use of color and set design greatly benefits the overall experience as does the timeperiod. The acting is simply marvelous. Both the actress really portrayed their characters to perfection, the subtle emotes and pale turned gleeful glances were superb. I don't know if those were award worthy performances but it definitely kept me glued to the seat delighted and mesmerized. The script was quite unusual, it doesn't have much dialogues but when there were those were sharper and absolutely unabashed. It's shot beautifully and a good example of a talented director at the helm.As beautiful as it looks and as much as the sexual tension was captivating, it was not flawless. The movies pacing is affected by a certain sidecharacters unnecessary arc which I couldn't care about even if I tried. It really drains out the magic of the film to quite a degree. Another disheartening thing is how the two leads fall for each other without much buildup. I mean it is not necessarily a spoiler as the movie is about lesbians in the 1800s but I felt the movie was more enjoyable and enchanting when there was sexual tension between them. When they get together it's down to the same cookie-cutter formula of forbidden love and it really drowns the movie quite a bit.Surely one of the most beautiful movies I've seen this year but a few overplayed elements and abrupt pacing at the last quarter of the film bogged it down quite a bit. It is still a treat to look at nonetheless. The rating might not go in line with the flaws I mentioned above but considering how it managed to draw me in with what should've been something really boring, I'd say it earned it.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

177,Go6565,Arty film that is actually artistic,7,4 July 2020,"This is a rare bird: an artsy film that is properly artistic (as well as being, in some small part, about art). This could have done with a little bit of extra weight to the dialogue, but it has a remarkably strong visual identity, both delicate and bright, bringing the feelings of the characters and the hopelessness of their situation relentlessly to the fore and examining them in brilliantly lit scenes. Everything about the film is gorgeous: composition, costumes, cinematography, the one musical interlude, locations. I could particularly appreciate the craftsmanship since the exteriors were filmed down the path from my granny's house and I could recognise the actual rocks that I used to clamber on as a kid; but in the real world, the light there is never as bright, and the sea never as gloriously turquoise as it is in the film.On the flip side, the two leads did not really convince me that they had as much mutual attraction as is necessary for the story, the dialogue is a little flat, and the film could maybe have been brought in under 1.5 hours, with a little less necking and longingly-gazing, without losing much impact.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

However, it isn't long before strong feelings and emotions come to the surface between the painter and the subject.This movie maps out like the creation of a painting. It truly is a film captured in the eye of an artist who uses their brush to bring human emotions and intense intimacy to life before our eyes. Characters equally flesh out and become exposed on screen like gentle brush strokes across a canvas, it's utterly breathtaking to watch. We get to observe the careful meditation between painter and the subject as well as the blooming of a forbidden love. Observation seems like the most romantic thing ever: it's love not lust. So much is said with small looks shared, slight expressions, wandering eyes and tiny gestures; moments are created from this and those moments seem to linger and fester in every perfectly framed shot. Before you know it a beautiful relationship- a flame if you will- has been and gone, extinguished right before us. Calling this relationship fleeting would be offensive to the level of its beauty but it does feel like it comes and goes so quickly to a painful extent. This film is all about the small and finite details: somehow the small sounds of a crackling fire and the scratching of chalk across a blank canvas build sexual tension until something honest and true manifests. The slow pace and soft editing just make the sexual tension even more sexually tense but I feel like you can't capture that kind of atmosphere in any other way it payed off more than anything. This movie is so soft and gentle that the classical music played at the end feels so harsh and so brutal, it felt like of the most brutal moments in cinema, it was so painful yet it was just a piece of classical music. Just such masterful decisions were made with this film: how does one create something so simple and yet so genius?",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The time period makes the romance forbidden and inevitably heartbreaking, but tender all the same. Both actresses give reserved yet intense performances. I can read from the smallest gestures and eye movements and understand exactly what they're feeling or thinking. The rest of the film around them is just as quiet and subtle. The only music heard is music playing in the actual world of the story. The sound of the ocean goes from blaring to not much more than ambience by the end. The role art plays in the relationship between Heloise and Marianne is also powerful. Painting represents perspective, memory, regret, personality and soul; a permanent link between both women.

190,bhaskarulichi,Listen to Vivaldi by watching your favourite paintings instead. Coz This film is an epitome of borefest.,1,4 October 2020,"""The Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is incredibly slow, excruciatingly boring and literally empty that only a handful of people in the world can actually watch it. This section of audiences include people from film fraternity, film academicians, critics, painters/artists, art film lovers and lesbians. This film had nothing to offer to audiences in general, be it in terms of entertainment or in an artistic sense. Adding to this, with barely any background score, this film is very hard to sit through (Forget about Entertainment/Enjoyment).The title, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is so misleading as it literally had nothing to do with what actually happens in the film. Even the painting she describes in the film as a Portrait of a lady on fire is actually a Landscape. Lol.In the very beginning of the film, when the painter is traveling on a boat to the island, one of her canvas falls into the sea. I was expecting one of the rowers (men) would jump into the sea to bring it back. Nope. Our strong female protagonist painter doesn't need any help. She jumps right into the sea and gets her canvas back. What does feminism has got to do with this scene? Not even today, if something like that happens, Men wouldn't allow a lady to jump into the sea. Because Men will be Men.In a nutshell, the film takes, luxuriously, around 1 hr to actually begin and takes another 1 hr to end. So, what happens in the middle? Nothing. The two ladies make love a couple of times & The painter finishes her assignment. Though, Two ladies become emotionally connected in the film, audiences were not given even a single scene to emotionally connect to the film.Coming to the climax, this film had a decent pre-climax where the Painter witnesses a painting of her lover, posing with her child and a book which had number 28 on it. The film could've very well ended there. But, nope. It ends with a very lengthy Shot where her lover breaksdown listening to Vivaldi at an Orchestra. Unlike Brokeback Mountain or Cinema Paradiso, the climax doesn't evoke any emotions at all. Because we don't get to know the connection between the characters and the famous Vivaldi Score. Apart from a single scene, there's nothing that actually connects the characters with the score. I personally felt that the climax is a fiasco as anybody can become emotional when they listen to classical music & Vivaldi had no in-depth emotional connection to memories of her lover. {Unlike Brokeback Mountain where Health Ledger breaksdown carrying Jake Gyllenhaal's Shirt and in Cinema Paradiso, where Salvatore gets emotional while watching a montage of censored kisses from his childhood favorite films, the filmmaker, here is too lazy to write anything unique that she forcibly tried to invoke audiences emotions through an already famous classical masterpiece}PS: To understand the meaning of number 28, one should watch this film. But I strongly recommend not to watch this ""lazily made"" film at any cost. Unless someone forcibly make you watch at a gunpoint.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The central relationship is crafted both beautifully and patiently by Sciamma. Sometimes less is more in dialogue and plot terms and this is a shining example of that.

195,Screenthoughts,Movie Review: Portrait of a Lady on Fire,9,6 November 2020,"Little Women and Portrait of a Lady on Fire, which recently arrived in US movie theaters, have more in common than being on the top of most lists about the best female-directed films in 2019. Both movies deal with the pressure for marriage and, more specifically, with marriage as ""an economic proposition"" for women, as the young March sister, Amy (Florence Pugh), describes in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel.In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Marianne (Noémie Merlant) travels to a remote French island to paint a portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), which will be sent to an Italian nobleman in hopes of sealing the marriage arranged by her mother, La Comtesse (played by veteran Italian actress Valeria Golino). Héloïse had been contently living in a convent before being summoned home to fulfill the destiny first designed for her older and recently-deceased sister - an irrelevant replacement in a business-like transaction in which the couple-to-be does not know each other.The promised bride had already refused to pose for a previous artist, in an attempt to avoid the wedding by preventing the creation of the required ""business card."" Marianne is introduced as a companion for the young lady's walks, and instructed to study and memorize her subject's face, and paint the marriage portrait in secret. This dynamic transforms the movie into what the director and screenwriter Céline Sciamma calls ""a manifesto about the female gaze,"" in which painter and subject collaborate to create art together. And in Héloïse and Marianne's world, the long walks by the sea quietly turn into love and desire.If Greta Gerwig uses a golden glow to separate the March sisters' childhood from their adulthood, in its lyric film Sciamma portrays the life of her characters in a mix of light and shadow, which Claire Mathon's cinematography uses to turn each scene into a painting. Between bright and dark moments, the couple enjoys the days before Marianne's scheduled departure, sometimes including in their private world and partnership Sophie (Luàna Bajrami), the house's young maid who is dealing with a female problem of her own.
With few options and little say over their own destiny, Marianne and Héloïse have to accept the ""poet's choice,"" as Marianne describes the Greek myth Orpheus, of creating memories that they can keep and cherish for the rest of their lives.The stories of Little Women and Portrait of a Lady on Fire are separated by almost a century, with the first taking place in US civil-war era and the latter circa 1770. Nevertheless, seen through 21st century's eyes, the discussions about the role of women in society that inform both films remain surprisingly - and sadly - relevant.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
196,syahputraeqqi,Beautiful Potrayal of Art!,9,22 August 2020,"This movie is really beautiful. all the aspects in this film amaze me, all of them really fulfill the artistic aspects, according to the main subject. The plot is almost the same as 'call me by your name', but for me, this film brings out more beauty and has a better appeal. All the characters here are so charming, I like the fact that around the first 30 minutes there isn't any interaction between the 2 lead characters, even they haven't met at all. But the connection and the metaphors they provide are brilliant. You will be able to quickly understand what each character is feeling, and of course you will quickly fall in love with the character.there is no scoring throughout the film, except for the last scene with the orchestra. Even without scoring, I don't think you will need a touch of scoring anyway, because the aesthetics of the cinematography that is displayed will already be very indulgent to watch this film. The framing and color palette are very aesthetic, I feel in love with every shot and scene. Truly one of the best films of 2019.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The bride is filled with anger over her sister's recent suicide and the fact that she's been promised to a man she's never met. Over the course of the artist's stay, the two become close - first, as friends and then, as something more.The entire film is shot like a painting itself and the sound design is simply stunning with no music whatsoever until a final, breathtaking moment which makes it all the more powerful.

203,Jonah_R,I was disappointed,3,11 May 2020,"I was very excited to watch this movie after all the buzz it received and all the great reviews you can find everywhere. On all sites where I looked this movie was praised to heaven, so it was obvious for me to watch it and I went in it without much prior knowledge about this movie.First of all, I needed three attempts to sit through this movie or ""Piece of Art"" how some call it. The first two times I simply fell asleep and this is not something that happens often when I watch movies. I think the last time it happened was when I watched ""Jack and Jill"". But I must say that this movie looks really really gorgeous and is visually really beautiful. The costumes are nice, the setting is great and the cinematography is fantastic and each shot is magnificant and something special that wants to show you exaclty what you need to know and to see, so everything has its purpose to display the emotional state of the characters or the feelings they want to express. And the score also does a fanatstic part in creating the atmosphere. I give it that. Sadly thats it basically, because it seems that this is everything this movie wanted to achieve. Delivering fantastic shots which show you everything you need to know while the plot slowy unfolds next to it. And yes, it does that, but it is like watching grass grow or a painting dry, because there still isnt much going on. And a possibility of why I was so disappointed is simply the reason I stated in the beginnig. I was so hyped about this movie that it just couldnt live up to my expectations and that I expected something that it couldnt deliver.This is a love story about two women from ""different worlds"" that start to fall in love, even though there are not supposed to, because of the life that is predestined for one of them, and that they have to come to the realization, that you need to say goodbye at some point and let the ones you love go. And that is basically all this movie is about storywise. The struggle they both experience during their time together and how they have to handle their emotions while beeing surrounded by few other people. And this is where the bad things start. I simply can not stand love storys, which was a huge let down. For me the overall acting and the facial expressions seemed a bit emotionless and bland most of the time. This led to the fact that I simply didnt care for the figures and I could not connect with them. And dont let me start talking about the plot. It was as predictable as it was boring and it was a torture to sit through this. And I like slow paced movies where I get an amazing conclusion at the end, where everything comes together, so that it is worth to sit through the movie. But this time my patience was not rewarded. Nothing to make up for the time I struggled through this movie was waiting for me at the end and only the nice shots and the cinematography couldnt make up for this,Still, I am glad that I formed my own opinion about this movie and it was definitly an experience and something different. You should also form your own opinion and if you are in to love storys this might be something for you, but for me the movie didnt work and the only nice things about it were the cinematography and the score, which elevated this to at least 3 put of 10 stars.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

206,veeckasinwreck,Like watching paint dry,3,2 March 2020,"To be fair, it is not completely terrible. A lot of it is visually arresting; many of the scenes are composed in a satisfying manner and when we see the paint being applied to the canvas, that holds our interest for a time, although not nearly long enough to justify the length of these scenes.
It brings to mind films like ""Black Swan"" and ""The English Patient"", which were similarly incoherent, static, and wrongheaded but got great reviews by pandering to the audience, implicitly praising the movie goer with high-flown cultural references (""I like this film because I am so deep. I get all the High Culture stuff; this movie is for people with a profound artistic soul-like me!""). In the case of ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"", the cultural touchstones are the ""Orfeo"" myth and Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"". Interestingly, all these films promise an erotic experience, but fail to deliver because none of the characters bear any resemblance to real human beings.
There is a discussion of Orfeo in which one of the main characters fatuously pronounces that Orfeo looked back at Euridice because he was at heart an artist, not a lover. This is the movie in a nutshell, a mock-profound statement that becomes more and more meaningless the more you think about it.
There is nothing resembling a plausible conversation in ""Lady on Fire"". Most of what is said consists of aphorisms that would fit nicely inside a fortune cookie. There is a halfhearted stab at feminism, as the women create an idealized society when they can live in a wonderful world without men, and there is a subplot involving abortion, airlifted in from some other movie.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Cinematography, colors, overall aesthetic part of the movie is very special and one of the most beautiful I've ever seen on screen. Another strong side is the astonishing beauty of the main characters. Their skin, hair, eyes, holding, etc. One of the main motives of the movie are female gaze and the question: ""If you look at me, who do I look at?"". This movie is, from my perspective strange and different, the plot is set in awkward undefined time and place, with some holes in the script, without a whole explanation, perhaps a little bit bizarre. That whole scenery is wonderful but not enough. Overall, nice, slow movie if you want rest your eyes on the beautiful shots and colors, with a lot undertext, which is left to the viewer's interpretation.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The acting performance of the two leading actrices Noémi Merlant and Adèle Haenel is superb. There are also very beautiful woman to look at, especially Merlant is one of the most gorgeous looking actrices I have ever seen.Although I am a hetero man, I was totally involved with the moving love affair between Marianne and Héloïse.I did read a lot of reviews about this film, which were almost all very praising. And I was already enchanted after seeing the trailer at the cinema.
I went to see the movie in a very small theatre of a small cinema. But there was no seat anymore left for this true masterpiece. The public was very quiet during the presentation of the film. This is always a good sign. It is actually a shame that these kind of movies are not shown on a big stage. However, it is perhaps even better to see 'Portrait de la jeune fille en feu' in an intimate environment.I was moved the whole way long, and especially the end was so strong and left me and a lot of people in tears.This is by far the best movie that I did see in 2019.
My personal top 20 of movies that I all have seen at the cinema:
1. Portrait de la jeune femme en feu
2. Green Book
3. Dolor y gloria
4. If Beale Street Could Talk
5. The Wild Pear Tree
6. Roma

Not at all in my top 20: Der Goldene Handschuh; High Life; Gloria Bell; Joker; Teen Spirit; Border; Midsommar; Sunset.So leave your house and try to see this marvellous painting of a movie at the cinema, because the cinematography and beautiful 'painted shots' are so much better to admire there than at home.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
216,Jackthemovielover,Very satisfying film to watch,9,24 February 2020,"An excellent film, and little could be improved. It is satisfying in that nearly every scene and minute was visually attractive and contributed to a fascinating story. The actresses were a pleasure to watch, and nearly every aspect of the craft of film-making was done justice in the completed product. Even the housemaid was excellent in her supporting role. The pacing of the dialogue was unusually slow, but it was clear that this supported the thoughtfulness and the characters and was consistent with the slower pace of life in that period. I relied on the subtitles, as I don't speak French, but I had no trouble understanding nearly every conversation in the script. Only two suggestions come to mind if I were to try to improve the film. First, there were almost no male characters portrayed, and they seemed one-dimensional when they appeared. Somewhat curious, considering that they were quite influential in that time period. Second, the nudity that was shown, especially when the painter dried herself by the fire, seemed gratuitous, without contributing to the excellent storytelling. I suspect this was added to garner support for the rating or to boost the audience, as it is so common to portray young actresses in this way. Perhaps not the choice of the director at all, which would also be curious, because the film was a strong statement about women and the roles allowed at that time. These minor weaknesses did not detract from the film significantly, and I would still recommend this film to almost anyone. By the way, even with the nudity, it is appropriate for children, as long as the parent explains the context. It is a powerful love story between two women, but as a man I found it resonated with my heterosexual feelings about relationships too. Even children could understand this story, although they may need a few tips to get the subtleties.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

219,lordbaldrick,Awesome lack of score makes it even better than perfect,10,24 December 2019,"What strikes me most, besides its absolute perfection, is the lack of film score.There's absolutely zero BGM. Because it doesn't need it.Hollywood blockbusters rely too much on BGM. Too many pitty films get away with idiotic story lines and dreadfully written characters by inserting film scores which basically play out like emotional cue for your average film goer.Portrait of a Lady on Fire is none of that. Music only happens 3 times in the plot, so you get 3 scenes with music. And the 1st one is only setting up the last one. But my lord when it happens it shakes you!It doesn't need BGM because the script, acting and story telling are so gripping that it doesn't need any music to pump up the viewers. Not a lot actually happens in the story but the characters are so relatable, it makes Marriage Story look like a drama student's homework.And cinematography is so beautiful it's like a Vermeer with Botticelli's girls in it.It has to be in the top 3 of 2019 films. In my opinion Portrait is way better than Parasite, especially in film score. Portrait is at least 2 levels above Parasite in that regard.This is a ""small"" film made to perfection. It's a joy to know such art exists.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
220,patrickbateman-84347,How i saw it.,6,16 January 2021,The Portait of a Lady on Fire is about a painter who tries to paint a young lady who is about to get married without her knowing. The cinematography deserves a prize the screen was literally a painting the colors were just amazing. Because the young lady doesn't know that the painter tries to paint her she thinks she is her friend and the painter tries to paint just by looking at her while they are together this really get you in the mood to try to visualize her characteristics as well. The movie has no music(except some scenes) and its pretty silent while the dialogues are slow and clear giving you the whole vibe of isolation. I was feeling through out the first half of the movie that I am going to painter her as well and I found my self noticing little details about her. The second half I didn't like it tho when the romance unravels between the painter and the lady I lost the whole excitement about the movie and become a boring romance in my opinion. I found it completely unnecessary . The scenes about the oldshool type abortions where really shocking. I think the movie started well but didn't end well. I recommend it tho I think that some people are going to find it a masterpiece definitely not me.,Portrait of a Lady on Fire

226,kdlprod75018,Nice Beginning & Great Ending... Middle part is boring... Overrated,5,21 May 2020,"As many have pointed out, the cinematography although pretty static is very nice in 'The Portrait of a Lady on Fire', almost every shot is carefully framed with a specific intent to create illusion, tension, mystery, magic or confrontation. So in terms of cinematography, I would give it a 3.5-4 star out of 5 given its limited budget.
It is a period piece although it could have been any ancient period as there are very few scenes outside of the confines of a house/mansion and by the seashore/cliffs on an isolated island somewhere in the West coast of France in Brittany.
The main things that make it a period piece are the rather subdued but colorful dresses and the rather dated way the main characters speak to each other in French, using the 'vous' tense for 'you' and sometimes awkward old-dated phrasing in their dialogue with one another.
I believe that this movie was mainly celebrated and generously awarded because it is a lesbian movie that is great for identity politics in our time and age. Don't get me wrong, I do love some great LGBTQ+ movies such as 'Blue is the warmest color' or 'Call me by your name'. Alas, 'Le portrait de la jeune fille en feu' bears little of the qualities that these aforementioned recently celebrated movies have.
The acting by Noemie Merlant is very fine nevertheless and well, I'm not totally convinced by actress Adele Haenel's performance.
Script wise, it is a rather non-eventful movie for the most of its 120-min runtime... The reward is in the last 15-min or so of the movie where there is a sense of time having past, and the overwhelming weight of it. The ending is very beautiful and powerful and makes the movie watching rewarding. It is quite baffling as to why this movie won the Best Screenplay at Cannes in 2019... politics probably.
So in short, you can watch the first 5-mins and pretty much go on and off for 1h30 without missing much of the plot, and then enjoy the last 15-min. It took me three watchings to actually finish the movie... yet I'm a film buff who loves a great art-house film... I love the criterion collection movies and don't mind slow moving movies whatsoever... But there's a tendency these days to conflate good movies with good looking movies that ultimately fall short and rather blend... The Portrait of a Lady on Fire falls in the latter category... It is a well acted, well shot, well intentioned movie with decent acting from the main actress (the painter) with a nice reference to a well known mythological story (Orpheus & Eurydice) that lacks much of any kind of emotional or eventful pulse except for the beginning and the end... Precious but Intellectually and emotionally blend without the rewarding ending... a shame really, all the ingredients were there... However, I can understand though that it is a good introduction for younger audiences to what art-house films can be... don't just stop there... go watch much better movies than this one if you've enjoyed it... There are so many of them out there... a shame this one is being highlighted much more than others though... Still it's a decent movie and good effort, yet totally overrated, so 5 out 10 for me.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Eyes looking, and then looking away at the canvas and in this case, each other. I saw the relationship between the two as the work of art. Relationships are very unique and sometimes hard to paint, as a viewer we see their relationship being painted, there's a story. The frustrations and the beauty are gently portrayed with attention to human detail. Very minimal (no music) and somewhat calming (no testosterone perhaps) with most frames looking like a painting.

This has been happening more often in recent years. This is a French film about a woman who has to secretly paint the portrait of another woman who about to be married off to a wealthy gentleman in Milan but she doesn't want to be married off so she's refusing to pose for the portrait. This is a quiet slow burn exquisite film. Chris Stuckmann was right when he described every shot of this film as being lush (he actually said ravishing but either way both words are accurate with this film) because it is and they are. This is a quiet portrayal of what life was like for women in 18th Century France from the day to day stuff to the little interactions to the far deeper emotional things that by law, culture, social convention, technology, etc. severely limited women at the time and it slowly builds up to a forbidden romance. It's also about art, painting, love, music, poetry, just go see this film. It's a different experience and surreal and ethereal to watch a movie that is so quiet but that speaks volumes.

243,jabberwhack,A sublime film about the female gaze and experience,10,19 November 2019,"I had the opportunity to go see a movie I'd been dying to watch, Portrait de la jeune fille en feu by Céline Sciamma, a French director I admire very much. It was well worth the wait! Like her other films, it's subtle, nuanced, elegant, it centers women's narratives and touches upon themes of queerness and gender. It's a exquisite movie about the female gaze (and also female desire, friendship, solidarity, love, secrets, passion, and intomacy).
The plot goes like this: in the 18th century, a female painter (Marianne) is hired to paint the portrait of a young woman (Héloïse) in order for the said portrait to be sent to Héloïse's would-be husband. This becomes an excuse for two intelligent, beautiful women to stare at each other intensely, longingly for hours. The desire and flirtation had me on the edge of my seat.
The movie is a huis clos. During most of it, you only see 3-4 women together, somewhere on the coast of France in an empty castle. (The first time a man appears on screen, it's almost shocking.) They play cards, read to each other and discuss the meaning of stories, go swimming, take care of female issues, and of course, fall hopelessly in love.
The difference made by a female director was obvious to me throughout the entire film, but one detail was especially telling: at some point, the painter wakes up at night in pain. In the next scene, she's sitting in the kitchen, and the servant gives her some warmed up dry peas wrapped up in a cloth so she can soothe the pain. She is having menstrual cramps. I don't think I ever saw a depiction of menstrual pain on a screen ever in the near 1000 movies I've warched!
The movie reminded me of the Virgin Suicides in the way it told the story of women who feel trapped (but this time, the observer is a woman, not some hapless dude), of The Piano on account of the period it's set in, the water, the unspoken desire, and maybe a bit of Persona (though a loving take on two women alone together and studying one another). Prepare yourself for a lot of sexy, poignant, heartbreaking cinema about women and made by women!!!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
244,HenrikBakke94,The connection between art and love.,10,15 December 2020,"The story of ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is mostly told through cinematography. The way the characters stares at each other really transfers the tension growing between them to the viewer. This plays out brilliant in the way the characters unfolds and start to see each other as equals, both in real life and in the making of the portrait.The cinematography, which is done by Clarie Mathon, resembles a classic piece of art, a sort of a moving portrait of the lives of french women in the late 1700's. As a big fan of cinematographic storytelling, I must say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
245,Texan_man,"Grandiose and Impossible, and Beautiful",9,13 July 2020,"I like to challenge myself in film. Yes, there are times I swallow film like comfort food, but there are definitive times I want to be taken out of my comfort zone. I want to be forced to see things in a new way, from across the divide, in the shoes and stilettos of the other.If you feel like me, then I recommend writer-director Céline Sciamma's entrancing historical romance about a young painter and her subject. It's a perceptive, erotic exploration of power, and about as far from my comfort zone as you can get. However, by focusing tightly on specifics, Sciamma has found the key to universal appeal in the unique, tiny details of story and character.It drew me in because I was fascinated. I know little about French philosophy and Greek myth on the mandates of human love, but as a human, I have loved, and my own experiences have given me an insight that has only ever considered my own gaze on the subject of my heart.But here, as painter and subject begin to swap roles, Sciamma forces us to question our biased gaze in this itellectually erotic study of power and passion in which observed becomes observer, returning time and again to a central question: ""Do you see the person I see when I look at you?""There are no answers, or if there are, they would be like this mesmerizing glimpse into another era and world, grandiose, almost impossible, yet deeply, movingly beautiful.

247,danielnikrasov,The Inception of a Genius Female,10,7 August 2019,"I watched this film at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and it was worth it. First, before the review, I want to point out that the movie touched my heart very much. Every scene and scene is pure and very real. The characters in the movie were a revelation to me and I don't doubt that the cast of the two main actresses, as I will explain below, impressed me greatly. Without wasting time, we set off!* This Review does not include spoilers *Portrait of a Lady on Fire, directed by Céline Sciamma (Fascinating, by the way) is a period love drama that takes place in 18th century France, when Marianne (the impressive Noémie Merlant), a beautiful young painter, is hired to paint the portrait of Eloise (Adèle Haenel is a high-class revelation) for her upcoming wedding. However, Eloise is not interested in getting married, and therefore refuses to cooperate with the wedding preparations in general, and with the portrait painting in particular. Marianne decides to hide the fact that she is a painter and presents herself as a companion designed to stir Eloise's time. At the same time, she watches her day after day and paints her secretly.The film is a visual poetry, with a feast for the ears and eyes, each richly textured frame and unique sound design, overpowering the most immersive viewing experience, and I recommend watching cinema instead of sitting in front of a small screen on the comfy couch at home. Every theme in the movie about love and self-discovery of the characters is serious and powerful, the dialogues between the characters are very interesting and very honest. The atmosphere in the film is both realistic and clearly poetic. The relationship between the two main characters is exceptional and also helps build the character of the characters. Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel's cast are a revelation and don't see it every day, which makes me want to see them in more movies. Claire Methon's photography was very wonderful, reflecting the historical background of 18th century France.
The ending left a mark on the film and this is one of the most amazing and exciting endings I've ever seen.Had the film been written and directed by someone else (even if it is a man or a woman), the film would have felt fake and pathetic, and the relationship between the characters would have been unreliable. Fortunately, here comes Sciamma, whose feminine perspective and innovative demeanor transform what could have been a time-lapse into the powerful power of art, the enhancement of feminist cinema and the empowerment of modern and early audiences. There were some notable interactions in the film that one, I think, hint at the end of the film, such as a discussion of the significance of the Orpheus and Orodice Greek myth debate. From this it can be concluded that Siama's passion and humanity shows that it is the director's unflattering vision that is her most poetic.Full of people wonder why the movie is named after that. The truth is, the movie has a lot of meaning. First and foremost, this refers to an actual portrait drawn by the main protagonist, Marianne, but he also cites the film as a cinematic study of the lady in question, Lewis, whose dress is on fire at one point, as if the love and passion she experienced towards Marianne made her shatter Spontaneously brooding.The film won the Best Screenplay Award and the Queer Palm Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and it deserved to win at all costs.""Portrait of the Girl on Fire"" is the most genuine and sincere artistic film I have seen in the past decade and in my opinion the most LBGT movie I have ever experienced. This movie is a must watch movie and not home, remember well.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

249,reginadonk,Rather like looking at a painting,6,1 November 2019,"This movie is a French period piece and it tells the simple tale of a female artist commissioned to paint the future wife of a Duke. The artist travels to the woman's seaside place of residence and the movie covers the period of the painting of the canvas and the initially touchy, but ultimately loving, relationship that develops between these two young women.
The setting is intimate, the cast is small, and the plot is almost wafer-thin. The pace is almost painfully sedate, but one gradually becomes accustomed to it, and to appreciate the opportunity to soak in the imagery, and the detail (Rather like looking at a painting, I guess)
The cast is almost exclusively female, as is the director, and this is clearly a deliberate and dedicated woman's movie, in every sense. However, any man who actually likes women will have no problem being entertained and ultimately rewarded by giving this film a watch.
Naturally any kind of open love between two women of social status was never going to be a potential option in the 18th century, so how are these two going to reconcile the passion that emerges between them. This is the only plot device and jeopardy element. Not much to work with, but I felt that this was a statement by the producers to show that in the woman's realm deep feelings go a longer way than plot twists and high dudgeon.
The acting is controlled and meaningful, the interior settings are explored to the point that you almost fill in the smells yourself, and the sequences at the beach linger long enough that you begin bracing yourself against the coastal winds. The high-point of the film is when the community of women gather on a cliff to associate, drink a bit, and sing a particularly haunting mantra-like song.
My all time favourite film (La Belle Noiseuse - Long version) also attempts to capture an artist busy in the process of painting a picture. It is not an easy thing to do on film. Naturally I believe my favourite movie does, but does this film achieve that too? Well, to a point, although, for me, the creation of the picture here is more a metaphor for the falling in love, than about the artistic pursuit as of itself.
Did I enjoy watching this film? Yes, I did, but a week later I am struggling to recall more that a few vivid moments or to reconnect with it on an emotional level.
A worthy film certainly, an important woman's work for sure, but one to be more admired than ever relished.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

She is tasked with painting the portrait of the mysterious Heloise (Adele Haenel) who is soon to be wed to a stranger against her will. Heloise has refused all previous attempts to pose, so Marianna must paint her from memory.

266,kerrielou,If Kubrick had a sister.,10,7 May 2020,"I love Stanley Kubrick films, but I've been frustrated for a long time that his depictions of the feminine are so idealized. The smiling mother or wife with her long hair and dress spinning between sheets of laundry. While his portrayal of men is brutally honest and painfully complex, his portrayal of women betrays him. It's hard to talk about art without comparing one artist with another and I hate it that I have to compare Céline Sciamma with a man, but because the playing field is virtually all men that's the reality.This film is ""The Thin Red Line"" level beautiful. It is truly a masterpiece and it is everything I've longed for from a Kubrick film he could not only not make, but likely has no desire to, nor is it his responsibility.In the same way Kubrick virtually ignores the concept of a woman as a unique individual, Sciamma does the same with men. With the exception of a few rowers in the beginning and a courier at the end, there are almost no men in this film. It is both a stand alone piece of exquisite art (every frame is a painting indeed) and an exploration of women not portrayed in contrast, opposition, or in cooperation with men, but on their own. While the reality of masculine dominance dictates their lives, their shrugging acceptance of it leaves the characters free to be individuals with no regard for man as a person. The lack of fight actually removes men from the equation almost entirely. They are a nameless, generic force in their lives. As individuals they do not exist. That erasure leaves nothing but the women and their universe is every bit as intense, painful, joyful, conflicted, and complex as the universe of men.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The scenery shown appear to be taken out straight from a oil painting, and even the most intimate scenes are shot whit gentle artistic touch. The main plot (in general) may be nothing ground breaking, but what the movie lacks in innovation it pays off by being gorgeous.The dialogues were too short for my taste. Maybe that was the director's intentions, to make us spectators earning for more. In some scenes, I did not understand what the dialogue was referring to, maybe the problem here was my subtitles version or maybe the writers should have been more clear about what they are trying to say.Both actresses (Noémie Merlan and Adèle Haenel) are extraordinary in their roles.

Adele Haenel does not carry emotions properly, imposing her own personality, which does not fit the story. The sets are poor rather than minimalist and the compositions do not add anything to what was there to take. Photography could have been so great.
The story is emaciated and shallow. Without the modern politics attached to the main role and movie crew, It is likely that nobody would have found it interesting. This movie will not change anything for anybody, making it artistically forgettable. Something was to be told there but never really was. We got stuck at the ""summer romance"" level.
""The Favourite"" or ""Blue is the warmest color"" are much stronger and well-crafted movies on the same topic. ""La belle noiseuse"" remains the absolute reference for painter/model relationships, with also a very slow rhythm but so much more suggested and felt, especially through the painting scenes. I'm sure this Jacques Rivette movie was in the mind of Céline Sciamma when she directed.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
275,Nymeria_Meliae,Boring,2,18 April 2020,"I found this film excruciatingly boring. I didn't even find the cinematography that interesting either. I understood the film's purpose and what the director was trying to achieve. I think a lot of the tedium was deliberate in order to produce the final ending, but it was painful to watch a film for that long for the moment at the end. It is not the most boring film I've watched because there is some interest in it... but it was a difficult watch and I just don't agree with the other reviews that each frame was a painting.

But what could be more conflicting than being so completely torn and helpless that not a single thought, no light turns on in one's head to ignite the notion of an escape? An escape to being content was impossible in their time and it played out as realistically as it should have. One has to live in their own torture. Then again, at the end, is it really torture?Everything about this film is gorgeous; the language, the cinematography, the acting, their chemistry, the writing. And it was so refreshing to be disappointed in a good way. I say good because the movie is about resilience as well. The main characters in this are truly remarkable. This movie is near perfect.I say near perfect because there was a single moment I wanted to see something more happen between them, if you catch my drift, but that more that I wanted turned out to be so much less than what the film actually gave from that time throughout the rest of the movie. It was an incredible experience, a wonderful feeling where I held my breath countless times.

Thats how I interpreted the movie. You have to say goodbye to someone you love sooner or later. You might want to do the impossible and bring them back from the depths of underworld (like Orpheus) or try and get them to rebel against dominant societal norms (resisting marriage). But when it is impossible, you shouldnt cause them pain by encouraging rebellion against a fate set in stone.

There are no flaws to it that I can think of. Every detail of Portrait of a Lady on Fire emanates the undying passion between the two. Noémie Merlant (Marianne) and Adèle Haenel (Héloïse) give such beautifully emotional performances. So much can be interpreted from their relationship, giving the idea of ""art imitating life"" a completely new meaning. The film production itself is of such a high quality that I find it hard to make any comparisons. The thematic designs and shot compositions stood out to me in a way that caused me to overanalyze all that was happening. Did the colors of dresses represent something else that I missed?Not a single frame was wasted it seemed. I can think back to a few scenes that struck me as simply incredible. The two standing by the cliff's edge as the waves roared. The affection shown for each other subtlety though eye contact and silent pauses. Other little things added so much to this film, such as the constant flickering of fireplaces, and the footsteps on the wood flooring, adding to the immersion of it all. I loved that not everything was obvious, leaving some aspects up to the interpretation of viewers, like what happened to Héloïse's sister, or the rather ambiguous yet satisfying conclusion. Something I wonder is if the dialect of their French was similar to that of the time period (18th Century), with what was utilized in Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse.In this, much of the dialogue was composed from how actual lighthouse keepers and sailors talked back then, taken from written accounts. I bring up this because it has been what I considered to be the best movie of last year, but now I am starting to think that Portrait of a Lady on Fire is my new favorite of 2019. Its awards and praises are well deserved, and I look forward to seeing director Céline Sciamma's other work.

The ""white gown"" scenes are extremely unsettling as the painting of the lady on fire at the beginning which looks like something from a nightmare. At times I felt genuinely scared.

285,shalomsk,Have you known love?,9,26 August 2021,"Céline Sciamma's Potrait of a Lady on Fire is a technically strong and lyrically accented film about an intimate romance between two women during the course of a few weeks on an island in Brittany. Intimate not just in the scope of how the scenes play out but also in terms of the setting. There are but a few places where the scenes unfold and apart from a glimpse or two of some other participants, the cast stays confined to four major players. The story revolves around Marianne, a painter, who is commissioned by a widowed countess to paint a wedding portrait for a suitor in Milan, of her daughter Héloïse, who is not too keen on the idea of marriage and is grieving from the loss of her sister. Her mother, during a conversation with Marianne, says the marriage will present Héloïse with an escape from boredom. How wondrous then, that as the film goes on, we see Héloïse achieve exactly that not in the act of leaving...but of someone else entering. One of the early exchanges in the film involves Marianne playing one of her favorite pieces on a harpsichord for a onlooking Héloïse, with a gentle fire burning in the background as they lock eyes from time to time. Fire, thus, becomes an important motif in the film signifying desire, destruction, tenderness, warmth, and love. During another scene with locked gazes, Héloïse's dress literally catches fire. What is easy to miss is that as much as Marianne is painting Héloïse, Héloïse too seems to conjuring up paintings of her own. There are extensive shots of Marianne carefully studying her subject's face, contours, shadows and continually working and reworking her piece, manipulating her hand and fingers to reproduce the enigmatic beauty of this lady. Héloïse seems to be employing a tactic of her own - painting Marianne with her eyes. She is as much an acute observer as her painter, paying close attention to how she touches forehead, how she breathes, how she raises her eyebrows. It's almost as if she knew, with precise certainty, how important all of it would end up being for her. The last shot of the film features a magnificent display of flowing emotion by Adèle Haenel. Marianne attends a play with Héloïse present in attendance too, seated at the opposite end. Marianne gazes at her, her gaze not met with reciprocation. ""He made the poet's choice"", opines Marianne, in an earlier scene that features a reading of ""Orpheus and Eurydice"" in front of the fireplace in the kitchen, when Sophie (the servant) wonders out loud why Orpheus turned back to look at Eurydice. Sophie feels as though he had no reason. We then think about, at the end of the film, the reason for why Héloïse doesn't look back at Marianne. Perhaps, she made the painter's choice, choosing to keep the image of her love alive and well in the deep trenches of her soul. . There is a third painter too though, one we never really see, whose work runs at a crisp two hours and forbids our looking away: Sciamma herself. She along with the team ensure that while you may fault this film for maybe moving with too languid and gentle a pace, what you can't fault it for is being an eyesore. The camerawork here, at times doubling for Marianne's eyes, is excellent with the frames looking beautiful despite the muted colors. As for the performances, though Héloïse is the more intriguing character, it is Noémie Merlant whose performance captivates the most. There is a deceptive effortlessness in her performance, as she very confidently navigates Marianne's many emotions - her anger, her fascination, her frustration. It's all on display here and is a delight to witness. That's not to say Haenel is far behind...that last shot alone isn't just a signifier of her ability to hold a frame but also hold our gaze simultaneously. However, in some scenes I did feel that she injected a slight masculinity in her character that felt a little misplaced. Luàna Bajrami manages to make an impression as well. It's a mark of some commendable writing that her character doesn't feel out of place or unwelcome. Technically brilliant, well written and beautifully performed, Portrait of a Lady on Fire must be witnessed by anyone who has ever felt love.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The dialogue is soporific, the acting is so wooden that the Californian redwoods pale into insignificance in comparison.Just as an example, 8 minutes into the movie, there is a scene of the woman, naked in front of a fireplace, smoking a pipe, with 2 canvases drying either side of her. Utter self indulgent refuse of the highest order.How this movie got an average of 8.3, I will never know. Perhaps all the Carsten Janckers who go to Cannes and drool over cinematic dross piled onto IMDB in their droves?There are so many good movies that hail from our Gallic neighbours, unfortunately, it's because of festering celluloid cow-pats such as this which garner attention with golden globe and oscar noms , that most cinema viewing folk stay well clear of anything French.

I've always loved female centred movies and this being a female only movie makes it even more special. I watched this movie not knowing what to expect and I'm surprised by how fine this turned out to be despite the fact that it had so limited characters and very few locations.

Which is more than can be said for this which is all if those things. There is Zero character development.Minimal plot. Nice cinematography but nothing visually original or surprising. The acting is perfunctory and over directed. It is a hollow and meretricious exercise which many modern arthouse cinema goers mistake for real cinema.

297,amelielapointe,Retourne-toi,10,27 December 2019,"This movie reminded me of the basic principles of cinema, of what differentiates it from mere entertainment and makes it art.
It makes everything simple and immensely dense at once. What it does best - the beautiful landscape shots, the sensible dialogue, the nuance with every sigh, every whisper - it seems to do effortlessly. It often doesn't look rehearsed (I think Céline Sciamma even mentioned that she wanted the dialogue to seem improvised), it's filled with silences during which the characters look at each other, they truly look, as if the study prior to painting transcends into reality. At one point it becomes unclear whether Marianne is observing Héloïse because she has to or because she wants to. We see it all happen : slowly at first, and then without restraint, in a commotion. Something blooms in the characters' eyes.
There is an emotional movement in the film that is independent from any medium other than the image. There are no soaring strings to help elevate the emotion. It stays raw, and we can't help but live it with the characters as it is. We are never shielded from reality. Instead, we are forced to keep our feet firmly planted as every scene delightfully unfolds right in front of us. Music appears only twice, otherwise the music is the language, the sound of waves, the sound of breaths, the sound of paintbrush against canvas. The long takes are so steady and delicate, you might not even notice them until the cuts takes you by surprise (this shows how seldom they seem to occur). There is a sense of huis clos in the painting sequences, as if the characters cannot escape one another and, as a result, are almost forced into a slow duel of piercing gazes, biting remarks and heavy silence. Their love is left untamed and vainly restrained, and it soon begins to burn and crackle, and when it finally bursts out, it leaves no one unscathed : the result is a beautiful yet powerful phenomenon, like the waves that roll and crash around the island.
Céline pours such depth in everything she creates and there is so much to be said about this film... I hope she gets rightfully recognized for all she gives to the art of film.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

299,emcmahan-23900,Beautiful and Emotional French Period Film w/ Amazing Chemistry Between the Two Leads,10,31 July 2021,"'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is one of the best films I've ever seen. The film was all about the 'fleeting' moments and emotions of falling in love. You could tell both characters were falling in love by the way they gazed at each other. It sort of reminded me of my own experience of falling in love with someone. It is not a typical romance film because it only focused on the beginning stages of a romance - the ""euphoric"" stages of a relationship. In a way, the time that Marianne and Héloïse spent together was a euphoria within itself. A good 5-6 days of quality time without anyone telling them what to do is surely euphoric, especially for this time period.Although this film did have a few archetypes of a typical lesbian romance film, it stood out to me because of its immense focus on the interactions between Marianne and Héloïse. Many of these lesbian romance films show a bad husband/boyfriend figure, while in this film, it barely had men in it. The male figure (Héloïse's soon-to-be husband) wasn't even shown - just mentioned a few times. We didn't even know his name. I believe this was done to emphasise the focus on the romance between her and Marianne. It focused on them alone instead of the overarching patriarchy that seems to be in every other lesbian romance film. There obviously is a patriarchy, but it is not the main focus of the film. You also become hooked to Marianne and Héloïse, interested in their every move. You want to learn more about their respective backstories.The film is slow-paced, but intriguing at every minute. The acting was outstanding because the actresses had exhilarating on-screen chemistry. You could tell because you so badly wanted them to be together in the end. They have a great understanding of each other. It's more than just a script that tells you they're falling in love. It's movement, gaze, expression, and passion. I found it interesting that there wasn't any orchestra music score behind certain scenes. You could clearly hear the sounds of walking across the floorboard, the waves crashing on the rocks, and the deep breathing each time Marianne and Héloïse got close to each other. The photography and scenery was beautiful and bright. The cinematography and angles of the characters' faces and movements were in-depth and not objectifying at all. Even though the film is set in the 18th century, it very much felt modern, as if the director was trying to show that the complexity of this forbidden romance story is still very much a reality today. It's more than a story about falling in love. It's also about the memory of a person whom you fell in love with.Although Marianne and Héloïse did not end up together, you could tell in the final scene that their love for each other will prevail and last. Even if they couldn't be together, they could remember each other forever. Marianne has an image of Héloïse through various drawings and the final painting. Heloise has the memory of Marianne on page 28 in her book. I watched this film so many times. I highly recommend it if you want something that stands out.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Although the scenery and shots are without a doubt beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, the plot, acting and script are just empty. Even if you watch a movie you hate, at the end you are filled with opinions and emotions about it, but this movie was in my opinion so bland, I forgot about it 15 minutes after having finished it.
Their relationship is simply not believable, which is why I had experienced a lack of feeling and empathy during the whole movie, as well as total apathy towards how it will end. Someone in another review very accurately said that it seems that because of the extent to which every scene was so thoroughly thought out, in result, it made everything seem unauthentic and untrue. The script didn't keep my attention and it didn't make me stop to think about the meaning, like many other ""artsy"" movies have succeeded to do.

316,geebghd,Beautifully shot but astoundingly slow,4,15 May 2020,"I started off watching this film with high hopes as I constantly saw glowing reviews from people on social media/those who are particularly interested in film-making, and was expecting to watch an incredible film that would stick with me long after. Despite the huge critical acclaim it's received, I have to be in the minority and state that I was very let down by the movie and the only reason I thought about it afterwards was due to the disbelief I had that so many people have adored it. I will say that the movie is beautifully shot and the cinematography is stunning, but as of late, I've noticed that many directors are assuming that a movie's directing is the only crucial factor that matters in order to make a film unforgettable and moving. No. The writing and dialogue have to be riveting. The characters need to have chemistry. There needs to be some sort of conflict or struggle that entices the audience into wanting to continue watching. This movie did not have any of that.There comes a point where directors need to realize that in an attempt to be ""artistic"" (and I love art-house/foreign movies that are stylistic and focused on imagery) they may be making their movie much more tedious and difficult to get through. I constantly kept checking the time and found it agonizingly slow. Oh God was it slow. I also felt that the characters romance felt forced as there was barely any dialogue between them. Yes, I know, it was meant to convey ""yearning"" but we needed more conversations to buy into their love story.Anyhow, disappointed by the film and perplexed at why it's gotten so much love. It's boring and even the masterful cinematography cannot keep you from pausing and seeing how near you are to the end.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
317,zephanier,Transforms your eyes into painter's eyes,10,7 January 2020,"In the beginning the protagonists describes how to paint a portrait; what to stay attentive to, the small details in a person, their contours, stance e.t.c. And with an amazing script/screenplay and cinematography you begin to pay attention to smaller things in great detail. Things that the director Céline Sciamma uses to it's max potential. With long still shots and and long close ups.After the change of perspective the audience is more indulged in not only the plot but the story of each characters emotion, you're indulged in a relation and connection that transcends from the screen to you.As I will not spoil this fantastic film I will not dive further into its amazing script and amazing use of a greek mythology story, do be aware of the nudity and to be struck with awe at the end.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

Sit down without distractions (as you would in a cinema) look, listen and immerse yourself in this beautiful cinematic masterpiece. Some people I know who weren't too impressed with ""Portrait"", had watched it on their laptops, or in a casual sort of way, but this film deserves more than that. It also deserves to be watched more than once because it is so multilayered, and those of us who are not French speakers miss a lot at first viewing while reading the subtitles (and of course, simultaneously dealing with the emotional hits!).It's interesting how people from from different cultures all over the world have resonated with this movie in different ways, and drawn their own positives from it. Writer/Director Celine Sciamma remarked that the final scene, which was the first she had in mind, was inspired by a poem by Mary Oliver the last lines of which go:I tell you this
to break your heart,

that it break open and never close again

A composition, is what this film is, appeasing the analytical mind as much as the heart longing for a gay romance that doesn't hinge on prolonged sex scenes. As clever as this film is, you won't feel its cold structure. Instead, the genius of its construction will make you incapable of taking your eyes off the screen.Céline Sciamma guides you by the hand through Hades' world and you breathe and think and feel along with the characters, understanding only in the very last moment of the film that much like Orpheus, you too would've turned around to take a last glance at Eurydice.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

I mean if you ever drawn or painted anything, you will laugh out loud on every painting scene, and apart from that there's only walking on the beach, walking on stairs or doing nothing basically.It's a nonsensical, unbelievable story, with forgettable dialogue and performances. It is shot nicely, but that is far from enough to make this work. I get it that using no music makes the 2 times when there's music really emotional, but if it's done in such a noticable fashion, it just doesn't work.I am not mad for wasting 2 hours of my life on this, it was watchable.

But it is, apart from the set design, also the only reason I'm giving this an above average rating.This movie is concerningly shallow in terms of story. Maybe seeing two women fall in love is enough for a lot of people, but it certainly doesn't make a masterpiece, especially if that's all there is to the story.
There's almost no conflict, no flaws for the protagonists to overcome, the second act begin to drag heavily, there's an abortion subplot that implies deeper meanings but never actually connects them to the main plot, and the ending is foreshadowed by the very first scene, which anyone who's seen more than 10 movies can instantly pick up on.This is a decent love story with stunning cinematography. Nothing more, nothing less.

334,damien-beaton,A Landmark,9,10 May 2020,"This film feels like a major statement. A statement that should be obvious to anyone, regardless of their gender. But the patriachy still needs a massive slap in the face in order to accept what is blatantly true, and this film - is - that slap in the face. It proves beyond doubt that women in cinema are, at the very least equal, if not greater than men. And before you judge me as a man-hating feminist, I'm actually just a regular male. It's a film made by women, about women, and executed with such brilliance that it should become a post-Weinstein landmark.Céline Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a jaw-droppingly masterful work. I had almost zero expectations, I hadn't seen any of her other films. I hadn't read a synopsis of it, as I often like to watch a film without preconceptions.The film is a romantic period drama (a genre I normally dislike), but, as the title suggests, it is a work of art rather than generic entertainment. It is a deceptively simple framework: in 18th century France, the artist Marianne is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of Héloïse. The two young women form a connection that soon turns into a passionate affair, and this creates obvious complications. About 20 minutes into this film I could see where it was going and I wondered how it was going to hold my interest. Then I started to notice how well the narrative had been constructed, and how subtleties were woven into every step of the plot. It's brilliantly written. There is a sparingly minimal approach throughout, not a great deal happens and yet everything happens for a reason, there's no filler. The actresses all give strong performances, the cinematography uses a gorgeous, painterly colour palette, and the story ends with a simple yet breathtakingly-moving final shot that will stay with you. It's a film made with incredible poise and ease, and it's disarmingly powerful.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

The bond that grows between Héloïse and Marianne over the film is real. I found this film to be very comparable to Call Me by Your Name (feel about it as you may); however, I felt this to be more straining and indelible in its conclusion. The love is mature and powerful, established even more robustly through the synergy of scripting and acting.

357,abilkhanovalmas,"Beautiful, unhurried, gentle love story",10,13 October 2020,"What I knew about this film before watching. That this is about the love of two girls and that the film is very beautiful and unhurried. Now emotions and impressions. The film is really unhurried, a lot of time to sit and think. Very beautiful landscapes, especially the coast (ocean). I realized that I have a weakness for such landscapes, especially ocean and coasts. The plot surprised me because I didn't know what the film was about. It was possible to guess that the film was about the artist, but then there were no particular options. I liked the actresses very much, the characters are very emotional. What I liked and surprised me was that there was no repulsive character here. I don't even remember what other film can boast of this. There are few characters, more precisely 4. The first and the main one, it is especially sweet and very suitable, not a lot of emotion, but looks very beautiful on the scene. The second one also looked good. And in the end, I already was sure that this was the best role in this film. I should say about the chemistry between these characters. Their love is very tender and beautiful. Like the film, all of their interactions are slow and slow over every detail. You can feel every kiss and every touch.
Let's move on to specific moments. The film is like one continuous, unhurried work. But there were still moments worth mentioning. Start where she got to this house. As I said, waves, beautiful landscapes and so on. Revealing the plot, that is, the moment when they explained to her what to do. The moment they tried to have an abortion. I didn't even think about how it was then and whether it was possible at all. The moment when mom left and they were left alone. A moment at the fire. This is very unusual and one of the best and most important moments. An incomprehensible thing begins, suddenly you realize that this is music, and everything falls into place and the moment passes very lively and beautifully. The first kiss. Next is the love story that I have already described. The moment of the quarrel. It was here that it seemed to me that the girl on fire was playing her role very strongly. Separately, I want to say about the scenes of drawing. There main character looks especially gentle. And the scene when they showed each other how much they know each other, saying how they act in a given situation. The ending. Cool musical accompaniment, and the girl is on fire. I think at this point it is logical to move on to what I got from this film. As they said, she sat alone and broke down. I couldn't get it right, but the point is that she didn't want to go there, and only the music saved her at least a little. At the same time, the artist saw her in a white dress. It seemed to me very beautiful shots, but after the film I realized that it was she who was afraid that she would marry, was afraid of losing her. What else did I notice? Many close-ups of the face. to show beauty and convey meaning. And in general, a great emphasis on faces. There was a moment that they showed a face, and all the action took place outside the stage. Overall, this movie is a beautiful, unhurried, gentle love story.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

I watched it, thought, ""hell yeah,"" and moved on.This movie was an entirely different experience. I was enthralled in these characters. The cinematography spoke just as much as the dialogue did. The actors spoke as much with their silence as with their words. I was crying at the end, and expect this movie to leave an impression. This is art, just like the paintings of the film itself.

364,steph_p28,A Masterpiece. Unlike Anything I've Ever Seen.,10,19 January 2020,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is unlike anything I have ever seen. It completely rivals the status quo of filmmaking which is the only reason I can think as to why it would get mediocre reviews. Well, other than the fact it's a subtitled, minimalistic film that explores two women falling in love in 18th century France. It's not a film for everyone. And that's a good thing.This film moved me so deeply to my core that it entranced me for many days and will live with me for many years to come. This film deeply and truthly explores feminine art, women's role in society, female gaze, women's erasure from history and last but not least, love as pure and as equal as anything I've ever experienced. There is no element of conflict or hierarchy here. No musical score. No men. Three actresses. One location. It's minimal and quiet but speaks volumes. If you're like me you will be thinking about this movie for weeks. To pull something like that off requires a genius behind the lense and there are quite a few geniuses at work on this film. Writer/director Celine Sciamma and cinematographer Claire Mathon deserve the most applause. Every element is so perfectly and meticulously crafted that it belongs inside a museum. Celine Sciamma is a truly great filmmaker; one that only comes along every once in a while. She is an artist who challenges the status quo and makes you see the world in a completely different way. And in front of the lense, two incredible genius actresses: Noemie Merchlant and Adele Haenal. They are artists and collaborators, not movie stars. Their chemistry is real, not manufactured. Most importantly they are subjects, not objects. Something that I rarely, if ever, see with American films.This film deserves every bit of the label ""masterpiece."" Everyone go see this movie. In a theater. And if you can't get to a theater, watch it on the biggest TV you own.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

368,daninfo-85959,A potentially great film ruined by awful cinematography,6,28 October 2019,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is at times one of the best films of the decade, with stellar acting by every actress, a daring script that involves slightly taboo themes and a great, yet minimal score.At other times though, the film is completely ruined by having too long static shots that, while showcasing the actresses' abilities, really bored me and just made me wish the film was over already. That's a feeling that is also compounded due to the slow pace present. This is especially noticeable when we transition through scenes in a sudden and choppy way, that would be more appropriate for a trailer. The worst part of the editing and the choice of having long shots is that they really turn this movie into a drag. This is a 2 hour long film, that, if it was shot differently, could have had more character development (which it really needs in regard to the relationship portrayed), instead of scenes where no one is doing anything. The only good part of the cinematography, apart from some actually good shots (like all of the campfire scene - that was beautiful), was the absolutely stunning location.To conclude, this film really disappointed me and it especially hurts since there is something truly great buried within and I can't fathom how a film that so many seem to love, has so many big issues, turning it into an amateur short film that somehow ended up being 2 hours long.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
369,mauricelabi-20811,Could it be that the film was too French for its own good?,6,18 November 2019,"It's a period film about two women lovers. That's a great promise. However, too much was left in (close-up shots that last eternity to evoke feelings) and much was left out at the expense of the sense of sight. What about the smells? The kitchen in the house was sterile, completely staged for the sake of aesthetics. The everyday life of 18th century France was missing: who brought in the meats, how did they go to the toilet? Yes, these simple fixes could have lent the film credibility, authenticity. Instead, the camera centered on the women's distraught faces for much too long, not convincing entirely that their love suddenly burst when earlier mere words were exchanged for long stretches. Do you really need the laborious detail of a man who hammers 4 nails in each corner of the canvas crate? Better choices could have been made with the use of time to keep the film under 2 hours and still convey an otherwise great subject to a film.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
370,nam_NL,.. an instant classic,10,16 December 2019,"Portrait de la jeune fille en feu is an instant classic: highly intelligent, sensual, and innovative. Sciamma uses every second she has to actively involve her audience - and actually quite a lot happens in those two hours. It starts with the first shot - a hand thoughtfully sketches with charcoal on a white sheet of paper producing a sharp scratching sound; never before an audience turned thát quiet thát quick. This first shot also sets the tone by saying: don't just watch this film passively, you'll have to listen, feel, smell, experience it physically. Open your body, be attentive, alert. Next, the message given (by Marianne) is that the story she has to tell is painful. What follows are two hours of unexpected and clever interventions by Sciamma in the development of this story about a first love, and it's a true pleasure to follow her in what she does, to realize why she does the things that she does, how she fully displays female love, and gives her characters color, personality, and agency. In the meantime, her actresses (e.g. Haenel, Merlant, Bajrami) again and again stretch time in their acting and dialogues, alternately building and relaxing tension, like a muscle. Without musical score (a crucial choice to sharpen awareness and involvement), Portrait contains three live performances with great emotional impact and depth. The threefold finale, with an unsurpassed, unparalleled minutes long close-up of Heloïse, is truly heart breaking. At the same time, the finale seems crucial for what Portrait has to offer: catharsis. It is at this moment that the painful experience of an impossible love, the bitter feeling of disappointment or regret which colors the first scene of the film (and which perhaps haunts Marianne) gets softened or even replaced by an awareness of eternal love - through feelings of gratitude, acceptance, pride and bliss that indeed love hás been found, it hás been lived, and shared, in the first place. Who knows what the ex-lovers, having had that life-changing experience and with their hearts ignited, will encounter in years to come?Despite the undeniable ache in my heart, I didn't leave the cinema feeling bitter (the effect that The invisible life of Euridice Gusmao had on me). The women in Portrait, and their love, don't get crushed by patriarchy, they live their lives to the fullest possible, individually and in solidarity. Several films that get mentioned as front-runners for Oscars and Golden Globes I've seen by now, yet I have found no story as modest, nor acting as retained, while being that impressive and impactful, both intellectually and emotionally. Sciamma doesn't tell a story, like other directors do, she has written a poem. And honestly, I couldn't care less about old stories from old men right now.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

When they cried they went all out and when they acted to be inlove it was as if the actresses where actually in love.
The dialoge felt natural and human and the characters never said more than they had to. When they wanted to express an emotion they showed it which is what every good movie should do; show.
The lovestory felt natural and never rushed like it sometimes can feel in other movies. We watched them fall in love and doesn't feel confused when they, for example said ""I remember the first time I wanted to kiss you"" because we where there to see it. Even though we might not have known it at the time the pieces clicked together once they mentioned it and that's brilliant.
The paste of the movie felt slow yet it never made the story boring.
Although not an expert on the cinematogrophy, I felt that the background, light and camera angle made every single shot beautiful, everything from the sceens by the ocean to the very last scene. Not a single shot felt out of place or unnecessary; the camera had always a purpose.

And the scriptwriter, cinematographer, and director are all women. Only two men with dialogue.A beautiful romance movie between women by women.""In the 18th century, an isolated island in Brittany, France. The painter Marianne was asked by a lady in Brittany for a portrait for her daughter Eloise's matchmaking, but Eloise herself refused to marry"" (from the official page).A castle on an isolated island. The daughter of the Count who is forced to marry undesirably. Her sister who died a mystery. So far it looks like a typical Gothic romance.In Gothic romance, a prince who hides his identity sneaks into the castle, defeats the bad count, and connects the prince and his daughter. (If the prince is a middle-aged thief, the two cannot be connected ""Cagliostro's Castle"")In this movie, it was a female painter who hid her identity and came to the castle.Marianne hides herself as a painter and acts with Eloise as a conversation partner. Eloise, who continues to be in the eyes of Marianne, continues to look at Marianne secretly.Beautiful image. Especially the image captured by the candle fire is wonderful. Kubrick was shot with ""Barry Lyndon"" with NASA's F0.7 lens for lunar surface photography, but it was a little different from what we see under the candles with the naked eye. As time goes by, the candlelight footage of this movie is very clear.Waves crashing against the sheer rocks of Brittany. It seems to represent their buzzing feelings.Even if it's a love affair between women, I don't feel it's unnatural or ugly. The same interests, curiosity, favors, understanding, and conflicts as the Boy Meets a Girl story. There is no difference between men and women and women. On the contrary, it feels good to see as much as the man does not swing the machismo. The collision between equal human beings is refreshing.A village festival visited by Marianne and Eloise. The beginning of the female chorus was like the music of Stargate in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". And ""burning woman"". It was a famous scene where music and video were combined.It also depicts an abortion in France, which should have been banned by Catholics. Rather than arguing violently, the director quietly describes, ""There have been romance and abortion between women since ancient times.""It was a wonderful work that was delicately and passionately drawn until the last one-shot.",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
383,petrolialchuk,one of the best in this genre,10,25 July 2020,"This particular piece of cinematography (I dare you to call it a MOVIE) graces you with a touch of that deep bosom feeling that you cannot armor in words but only live through and hide at the bottom of your soul. Books have been written, songs have been sung and now this film has been made to commemorate that exact feeling which has always been a companion to men and women. This is why characters seem so familiar,yet no less genuine.
""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" takes us back to France of 18th century and concerns one of the by-themes of another exceptional film of 2019 ""Little women"" - inability of women of that era to fully self-actualize and live according to their own wishes and dreams. No surprise the director Celine Sciamma would tell a story from that point of view, but she doesn't use modern society problems to bring more attention to her work. Instead, she creates a structure of a story that cannot have a traditional ""happy-ending"", she creates tragedy.
This unavoidable tragedy reminds that of ""Atonement"", when you willingly join main characters in cherishing every little moment of closeness. Each that moment caught perfectly by cinematography of Claire Mathon, who perhaps even pays homage to ""Atonement"" by depicting magnificent coast of the La Manche. Each and every frame of the film appears to be authentic due to brilliantly made sets and costumes. Lead acting duo of Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel charms you into reliving the story with charachters.

Eurydice couldn't leave hell forever.Sophie was upset at the tragic end of the story ""Why did he turn around, he was told not to!""
Héloïse: ""Because he loves her passionately, he can't resist!""Marianne argued that because Orphenus chose to miss his wife, he chose poetry over love. By this point, the argument of the three people had turned into hidden words given to each other between Marianne and Héloïse.Héloïse replied that it was because Eurydice called Orphenus that Eurydic turned around. Marianne's face that was smug and infatuated with art faded slightly when she realized that her muse was right.Marianne turned her head when Héloïse called out. Héloïse is wearing a white wedding dress like in the picture of Eurydic and Orphenus's separation. The white dress was like an illusion from the night before that had scared Marianne. A scene may be confusing for the first time, but the white dress represents Marianne's hidden fear of losing Héloïse. Céline Sciamma has achieved the milestone filmmakers have always wanted - creating a masterpiece for a lifetime.And though Héloïse made Marianne realize there was another great love besides her love for painting. After all, Héloïse and Marianne were the women of the 18th and 19th centuries. They have no choice or miracles like the old story.

397,ElNassim,A Poignant tale told Poetically .. A MASTERPIECE!!,9,29 October 2019,"!!!SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH!!!Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a historical drama by the aspiring French director Céline Sciamma. The Movie is set in 18th Century France when Marianne, a beautiful, young painter is hired to paint the portrait of Eloise, an elegant, depressed young bourgeois who is about to be wedded following the orders of her mom. Marianne faces her first drawback when she discovers that Eloise refuses to be painted as she mourns for her sister's death who she loved dearly. Marianne has to be discreet in the process, taking glimpses of her shy, weary face on their beach strolls and looking intently into the small details of her eyes and the shapes of her creases, without drawing suspicion, to perfect a seemingly impossible piece of art. Their relationship slowly develops as they both start opening up to each other and an unlikely friendship surfaces. When the portrait is done, Marianne felt like she betrayed the trust of Eloise and felt the need to disclose the true motive behind her visit. Eloise took it lightly but then wanted to see the final product which didn't satisfy her or did it? Her dissatisfaction with the painting could be interpreted as her refusing the fact that Marianne's work now is done, and she is bound to leave. She found comfort in her company and the void that was left by her sister's suicide was finally being filled. Marianne wasn't going to leave that way. She vandalized her own painting and decided to stay longer and redo it. Eloise agreed to pose for her as a compensation. In their upcoming drawing sessions and in their little night escapades they found each other gradually falling in love. The portrait is almost done and the wedding approaches. Their love story is nearing its finish line and the separation is bound to happen. They leave each other with tears, memories but with little regrets blaming a society that oppresses women in the name of honor.The movie is a French masterpiece that embodies the purpose of the 7th art. The cinematography is splendid and takes us on a journey to the 18th century France countryside in all its grandeur. The acting is gripping and true to the characters. the two young actresses did an amazing job portraying the emotional rollercoaster that Marianne and Eloise go through. The atmosphere of the film is dreamy and poetic which left the audience in aw throughout the whole screening. The ending was saddening and unfair which left us in agony and in sympathy towards the two characters and their forbidden love.Portrait of a Lady on Fire won best original screenplay in Cannes Festival.

Haven't felt like that in the cinema in more than 15 years. Didn't see that coming, especially since a lot of critically acclaimed films in recent years left me unmoved and baffled with what the hype was about (e.g. Call Me by Your Name).During the screening I was a bit impatient. I left with the profound feeling of sadness. Absolutely smitten with the exquisite main characters and depiction of their love. The story came to a conclusion and was complete but made me strive for more. I couldn't escape the images and feelings they incited.Second time I was less anxious. Knowing how the story unfolds, enabled me to devour every look, gesture, movement of a brush on canvas. Made it possible to notice more, better understand the relationship with myth of the Eurydice and parallels between love, art and female subjectivity. This time I left elated and at ease. Still wanting more. I cannot wait to watch it again.I highly recommend to see it in the cinema, because I think that a smaller screen and average audio system may not give the full experience.Extraordinary collaboration of cast and crew.

The drama in it was light, as in there didn't feel like there was much conflict and left me feeling emotionally underwhelmed. It seemed the scenes of the maid only purpose was to show the hardship of women of the period, the problem was it wasn't tied into the main story at all. Also, something felt unrealistic for the period but i can't put my finger on it.

The lighting and palette drew inspiration from 18th century paintings, there are scenes in this film that will stay with me fore some time... and the slowly building inevitable climax to the story is heart achingly gratifying. An utterly original and beautiful instant classic that somehow didn't capture the attention of the Oscars Academy!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
412,xingmoni,Don't missed every single frame of this movie: Powerful and beautiful,10,12 January 2020,"I saw this movie more than three times. The first reason is I wanna support independent film like this, also because I fall in love with this printed movie by the genuine Céline. Watching this movie it's like visited a museum of gallery, the light, the costume, the language brought us back to Century 18. Like a long flash back to find a love story, LGBT community is always exist in our human history, just be hidden in the history.
Thanks again for Céline to create this movie I am looking forward more film work like this.
The performance of Adèle Haenel and Noémie is magnificent. Bravo, bravo!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire

414,ElenZack,masterpiece,10,1 November 2019,"First, I would like to tell everyone who will read this, go and watch this film, you definitely should see it by yourself!
Second !SPOILERS!, IMHO, Celine Sciamma is a great screenwriter and director. The film is a masterpiece in its every moment, moreover, the script was revolved in the mind and written from the heart, you can see it by the time given to every scene, the minimum of dialog, expressive emotions on faces of the characters and the rhythm. I also admire decision not to shot explicit sex scenes, but to save modesty and purity of love.
Third, there isn't any offscreen music. For me personally, it must've been a hell to watch that kind of film! (Sometimes I more listen than watch, even films) But hey! I didn't find any moment in the film where it was needed a soundtrack. It looked very realistic and atmospheric.
Forth, oooohh I've heard many times even from my friends things like: ""Hey! Why there are a gay/ an Afro-American/ a lesbian in every film? I'm tired of that!"" or ""Have you heard about ""#Frozen 2""? They're rumors about making her gay! How do they suppose to show it to children?"" And I'm like ""Sweetie, are you talking to me? Cause, you know, I'm gay, and ""it's okay to be gay"", so your questions are just awkward!""
After the premiere in Moscow I've heard one person saying: ""Why there isn't any men in this film?"" And it was really dumb question. Firstly, because there IS a man in the end of a film and, secondly, because ... look, why no one tells that it's wrong or against women when some guy shots the film mostly with men starring in it? (I could've write a large list of that kind of films but I won't.) These double standards go against common sense.
And finally, the main point of this post is just to say BRAVO TO THE DIRECTOR, ACTRESSES AND THE WHOLE CREW!",Portrait of a Lady on Fire
