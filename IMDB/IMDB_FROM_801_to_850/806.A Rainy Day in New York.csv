0,SnoopyStyle,a Woody rom-com,6,21 December 2019,"Gatsby Welles (Timothée Chalamet) attends an upstate New York college but he's more interested in winning his poker games. He has distaste for his family's upper class world but not enough to refuse their money. He takes his girlfriend Ashleigh Enright (Elle Fanning) to New York City to interview filmmaker Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for her college newspaper. They go their separate ways. She attracts the attention of Roland, Ted Davidoff (Jude Law), and movie star Francisco Vega (Diego Luna). Meanwhile, Gatsby encounters Chan Tyrell (Selena Gomez), the younger sister of a former flame. There is intermittent rain over their days in the city.Woody Allen is doing the structure of a rom-com in his own way. The main thing is that I don't care much about Gatsby. It's not until his conversation with his mother that his character develops some depth. That's not to say that the conversation isn't awkwardly unreal. There are quite a few awkwardly unreal conversations. The first one starts with Ben Warheit. He's obviously a troll and I can see what Woody is doing. I just don't believe that Gatsby would helplessly stand in front of him to continue the conversation. Sure he got the Chan information but he should leave as soon as that's done. He's not doing it to be polite so the only reason is that Woody wants to do a funny. Now, Selena Gomez is probably too old to play that part. The point is that she is younger than Gatsby. She was a little girl the last time he dated her sister. Quite frankly, Elle Fanning may be better for that role and switching the two actresses would be useful. As for Elle, she is trying for some broader comedy. She's a very winning actress but the drunk acting may be too much to ask for. I laughed but I'm not sure if it's for her and at her. It's awkward to do that broad physical comedy when the older men are on the prowl. Overall, the characters grew on me and it's a minor later Woody for me.",A Rainy Day in New York
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Not one of Woody's best, but still has its charm",6,18 December 2019,"""A Rainy Day in New York"" is a new American movie from 2019 and the most recent filmmaking effort by writer and director Woody Allen, who is gonna turn 85 already next year. It runs for slightly over 90 minutes and that includes credits already, so not a too long film. And Woody Allen is still a really big name in the industry, so no surprise the cast includes many really famous actors. I don't want to make a list of the names as you can check these out for yourself, but let me say that Timothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning play the two central characters. Rebecca Hall I really like and she is always a welcome addition, even if she only has one scene like in this one here. She worked with Woody already in the Oscar-winning Vicky Cristina Barcelona where by the way she was as good as the actress who won the Oscar for that film in my opinion, maybe even better. Okay but now back to this one. Woody making films in which cities play quite a role is not an exception at all. And this is by far not his first tribute to New York. Think of Manhattan obviously or pretty recently also of the Coney-Island-set film starring Kate Winslet. Still I must say that this one here felt really much more about the characters than about New York and it could have played in other areas of the world too. It is basically set in the now. I wondered a bit about that honestly with mentions of legendary directors and the way they were mentioned felt a bit as if they were currently active still, but later on we find out about mobile phones being used and there is also a brief climate change reference in here. I mean not in the sense where it is in any way trying to make a political statement, but you know it is a film that takes place in the 21st century.Okay now about the plot and characters: Chalamet is Gatsby and Fanning is Ashleigh. I thought for quite a while that Gatsby was just his nickname really because his lifestyle and general approach to life were similar to the famous literary character's but no it is his real name. I wonder what the parents were thinking naming him like that. Anyway, we have a young couple travelling to New York for a weekend because the girl is working on a journal article for her university and she gets a chance to interview a really renowned director. This turns out to be a massive challenge to and chance for her, so eventually she just won't find any way to spend quality time with her boyfriend whatsoever. And that results basically in both of them spending a lot of time with attractive people from the opposite gender. For Ashleigh, it is not just the director, but also his regular screen writer that she is a huge fan of and eventually a really popular Hispanic actor. For the boy, it is the younger sister of a former girlfriend and a lady he meets at a restaurant. Don't want to go particularly into detail what she does because then maybe she would not fit the description anymore. But she becomes his date when they go to a party organized by his mother. I must say all these meetings were fine, but the great attention to detail was not offered in the scenes that included them, so at some point for me it basically just turned into a guessing game who's gonna end up with whom. And Woody sure enjoyed toying with us here because first it seemed as if Ashleigh could start something with the director (Schreiber), then that Gatsby could start something with Gomez' character and that Ash stays faithful, then that Ash starts something with Law's character and so on. Eventually, she is really ready to have sex with Luna's character and it would have happened if his wife had not interrupted that very moment, so it puts Ashleigh not really into the best light, also not when she says to Gatsby near the end that the actor only wanted her body and that she is happy to be with her boyfriend again, the one who she basically not only neglected all weekend, but she even denied him pretty much when being asked if she has a boyfriend, so certainly not a likable character, even if that is not too easy to say for me because I think Elle is really one of the most adorable actresses on the planet and I am sure she will have a great career for decades to come. I still must say hiccups on her I expected to be the cutest thing ever which they were not and maybe with an actress I like less I would have hated that little inclusion, even if it really only a minor addition.Now ""rain"" actually plays a crucial role in this film somewhat. There is a lot of talk about it how Chalamet's character finds it romantic, but Fanning's not at all. This is basically the key explanation why they do not really fit together. At the end, it becomes obvious too when the last words by Ashleigh in the carriage are basically an instruction to the driver to hurry up because it rains and at the same time Gatsby enjoys his time in the rain and he meets the girl he really wants there because she feels the same like him, about rain and about mutual attraction you can say. The photo here on imdb is really a bit of a spoiler, but admittedly you really could have guessed with the first (no third) kiss between these two. And how it starts raining this very moment. Or how they through coincidence meet again in the rain in the taxi and they go on the ""vehicle trip"" that Gatsby wanted to go on with his girlfriend initially. On the one hand, I am a bit surprised that Woody really cast Selena Gomez for such a crucial part, but then again nothing should really surprise me when it comes to Woody. He does what he wants and not what the media tell him and obviously he himself is controversial enough as a character that he should not really give any credibility to people saying Gomez may not be good enough an actress for the part. And I thought she was good enough anyway. As for Woody, many people still refuse to watch his films because of his romantic affairs, but I think that is not any of my business and I won't strip myself of a quality watch because of that, especially because I have a permanent ticket anyway, so I did not pay any money specifically for this showing, i.e. into the filmmaker's pocket. These criticisms are like the ones about Polanski, another very old and successful filmmaker, although maybe slightly less serious for Woody. But I don't want to write a lot about that here and return to the film instead. How much I consider it worth watching is already described in the title of my review. I don't think it is as bad as many say, but also not a truly great achievement. People who like Chalamet (and Fanning) should watch it as basically one of them is always seen and it is a bit split between these two as they don't share too many scenes like Allen already did it in another recent film with Stewart and Eisenberg. But this one here also has many nice moments and examples of smart writing. I liked the beginning with the song. And how we are thrown right into the action, which is not too surprising though because like I said it is not a long movie. As always, Woody will definitely get a smile on your lips here and there. I will mention some moments when he did with me. For example, that was when near the end all the guys want to get away with Ashleigh and leave everything behind and act as if it was true love, well except her boyfriend, who was crazy in love early on, so I struggled a bit with believing he fell out of it so quickly, even if admittedly seeing your girlfriend enter a famous actor's car makes something with you. But I want to talk about the positive really now. These final moments of Schreiber's and Law's characters were funny. Also funny was how he keeps beating everybody at poker and makes tons of money this way and well I will leave it at that, you will recognize these little funny moments when you see them like what's the secret thing Schreiber's character wants to tell her and she thinks it is something else at first. Simple Woody, you know what I mean. Nonetheless, there were also many moments that were intended as funny, but did not work out so well, like him trying to hide away from his extended family at the museum. Or the scene I mentioned earlier when one character's (still) partner shows up and destroys a scene in which a couple is getting busy. Also for the non-funny moments there are further examples that you will find yourself. One more dramatic scene that did really nothing for me sadly was the one near the end when we have Gatsby's mother confess to him about her professional background back in the day. I mean this really made something with Gatsby as we find out at the very end, but this monologue by the mother did absolutely nothing for me and it reminded me of Chalamet's most famous film, in which his dad makes a confession to him at the end and that scene is so right, so heartfelt, so honest and this scene we have here is really nothing of that. This parallel was really disappointing for me. But yeah, overall I still believe the good is more frequent in this film than the weak and unless you start watching it with expectations that it could be a masterpiece, you shouldn't be disappointed. I give it a thumbs-up and nice to see Woody still come up with movies like this at his really old age now.",A Rainy Day in New York
2,claudio_carvalho,Average Romance,6,21 January 2020,"In the Yardley College, Gatsby Welles (Timothée Chalamet) learns that his girlfriend Ashleigh Enright (Elle Fanning) will travel to Manhattan to interview the cult director Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for the college paper and he plans a romantic weekend with her.

Along the rainy weekend in New York, Gatsby and Ashleigh have new experiences and discoveries.""A Rainy Day in New York"" is an average romantic comedy by Woody Allen. The performances are great but the story is conventional and predictable. However it does not exist a bad Woody Allen film and it is worthwhile watching.

3,grantss,Hit and miss,5,9 October 2021,"A young student couple, Gatsby and Ashleigh, head into New York as Ashleigh is interviewing a famous film director for her college newspaper. What follows is a series of chance meetings and misadventures that will sorely test their relationship.A film that's pretty much par for the course among Woody Allen's recent offerings. His 1970s, 80s and 90s stuff was brilliant as was Match Point (2005) but from a point the humour and clever plot reduced and his films became meandering relationship dramas. A Rainy Day in New York is no exception.There are flashes of the old Woody Allen, with some great one-liners, but for the most part it's a pointless wander. Engagement is limited, due to the meandering script and the irritating main character, Gatsby (played by Timothee Chalamet).The character would have worked if played by Woody Allen in the 70s, as the dialogue is written for himself, but here, and with Chalamet's bland, unconvincing performance, it's pretentious. More than this, it seems anachronistic: the characters, their way of talking, the whole vibe seems like this was set in the 60s or 70s (even 1920s!). I genuinely thought this was set in the 70s until modern cars and cell phones started to appear.On the plus side, Elle Fanning is great as Ashleigh: wonderfully bubbly, funny and wide-eyedly innocent. She gets some of the best lines. On that note, Selena Gomez is surprisingly good in her role and also benefits from some great, funny lines (largely put-downs).This all makes for an up-and-down, hit-and-miss production. Overall it's not great, but not terrible either.",A Rainy Day in New York
4,phd_travel,Delightful,10,7 December 2019,"There is no one who shows the wonderful aspects of New York so magically as Woody. The well constructed movie has the fine things everyone loves about his movies - the wit and unexpected humor, the music and the relationships.Elle Fanning plays a naive sweet enthusiastic college girl doing an article for her paper going to NY to interview a director. A funny screwed up bunch she encounters along the way including a famous actor. Timothee Chalamet is The Central character her boy friend who wants to show her a good time in the city. He likes playing the piano and resents his pretentious social climbing parents. But he's got a surprise in store. The two get separated for the day and have a series of interesting encounters.Elle overacts a wee bit but she is right for the role. Tim does a decent Woody type character. Nice to see Selena Gomez acting again.Hope this isn't the last Woody Allen movie.",A Rainy Day in New York
5,deloudelouvain,Not bad for a Woody Allen movie.,7,16 December 2019,"Well this is going to be a review from somebody that is not a big fan of Woody Allen, quite the opposite I would say. But for once I did enjoy one of his movies. A Rainy Day In New York is a simple story, easy to follow, but with a touch of subtle humor, the kind of simple phrases that put a smile on your face. The dialogues are well writen and are one of the reasons this movie is enjoyable to watch. And the acting of Elle Fanning, she's by far the best actress/character of this movie. Most of the scenes where I had a smile on my face were scenes with her. Almost the entire cast is well chosen though. To me probably the best one I watched from Woody Allen, but I didn't watch them all so it's difficult to fully compare.",A Rainy Day in New York
6,lasttimeisaw,A RAINING DAY IN NEW YORK is unequivocally too antiquated for its own good,6,2 October 2019,"Shelved in the stateside in the light of the escalation of Allen's decades-long sexual assault allegations, A RAINY DAY IN NEW YORK, his 48th feature film and a white-bread adolescent romance plays out chiefly in a one-day span, has no trouble in charming audience in the other side of the Atlantic.The template is an egregiously well-worn one even the protagonists are, age-wise, considerably rejuvenated to undergraduates, Chalamet plays Gatsby Welles, yes, his name alone is a dead giveaway that he has a very old soul, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, loving playing pianoforte in vintage bars, hanging around museums and anachronistically old-fashioned in the romantic front too, aka.

7,ElMaruecan82,The Day the Sky Fell on Allen's Head...,5,23 June 2021,"I wish ""A Rainy Day in New York"" was only one of these lesser ""Woody Allens"" sandwiched between better offerings... that time it was different, it was ""time's up"" time marking the decline of Allen with the first year (2018) without a theatrical feature (since 1981). Allen became the antithesis of his status as the ""hip"" director to fill an actor's resume. Now, there's only Tarantino left... and for how long?""A Rainy Day in New York"" couldn't have had a more ominous title for the rain that keeps on pouring on the troubled heads of its protagonists is a drizzle compared to the shaming tsunami that fell on the head of Woody Allen after the shooting, right in the midst of the Weinstein scandals and the revival of his extended conflict with Mia Farrow, from a prestigious director he became the child abuser who married his ""own"" daughter. It didn't help that before these allegations even resurfaced Allen was warning against a witch hunt, as if he had sensed that the rain in New York would be the metaphor of that gloomy career-winter where the only bird-chirping to hear would come from a little device named 'Twitter'.Could he anticipate that actors who took part in his 2010s streaks would all in unison turn their backs on him? I still remember it: in a sort of Pavlovian move, and a span to be counted in days, Timothée Chalamet who played the lead role and was in 2017 one of the Oscars frontrunners for ""Call Me By Your Name"" didn't want his career to be nipped in the bud and decided to give all the money he got for charity, Selena Gomez expressed her regrets in a less frontal way, Rebecca Hall also donated her money and admitted that talent shouldn't be the only criteria to star in a film thus jumping on the winning bandwagon. Did she believe she got her break in 2008 by playing in Ron Howard's ""Frost/Nixon"" the role of a bimbo seduced by an older man, wasn't it for her more shining participation in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""?Allen didn't build their stardom but surely his name counted and yet they decided that the presumption of innocence was a notion to be put in perspective in regard to the emotional trauma inflicted to and invoked by the victims. Not to make a whole retrospective of the Allen case but it's interesting that Allen's loss of touch is one of the film's very symptoms. It's about a young Ivy League kid named Gatsby who wins big sums of money he doesn't even need and proposes a weekend in his native New York City to his girlfriend Ashley, a dim-witted but wealthy student played by Elle Fanning, a fine opportunity for the Arizona native to discover the Big Apple and interview a renowned auteur filmmaker named Roland Pollard and played by Liev Schreiber.Was the parallel with Roman Polanski or Sidney Pollack? Any Allen's movie is an ego trip and it's obvious how the case of Pollard echoes Allen's own mental blocks. But how come a girl considering Kurosawa European cinema becomes an instant muse? Didn't Allen figure it would reveal something in his own psyche building a creative infatuation between Pollard and Ashley? Listening to Ashley's praises toward a self-deprecating Pollard, I felt maybe what Allen saw in younger women was perhaps whatever they saw in him. I suspect Allen never really liked himself and could never truly understand his European appeal (almost mocked in ""Hollywood Ending"") but there's a feeling of Allen at the limit of his emotional brainstorming, to the point the director's subplot is cut short halfway through the film.And Law's character (a genius according to the 'starlet') became of course another neurotic cuckold alter-ego, as annoying and implausible as Kenneth Branagh in ""Celebrity"", and already overused even by Allen himself. That's the problematic part: that mix of fascination and revulsion he's got with his own persona only resulted in the creation of cardboard and soulless characters, their soul is Allen. What is it with Gatsby and the young actress Chan (Selena Gomez) two Generation Z products to exchange lines without any pop culture reference whatsoever from the third millennium? Allen's obstination to exist through the channel of younger generations have come to an end.And the arc closings make things worse. After showing Gastby as a pretentious and frivolous snob, Allen decides to reveal that his behavior has got deeper roots through a crucial scene with his mother (Cherry Jones). And that almost works. But for Ashley, after flitting and flirting with Schrieber, Law and later Fernando Vega (playing a Latino heartthrob) her romantic interlude turns into the most idiotic Vaudevillian schtick rightfully allowing Allen's detractors to state that he doesn't know how to write good female characters anymore, or maybe the younger ones. There's something about women that does perturb him: they're femme fatales, victims, prostitutes, mistresses or murderesses. There's a reason why 'Vicky Christina Barcelona"" is one of his last good films and don't get me started on ""Annie Hall"" or the so-underrated ""Interiors"". Allen's perception of female youth can't even fit a fictional reality.And Allen got that sour taste of reality afterwards: young kids don't talk about Kurosawa or De Sica, they're driven by social networks and popularity, and the younger members of his cast understood that the right move for their careers was to backstab the old man. It's a time where Allen's art didn't bring an issue on life but life gave a (karmic?) lesson to his own art. Yes, there's something tragically poetic in that failure. And this is the saddest Allen film for the whole reality it brought up. For the record, Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, even Jude Law didn't attack him, guess what they had in common?Allen might reconsider his casting choices and stop being a leverage to a generation too remote from him, that and pray for sunnier days.",A Rainy Day in New York
8,MOscarbradley,"Minor Allen but still so much better than it might have been,,,",8,18 December 2019,"I never thought I'd live to see Timothee Chalamet play Woody Allen but then I realised the young male lead in any Woody Allen film is only a substitute for the character Woody himself would have played 40 or 50 years ago. In fact, every male lead in every Woody Allen picture is Woody whether they are Timothee Chalamet or Joaquin Phoenix or Owen Wilson or anyone else and that every Woody Allen film is just like the one before, particularly if they are good or are comedies like the early funny ones.""A Rainy Day in New York"" is Allen at his slightest and his most incestuous but it is funny and it is charming. The jokes are old-hat but they're funny even if we did hear them as far back as ""Manhattan"" and Woody can still muster a first-rate cast to deliver his old-hat gags. Chalamet is smart enough to take on the Allen role but imbue it with enough of his own personality to stand out while Ellie Fanning, (chanelling her inner Diane Keaton), and Selena Gomez are terrific as the two (young) women in Allen/Chalamet's life. In fact, Allen pops up quite a bit in this film; Jude Law's screenwriter is Allen, Griffin Newman's student filmmaker is Allen and, of course, Liev Schreiber's director is Allen. Oh wait, isn't he Allen's version of Bergman or, at least, Bergman if he were a character in a Woody Allen picture.Of course, no-one will ever claim ""A Rainy Day in New York"" as first-rate Allen and while it's funny it's never as funny as those early funny ones but it does look gorgeous, (once again Storaro shot it), the whole cast throw themselves into it shamelessly, (indeed, there was a time before Woody fell out of favour when Fanning might have got an Oscar for Supporting Actress), and Allen completists certainly won't want to miss it.",A Rainy Day in New York

As the film opens, Gatsby's voice-over tells us about his girlfriend Ashleigh. We meet Ashleigh and she informs Gatsby that she has secured an interview with a famed movie director, which requires her to go to New York City. Gatsby decides that they'll make it into a romantic weekend getaway. Upon arriving in New York City, things go very differently than expected... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the umpteenth movie from writer-director Woody Allen. Apart of the quality of the movie itself (more on that later), the movie comes with a lot of baggage. This was filmed in 2017, yes, three years ago, and was part of his deal with Amazon Studios. With the #MeToo movement in full blaze and new rumors against Woody Allen, Amazon refused to release the film, and a number of the movie's stars, including Timothée Chalamet and Selena Gomez, disavowed the project and donated their salaries to good causes. Amazon and Woody Allen eventually reached a settlement and the movie finally saw the day of light in Europe in June, 2019, yes 16 months ago. It was released in select US movie theaters this weekend. As to the film itself, it tries to portray itself as ""just another Woody Allen film"", with the same credits, the same music, and the same overall feeling of so many of Woody Allen's films, except of course that this isn't the same world anymore, and it all just feels very quaint and out of date. Timothée Chalamet as Woody Allen's alter-ego tries to make the best of it, but even he cannot salvage the fact that the script is devoid of fresh ideas. We've seen it all before in so many other Woody Allen films, there is literally not a single new twist in any of this. Bottom line: this is a film that is being released beyond its expiration date.As mentioned, ""A Rainy Day In New York"" opened this weekend in select theaters including at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so: 6 people in total including myself. If like myself you are a life-long Woody Allen fan, you are likely tempted to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and I would certainly suggest you do so, but come with low expectations, and then draw your own conclusion.",A Rainy Day in New York

17,jadepietro,Misty Watercolor Memories,7,6 May 2021,"IN BRIEF: Flawed but entertaining rom-com.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) While going through the latest films now streaming, I unexpectedly came across a strange film offering that had been shunned from American cinemas nationwide, although it was distributed throughout Europe and had a successful run this past fall. The movie was deeply embedded among many of the monthly choices found on Amazon Prime, easy to overlook and hard to find. The film, a mild fluff of a romantic comedy, had no shocking sexual situations, overt profanity, or graphic violence. Yet the mere presence of this movie incited such a negative and polarized reaction by most of Hollywood royalty. You may ask why was such a film treated with such horror and disregard and I can answer your query in two words: Woody Allen.The film is A Rainy Day in New York. It starred a fine cast that included Timothée Chalamet, Elle fanning, Selena Gomez, Jude Law, Diego Luna, and Liev Schreiber, most of which were forced to give up their salaries to charity in order to save face with the public and denounce this filmmaker who has been accused of sexual harassment but never convicted of the crime. The movie never was released in our country, more due to our cancel culture mindset than COVID, although it is hard to decide which rationale is more lethal these days.For those not aware of Mr. Allen transgressions, I will not dwell on the continuous debate of viewing the life of an artist vs. His or her art. You and your conscience can come up with your own conclusion. As for me, I will concentrate on this filmmaker's latest venture in my review. I can truly say that this film may not be his finest work, on a par with masterworks like Manhattan, Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, or Hannah and Her Sisters, or more recently, his Oscar-winning Midnight in Paris (2011). But it may be worthy of your time and attention, especially if you are a serious cinephile or enjoy a love story.The plot revolves around a young couple's romantic getaway weekend to New York City. Complications ensue that separate the lovers as they pursue other goals. Writer / director Allen is rehashing his similar storylines with mixed results against the backdrop of some of his favorite haunts (Central Park Zoo, the Metropolitan Art Museum, the Carlyle Supper Club, etc.) The sites will seem familiar to those fellow New Yorkers and tourists, as will the narrative to many loyal Allen fans and moviegoers. Signs of Mr. Allen's quick wit do pop up and his cast engagingly delivers their clever lines, even though the characters are not that well written nor fully dimensional. Some of their dialog appears to be anachronistic, as if the screenplay was written years ago and recently re-envisioned. There is plenty of dated references throughout the film honoring the likes of past celebrated icons such as Luis Buñuel or Cole Porter, as if to say that these only modern intellectuals are desiring of worth. One wonders just who would be this film's target audience anyway, certainly not Generation X, Y, or Z. The aura of ""been there, done that"" hangs like a heavy shroud over the proceedings, although Mr. Allen's go-to cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, lavishes the film with much beauty.Mr. Chalmet remains charming as the movie's main figure, Gatsby Welles, an idealist eccentric yearning for love. The actor convincingly fills in as Mr. Allen's nebbish persona, especially with his voiceover narration, since the director is far too old now to act the fool. Ms. Fanning as his present girlfriend, Ashleigh, and Ms. Gomez, as Chan, his newest conquest, bring some charisma too. But much of the interrelationships and their forced situations seem contrived, mere plot devices to move the movie forward. The whole Ashleigh sub-plot is far-fetched and follows farcical rules that fizzle while the more successful Gatsby's portion is pure rom-com down to its jazz-infused score of jaunty 40's tunes. Fine supporting work is also provided in small but memorable turns by Cherry Jones as Gatsby's domineering mother and Kelly Rohrbach as a lovable hooker, shades of Mighty Aphrodite...well, it is a Woody Allen movie, isn't it?A Rainy Day in New York isn't all wet. It is still diverting entertainment and has some smart lines, although it's just a tad damp around the edges. (GRADE: B-)",A Rainy Day in New York
18,richard-1787,A real disappointment,2,13 October 2019,"I've enjoyed so many Woody Allen movies that I keep going to see the new ones, even though I know that his output is mixed. I very much enjoyed *Midnight in Paris*, for example - and tonight felt that I was watching outtakes from it that were rejected with good reason.Basically, there is nothing new here. It seemed like a patchwork of previous WA movies, but never came close to reaching the heights of the best ones. The main characters seemed to be too young to be spouting lines the likes of which we are used to hearing from characters decades older.I felt downright sorry for Ms. Fanning. She was made to play an airhead, which she did well, but do we really want to see that in 2019? I should think many women would find her offensive.The male lead wasn't much better. He seemed very shallow.They were like pale copies - very pale copies - of the engaged couple in *Midnight in Paris*, but without an interesting third party such as that earlier movie had.The usual talk about the arts seemed very superficial, as if the characters were just reciting lines they had memorized but didn't understand.There were scenes that were fun to watch for the scenery. But the dialogue was too often uninteresting, and the plot, to the extent that it had one, of no interest to me.",A Rainy Day in New York
19,rannynm,Classic Woody Allen. Lots of dialogue and intertwined characters,8,14 November 2020,"A Rainy Day in New York is a classic Woody Allen film: lots of dialogue and multiple intertwined characters with their own personal dilemmas-and, in the spotlight, a seemingly happy couple discovering that they don't have much in common. Gorgeous cinematography, sets and costumes. And a very well-narrated story in which the human condition prevails.Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) and Gatsby (Timothée Chalamet) are spending a weekend in Manhattan for a very special occasion: She (a journalism student) will interview one of the most famous directors in the movie industry. He will visit his parents and both will spend a romantic weekend with the excuse of a school assignment. But the bad weather in New York is a perfect metaphor for a weekend of encounters and disagreements.The cast is fascinating: Elle Fanning shines! Her naiveté and enthusiasm are a great mix to make her character so enjoyable to watch. Timothée Chalamet is on point, despite that this will not be one of his memorable roles in his filmography. Liev Shreiber plays his character in a way that ensures the audience wants to know more about him, but the script does not have a complete arc for him to deliver.Selena Gomez plays Chan, and I love her performance as one of Gatsby's friends from the past (her sister used to date Gatsby) who seems to have a different point of view. Diego Luna plays a famous actor-great to have a Latino represented in the story-and Jude Law is convincing as the famous director's assistant who is discovering an awful truth. All these great actors are absolutely well-directed under the classic, charming, genuine Woody Allen storytelling. The music, classic jazz, evokes the sounds of a very sophisticated Manhattan and underscores the charm and elegance. The movie industry and its complexities as well as the beautiful city of New York are characters in the story like in other Woody Allen films. The cinematography is one of the greatest achievements of this film: Vitorio Storaro is certainly a master of light, and the golden hour scenes make A Rainy Day in New York aesthetically stunning and kept me in awe throughout the movie.I give A Rainy Day in New York 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 13 to 18 (and adults, of course). Some themes won't be relevant for audiences under this age, and there's brief nudity, mild drug use and adult themes.

There are just a couple of lines that are too anachronistic coming from the mouths of the characters and the fact that 2 characters are basically just versions of Woody Allen.

21,valadas,Encounters and divergencies,6,30 October 2019,A pleasant movie to be watched and nothing more than this. A young couple go to New York where the girl who is a journalist has to interview a well known movie director and the boy wants to have a pleasant stay there with her after the interview. However it happens that things get complicated by the meeting with other oeople which create unpredictable situations that turn encounters into divergencies and lead them to try to disguise their behaviours to each other. This is the usual Woody Allen's way of making movies that tell the stories of ordinary people caught in unpredictable awkward situations.,A Rainy Day in New York
22,michaeltrivedi,Really Really Good,7,4 December 2019,"Woody Allen comes back once again with this pretty good film. As always, we're brought back to New York, and all the characters seem to try to be staying out of the rain. Could this be a nod to climate change?But the real takeaway in this movie, which I was impressed by, was Timothee Chalamet. I think he really shines here as a potential big time movie star, perhaps down the same lines as heartthrobs Pitt and DiCaprio. I've only seen one or two other performances, one of which he played a similar character. I would have to say all in all I really enjoyed watching him. He had a coolness about him. There was also a geekiness tied to him, which I have been worried about with the new young actors in the industry. He seemed to prove otherwise here, really outshine Elle Fanning. She put on weight, and didn't really look that attractive or appealing. Perhaps purposefully?The story is about two college students who are dating. They go to Manhattan so she could meet a director for an interview. During this time, the boy embarks on his own journey, assisting in a short film by a friend and also attending a party by his parents. The couple don't stay together in the end, and yet it's a happy ending all the same.I was really thoroughly impressed by this film. The last Woody Allen movie that got me was Irrational Man with Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is more sweet and simple minded. I do think that Timothee seems to be playing the upscale New Yorker all wrong. And Elle also plays the sweet innocent Arizonan all wrong too. They started off as actors playing a role, and by the end fit into their roles pretty well. Aside from that, everything else was sort of normal. I enjoyed the party scene at the end, and scenes with the boy walking in the rain around New York.The fact that I've given this film so much thought and a wordy review should signify the fact that I really thought highly of it.Great movie. I would highly recommend watching it, though it's not a must see I guess.7 stars!",A Rainy Day in New York
23,leftbanker-1,Woody Allen Pastiche,1,5 May 2020,"This was embarrassing to watch, at least the little that I made it through before turning it off. It was embarrassing and I was watching it alone during quarantine, a time when my standards drop even lower than normal, yet I was still insulted by this mess. It felt like it was made by Woody Allen's over-privileged step-son who just got out of rehab and then he had a friend proof-read it and look up a few brainy-sounding quotes on Wikipedia.I just wrote this review to remind myself not to try and watch this again when I've completely forgotten about it in a month. It's very forgettable.",A Rainy Day in New York
24,maurice_yacowar,High Society misfit finds truth and truer love.,8,20 June 2020,"As usual, the new Woody Allen film - his 48th feature in 51 years! - is a disturbing departure from the last few. What disturbs is its newness. We're disappointed when our expectations are denied. So an adjustment is necessary if we are to take it on its own, proper terms.
The plot is familiar: when a small town hick comes to New York, her relationship with a city guy is challenged by the Big City. It's Neil Simon country but Allen infuses it with an uncommon density of personal inflection. That goes beyond ""What's sexy about short-term memory loss?"" And ""Time flies....Unfortunately, it flies coach.... It's not always a comfortable trip.""
Specifically the film responds to the time and circumstance of its making. When Mia Farrow's questionable allegations of Allen's alleged abuse of her daughter resurfaced, Amazon broke their agreement to fund and distribute the film. So here: ""The world is full of tragic little deal-breakers."" And ""There are no newspapers that are not tabloids."" Not since Manhattan has Allen delivered such an encomium to New York City: ""You are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve another level of anxiety, hostility or paranoia anywhere else."" Instead of the usual star-studded Allen cast, here Jude Law is the film's one big star.
As his name suggests, Gatsby Welles is a cultural construct. ""Gatsby"" signifies the illusion of old wealth and social stature. ""Welles"" connotes a maverick individuality. The hero's wealthy family propel him into the arts, the responsibilities of high society, the mixed blessings of the privileged. But at that privilege he bristles.
This Gatsby took classical piano but yearns to play romantic ballads in a bar. He doesn't have to be able to sing well to enjoy singing a classic ballad. Instead of college studies he prefers high stakes gambling (at which he succeeds uncommonly, like Woody the filmmaker). Ultimately Gatsby breaks out of his romantic rut, unlike brother Hunter, doomed to marry a woman with an emasculating laugh.
Gatsby's girlfriend Ashleigh comes from a wealthy Tucson banking family. A journalism student at Yardley College, she takes him to New York to interview the famously serious film director Roland Pollard. ""You're too original to have mass appeal,"" the awed Ashleigh assures him. Gatsby's old schoolmate dismisses his work with ""Never a decent toilet joke."" When Ashleigh quotes Pollard's line ""Love and death are two sides of the same coin"" she doesn't understand it, but has evoked an early (funny) Allen title.
The R.P. director's nominal echo of Roman Polanski sets up Ashleigh's NYC adventure. While in real life Farrow persists in her discounted allegations against Allen, she publicly defends Polanski against the sex charges to which he pled guilty. Here Pollard, his writer Ted Davidoff and actor Francisco Vega personify the predatory film industry that feeds off the star-struck, helpless naifs. Pollard uses his artistic suffering, Davidoff his unfaithful wife and Vega his star power to seduce the relatively innocent Ashleigh. Only the early return of Vega's girlfriend preserves Ashleigh's relative chastity. Implicitly Allen places Farrow's persistent allegations in the larger context that undermines her.
Seeing Ashleigh on TV with Vega, the heartbroken Gatsby hires a hooker to represent his fiancee at his mother's classy dinner As Gatsby describes his mother's literary circle: ""It's rich housewives who have the leisure to pursue esoteric culture. The out of work, discussing the out of print."" After his mother sees through the ploy and sends the woman home she tells Gatsby that she had herself been a hooker. Indeed that's how she met his father. Indeed she used her savings to set up his eventually successful business. This candour opens Gatsby's relationship with his mother: ""She's a lot more than I gave her credit for."" With that knowledge he can accept himself as well as her and he can follow his desire to stay in New York and live the life he prefers. There is not such a gaping gap between the respectable and the pragmatic after all. There is non shame in honesty.
The film ripples with allusions. Its sentimental core starts with the opening song: ""I got lucky in the rain."" The singer sadly needs a song, then ""You came along,"" the love of his life. Relationships begin and end in the rain here, climactically over ""Misty,"" because the rain signifies the melancholy chill from which we seek love for shelter. ""What I really need,"" Gatsby avers, ""is a Berlin ballad."" In the converse call to social realism, Gatsby is supposed to see the Weegee exhibition at MOMA, but he abandons that to follow his new interest, Chan, the grown-up kid sister of his old flame Amy, into the older histories in the Met.
This relationship begins with the Benedick-Beatrice sparring on a student film set, where they meet and have to act a passionate kiss. Eventually their life will follow that art. They meet on that film set, have that museum date then meet again under the Central Park clock reliving a favourite romantic film. Chan's home is full of Old Master paintings and antiques. She reads Gatsby as an exotic searching for a romantic dream from a vanished age. That becomes her.
Chan wins out over Ashleigh because she knows Allen's familiar dependency upon art for a meaning and consolation otherwise rarely available: ""Real life is fine for people who can't do any better."" That's a film-romance re-write of Gatsby's mother's career.
Unfortunately, to cleanse themselves of the old Allen ""scandal"" Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall announced they were donating their salaries to charity. They make themselves victims of the slander and misrepresentation Allen has suffered and survived for so many years. This is a film they should be proud of having served.",A Rainy Day in New York

28,tm-sheehan,"Really a 7.5 A Movie that Deserves to be seen ,its romantic and entertaining",7,19 January 2020,"My Review - A Rainy Day in New York My Rating 7.5 /10It really nice when you finally get to see a Film that's been surrounded by controversy due to Its Director Woody Allen's alleged sexual misconduct charges I stress ""alleged"" and I'm only interested in the film .A Rainy Day in New York eventually managed to get a European release in September 2019. Woody Allen won back the ownership rights from Amazon after lodging a $68 million lawsuit alleging Amazon had failed to meet contactual obligations to release the film.in November 2019, Allen settled his breach of contract lawsuit against Amazon, and both parties voluntarily filed a joint notice dismissing the case.I'm a Woody Allen film fan, not of all his films but a great many of them especially the ones he doesn't appear in . I like his script writing concepts and direction I hear in some of his movies the actors are encouraged to ad lib lines but I don't think the lines in this film are ad lib they're too clever.So I was keen to obtain a DVD copy to see what this one was like and I really enjoyed it.
It's not a great film but it's a very entertaining sweet romance of course made more romantic by having New York ,one of my favourite cities in the world as its location.
Woody Allen has often used New York and it's interesting that this is the very first full feature film directed by Woody Allen with the words ""New York"" featured in the title. However, Woody Allen has made a number of movies featuring suburbs of New York in the title. These are: 'Manhattan' (1979)Bullets Over Broadway' (1994), 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' and 'Broadway Danny Rose' (1983) - with ""Manhattan"" and ""Broadway"" being used twice in Woody Allen theatrical feature film titles.A film had of course must have more than a romantic setting it needs a good script and actors to provide the main course and I think there's some delicious moments in this movie.Timothee Chalamet as Gatsby Welles a privileged rich but naively sweet College student accompanies his current girl attractive friend Ashleigh played by Elle Fanning for a romantic weekend in The Big Apple while she is interviewed by film director Liev Schreiber ( Roland Pollard) .
Their plans of a romantic weekend proceed to unravel when Ashleigh stands up Gatsby by having to prolong the interview to watch the Directors movie.Gatsby has to go solo for his New York adventure until they eventually do get back together but Gatsby Welles has changed and grown up emotionally especially after a visit to his mother's Gala event played beautifully by Cherry Jones where he realises his perception of his wealthy parents is so incorrect.The minor roles characters are just as interesting in the movie Gatsby meets Chan (Selena Gomez )the sister of an ex girl friend ,Ashleigh meets Ted Davidoff Jude Law in a nice cameo and she also has a possible #METoo encounter with charismatic director Francisco Vega (Diego Luna)Some of the actors in this film have donated their salaries to charities after the legal proceedings against Woody Allen took place including Timothée Chalamet who announced on Instagram that he will be donating his entire salary from his work on this film to the charities: the LGBT Center in New York, Time's Up and RAINN, an anti-sexual violence organization.
Rebecca Hall who plays Connie donated her full wage from this movie to the Time's Up movement after reconsidering sexual assault allegations against the director in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.It's a shame this film with its talented cast will probably slip in to obscurity because of the controversy but seeing a lot of profits going to worthy causes may save it.I must say regarding Timothee Chalamet's singing debut that his voice remind me of a Chet Baker the legendary jazz trumpeter and vocalist . If any studio or director wants to revisit The Chet Baker biography for filming ( its been done in 2015 with Egan Hake ""Born to be Blue"" but only dealt with his comeback you have the perfect man to star in it with Mr Chalamet.
My favourite quotes from Woody Allen's script - Gatsby Welles: One thing about New York City. You are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve another level of anxiety, hostility or paranoia anywhere else
Gatsby Welles: I need a carbon monoxide to survive. We are two different creatures, right? You like the sound of crickets and I like the rattle of the taxies. You blosom in the sun and me, I come into my own under grey skies.Ashleigh: -Oh my God, you're Francisco Vega!
Francisco Vega: -Is that good or bad?
Ashleigh: -My roommate thinks you're the best thing to come along since the morning-after pill.Gatsby Welles: I read. I just don't read what they give us in school. I mean, do I really care who wins between Beowulf and Grendel? No, I don't. Maybe if I had a little money on it.I hope it gets streamed by Netflix or Stan it certainly won't be on Amazon Prime meanwhile it's a nice edition to my DVD collection to watch again .",A Rainy Day in New York

I don't care who did the movie( watched the trailer and it looked entertaining enough) had a pretty good ensemble but .. Where to start. I like Elle Fanning and Schrieber so what could be so bad? Well that lack of decent dialogue and basic story telling. Was there any? The only person I could stomach was the chap who played Gatsby. He is the only redeeming thing in this whole mess. None of it made sense it was a bunch of random interactions ( mine are more interesting irl) It wasn't awful but what was the story? Guy dates girl. They go to Manhattan she acts like an idiot and ( honestly who acts like that, let me stay with strangers and ignore my boyfriend) he acts in a film with the sister of a girl he thought was beautiful and looked like Grace kelly and then somehow leaves his girlfriend who was so great for a girl he spent a brief few hours with.

It certainly helped that it was set in New York, as the city was one of the strongest characters.It was my first time seeing a Timothee Chalamet film, and I found he really carried the film. He certainly slotted into that self-absorbed and quirky-Allen-cliche-character quite naturally. The supporting cast looked like they were enjoying themselves too.The whole film had numerous really beautiful shots. I enjoyed the witty dialogue too. Couldn't help but smile at times.

Timothée Chalamet was quite good channeling a young Woody Allen-esque character. Started off a bit sloppy too but in the end really delivered a nice performance, proving once again that he is one of the most talented and interesting actors of his generation. Chalamet combines both charmes and innocence to his portrayal of a grow up minded personality. Good work. Elle Fanning however was the weakest part. She really did have a fine character to work with but blew it with absolutely irritating overacting. She gave the impression she really did not get the part and neither played it funny, as is was intended to be nor in anyway convincing. I was positively surprised by Selena Gomez who actually turned into a very good performance herself. Jude Law had a nice supporting role and I wished he had given more screen time. Liev Schreiber was good too. Rebecca Hall had a fantastic cameo and so did Cherry Jones. The screenplay was good and the direction typical old fashioned Woody Allen.

Why we need him so much. without Allen, the cinema industry would have been a little boring. His films are unique and very powerful by meaning of beauty, art and emotion. ""A Rainy Day in New York"" is another perfect example of true art. The film stars with a young couple visiting New York for the weekend and end up in a rainy day full of excitements. The movie feels like another Allen love story from the start: the location of New York, the narrating, the differences between characters, how they fall in love against all chances, and the sweet ending that all viewers wish to have in their lives. When I first saw this film I immediately had a sense of nostalgia towards ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"". All films perfectly connect to each other, not by plot but more in a sense of genre and dialogue. The dialogues in this film are just like in any other of Allen's films, catchy, humorous and with a lot of sense towards life. The cast is amazing: Timothèe Chalamet is wonderful, his character resembles a lot of Allen's performance in his other films. Basically it's the same character but different actor. Selena Gomez is adorable and shines in her role, Elle Fanning is humorous, the entire cast works so well with the genre of the film.

I keep watching them, thinking the next will be funny, but the last three or four have just been torture. Dialogue isn't funny, and borders on embarrassing, and in this particular film, at least, none of the characters feel relatable. And they always seem to feature a female character that older men just can't resist, even though she seems quite resistable to me. I think the actors do a credible job of doing what Woody asks them to do, but they all seem like characters we've seen before, and no one does the neurotic nerd like Woody.

No one speaks like that except inside the head of a writer.Woody just hasn't been able to catch his old classic magic ever since he did Crimes and Misdemeanors. To me that was his last great movie. Everything else has been subpar and/or derivative.Selena Gomez is actually a very natural actress, but boy, her skin is horrible. They needed a better make-up artist or filter for the camera. So greasy - what a shame after given the illusion for a decade that it was flawless. I guess we can give photoshop kudos. Maybe it's just me but Selena's voice doesn't match her face or body.Elle Fanning is quite annoying. She plays this irritating bubbly unaware dumb person. But she was written and directed that way, which is another shame.Timothy is overrated. Not sure why he gets so much attention. He is not that interesting. He comes across as the quiet ""cool"" kid, but when you meet and talk to him, he is a bore fest.There was noting in this movie that rang true to life.The shots were odd. Lately it seems like Woody cuts from wide shots into these super close ups where the actor's face fills the full screen. Just weird and unmotivated.They also used wide lenses that distorted the image. The camera sometimes wasn't leveled. Just bizarre. Then there was a shot in the apartment where it was clearly sunny and clear sky outside, but then ""rain"" was coming down, but only on one side of the windows. They couldn't even fake the rain and that is the title of the movie. And overall the cinematography was horrible. Unflattering to the actors. It looked totally rushed.Like young early 20s guys use the phrase ""make love."" Only Woody and his upper east side yuppies use that phrase, but in the 70/80s.The editing was also so bad.

In this comedy, a young couple arrive in New York for a weekend where they are met with bad weather and a series of misadventures.

If this turns out to be Woody Allen's final film, ""A Rainy Day In New York"" is one of the more familiar of Allen films but it feels really overused at this point.

Director: Woody Allen
Starring: Timothee Chalamet, Elle Fanning, Jude Law, Selena Gomez, Liev Schreiber etcOverall rating 68/100A rainy day in New York Is about a young couple who go by the names Gatsby (Timothee Chalamet) and Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) who travel to New York for a romantic getaway, but as they both meet different people, they end up growing apart. A rainy day in New York was very charming and had many great qualities to it but was held back by it's character work and issues within its plot, let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I loved the performances and characters, use of narration and dialogue. The performance in this film were great, Elle Fanning had a charm to her acting, and her character with her innocence and Naivety was likeable in most parts, but the best performance definitely has to be from Timothee Chalamet, who further proves that he can play any role well, his performance was likeable, charming and passionate, to the point where you couldn't help but really like his character and his progression of finding what he wants to do with his life will connect with a lot of people. The narration used was also excellent, it really added layers to the character, making you learn about their pasts, but it also added humour and more of an easy connection to Gatsby as a character. The dialogue in general was also great, it was very witty and fast paced and was a key part in what made a lot of the characters very likeable. The cinematography was also excellent, with the scenery that New York has to offer you are almost guaranteed a visually stunning movie, and this was definitely the case here, the amount of fantastic set pieces and Mise en scene was excellent with key attention payed to the lighting and colour saturation which I loved.My next couple of positives would be the humour and charming tone. The film surprised me with it's amount of humour in places, there was so many different interactions which some worked and some didn't (which we will get onto in the next paragraph) with funny characters with a good running gag of someone with an ugly laugh. The film also had a very charming tone, when watching you couldn't help but have that warm fuzzy feeling inside that just made you smile at what you were watching, the characters and dialogue was a part of the charm, but also just how classic Hollywood it felt.However, my first few negatives would be that there was too many characters with a lack of development making it feel like two movies, the odd creative choices, and the lack of connection to the main relationship. There was for me way to many characters with a lack of development throughout the movie, this made the pacing and the script very inconsistent, also making the film lack a cohesive plot, and it also felt like two different movies, with Gatsby and Ashleigh having hardly any screen time together, so it was two different stories that weren't really connected well enough. I also didn't connect to the main relationship hardly at all. The script did a terrible job at making you connect with Gatsby and Ashleigh's relationship, whenever they were together which wasn't very often, they always seemed very distanced and not that interested in each other, I just thought it was odd that they moulded the whole film on a relationship that people couldn't connect with. They also made some very odd creative choices with Ashleigh as a character. Making her so easily controllable and her lack of thought in terms of the situations she got in and her lack of thought towards Gatsby, made it really difficult to connect with her character.My final two negatives would be the lack of plot and the odd ending for Ashleigh. The film really lacked a solid and developed plot, this wasn't the case with the characters which I will get onto, but the plot was really just multiple different meetings and scenarios and just lacked and complexity, I also thought the ending they chose for Ashleigh was odd and I wasn't particularly a fan of it, the fact that they almost had both her and Gatsby just meet and make up like nothing happened was not a good decision, they did something with Gatsby's character for the end which was good, but they just left Ashleigh without any form of satisfying ending or conclusion to her character arc.My final few positives would be the character background and development and the satisfying ending for Gatsby's character. The film did an excellent job at developing Gatsby as a character so this paragraph is dedicated just for him. The amount of background they went into explaining why he behaved how he did, and his relationship with his family was really well done and in depth, it made you understand his character a lot more and really made you connect to him. How they developed his character was also very well done, to see his personal journey of discovering what he wanted to do with his life was very satisfying and well done, you learned his passions and interests as the film went on, so when he finally decided it was well earned. The ending for his character was also very satisfying, him being with Selena Gomez's character and staying in New York was definitely a good decision by the creative team.Overall A Rainy Day In New York is a charming, and funny movie, that took you back to the classic Hollywood era, with fantastic character work. But is held back by it's lack of detail to it's plot and the lack of cohesiveness with the characters and how they were all connected.",A Rainy Day in New York
41,mike-c-b,The movie is broken by it's attitude,1,14 August 2020,"The two main characters attitudes and script is a new height of disgusting.First of all, they walk and talk like gods but playing it down.

Just like many other films nothing much happens and you are just stuck in New york with in the character's head space.

44,annevejb,A quality film by a frowned upon director. V1.02,10,14 February 2021,"In my review of 'Teen Beach Movie' I mentioned that I understand Woody to be a victim of modern day vigilante justice. That having read some comments by Moses Farrow and Dylan Farrow and Ronan Farrow it seems proper for me to side with Woody on this.Also, there is a pattern of allegations and immediate hostility to the targeted person of vigilante justice, and also job loss. If there was a criminal prosecution and a criminal penalty, the hostility and job loss would continue before and after the criminal penalty had been paid. In this case it goes on after a proper official investigation that dismisses the allegations. This is a right wing world, though this does not just happen in right wing worlds. I consider it to be diseased. Among other things, it reminds me of the later episodes of Angel.With the UK Blu-ray of A Rainy Day In New York available at a more affordable price than usual, I assume because of this, I was able to follow through and get to know the film. It is typical Woody, a story where everyone is a mess, their world is diseased, yet they mostly manage to get by.The plus for me is that the 'Woody role' is taken by someone of appropriate physical age rather than Woody pushing second childhood into the real world, not keeping it in a personal fantasy world. There is also a young Woody lookalike.I personally found that second childhood was really important to go through, just near impossible to do right.Used to be my favourite Woody was his musical, Everyone Says I Love You (1996), Rainy Day squeezes that into second place.*Having just read a review of the HBO series Allen v Farrow I know that it is a series I need to avoid. I interpret the review as showing the series as a powerful media trial by a skilled prosecutor.Anyone who has come across the written Moses / Dylan / Ronan accounts that I did but coming to the conclusion of Woody's guilt should avoid this series unless they want to become part of a baying lynch mob. The film review tells me that.Me, I still put my trust in proper formal investigations, rather a lesser distrust, with any trial including more than the official state appointed prosecutor. My experience of being transgendered chaff blowing in the wind also makes me distrust simple interpretations of reality. The answer is not blowing in the wind.",A Rainy Day in New York

46,patriciogl10,Allen as comfortable as ever.,6,19 February 2020,"Most of the events and characters that coincide within this film inevitably make me believe that they could only occur in a Woody Allen film, along with its rich, witty, familiar and reminiscent of a past era dialogue, which can never be absent in a film of his. New York has never been shown with so much melancholy in an Allen offering before, and let me tell you it just feels ethereal, completing that sentiment with its wonderful and pleasant jazz soundtrack, which never fails to suit New York rightly so.Allen's dialogues are usually quite excellent, is where his talent lies, but do his performers' delivery do them justice? You can bet they do.
Timothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning play their parts stupendously, they fit incredibly well in Allen's designed universe and filmic context. As do Liev Schreiber and Jude Law, who have great supporting roles, and I must not forget Selena Gomez, who is Fanning's counterpart in terms of how contrasting her roles are.Allen excels at telling stories that develop in the course of a day, a weekend, etc. He knows how to unravel events, incidents and whatnot in a way that it doesn't feel unrealistic, but somehow belong to his peculiar cinematic framework, and that's a marvelous achievement for a filmmaker, but it comes as no surprise, given that Allen has been an established trademark since the late 70s, and has been an unstopabble filmmaking machine ever since, with many hits and misses, but being his cinematic self all the way through, with small adaptations to current times, such as technological developments and new stars that have caught his infallible eye for acting talent.All in all, this is Woody Allen as always, but at the same time he comes in fresh dose of renewal, which is what keeps his many supporters interested in his vast filmography.",A Rainy Day in New York

For this reason the film did not, in my view, succeed either as a com (I only laughed once) or a rom (no chemistry).I thought that Elle Fanning did ditsy well.I didn't know that Jude Law was in the movie and I didn't recognise him at first, I thought it was the actor from Big Bang Theory. I think that he did the physicality of the character in an amusing way, but he slipped away from an American accent to a British one on a few occasions.",A Rainy Day in New York
56,aliases-53334,Boring and sexist,1,13 October 2019,"Not only was this film boring as hell, pretentious conversations are not torturing enough for W Allen, he had to also be sexist and place more than half the female characters as shallow, stupid or prostitutes. Glamorising prostitution is not a thing we want to see and it is insulting to think that a beautiful woman sitting in a bar could be nothing more than selling her body to men. When the story took THAT turn I was already done with this film, but then he had to go there with his own MOTHER. Does W Allen hate women that much? Has he not had enough of controversy with his own private life being accused of sexual abuse ?
And leave all that aside, the script was lame and boring. I will recommend this film to people I hate.",A Rainy Day in New York

I admittedly don't know much about 20-year-olds, but I don't think many torment themselves over whether to stay at the Pierre or the Carlyle.Meanwhile, the female lead's lines are insipid, and she comes off as an airhead.

62,ozjosh03,Woody Allen + New York = :-),8,30 May 2020,"A Rainy Day in New York is Woody Allen at his charming and witty best, even though much about the film is slightly weird and problematic. For a start we have a supposedly contemporary comedy in which a cast of young, hip twenty-something actors deliver lines very clearly written by someone several generations older. So while you'd expect their cultural references to be Beyonce, Bieber and Gaga, Allen has them casually citing Grace Kelly, Gigi, Sky Masterson, Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum while dropping his bon mots. Timothee Chalamet's character at least has the cover of being fan of New York piano bars who feels most at home at the Cafe Carlyle and the Pierre. Still, when he sits at the piano and sings Everything Happens To Me - a moderately obscure song written in 1940 - it's still more than a little odd. The other problematic elements are the usual Woody Allen fixations. All three of the older male characters (played by Liev Shreiber, 54; Jude Law, 57 and Diego Luna, 40) attempt to seduce the nubile 21-year-old Ashleigh (who at one point is mistaken for 15). And both Elle Fanning and Selina Gomez are written and groomed as Lolita types in barely-there mini-skirts. That said, their characters are vivacious (Elle) and smart (Selina) and Allen coaxes wonderful performances from them. Chalamet is also charming, even if I never quite bought him as a somewhat cynical, semi-jaded inveterate gambler, and even though he doesn't always make Allen's witty observations sing as they really should. But there are standout performances by Jude Law and Cherry Jones. The entire movie is (yet another) love letter to New York. Almost every interior location (bars, hotels, apartments) is a visual feast, gloriously photographed. And, all in all, it's an enjoyably frothy confection of a movie, and a cut above most of Allen's late-career efforts.",A Rainy Day in New York

No real plot and how unrealistic that the Analeigh character doesn't go back to find her cell phone and purse when she's locked out of the apartment. She just leaves town with nothing. There should have been a scene when she at least makes an excuse to pick up her things. Strange. Performances are OK with Cherry Jones doing the best acting. Ms. Fannings performance is a little over the top and should have been toned down. Best thing about the movie is the standard songs used, especially Everything Happens to Me. Guess this is Woodys last movie. Watchable but forgettable!!",A Rainy Day in New York

Wonderful.,10,3 August 2019,"I cannot write a proper review yet because thanks to a shameful lynching campaign against Woody I was robbed last year of my yearly Woody Allen film (me and millions of fans around the world). So, I still have to wait until October for the film to be released in Spain. But I know that it will be amazing, so I give it a 10 already.I'm angry and furious at the stupidity and witch-hunt that goes on in the States and don't have words to express my anger and disappointment. How is it possible that Woody's art has suffered because of a shameful prefabricated accusation? Woody has worked with hundreds and hundreds of actresses in the past half century and nobody, NOBODY has ever complaint of his behavior. If you believe that prefabricated story made by 3 vengeful psychos you are either ignorant, stupid, antisemite, or just part of the lynch mob. It does not exist another single case of real abuse that presents only 1 accusation. For the ones who feel uncomfortable with the fact that Woody fell in love with Soon-Yi Previn, just have in mind that Woody and Soon-Yi love each other and are together for more than 26 years, have 2 wonderful daughters and don't care about what you, me or the psychos think about their love. Their relationship and their love is what triggers the ignorant people, not the shameful false accusation.I know that A Rainy Day in New York will be wonderful and magical, like every film that Woody makes, so I can already rate it with a 10. It has an excellent cast and one of the best cinematographers of today: Vittorio Storaro.Since Amazon loves to censure Woody Allen's fans and controls half the world I guess these words will not be published here. But just let me say that there are millions of fans who support, admire and love Woody Allen and who will go to the cinema to watch and enjoy this wonderful gem. Woody's the best director ever and the best writer ever. His films talk about love, death, dreams, art, passions, and desires, and are poetic, brilliant, real, magnificent, stunning and wonderful.We love you, Woody! Thanks for your Art. Your films make life better / Antonia Tejeda Barros, Madrid (Spain).Updated: I JUST SAW THE FILM! I had to wait until today (August 24th) to see the film. I was very lucky to be with my family in the Netherlands this month and this afternoon I went with my oldest daughter (she's 13 and loves Woody's films) to the national Dutch preview of A Rainy Day in New York at the Film Hallen (Hannie Dankbaarpassage 12, Amsterdam). We live in Madrid and in Spain the film will only arrive in October.I don't want to give ANY SPOILERS here, but I just will say: Wow, such a film: funny, poetic, beautiful, clever and so entertaining. We enjoyed it so much. Such a gem! Woody is so brilliant, Vittorio is the king of light, and the writing is so cool and funny. The only problem: the film felt too short! I wish it would have gone on for two more hours... (Woody should always make films that are over two hours long, one hour and a half simply feels too short!).I have to confess that I was very angry with Timothée Chalamet because of his cowardice and opportunism, but his performance in the film is very beautiful. Selena Gomez is also really good and Diego Luna is very funny. Elle Fanning is probably the weakest actress here (to play comedy isn't that easy after all) but it doesn't bother so much because her lines are hilarious. Cherry Jones' performance is absolutely spectacular. Liev Schreiber, Jude Law, Will Rogers and Kelly Rohrbach are also great but I wish they'd appear more.The music of A Rainy Day in New York is wonderful as in all Woody Allen films, you can feel the rain's perfume and there are plenty of quotes that will make you laugh and enjoy.No superheroes here, no bombs, no explosions, just real people with normal problems, like you and me. Woody's films make life better. Thank you for your art, Woody, and, please, keep on creating.10/10",A Rainy Day in New York

Gatsby WellesI love Woody Allen movies. I have loved them since I was 14 and caught ""Annie Hall"" on tv late one night and thought ""movies can be like this?""
Allen has been banging out a movie almost every year for near on fifty years, and I have seen them all. They're not all classics, some are indeed terrible, but the hit rate is well above average, and there's a consistency of tone and outlook that made seeing each new Allen movie a pleasure; like running into an old friend with whom you could instantly slip into the old rhythms.That feeling has been complicated of late. There have been allegations and controversy swirling around Allen that makes viewing of any new movie of his difficult. Part of why I didn't see this in the cinema but waited for it to show up on streaming.There's a lot to be written about what's been alleged happened with Allen in recent years but I don't want to turn this into a space to ruminate on that - I am just going to concentrate on the movie as a movie.And in that respect; it does pretty good. It's not vintage Allen, it's certainly no ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" but it's an amusing slice of neurotic, rom-com angst as Timothée Chalamet as Gatsby Welles channels his best Woody Allen impression and wanders about NYC as his ditzy girlfriend (Elle Fanning) gets into her own unbelievable scrapes.This is a fairy tale of New York, one in which you pass a movie set and get asked to join in, in which a college journalist scores a big interview with a celeb, and in which NYC is the both the worst and the best place.There are some terrible choices with Fanning's character, particularly a gratuitous scene in which she gets locked outside in her underwear, but for me, the joke seemed to mostly be on the allegedly cerebral older men who kept falling for her flighty charms. Where some have seen this as Allen celebrating older men hooking up with younger women, I see older men making fools of themselves as they fawn over a young woman, when women their equals (Hi, Rebecca Hall) are walking away from them.The other half of the movie involves Chalamet self-consciously running away from his privileged life, and trying to be some sort of upper class beatnik, but like the older men, he lacks the insight to see who he really is. Luckily he keeps running into Selena Gomez who has a better idea than he does.Unfortunately Gomez doesn't know what movie she's in. She plays it as naturalistically as possible which grates against the tone everyone else (and the movie) is playing at.The bigger problem is that Allen's dialogue just doesn't fit right coming out of these young mouths. Chalamet does a good job but buying into him as this world-weary card shark when he's college-age is just too much to ask.A lesser Allen, but still worth a watch if you can divorce reality from the fairy tale being told.",A Rainy Day in New York
82,thomasmitilis1995,REAl LIFE IS FINE FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DO ANY BETTER...,6,27 May 2020,"PROS:
~The best element of the film is the city of New York. The city works as a live character that has an affection on the characters and pushes them to take desicions that will change their lives. The walks in the narrow streets of Manhattan and the various beautiful places give retro vibes to the movie.
~Timothee Chalamet gives a solid performance and portrays a neurotic young man struggling with his thoughts and love life. He makes his own rebellion and despises reach people although he is a part of them. He is actually a Woody Allen archetype and immitates his mannerisms from his earlier filmography. The interaction with his mother (Cherryl Jones shines here) and her revelation make him reconsider his opinion about her and see some things from a different perspective.
~Elle Fanning does a decent job as always. She is a naive young woman who must choose which part of her life is more significant, her romantic relationship or her future success. As expected she makes stupid mistakes due to her immaturity and her little experience about life. On the other hand, Selena Gomez is the most straightforward but relatable character of the film and her chemistry with Chalamet is fantastic. With her first appearance comes the rain which symbolizes the changing of many things.
~The rest of the cast does a respectable effort. Liev Shreiber, Jude Law and and Diego Luna represent intellectual and sophisticated people who hide their uncertainties and their personal problems and see Fanning's character as a their last recourse.
~The ending of the movie is standard but in a good way. The couple finally meets again but they have changed. Each has experienced some harsh realities and truths that have left them more down to earth and each one has made a life-changing decision.
~The piano notes create a nolstagia for the old New York and generally an aesthetic of an older era. The photography of Vittorio Storaro is impeccable and the kissing scene inside a car between Chalamet and Gomez as the raindrops start to fall on the car is magical.CONS
~The film lacks originality considering that its themes is a terittory that Allen has extensively covered before. Moreoever, despite the charisma of Elle Fanning, the end of her character is left in limbo.
~Although the dialogue is witty and sharp, it is kind of pretentious that these conversations come from young people. In other words, it's not how 21-year-old talk and behave in the modern world but how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved, something that makes the characters unrealistic.
~The movie chooses to focus only on rich people and as a result it seems that they live in their own bubble and their problems are overdramatized (personally I find it hard to relate to any of them, maybe it's just me).",A Rainy Day in New York

'She' does not easily combine with ""melancholic"", but Woody Allen is able to show and exploit that side of this city. Love it. No one else is so capable of visualizing the love you can have for this city.Allen does not often sink through the 'class' his dialogues already have, to really expose underlying emotions in a more raw way. A lot often remains wrapped in infectious and very erudite - Jewish - humor.
But at the very end of this movie actress Cherry Jones has the opportunity to cause goosebumps on my arms in a short, gripping monologue that digs up those emotions. It is proof of the total control that Allen has over his profession over the years.

90,zacdawac,Everyone's Woody but that's all fine and well!,8,31 October 2021,"Pulp Fiction is a truly brilliant masterpiece but I can still hear Quentin Tarantino, alone in his living room doing a table reading of the script and reading every line, convincingly. The characters in Pulp were distinct, unique, perfectly crafted and absolutely credible but it didn't matter. I could still imagine Quentin in every role and I could hear every line of dialogue, coming from his mouth.Chazz Palminteri actually did start off A Bronx Tale, another rather brilliant film from the same era, by playing every character in a one man stage show. Unlike Pulp though, when Bronx Tale was brought to the screen, the other characters were their own people and didn't have the writer's voice.Every character in this film, or at least every male, talks and acts like the Woody Allen character we've come to know for over fifty years. Woody could be speaking their dialogue, thinking their thoughts and doing everything they do. We've seen him do it all and we've met all of these people, even if they all no longer all looked like a skinny, glasses wearing neurotic Brooklyn bred. Whiny one time red head. And yet, as in Pulp Fiction, every character is credible, they're distinctively interesting and we're vested in them all. Kenneth Branagh has played Woody Allen. Larry David has played Woody Allen (mixed with Larry David). In this one, a dozen people play Woody Allen. Still, t0000here isn't a missed not or a less than compelling moment, throughout. I was absorbed from the first minute, through the end, and I actually wanted to follow all of the character past where their stories ended.For the past ten years, if not a bit longer, every time I see a new Woody Allen film, I'm happily surprised that he can still deliver such high quality. There's only one Annie Hall and Woody will never again deliver the outrageousness of Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex or Take the Money and Run. The quality of Woody's work hasn't waned in the least, though. If anything, it keeps getting stronger.

Timothy Chalomet's lounge bar piano bit in an uptown apartment is lovely and the depiction of young people bluffing about things they don't know, especially in Fanning's character, is beautifully observed both in script and performance.

But it's somehow a charming way to spend a couple of hours. Elle Fanning is kooky and does her best to be a chip off the old Diane Keaton block. Timothee Chalamet is dreamy and solid but doesn't get enough clout. I'm not fond of the huddle of middle-aged film lotharios jumping all over Fanning, and I don't think Selena Gomez had enough sharp lines. However, it's another study from Allen of New York as a live character taking over the people in it and sweeping them along. Cherry Jones is extremely well-cast as the mother with a secret and Allen saves the best till last.
I probably won't watch it again for a long time, not one of his best but not the worst either. It's a shame that Netflix have done what they did to Allen. Not just for him, but the hundreds of names that rolled past in the credits of all the cast and crew who worked so hard on this movie to have it junked in the US, who did nothing to deserve this.

He creates interestiing, quirky parts for these overrated actors. But even Woody with all his directing talent cannot draw compelling performances from the ingrates Chalamet and Hall who fell in lock step with the MeToo crowd to enhance their female-identified creds. What, so he can get a part in worst version of ""Little Women "" ever made? And work with that overrated director Gerwig, another ingrate. Chalamet cannot act his way out of a paper bag. And Hall is so wooden, she's got splinters coming out of her pores. Yet I give this movie a 10/10 - for the amusing story, marvelous score featuring the incomparable Errol Garner, the sumptuous Manhattan cinematography and the exquisite sets. I agree with some of the others on this site that the Gatsby role was perfect for Jesse Eisenberg. Because of the me -too posse, we were not able to see this film in a theatre. This is just another black mark for my country as if we don't have enough. I feel fortunate to have obtained a DVD for my collection. I just hope that when Woody writes his next screenplay, he writes parts for the loyal, talented actors who have the courage to stand up for him, i.e. Alec Baldwin and Scarlet Johansen.

112,jerryp65,The music was the best part,6,27 March 2021,What I like about Woody Allen is that he's got great taste in music. I almost forgot what the movie was about whilst being swept away by Erroll Garner's piano music. That was also the better part of this mediocre flick with second rate acting.This film was nice and light and slightly funny but it lacked too much in every department to make this a decent story. A weak plot doesn't help either. Gatsby did fit the part and I like his piano parts and his acting wasn't bad.The rain in New York is always a wonderful sight. The movie however should've been called a misty day in New York as they played Misty more than once...,A Rainy Day in New York
113,TheCheeseMistress,Entertaining from beginning to end,8,7 May 2020,"I had never watched a Woody Allen film before. I was worried this one was going to be either boring or depressing, which is the vibe I always got from him (and now I'm rethinking) but I decided to watch it anyway for the two female protagonists and it was not the case at all.It's the type of movies that don't have a strong plot but instead appeal to the overall charm of each one of its acts, somewhat like ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" style. When done poorly, this concept results in 90 minutes of just stuff happening, which is why I was a little reluctant to watch it, but this one keeps the viewer engaged in a very comfortably relaxing and entertaining way from beginning to end. Not anxious about what's going to happen next, wanting something specific to happen, rooting for one character or wanting a couple to end up together.. it just keeps you hooked up enjoying the moment.
It advances at a gentle but constant pace, it never stalls, there's something interesting or meaningful happening at every minute.Woody Allen's films are sort of a niche so if you're a fan of his work then you'll probably watch it without reading these reviews first, but if you're worried this might not be your type of movie I highly recommend you give it a try. It will not blow you away but it will definitely keep you entertained throughout the entire length and will leave you with a really nice and warm feeling.",A Rainy Day in New York
114,FilmsFillMyHoles,Elle Fanning is a light that never goes out!,7,28 November 2019,"Honestly never seen her in anything where she wasn't - at the very least - simply wonderful.A comedy from a bygone era, yet a tale of romance, which is timeless. Now, before you roll your eyes back into your head, when I say ""timeless"" I mean Woody has basically made this film, I don't know, ten times already, but for me the message hits a little different and still resonates each and every time.
And I just love the man's writing. I also watched a couple of Éric Rohmer's early works this year, and A Rainy Day in New York reminded me of them in a most pleasant way.And I probably had the most ideal viewing experience imaginable as well:
a steady rain outside the theatre, the film shown in a rather small room, with a senior crowd (old ladies letting out hearty laughs left and right), me and my nice cup of green tea in one hand and a pretzel in the other.It truly was one cosy afternoon.
I look forward to repeating it once it hits VOD.P.S. (on the behind the scenes stuff):
I get why people wouldn't want to watch/support Woody's work. I myself am quite iffy about watching Polanski films. While I'd question the integrity of certain cast members, donating their income to charities is ultimately a good thing.

A remarkable transition from a filmmaker over 80 years of age, surely showing his genius.For once Woody Allen keeps his face out of his film -- we see a young guy acting as his 21st century stand-in. Around this guy develops a true whirlwind drama, reminding us of Allen's best work.The rainy picturing of wealthy New York of 2018 is fine, and the piano-music surely adds an extra -- even including Eroll Garner (1921-1977), a very famous American jazz pianist.My only doubt: our guy meets his girl in Central Park at the end of this film.

Nevertheless Elle Fanning was actually quite good, I mark it a 4 'cos of her, I always watch a film with Ms Elle on it with intrigue.

It is just so light, charming and funny with two great leads. At the same time the dialogue is witty and natural. Obviously we will not have a deep dive into today's problems, social commentary and the seriousness we have to have now in everything because this is not that kind of movie. It is a lighthearted comedy with an unbelievably charismatic Elle Fanning (who could have been written a little less naive) and an also convincing Timothée Chalamet. There is not head-heavyness, people don't ponder about the way their day goes so much. They just go on for the ride and see what happens next. It is a breath of fresh air. I also liked the way the lighting is used here. The music adds to the great experience. Thumbs up!",A Rainy Day in New York
124,highnemonkey,The ease is gone...,6,12 May 2020,"I loved the Woody Allen movies I have seen, even in their darker moments they flow with ease, a sense of airiness that perfectly transmits the moments of falling in love, which are numerous in the films he directed.
Yet, in this one I felt that very ease was gone.
It is an intriguing experience to watch this movie with the allegations against Woody Allen in the back of your head. Maybe a piece of art can be seperated from the creator, maybe it cannot, this is one of cinemas biggest questions since ""Me Too"" started rolling. Even if you try to seperate it and see the movie for what it is (the option I try to pick), with this movie it felt impossible.
The character of Ashleigh is just so flat, it makes you quite uncomfortable. A naive puppet, put there to provide some laughter and prey for fellow men. This was quite bugging, as the relationship between Ashleigh and Gatsby could have been fantastic material for Allen to mould his dialogues out of (just their first encounter already explores the boundaries of their relationship - how well do they interact? How well do they share goals?).
Love triangles, New York City, humor between the lines, this movie had all the ingredients but somehow managed to turn up the heat in some places while also undercooking the whole thing. In my experience, the good Woody Allen films worked excactly the other way around.Maybe Allen tried to deliberately violate everything that is expected in a post-Me Too-movie. That could have been a great move to make you question these unwritten laws of character definition. But it just felt like you are watching a very dumb girl being abused without noticing it.
Plus, the two main characters and their love for 'old stuff' was quite unbelievable.At the local cinema it was advertised as the best Woody Allen flick in decades and boy, I think, they just fooled me into buing a ticket.",A Rainy Day in New York
125,cgcastanedo-75966,"The Magic and Power of Women""",10,18 April 2020,"Woody Allen's most recent film (2019) is a huge film. One more...

Life in New York, the relationship of the couple, nobody dominates these themes better than Woody Allen.
As is traditional, a movie written and directed by the prolific New York filmmaker.
Yet another strength: it is Woody Allen's well-established team in production, photography by Vittorio Storaro (3rd. movie) and editing by Alisa Lepselter, the latter with 20 years of work on the team.

130,dizexpat,First Lesson for a Writer. Write about What You Know,6,8 December 2019,"In the age of super hero films I'm glad that there is still someone who is making films with witty dialog. Woody Allen should be praised for that.
But in this film neither the dialog nor the story works.""Hannah and Her Sisters"" works so well because Woody Allen understood these characters--how they talk and behave. He knew how to write for them.That was 1986. Now it's 2019.21-year-olds in 2019 don't say ""I need a drink, a cigarette and a Berlin ballad."" No matter what their background that's not how they would talk.""A Rainy Day in New York"" is filled with references that no one born in the late 1990s would have. Songs by Gershwin, Porter, Berlin. Films from the 1930s and 40s. And the name of the lead character, Gatsby Welles, is just a little too cute.
All of these are Woody Allen references. The problem is trying to force these references on these characters. It doesn't work.Maybe this film is meant to be a fantasy. It's not how 21-year-olds talk and behave in the modern world. It's how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved.No one wants to see a film about people staring into their phones but the truth is that the two leading characters would have been texting each other every few minutes and wouldn't have gotten so completely separated from each other. I think it's clear that Woody Allen hates cell phones because they get in the way of his stories.I would have suggested two important changes to the film. Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s.
With those two changes I think this would be remembered as one of Woody Allen's better films. As it stands he's created characters he doesn't know or understand and, unfortunately, it shows.",A Rainy Day in New York

But while it has all the trapping of a Beautiful and Damned/This Side of Paradise mash up, it doesn't have the unique voice or the deep yet simple relatability that makes Fitzgerald's work enjoyable.I think Timothee Chalamet is one of the most talented actors of his generation but watching this you can't tell. Between the stilted dialouge and the direction, his performance feels amateurish and the other actors don't fare much better.Also, I found the ending to be too saccharine.

134,reviewwhatIsee,WTF!!!,1,21 November 2020,"I am a lifelong fan of Allen's work so I decided to give this movie a chance despite the bad reviews. I should have listened! This film is without a doubt the worst film I have ever seen! Even the character's names are unbelievable. I don't know how Allen managed to direct these wonderful actors to give such hideous performances. The main character, Gatsby, is a 20 year old college student, who speaks like a character out of a 1950's Turner Classic film. At 84, Woody couldn't play the main character himself, so he dressed Gatsby in his signature tweed jacket, affects him with a mumbling Allenesque speech pattern, and completes the transformation by adding an eighty year old's posture to the character's twenty something's frame.
Jude Law's character's wife is cheating on him with a man whose name is out of a 1930's vaudeville act. In the scene where he catches her, he reacts like a character in an old Marx brothers' film. All the male characters are a version of Woody, and they have been directed to deliver their lines as if Woody himself is speaking them. Only Liev Schreiber is spared the Allen schtick but he is given so little to work with that his performance is lost in the God awful shuffle. The performances are wooden at best, cringe worthy at their worst. The cultural references coming out of the mouths of college age kids ( supposedly in today's timeline) belong to the eighty-four year old Allen's era and the talented Elle Fanning is just hard to watch. The film is misogynistic , and the plot is almost non existent. It was difficult to sit through to the end. If this is the best Allen has to offer, Woody, it's time to call it a day. Many actors don't like to watch their performances once a movie is finished; in this case, probably a good idea.",A Rainy Day in New York

Elle Fanning's character was pretty unlikable, but it was probably intentional and her acting was top-notch, I also enjoyed Selena's character, she reminded me a lot of Alex Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place, the snarkiness suited her really well.

In the hands of a less masterful storyteller this movie would have been a mess. But Allen makes it look easy. Not a single word or scene is unnecessary, nothing is missing, I always knew exactly what was going on, and the movie never, for one single second, lost its momentum. As always the performances he drew out of his actors was astonishing. Every single one of them moved me. Even one actress who was only on screen for like two minutes. This is brilliant story-telling.

150,MetroVavin,Enjoyed greatly more than other late Allen films,8,30 November 2020,"This is a fantastic movie. Critics can have their opinions, but they can't change the fact that I not only enjoyed this more than any other late Woody Allen film, but I was deeply touched by it. It reached into deep places. I laughed at it more than other films.The laughter and the delight the film evoked in me can't be mistaken. That's how it affected me. What better criterion can we have for a film? If the same film touches some people and not others, is it more likely due to a limitation of the film or the people AKA critics?Other Allen films are funny. Other films dissect our collective hypocrisy, self-centeredness, and inhumanity. This one stands out because it sounds notes of hope and love, the importance of ephemeral moments of beauty accessible to everyone willing to pay theprice for them.It's about a young man searching for his way in life, what life has to offer that's has genuine value. It rings the bell of the different things he loves, that lift him above the daily grind. THe movie manages to invoked moments of these magic spells for us, too.It's also about the foibles of film makers. Funny, and pitiful. Allen is well qualified to draw those portraits.Particularly impressive is the charm and presence of Solena Gomez. Her character radiates warmth, honesty and aliveness, profound depth of feeling combined with social adroitness.Timothee Chalamet does a good job of presenting a character that captures the features of Woody Allen without being a parody or imitation. Allen invoked the feelings and came up with the words. It's inevitable that Gatsby will remind us of Woody Allen himself, as he is on screen. Chalamet gives us an original refreshing character.People who demand a brand new original plot line are ignoring literary history. Sec comedy has used the same plot twists from ancient Rome, through Shakespeare, down to the present. This does film have insights into the meaning of life not found in many films.P.S.As far as the rejection of the film on the grounds of the accusation against Woody Allen, this is just my opinion. I respect other opinions. This is an unproven allegation based on the memory of a child from many decades ago. It's known that such allegations can turn out to be untrue, for many reasons. As I understand it, three different official agencies investigated the claim. One of them, an expert in such allegations, exonerated Allen. The other two found no credible evidence. Do we want to be a society that destroys the career of a great American artist on the basis of a single, unproven, contested allegation? I don't think that is justice.",A Rainy Day in New York
151,igotdatfosho,Woody Allen's World in Modern Day New York,7,7 January 2020,"I feel like this script was written 30 years ago, being as the film takes place in modern day times, it almost comes across as a fantasy considering that young people today don't talk or dress or act like the common Woody Allen character, male or female. But once the story kicks in, it does come across pretty nicely.You'll get the same ole love affair, love triangle, love rectangle, older man enamored by the younger girl story lines that we're so used to in Woody Allen movies but it feels self aware in this one and doesn't go through the usual tropes as previous films did, especially for Elle Fanning's storyline. It's something that is used to in the Hollywood world and it does stem away from that dark cloud.The performances are niche, Timothee does put on his best Alvy Singer/Gil Pender impression but you do feel for him for being undecided on life. Selena is sweet, and she makes the film more real and levels out the humor. Elle Fanning's character could be annoying to some but she is naive and extremely neurotic but it still puts on a delightful performance. Everyone else in the film does well.

The guy because he gave off this tortured old school artist vibe, even though he's not an artist he sure talks and broods like one. The girl seemed too naive and I really didn't like her look.
The lines felt forced, there was a little comedy, not a lot of good comedy, a tiny bit of romance but I wouldn't say it's a romantic comedy. It made me exhale faster, nothing really laugh worthy if I watched it the second time. The romance is pretty much not there, I mean just putting a weird couple or almost cheating in a movie doesn't make it romance.
Anyway, it's not a classic movie which makes people think it's artsy so they pretend to like it.
A rainy day in New York is exactly that, a relatively boring day in New York but both people had ""interesting"" connections that were supposed to make it interesting. I think a day in my life would make a more interesting movie.
This movie was like... imagine a regular movie with a freytag's pyramid, bulldoze and squish it so much you get it like a centimeter off the ground.

159,reginadonk,'Reality is for those who don't look for anything better',7,3 November 2019,"Well this was a pleasant surprise for me. Firstly that the film was actually finally released after all the foolish faux-controversy nonsense that delayed his 50th film being issued. The second surprise was that it is really rather a fun and likeable watch. (These days, long-term Woody fans, such as I, have become accustomed to regular dud films between good ones)
So, here we have a director deep into his 80's attempting to make a film in his unique style but comprising of a cast of mainly famous young actors to presumable draw in as big an audience demographic as possible. I admire him for this, and he, for the most part, blends the ages well and draws good performances out of all but one notable cast member (more of that later)
The story triggers off with a young guy called Gatsby (!)(Timothée Chalamet) we meet on campus who's girlfriend Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) works on the college arts magazine and is given the opportunity to interview a famous film director (!) but she will have to travel to New York City to do so. Gatsby decides to accompany her. The plot then involves him being unable to avoid his family who live in NY, the girlfriend being swept up into a chase and other shenanigan's when the film-maker has an artistic crisis and his producer's attempts to prevent him from hitting the bottle and perhaps carrying through his threat to not allow his new film to be released (!), and various other revelations, near infidelities, and hidden talents.
This is all handled adroitly by someone who has written and directed 50 films and thus the coincidences galore and the almost ludicrous range of skills Gatsby possesses, we accept as a part of the fun, ...almost.
The real treat in this film, however, is the performance of Selina Gomez (someone even I know is a young singer/actress) who is sensational as a younger sister of someone who Gatsby once dated. They bump into each other and she then drifts in and out of the plot. It is a real shame she did not get more to do because when she is on screen the film just takes off. She not only knows how to act and to act comedy, but she knows how to act in a Woody Allen film. With her first appearance comes the rain, and we welcome it.
In contrast Timothée Chalamet has absolutely no idea how to do any of these things. He should be carrying this film and making a name for himself. Instead he is a rabbit in the headlights, frozen to stiffness by the challenge, and he never once brings his character to life. The opening long tracking shot of he and Fanning discussing the trip to NY is notable for the way Chalamet never reacts to anything she says but instead gives his next line as if he is talking to us, or, more probably, himself.
There is a moment a little later where he meets a college pal who is busy shooting a scene for a short film project. This pal suggests he take a small role in the next scene to be filmed. Chalamet declares ""But I'm not an actor"". Normally when this occurs in a film we, as the audience, note the dramatic irony of such a line. Sadly, though, in this instance there is no irony because he is not an actor, at least not in this film. He was so bad that I, on the one hand, felt sorry for him, but also I kind of suspected that Woody deliberately put in that line to expose the fact that he had soon realised that his hot young star was not capable of making this film as good as it could, and probably should have been.
I recommend this film. Ignore the silly stuff that surrounds Woody and sit back and enjoy the fun. Do not expect a masterpiece, or great profound art, although he manages to slip in here and there a few quotes on life: The one that jumped out at me was 'Reality is for those who don't look for anything better'.",A Rainy Day in New York

Timothée Chalamet (Gatsby Welles) is perfect again, only proving that he is one of the best of his generation. The sequential planes used by Allen are very involved along with the vivid but sober colors. My problem with the movie is the bow of the Elle Fanning (Ashleigh Enright) character which starts well but then becomes tiresome and ends up copying the bow of another character from Allen in To Rome with Love. A very good movie to watch on a rainy afternoon, whether in family, with a person you like or even alone, as was my case. 7/10",A Rainy Day in New York

Just watched this film again. Timothee Chalamet is just awful, unbelievably bad - he speaks the lines with not a hint of any acting ability and he looks so uncomfortable around the female characters, like he'd never held hands with a woman let alone anything else, painful to watch. The film needed an older or more mature actor.",A Rainy Day in New York
164,cronos090693,"Clumsy, but lovely",7,22 August 2020,"The opening scene felt clumsy, and not in a good Allen-kinda-way, There were scenes where the dialogue flowed as a catchy, upbeat tune, and other times it felt a little too contrived and unnatural, throwing me out of Allen's melancholy world, making me remember this is not how it goes in real life.Storaro, master cinematographer, shot this film wonderfully, but in my opinion there were two times that his lighting choices were distracting.Other than those points of critique, I loved the film. I love the atmosphere Allen creates. I love the leading actors; Chalamet, Fanning and Gomez do very well in this film, Chalamet being a perfect young Allen (with the extra benefit of a velvet voice, enchanting piano playing, and less neurotic demeanor, although of course, the neuroticism is still there).The word I used earlier, clumsy, is perhaps a good way to describe the film. It is difficult for the director to maintain the universe he creates in every action and every piece of dialogue in a way that keeps the viewer engaged in the characters and the story all the time and makes them forget they are watching a farce from beginning to end credits. When it works, it's magic, it's proper good jazz, but you have to accept that there are false notes. Anyway, in my opinion, it's flaws shouldn't hold you back from enjoying this film

Jokes about a neurotic literary and verbose younger Woody Allen like character, searching for a rudder against an upbringing of privilege, an overbearing mother, unfulfilled potential and a complete lack of direction in life. It also pretended to be a comedic love story. But ultimately it's neither a love story nor a ""catcher in the rye"" tribute. After you strip away the facade of spoiled rich kid persona, a superficial girl friend, a run-in with Hollywood, and the pretentios-ness of 5th Avenue spreads and the Carlyle Hotel, it's really all about a sentimentality, for a rainy date under the Delacorte Clock in the central park, for a romantic notion of urban sophistication.

It's what Mr. Allen has been taking the at all his life, human stupidity and duplicity!
The weak link here is not Selina, she was edible in all her takes, but the male lead! Weak! This Timoth... what's his name, does not have the juice. This was a part written for Mr. Allen's ""boy"", Jesse Eisenberg. All alomg the movie I imagined how Eisenberg would have played this or that scene... Bringing a punch to it and spicing it up with the good'oll Woody Allen spastic-paranoia! He would have killed, given the material at hand! For the life of me I will not understand why this part wasn't given to him. This is the only reason it's getting a niner and not a tenner from me.

I've seen Woody's recent films, but this for me really has his unmistakable fingerprint: witty repartee; romance; immaculately placed and selected songs from the incredible American songbook, all brought to life by the usual cast of flawed characters, bumbling through life. Chalamet does a stellar job embodying the quirky underdog Woody-character, whose alienation affords him a superior view on life, G*d-like, as though he's sitting on top of the world watching from afar. Although Selena Gomez' voice, sounds more worn than the actor who plays a hooker in the movie, she comes across as a child, delivering great lines with the acting chops of a breadboard, ruining any chance at even quasi-believable chemistry; even when she's playing a snotty brat, surprisingly she is still utterly implausible. Yet Woody has handled this well, with Fanning stealing the majority of screentime with her depiction of the all-American blonde. Her rank ambition renders her oblvious as to how annoying her character is, making you want to scream at her through the screen. Really great. As always, the visual splendour Woody portrays NY with confirms his love for the 'knockout city', making it feel even more NY than NY. This film is definitely one of Woody's more serious, albeit light-hearted character-based works, as opposed to the far-fetched plots he likes to have fun with. Not nearly as monumentally classic, but this film did leave me with the same wonderful feeling as watching greats like Annie Hall, Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters.

The plot - what there is of it - is like a 1970's Brian Rix farce. I was expecting people to appear out of wardrobes with their trousers around their ankles.""on some level, it feels like the director is saying, ""see, this is what the super-wealthy are like, and they are just like us, aren't they?"" but if you are like one of these people, I doubt you have the self-awareness to realize how unappealing your self-centered, insulated life is!overall, it feels like a jumble, things thrown together randomly - there's the general premise, but that feels contrived (the way it gets played out) and there are unnecessary distractions, which lessen any tension that might begin to build upit has a nearly absurdist quality, and perhaps if there was some sort of apocalyptic development and they all had to confront their imminent mortality, perhaps there would be a way to salvage this hilariously terrible messGatsby goes to a poker game while thinking Ashleigh might be in great danger - so the super wealthy don't have smart phones in 2018?TV news report that makes Gatsby jealous is quite contrivedWoody's amateurish devices, which sometimes come across as charming to many viewers, come across here as just poorly renderedtowards the end, the film changes focus, from Gatsby questioning his relationship with Ashleigh to Ashleigh fending off much older males who view her as a potential ""sexual conquest,"" then we get a family drama with Gatsby; it seems like ""filler"" was needed because Woody couldn't figure out how to articulate the central dramaending is ridiculous, with inverted cinematic values!the main premise changed more than once, with none of them being at all satisfying. the protagonist decides to ""choose"" a different woman to be his romantic partner, yet he doesn't change or recognize that his view of himself was inaccurate. instead, we see Gatsby chose the ""better"" woman, which I find distasteful, at the very least (in some ways it was like the ending of ""Manhattan"" reversed); at the very least the story was flaccid and lazy.the ending makes us question if Woody has ""normal human feelings,"" because Gatsy doesn't seem to exhibit any normal attachment to Ashleigh, but rather possessiveness. if this was the case, there should have been at least one scene where Gatsby recognizes his flaws and treats Ashleigh with the respect she deserves.",A Rainy Day in New York

Chalamet and his girlfriend in the movie were the most natural. Otherwise, it felt hard to watch, even with the supposed love letter to rainy NYC.",A Rainy Day in New York

198,trex_daemon,Woody Alan shines again,8,17 January 2020,"Woody Alan hits again
Let me start with: I don't particularly enjoy movies directed by Woody Allan. They are too slow for my taste, there's usually too much dialogue and the characters are stereotypes of some sort.
But this time, the old pervert did it right.
This movie was chosen by pure accident: being a foggy November outside (although it's January) .I wanted to spend the evening with a movie that is light and not demanding, so I've started searching... this one caught my attention as it had more than 6 stars on IMDB. Usually, romantic movies rarely get past the barrier of the '6'. Maybe it's because all of them have the same old pattern, girl or boy falls in love, finds out his partner is not what he thought it was and in the end they end up with someone else, usually some old lost romance. So by watching one movie, you will soon have the feeling that you've watched them all.
This one started as well as any regular romantic chick flick: Mr. He, a quiet, although intelligent boy has a rich, popular girlfriend and, being a movie where everything is possible, they are together.
Mr. He plans a romantic weekend with Mrs. She - where else than in New York, where Mrs. She wants to have a short, one hour interview with some famous movie actor Liev Schreiber.
This is a perfect recipe for these 5 star romantic movies you will watch and forget the next hour. When lucky, your better half will get all romantic about it and you will enjoy some joy-time in the evening.
But not this movie: Quite soon from the beginning, the perfectly planned trip is torn apart by some unforeseen events, when Mrs. She gets invited to watch the unreleased movie of this famous actor, so the one hour interview gets suddenly longer and all of Mr. He's plans will be torn apart. Also, after this happens, Mr. He meets the handsome little sister of his first crush, and they end up kissing. Not in a romantic way, no, they are part of a movie and they are being filmed...
The Woody Alan style is there, all-right, as the characters talk tremendously much, but this time it kind of feels natural: the dialogues are between people who did not meet for a very long time and they have lots to say to catch up. Also, like in any Woody Alan movie, all of the characters are put into situations where their true self comes to surface: Mrs. She will soon forget that she has a boyfriend and gets drawn into the stormy social life of several famous artists: First, Roland, who has some serious midlife crisis and obviously drinking issues as well, his friend, who by an unfortunate mistake finds out that his wife is cheating on him with his best friend or a famous Italian actor, who just wants to take advantage of her like he did with so many others. Being a naive blonde and helped by the endless drink she's offered everywhere she quickly ends up in the bedroom of this famous Italian actor .
Without spoiling the rest of the movie, all I can say that the plot is not predictable at all and very enjoyable: every time when you expect that the character will act in a very predictable way, they fuck up somehow and do exactly the opposite. Unlike other Woody Alan movies, where the dialogue seems to be overwhelming the entire movie, here it feels natural that really helps to reveal the true nature of each of the main protagonists without being over-abusive.
Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie where Elle and Timothee's acting talent really shines, but also the secondary characters shall not be neglected, as well, like Will Rogers, for example.
To conclude, if you would like to watch a good movie on a quiet evening, alone or with your better half, this is a great choice and I am sure you won't be disappointed.",A Rainy Day in New York

202,TutoneSF,Comedy Pathos and OMG the Dialogue,10,29 July 2021,"I think it was the haunting sweetness in Challomet's singing of ""Things Always Happen to Me"" that brought me back to this film time and again. I suppose I never took much notice of the piano bar sound until I heard it here as it defined for me what I had been missing for so long. All those masterfully written tunes of the past that I realized I could never again take for granted. And the one liners were poignant, funny, sad and contradictions of astute intelligence and capacity. Allen has portrayed this type of character in other films such as ""Midnight in Paris"" ie as the main character undergoes a change of heart at the end with a delicacy of grand dimension as he recedes from his current love interest and fades into the background toward a more meaningful path leaving society to fend for itself. Yes Woody Allen is one of the greats of our time and knows how to put it all together for which I will be forever grateful.",A Rainy Day in New York

This is the first film from Woody Allen I've seen and was hoping to get a taste of what he had to offer.I sincerely hope his other films don't have anything in common with this one. I wasn't expecting this film to be realistic but I was also expecting it to be a tad believable.The dialogue was so confusing. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be ironic? It almost seemed like Woody was creating a parallel universe of what young adults would act like if they were 80 years wiser.This film was billed as a rom com but none of it was remotely funny. One of the main gags was making fun of someone's laugh. Peak comedy right there...I couldn't finish it but made it about 2/3rds of the way through. Based on some other reviews, I know this isn't his best work but even if his other films are 10 times better than this, I don't think id be interested.The reason I gave it a 2 and not a 0 is because I thought some of the directing was quite good and the way it was filmed around the rain gave the film a cozy look/feel.

Very poor acting.,5,17 March 2020,"I love Woody Allen and have enjoyed many of his films (some of my top favourites include Love and Death, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Blue Jasmine, Match Point, Midnight in Paris...). This one, however, was a big disappointment. The cinematography is still stunning as always, but the acting is so bad. Any fan of Woody Allen would be able to tell that the main character in this film is supposed to be a typical Woody Allen in his old films: an anxious, pretentious, whiny little man who adores beautiful women. Timothée Chalamet didn't deliver any of that. I enjoyed his acting as an addict in Beautiful Boy, but in this film he fell flat on the floor. I guess either it was a miscast or Timothée didn't do enough study on his character as well as on Woody Allen's films, because normally he shouldn't be that bad. The acting of the two girls, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez, was just horrid. Selena's acting made me roll my eyes to the back of my head (who the hell came up with the idea of casting Selena Gomez in a Woody Allen film ???????) and Elle's literally made me fall asleep.

I always wondered what MANHATTAN would've been liked if it was told from Mariel Hemingway's point of view. Well, now you've got it in A RAINY DAY IN NEW YORK. I liked everything about it--the acting, the directing, the cinematography--and especially the writing. There were a lot of clever lines in this film. But what I liked most about this film was how the boyfriend/girlfriend and son/mother relationships were portrayed. It's funny because I recently read D.H.

Listen, I'm a film nerd, I get their references, and I'm normally a fan of Allen films, but it is incredibly unrealistic and just plain poor choices. I hate the direction for the main two characters, I hate that they are acting as if they are Diane Keaton and Woody in one of their 70's films. Not that we don't see that in every Allen film, but it never took me out of the movie like it did here. It was just bad writing and highly derivative of better, earlier work. And what a half-assed plot. I've watched art films that purposefully do not have a plot that had more direction than the first half of this cheese fest. I wonder if Liev Schreiber's character was a fill in for Woody looking at his latest film and hating it.

The conversation between Allen and Chalamet where Woody was telling Chalamet to mimic him throughout the movie and then coaching him through the delivery of each and every line would have been both painful and amazing to see.

the movie was supposed to be a ''comedy'', but i didn't catch myself laughing which meant either i missed all the jokes or there were no good jokes.Elle Fanning's acting was horrible in this movie i recall skipping almost all of her scenes because i couldn't stand the way she acted or talked.

230,iseepinkelefants,Would Have Been Better With Other Actors,4,25 April 2021,"Elle Fanning is a terrible actress. I don't know what it is but the later generation Woody Allen movies choose these actresses that seem to be playing charicatures of the Diane Keaton trope. I hated when Scarlett Johansson did it (in Scoop), it's even worse with Fanning. At least Scarlett was better at the naive, college school journalist trying to get her story role. Is Tucson a tiny little town that produces imbeciles? I couldn't figure out why it seemed like she had just crawled out from under a rock. They kept saying Tucson as if it was this magical fairy land to explain away her naïveté and idiocy. Clearly Allen has never been to Arizona.When Gataby describes Ashleigh as beautiful and witty and sexy I thought to myself, who is he talking about, because nothing about Fanning was witty, sexy, or beautiful, and it made no sense why these big Hollywood directors, screenwriters, and actors would throw themselves at such a milquetoast person. He was supposed to be IN LOVE with her and they had no chemistry.Chalamet wasn't any better. Again another Woody Allen caricature, albeit better than Fanning. I wanted to like his character because we share the same traits and ideas, and I understand his romantic nature obsession with old films, but I couldn't stand him. He should have got this role, he's supposed to be a trust fund kid from NYC in real life no? But it felt so put on.All of the younger generation actors were terrible and it would have been so much better had their roles been filled by other actors. Chalamet isn't even a bad actor, he's good in other roles, but playing the quintessential Allen lead male he could not pulll off. It made me want to go back and watch the older films to get the bad taste of this film out of my mind. Even Owen Wilson was better at it.The mother's confession at the end was a weird plot twist, but not because of the reveal, because it made no sense to add that to the plot. Even the look of it, the aura of that scene, didn't feel right in an Allen film.It's been a while since I've seen an Allen movie that had so much potential and was ruined by terrible actors (actually Wonder Wheel was ruined by Justin Timberlake, another oddball choice that ruined a film). This was such a disappointing film. I know Allen has to scrap at the bottom of the barrel to find actors who will still work with him, and I know he should stop making films because of his personal troubles, but I have been a fan of his films (I guess that's why it's easy to separate the man from his work), and he does make great, old fashioned films. It's a travesty to lose that talent, and that voice. These days no one makes films like the old ones.

First of all, New York and Manhattan in particular have probably pictured more picturesque with those cosy shades of sepia and the moody rainy environment captured masterfully by Vittorio Storaro, one of the great cinematographers, a real living legend.This film would go down as one of the highlights in the career of the new promising actors and actresses such as Timothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning, also Jude Law, Liev Schreiber, Rebecca Hall and Diego Luna offer greatly amusing performances, while Selena Gomez provides good proof that she has a solid acting talent as she confronts Chalamet in a few funny instances.The story as a whole is one of Allen's typical themes, presenting a naive college girl dazzled by the film star society of the Big Apple and soon she betrays all love and loyalty to her young lover who desperately tries to reconnects to her on a rainy day in New York.Woody Allen, shows great nerve and style in directing, there's solid fast tempo that holds the story interesting and tight without a single dull moment. There are of course those greatly inspired one liners that add extra laughs and wit to the story.
All in all, one of the finest films that Woody Allen has managed to offer in the last 10-15 years!

245,Julie_in_ams,A rainy day in NY - or Everything I wish happened to me in one single day!,8,2 September 2019,"Nothing too surprising. This is Woody Allen in Manhattan.
""A rainy day in New York"" came to me as a rather naive and refreshing way of doing what W Allen does. Gastby and Ashleigh question what they are and what they are becoming. They do that - to my perception - through the eyes of someone of their age. They think but do not overthink. Action immediately follows. They do not get lost in doubts and do not have to deal with an ego bigger than them. They act, they feel, they learn and repeat. They have so much to learn from that one day. I found all three young characters likeable and empowered, and the actors on top of their game (Timothee Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez). I would have loved to spend that day by their side The rain never bothered me anyways.",A Rainy Day in New York
246,berlyndvs,Hmm,6,26 January 2020,"Something about this movie feels unnatural to me. I guess that is normal with most romcoms. The script seems a little off and every conversation feels like a skit from an outdated acting class. Some of the language seems a little childish too which makes it unnatural as well. I loved the piano music in it though. It gives a unique and peaceful touch to it which gives off a cozy feeling. Anyways, wasn't the best movie but I give it a 6 based on the music and Timmy being so adorable.",A Rainy Day in New York
247,bethkrav,Charming! Great dialogue and acting,9,8 July 2021,"Loved watching Timothy Chalamet just kill it in this movie. His acting just shines in this. Almost a combination of Woody Allen himself plus vibes of Nicholas Cage, James Dean and Christian Bale. I love the rainy feel of NY and reference the romanticism of old movies. Jude Law was a great addition as well as Will Rogers as Gatsby's brother. I got a real kick out of the scene with Gatsy's brother and fiance! I notice that Woody Allen likes filming cities in the rain. Same with Midnight in Paris. It just works and creates a complete mood. It's a funny, witty film and honestly I couldn't be happier in spending time out of my day watching this. Would highly recommend!",A Rainy Day in New York
248,susanepler-11311,Woody Films Manhattan,7,16 August 2021,"I have been a big fan of Woody Allen from the beginning. It is now known worldwide that Mr. Allen has deep flaws, obsessions and deviant behavior. We have watched this play out on the big screen over the years from ""Manhattan"" onward.Allen remains brilliant and a creative genius to me. I will continue to watch his work until the end of either him or me. Allen is part of the West Side woodwork. Yes, he started out in Brooklyn, but landed in Manhattan damn fast as many other talented young folks from Brooklyn in the old days.""A Rainy Day in New York"" starts out with a few in jokes. The protagonist is one Gadsby. Mia Farrow played Daisy in the Redford version of the film. Farrow and Allen spent years together parenting and Woody made the best of this family time to his advantage. The story is so enjoyable and charming and the younger generation of actors seem to love working on this movie. Elle Fanning is so winning, charming and frankly adorable running around Manhattan and Kauffman Astoria studios to get her
research and interviews for the Yardley College news paper. The convoluted plot is quite funny with all the missed opportunities, opportunities and surprises pouring out as fast as you can say ""Jack Robinson"". The soundtrack is all Woody Allen and a mixture of old and new. The sets are spot on, the lighting is lush, and the nighttime indoor lighting is marvelous. I have nothing but praise to dole out here.Please recall that many brilliant artists harbor bizarre ideas and act out the crazy stuff to the detriment of themselves and innocent others. These creative man and women still make art. Thank you for reading . Sue Epler.",A Rainy Day in New York

I am also not one of those who judge him because of the late accusations..... But this movie, wow, it hit me in the balls.I went to theater and just wished that it gets good at some point, and it got worse and worse. To be honest, It didn't get worse, it was just all bad from the beginning. The acting, the camera, the lighting, the editing, and even the screenplay, all were subnormal. I was surprised and still think it was a nightmare. Only a couple of good lines, and some references to older works, and nothing else. Maybe my expectation is too high about this master filmmaker, or maybe he is going through extremely hard times.

Chalomet in the Woody persona holds up his lead well enough, with a bit of nice banter between him and Selina Gomez.

261,dmariat55,The Scoop,10,18 November 2020,Most don't know this film is a fantasy. It's a homage to Soon-Yi and Manhattan. Woody doubles down on the #metoo people. Selena's character Chan is Soon-Yi. Chan is an Asian name. Even though Chan and Gatsby appear to be the same age the premise is Gatsby was dating her older sister when Chan was young. Chan (Soon-Yi) says she had a crush on Gatsby (Woody) when she was a kid. Mention is made of the film Gigi in Rainy Day. Mia Farrow briefly called Soon-Yi Gigi as a nickname. Soon-Yi's adoptive father Andre Previn was musical director on Gigi. Rainy Day in NY isn't about today's youth. It's about what it would have been like for Woody and Soon-Yi without all the drama.,A Rainy Day in New York

The characters in this film are not relatable at all, and I don't mean because their ridiculously rich, it's hard to understand their emotions and thought process. You don't get to sympathise with them at any point.

Billed as a rom/com the film contains zero romance and comedy is nearly as absent; the cinematography is luscious and saved the picture from a one star rating but I can't help thinking he'd have better served humanity by releasing beautiful stills of rainy New York.Dull and plodding, the film is ostensibly set in modern day New York but you wouldn't know it from the dialogue; the cast are primarily unlikeable Gen Z's who inexplicably never reference any cultural events that occurred after 1950, I don't pretend to be tied into the current zeitgeist, but I can say without doubt that twenty somethings don't spend the afternoon talking about Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Gigi, Gone with the Wind and Mahatma Gandhi! Nothing in the script rings true, the comedy is dated and stilted, the romance is non existent, character development is nil; though there are some heavy hitters in the cast only Selena Gomez is capable of coming close to creating a three dimensional character out of the mess on the page. Elle Fanning gives a career ending performance of epic awfulness presenting a character laden with mind numbingly bland neurosis yet somehow we are to believe that three Hollywood bigshots are besotten with her utter lack of charm and idiotic patter?Over the years I've seen most of Woody's films and I can say beyond doubt that this is the worst of the lot, my recommendation is to save wasting the 93 minutes you'd spend watching this tripe by doing something more productive: trim your nails, scrub the toilet or stare into space; you'll be happy you did.",A Rainy Day in New York

The dialogue is terribly written, the jokes are cheesy and poorly executed. It's badly paced and painfully cliché. Not even in the comical enjoyable way, but in the repetitive way.

T. Chalamet and the delightful E. Fanning are fantastic together -- it's the best thing either of them have ever done -- and the casting, throughout, is spot-on. In particular, an actor named Ben Warheit absolutely kills it (in his hilarious scene with Chalamet), Liev Schreiber essays a very funny performance (that's all the more comedic for being so reined-in and ready to burst), and the great Cherry Jones knocks off a (typically-incisive) Woody monologue with a panache that takes your breath away.

Even though i don't like Ashleigh i think Timothée's acting is very good. In the end it's a great movie but it would be better without Ashleigh in it.,A Rainy Day in New York

307,robwilson-67795,Woody's worst,2,29 December 2020,"I love Woody Allen movies. Great dialogue, intelligent humor, accomplished actors, beautiful locations, delightful musical score. Every great artist should be allowed to miss once, so I will continue to indulge in Woody Allen movies and books. This story is weak, the dialogue forced with no depth. No classic Woody humor. Nothing special about the locations. The leading actor and his leading lady are devoid of any charm or charisma. To cast these two in a Woody Allen masterpiece would by like eating a 7 course gourmet meal with plastic silverware. The only thing up to par was the music.",A Rainy Day in New York
308,afonsotrindadejd,I cannot even...,10,26 October 2019,"For sure one do The best movies i've seen lately, the hole movie tries to push you into The movie, and the characters are brilliant, Timothée's characteristic character is just amazing, i'm really in love with this movie.",A Rainy Day in New York
