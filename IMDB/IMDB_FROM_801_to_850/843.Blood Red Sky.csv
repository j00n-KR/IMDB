0,Leofwine_draca,"Novel idea, but the execution's flawed",4,27 July 2021,"Here's a new Netflix one I just managed to catch: BLOOD RED SKY (2021). It's a German-American co-production, so some of it is in English while the rest is subtitled. Dominic Purcell and Graham McTavish are two of the familiar faces in it. The story is an odd mix of genres and plays out like a typical DIE HARD on a plane variant for the first part, at which point a vampire is added to the storyline and it becomes more unusual. I did enjoy the novelty of this one, but as a film it's let down by a low budget which renders it cheap and laughable at times, and it's also way too long at two hours; the second half really slows down as it moves more into horror territory, and it feels like very little happens from this point onwards. I did like the idea of a 'good' vampire battling villains for once, but this kind of storyline was handled much better in INNOCENT BLOOD.",Blood Red Sky
1,SnoopyStyle,ok first half,6,29 July 2021,"Nadja and her son Elias board a plane to New York. She's suffering from some sort of bone marrow disease. The movie starts in Scotland as the apparent hijacked plane lands and Elias escapes out of the plane. In between, a group of highly coordinated men had taken over the plane and Nadja's secret is revealed.I like the first half. This is a somewhat cheesy horror concept. Sure, it's blank on a plane. I like the execution more than I expected. Somewhere in the second half, the little mistakes start adding up. The most annoying is probably the kid's voice. The obvious ADR is too whiney. It's like fingernails on the chalkboard and I would cut out half of his dialogue. The other issue is that I start thinking about the initial premise of the movie. Flying on a plane as a passenger is a highly risky. She's better off in the cargo hold. The whole thing with the explosives needs to be done by her and it's all due to her annoying son that it gets that complicated. The son is always a little annoying. Despite that, this Netflix movie is still better than I expected.",Blood Red Sky
2,nogodnomasters,That was no dog,7,16 August 2021,Transatlantic flight 473 on its way to New York lands at the RAF base in Scotland with a Muslim (Kais Setti) in the cockpit. Elias (Carl Anton Koch) escapes from under the plane. He is whisked off and doesn't talk. The story is then told as a flashback with flashbacks within the flashbacks. He gets on the plane with his mother (Peri Baumeister) who needs special radiation treatments for her blood disease from a specialist in New York. The plane is taken over by hijackers including Dominic Purcell. Then comes the twist I didn't see.Decently done film. Certainly a different twist to the genre.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,Blood Red Sky
3,kosmasp,Zombies on a plane,6,28 July 2021,"Where is Samuel L. Jackson when you need him the most? Probably still fighting off Snakes ... ok he's trapped in the MCU ... or is Star Wars? Is he still in that too? I don't remember about the last one - MCU he is for sure. But away from that, because you may imagine something completely different than what you'll get. Actually even Snakes on a plane should not be thought of too much, because that was a fast, funny and completely insane movie - could have been better, but way more entertaining than this one right here.Which does not mean, that this isn't good ... it is, but the things you might dislike may weight more than the things you may like about it. For example: the movie is crammed with great actors (internationally speaking), but that also means you won't get much out of them - never mind character development. Now a bit of humor here and there might have worked wonders ... at least for me. But on the other hand I know that other people like their horror as straightforward as they come (no innuendo or pun intended).Having said all that, the movie has really good cinematography, the mystery aspect of it may work for a certain amount of time, depending on how much you know before watching this, and the make up is phenomenal too. But then you have cliches thrown in, characters seemingly doing exactly the opposite of what would make sense and a twist at the end that is quite mind boggling ... especially considering the ""consequences"" thereof ... I think some people need to rewatch and reevaluate Zack Snyders Army of the Dead right about now.Also a good thing: a horror (genre) movie from Germany. You gotta love that - and the director has shown that he is capable of much better things too previously. So take this with a grain of salt and a lot of suspension of disbelief ... you may actually really enjoy it (or not, but you'll know fairly early on)",Blood Red Sky
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Plenty of bite.,7,12 September 2021,"A passenger flight soon becomes a nightmare, a planned hijack, and something rather nasty sitting in one of the seats.I wasn't expecting much, however it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable watch, partly thriller, partly horror, it's mildly gory, but not over the top. It gathers pace as it progresses, and will probably have a few surprises in store.The Vampire genre seems to have been finished for some time, this definitely managed to breathe some new life into it. The mix of English and German worked very well also.Peri Baumeister does a great job as Nadja, Alexander Scheer was good fun as the outrageous Eightball.Not perfect, but on the whole it's a very good film, 7/10.",Blood Red Sky
5,classicsoncall,"""We have to keep the evil from spreading.""",6,29 July 2021,"The tag line for the movie states - 'A woman with a mysterious illness is forced into action when a group of terrorists attempt to hijack a transatlantic overnight flight'. A mysterious illness? Really? She's a vampire!! I wasn't quite expecting that from a picture that starts out with a terrorist airplane hijacking and at a certain point turns into a vampire flick. Not that I minded all that much, but it was definitely a strange transition. The woman (Peri Baumeister), traveling with her son Elias (Carl Anton Koch), turns out to be a 'good' vampire, meaning she has empathy for her fellow passengers and takes it to the bad guys on Transatlantic flight #473 from Rome to New York, who have in mind a withering suicide mission on the city. All of that gets waylaid as Najda's (Maumeister) first victim turns vampire after getting bitten, thereby starting a chain reaction eventually resulting in a plane load of rampaging ghouls.There were a few odd departures from your usual vampire lore in this one. For example, when Nadja's first victim starts to turn, she manages to kill him with a knife to the heart instead of your traditional wooden stake. In another scene, she looks in a mirror to study her face, and she does see the reflection, which to my mind has always been a no-no. But this is not your father's vampire move.The finale too, dispenses with one's expectations, as Elias, realizing that vampire mania is about to descend on mankind, escapes from authorities after being allowed to disembark from the plane. He's got the kill switch so to speak, a cell phone rigged to blow up the plane with mom aboard. I'd have to say it was pretty noble of the kid, seeing as how he made himself an orphan at the push of a button.",Blood Red Sky
6,Tweekums,"Part thriller, part horror aboard a trans-Atlantic flight",9,23 August 2021,"As this film opens an airliner makes an emergency landing at an RAF base in Scotland. It soon becomes clear that it had been hijacked. A small boy escapes from a rear cargo hatch and an injured man, possibly a terrorist, is seen in the cockpit... there is no sign of anybody else. The action then moves back to shortly before the plane leaves. The young boy checks in to the flight in Germany while his mother talks on the phone to a doctor in the United States, where she is heading for treatment. Not too long after take off the plane is violently hijacked. The hijackers have no idea that they are far from being the most dangerous person aboard. The fight back will see many of them die before another turn of events puts them on top again... can they be stopped before everybody on board is dead and a threat to the world unleashed?I really enjoyed this film. Once on board the plane it felt very much like a classic hijacking film; a multinational group of hijackers including one so psychotic even his colleagues worry about him. This section of the film plays out well as it keeps the viewer wondering what their motives are and what exactly they plan to do. One also wonders why there is such a focus on the boy and his sick mother. When we learn the answer to that question the film enters horror territory. This is done in a highly original way that should please horror fans looking for a new twist on a classic horror trope. The villains are suitably bad and the nature of the films heroine is a refreshing twist. The cast does a fine job; especially Peri Baumeister as Nadja, the boy's mother. The creature and injure effects are very good but unfortunately any shots of the plane in flight, especially as it manoeuvres, look like inferior CGI... thankfully there isn't too much of that. Overall though I'd certainly recommend this to fans of action and horror looking to see the genres combined.",Blood Red Sky
7,paul_haakonsen,Now boarding all vampires at gate 21...,6,23 July 2021,"First there were snakes on a plane, then there were zombies on a plane, and now there are vampires on a flight. Doesn't they screen what passes through the gates at all?I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Blood Red Sky"" as I stumbled upon it on Netflix, and I must admit that it sounded interesting and the movie's cover/poster definitely helped win me over.And I will say that writers Stefan Holtz and Peter Thorwarth definitely managed to write an entertaining enough story.While it started out fairly slow, it was a great setup, because the writers were excellent at setting the scene and carving out the characters, getting the audience to know the characters and have a connection with them. And then slow, feeding the audience tiny bits of what was going on and going to happen. So there wasn't a dull moment throughout the course of the movie.The movie definitely has a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the various roles and characters in the movie. I am not familiar with actress Peri Baumeister, but she really performed quite well in this movie. Now, I am not a fan of actor Dominic Purcell in any way, but he seemed rather out of place in this movie, especially in comparison to all other actors around him. And I feel it was a shame that actor Graham McTavish wasn't given a larger role to play, because he could definitely had added a lot more to the movie.Visually then ""Blood Red Sky"" is quite impressive. I especially liked the design of the vampires, and how they became more and more bestial as they lost more and more touch with their humanity. That was just phenomenal. And the special effects team definitely worked their craft well here.""Blood Red Sky"" turned out to be rather entertaining. And I am rating it a six out of ten stars. If you enjoy action-packed vampire movies, then you should give ""Blood Red Sky"" a chance.",Blood Red Sky

No trailers, no expectations, only the genre that's what I'm looking for and so this one on Netflix delivered somehow.It's an original twist on the vampire saga. Don't take it all that serious and you are going to see a rather good movie. It's all there what you want from a vampire flick and somehow it did remind me a lot of the serie The Strain.

My wife on the other hand had no clue what the story was about so she got that nice twist in the movie (a little bit like From Dusk Till Dawn). Blood Red Sky is not of the same quality as Quentin Tarantino's movie but it's certainly worth watching. Nice make-up, decent acting, and a good surprising story. I agree that the first half was better than the ending but overal I can't be disappointed by this movie which I enjoyed from beginning till the end and I'm certain a lot of people that like the horror genre will do as well.",Blood Red Sky
11,siderite,"An interesting story, well done, really annoying child",7,1 August 2021,"The idea is obvious from the poster, the trailers and the first minutes of the film: there is a (peaceful) vampire on board an airplane. And so are some sadistic hijackers. An interesting premise that is well done and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The only issue I have is that really annoying child. Maybe the child himself was not the problem (the kid acted decently) as the way the plot warped around his character and how a large percent of the dialogue is someone shouting ""Elias"".I can't help wonder how difficult it would have been to film an alternate version where the kid dies in the first few minutes and his mother goes berserk. I mean, the actors were there, the sets were there... :)Bottom line: another good European Netflix production with people in a plane trying to escape the sun. Maybe they can make up a cinematic universe?",Blood Red Sky

I liked the story and set up. The only let down of this movie was i think that it was maybe a bit to long. But on the other hand we got a story that was successfully told. I won't go into details and spoilers, but this is a one good movie in its genre. Reminded me of ""30 Days of Night"" (2007).Overall, i was really surprised of how well this movie was.

13,paulclaassen,So you think you've seen it all?,6,21 September 2021,"Think you've seen everything there is to see about vampire movies? Wrong! Think you've seen everything there is to see about plane hijacking movies? Wrong again! 'Blood Red Sky' offers a very different twist on both genres.After an interesting opening scene, the film takes us back to show us the events leading to this opening scene. A young woman, Nadja, and her son Elias board a plane. It's clear Nadja is ill, but we're not sure what's wrong with her. On the plane, her story is told through back flashes.A group of terrorists take over the plane. However, they soon learn they are up against much more than they bargained for. Wow, this film had a few nice surprises in store! I mean, bloody hell! The performances are really good, and the make-up is also fantastic. 'Blood Red Sky' is also a survival and vengeance story all in one.Towards the end - while chaos ensues - the film edged more towards a zombie film instead of vampire. I think the writers got a bit confused, because I honestly couldn't tell whether they were vampires or zombies. Parts of the movie reminded me of 'Train to Busan' and parts reminded me of 'Flight of the Living Dead'. Jeez, this film gets really wild and bloody, so if you're planning on showing this at a movie night, make sure your audience can handle bucket loads of blood and gore.'Blood Red Sky' is a fast-paced action horror thriller and there literally never is a dull moment.

On their flight a group of terrorists attempt to hijack and from that moment everything change.I enjoyed this movie because it was interesting mainly in the first hour, it also contained some plot twists that made even more interesting and it had plenty of action. The direction which was made by Peter Thorwarth was good and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters. In addition to this, he also presented the history behind his main characters something that made more clear the plot of the movie and the audience understood even better the whole plot. The interpretations of Peri Baumeister who played as Nadja, Carl Anton Koch who played as Elias, Kais Setti who played as Farid and Alexander Scheer who played as Eightball were good and their combination worked very well. Lastly, I have to say that ""Blood Red Sky"" is a good horror movie to spend your time with and I am sure that if you are a fan of horror movies then you will enjoy it.",Blood Red Sky
15,cruise01,Hijacking thriller turned vampire horror mash up.,8,13 October 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Good action horror film. Plot has a hijacking thriller concept mixed with a bit of vampire horror.

The story is lacking any sort of purpose other than blood and gore. The characters are flat, undeveloped and with no direction.

Things get a touch OTT when people start getting bitten and in turn becomes vampires.

The performance of the lead actress in creature mode is great. The setup is interesting. The early stages of the fight against the villains is fun. However, it soon gets pretty repetitive, with lots of scenes of characters endlessly running around different parts of the plane. It then gets very, very long and drawn out. They tried to add a little too much drama; the situation called for swift, brutal violence, but the character who could make it happen spends too much time hesitating. I also thought the backstory was mostly unnecessary. I was frustrated. It picks back up near the end, and there is a fairly dramatic conclusion, but it was too late by then.

Our fanged heroine, played by Peri Baumeister, travels w/her precocious son (he makes a friend in the airport right away) but something is off as we see years before during her son's infancy, her car broke down & seeking help from a nearby cabin gets her bit & her husband murdered by a vampire in the throes of trying to control his disease. Managing to kill her infector, she grabs whatever medicines he has & tries to maintain (keeping her blood ingests to whatever fresh meat is in the fridge) but this cross Atlantic flight seems to be an endgame for some final purpose (she's regularly shooting up to control her urges & physically she's lost her hair prompting her to wear a wig) but when the guns come out & she's shot when her son dashes from him seat toward safety, all bets are off as the fangs come out & the feeding begins as she takes out the thieves one by one but when one of them catches on & accepts the situation he finds himself in, he decides to inject himself w/some of Baumeister's blood (he incapacitates her w/a UV flashlight) leveling the playing field but also sparking an outbreak as the passengers infect each other (the plane lands safely but is surrounded by SWAT teams ready to infiltrate the captured vessel) threatening the world at large unless Baumeister does something. Not as tightly directed as I would like & some of the supporting characters veer into histrionics & typically two dimensionality but the idea is so crackerjack & novel, you forgive the film's deficits.

31,IonicBreezeMachine,A tense mashup of hijacking thriller and horror films.,7,27 July 2021,"Onboard Transatlantic flight 473, we follow Nadja (Peri Baumeister) and her son Elias (Carl Anton Koch) who are flying to New York to get treatment for Nadja's blood disease and physics professor, Farid (Kais Setti) who's attending a conference. When flight 473 is overtaken by hijackers of unknown motivation, Nadja reveals a secret that is even more dangerous than the armed gunmen.Directed by German director Peter Thorwarth and written by Thorwrath and Stefan Holtz, the film marks a departure for the duo who are more known for their locally produced films with a comedic bent. With a high concept hook and tight direction, the movie does well mixing tropes of hostage/hijacking films with those of horror to good effect.The best way I can describe Blood Red Sky is 7500 by way of Let the Right One In, as it takes a very familiar premise and despite the out there premise makes it fairly easy to swallow with a more character based slow burn approach that's given thought to how it works. Thorwrath does a good job of getting the most out of his limited location with the atmosphere in the plane changing appropriately as the movie slowly switches genres. Peri Baumeister does a good job as Nadja, and is allowed to be terrifying, tragic, and vulnerable with a clear understanding behind the character. Baumesiter also has good chemistry with Carl Anton Koch playing her son and it's a really well done dynamic with a lot of story and character layering their exchanges. The highjackers are well played with Dominic Purcell and Roland Møller playing the archetypical cold calculating leader and the most rationale henchmen respectively, but stealing every scene he's in is Alexander Scheer as Eightball, a gleeful sneering sadist with a hair trigger temper that we love to hate and gets more insane and threatening as time goes on.My criticisms are fairly minor, but they are there and should be addressed. The movie I think undercuts its credibility with a flashback sequence to the past that overplays its hand at over-explaining when it really probably should've let the situation speak for itself without feeling the need to explain it. While the sequence isn't poorly staged or anything, I feel it's something that could've been cut as it raises questions about Nadja and Elias' past that are kind of hard to ignore once it introduces them and doesn't have any satisfactory payoff for them. The sequence in the past also over burdens the narrative a bit with what's a flashback within a flashback and over clutters itself unnecessarily.Blood Red Sky takes a high concept high tension concept and puts it to good use with effective staging and strong performances. While the narrative structure is more cluttered than it needs to be with overexplaining aspects it really didn't need to, the movie for the most part takes its ambitious mashup as far as it can until it comes to an explosive finish.",Blood Red Sky
32,thekarmicnomad,Very good in so many ways - but out stays its welcome,5,22 August 2021,"A mother on a hijacked plane is forced to confront her hijackers - as you can tell by the trailer she is not your normal housewife.The story, acting, production and acting are all really good and there is a lot of fun to be had here.I fully understand why people love this.The thing that ruined it for me is that it just goes on, cycling the same piece of action again and again.The first fight in the confined area is gritty and visceral and only ends when one side runs for their life.Then with each fight you get diminishing returns as no one follows up their attacks and people conveniently drop through hatches or scuttle off to first class.There has so much going for it but it needed to be shorter and slicker to keep up the tension.",Blood Red Sky

35,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Vampires and Terrorist on a plane,8,28 July 2021,"What I liked about this film was the original screenplay. I thought how the terrorist fished out the air-marshalls from the rest of the passengers was pretty clever. They quickly neutralized that threat. Even though this is a vampire-action-thriller, I hope some people in the real airline industry took notice of that strategic play?I really would have liked if this tv film had a bigger budget and a little better directing because I really thought the story was pretty well thought out. It could have been made into a theatrical film.The only parts I found faulty were the backstory to the vampires in the flashbacks. I think it should have been a little bit more fleshed out and longer. Also, where did the teddy bear come from when the little boy drops down to the tarmac? How was the vehicle fire quench? How could Farid arms been tied up with handcuffs behind his back when his lower arm was amputated? I would think the handcuffs could easily slip off his left arm without a hand :^) 😉I very much enjoyed this film. I am giving it an 8 out of 10 because of its original story. Just shows there is still room for new original ideas and vampires! A better show than twilight that's for sure.",Blood Red Sky

Air force 1,
The Commuter,
And possibly a lot more that I simply cannot remember (if you do post below) but what about if you mixed an airplane heist movie with vampires!I know, sounds silly and why would you want to watch a silly film about vampires on a plane (not to be mixed up with the terrible Snakes on a plane)?Simply because it is a damm good film, starts off slow but honestly give it a chance because it's well worth it especially when the lead high jacker..........(sorry no spoilers).Joint German and English film so some dialogue will either be subtitles or dubbed if watching on Netflix.I was pretty well surprised by this film especially the amazing acting of the lead actress, scary! And oh wow the look on her sons face when the sun is coming in through the side door just breaks your heart!One to definitely give a try.Rating 8 out of 10.",Blood Red Sky
37,Patient444,Great premise followed by bad writting and execution.,4,23 July 2021,"Netflix has this habbit of absolutely greenlighting any movie, every idea, so no wonder this one was made. Why? Well because on paper, Blood Red Sky came up with something new, fresh, something that was bound to make an impact.I absolutely loved the beginning, how easily it made everything clear, the plot, characters, and I couldn't wait for it to develop into more. But how did they manage to ruin it the way they did, it's beyond me. Everything was set, just some pieces that needed moving, nothing more, so it is a real shame that this didn't got a proper development. Truly a letdown from every point of view, relying only on noises and blood. Shame..I will not recommend it, because it frustrated me a lot and hardly entertained.Cheers!",Blood Red Sky

The first hour of the movie, in particular, is excellent in establishing the conflicts and characters - that kid character, by the way - is seriously annoying.

I only watched the teaser, which didn't reveal much.This movie was quite awesome. It was a bit similar to Brightburn or The Witch: Subversion. However, there's a twist that made the main character interesting. The inner conflict that she constantly faced and the relations with her son made for a gripping thriller.When stuff went down, I was invested in the story. The characters looked scary and horrifying. There were good amounts of blood and action. The horror had me warming up because it not only entertaining, but intense because of the conflict within.There were certain things that bothered me. Not all plot points made sense and felt random. The runtime was a little long. Lastly, since the movie took place mostly in the dark (it had to), not everything was clear.I wanted to talk more about the movie, but that would be spoilers, just like the entire trailer of this movie.

42,SoumikBanerjee25,The Second Half Ruins Eveyrthing!,6,4 August 2021,"""Blood Red Sky"" unbosoms on a rather zealous note. While caressing the dramatic facets of the storyline with neat detailing and prominent character set-ups, it embarked on a journey that recapitulates Vampire literature. With discernible technical dexterity on its side; the first half indicates enough conviction for us to stay put!Fine Prosthetics, Intuitive Score, some respectable Performances, and an absolute Bloodbath when it comes to making appropriate use of blood & gore; this should have easily been one of my favorites had they not ruined everything towards the end! Truth be told, there were indeed a variety of reasons for loving it in the first place.But then again, in a surprising manner; The latter half came off as completely detached and segregated compare to the first. Gotta admit, I was quite taken aback, did not see that coming; at all! My greater grievance however is that ultimately the execution comes to nothing. It just falls short of getting to that desired result.I'm not overstating, or, for that matter being deceitful when I say that these two halves are like two heterogeneous versions of the same script. Can't get on to the details (because of SPOILERS!!!), but I will tell you this; the trailer hasn't revealed much in this regard (Thankfully though). Hence, brace yourself for some 'bloody' surprises, No pun intended.In all seriousness, I had never witnessed such a drastic digression in the context of a film's across-the-board treatment! In reality, the first half is far more efficient in pretty much all its aspects. Whereas, the latter one falters quite a lot in few. Without giving away much; all I can say, the entirety of the third act is meandering chaos, which should not have been the case!",Blood Red Sky

I didn't give this 10 stars because it did kind of drag on a bit too much and the son was really annoying some of the time.My only question is how did the whole vampire thing start? Are we to assume vampires were always around and the mom and dad just got unlucky one night when their car broke down or was this something that started another way? How did this research facility she was headed to find out about her being a vampire? I would think she would want to keep that a secret for fear they would study her for science against her will. How was she to be cured of being a vampire? Someone all of a sudden found a cure? I wish those things had been explained a bit more. Did she herself not truly understand that she was a vampire and just found a place that studied blood disorders and she was thinking she was going to go there and have them figure out what she had?At any rate I highly recommend this. It's edge of your seat the whole time.Oh and Dominic Purcell was in this for a cup of coffee and his demise was rather sudden and anticlimactic. Wonder if they just threw him in to get people to watch this...it worked on me. He's the reason I gave it a go.

So they came up with the idea of terrorists that hijack a transatlantic flight, but among the passengers stumble upon a female vampire with a vengeance.Sure, this could maybe work, but here it seems to me that the makers stumbled over their own ambitions: it's really way too much of some potentially good things. We get relentlessly murdering psychopathic terrorists; a vampire on the loose; wildly panicking passengers; new vampires being created by the dozens (after each bite people turn within ten seconds!); and all this ending up in some sort of vampire apocalypse in mid-air.The special effects and make-up are pretty good, but the quality of acting is hardly relevant, sooner or later almost every person changes into a roaring monster.

But small dumb things through the movie just upset me. Like how when she first came up from under the plane drenched in blood, magically she is clean and can go find her son. Or how she was so worried about protecting her son she give herself a shot so she is defenseless and weak. I loved all the actors in this movie they all brought something unique to the table and their performances alone make this movie a 10.

One hour is watchable, the last hour descends into chaos. The vampire. Nadja (the mother) I thought she looked the part. In fact the vampires looked pretty good. The lunatic hijacker sadistic Eightball (called that for absolutely no reason other than a GTA rip off) was suitably crazy. Probelm lies with the fact they killed off the only famous actor Dominic Pursell Prison Break (Berg) to quickly. Major probelm with the kid (Elias) who is extremely irritating as was Farid. Elias knew Farid for one hour and then they had this eternal bond. Too many ridiculous things happen through the movie which goes into overdrive at the end.

Vampire protagonist vs hijacker antagonist was a turn I didn't see coming, and there's some solid character development and performances throughout. As the film roles on, it settles into it's b-movie skin, where it stumbles a bit. Vampires multiply and the action heats up, but this kind of dumb fun should be delivered far more economically.

68,gabriel_sanchez,A movie with an interesting concept that could not handle it,6,10 October 2021,"**Note:** Although this review contains spoilers, I'll properly warn you before going over them. The review is split between a no-spoiler review and a spoilers review.##### No-spoiler review #####A woman with a disease and her son are traveling to New York for her new treatment. During their flight, terrorists hijack their aircraft.The movie's premise is about what will they do to survive. It soon becomes clear the hijackers are willing to kill everybody to achieve their goal.I was thrilled throughout the whole movie. Not because I found it terrifying or anything, but because of the feeling of claustrophobia. Being in an aircraft controlled by terrorists with nothing to lose is unimaginable.As the movie progresses, we get facts hinting what is Nadja's disease. We get them in pieces.161 minutes of length is a bit overwhelming considering the main plot and the ending. It could be cut shorter.The acting is great at some parts. You get mad at people, you want to cry with them, you want them to fail or succeed.All in all, this movie does not get the top 10 horror movies award for me. Although the overall plot is interesting, I think the subplots are disjointed and too open. Maybe they ran out of ideas on how to finish this story in the end.##### Spoilers review #####Someone done f***ed up promoting this movie. Because of spoilers presented not only by the cover art and also by the trailer, the main plot this movie has is soon uncovered by the audience. I think they could have tried to be more mysterious with the main plot.This is a vampire movie. Yup!The movie starts with the aircraft landing safely. The police and the army seize hold of the plane from a distance. Farid talks to the head of the operation, desperately trying to tell them he needs to evacuate. Elias, a boy, jumps off the aircraft and is rescued. Then, we get to see the facts leading to this moment.Nadja hides a terrible curse occasioned by a random unfortunate event. Somehow, not explained, she controls her urge to suck on blood with some medicine. This does not perfectly control her instincts.Also not totally explained, she is traveling to New York with her son Elias to start a new treatment. I couldn't understand if this treatment is specifically for her vampiric condition or if the doctors are just unaware.During their flight, terrorists hijack the aircraft. They come from all over the world, apparently, and how they met is not clear. What they are after is clear enough: money. How? By causing a seeming suicide attack to make the market stocks go crazy.One of the terrorists is a twisted psychopath. I wanted him so dead...Because I was aware something was up, I knew Nadja would have to act. Unwilling to do so but forced to, she can't control her vampire transformation anymore and, mostly not thinking straight, she ends up being the only hope left for everyone in the aircraft. Of course, everyone is afraid of her. And they should.I find it unlikely that such erratic aircraft would be left flying on its own nowadays. Fighter jets would be sent to intercept the aircraft as soon as things got eerie.This is a good time for me to talk about vampires. In this movie, they went with the animal-looking Chupacabra vampire style. As she succumbs to her doom, more so she becomes less human and more gargoyle-looking. I always prefer the human-like vampire, but considering this story, the vampires must be animal-like.I don't like the way the psychopath finds out Nadja is a vampire. I would prefer he would discover that by at least seeing her feed on blood or something similar. He just reads through her diary and is like: yup, she is a vampire. And, of course, he plans to become a vampire too if things go south.Fighting the terrorists leave a trail of people bitten and turning into more vampires. In the end, almost the whole plane is a vampire-fest. This leads to the finalé: trying to land the plan and also kill every vampire on board to stop the spread. You know what is coming: Nadja needs to die too.In a powerful climax, Elias gets to see his mother one last time, but she has completely turned. He presses the button to complete the plan, blowing up the aircraft and everyone inside it, but they were all dead or getting killed by vampires by this point. And the movie ends.As I mentioned, I guess they could not find a way to continue such an intricate plot. All subplots are just fillers. The story is about a hijacked aircraft that has a vampire inside. The vampire sets loose, starting a killing spree that culminates in almost everybody getting killed or turning into more vampires. To prevent further disaster, the survivors blow up the aircraft. Any other story we pick in between is just pointless.The ending was too abrupt. It could at least continue with the cliché that the Government covers up this story and get hold of some samples for research.",Blood Red Sky

The same plane gets hijacked by a bunch of ruthless armed mercenaries and how she deals with the same forms the rest of the story.Carl Anton Koch as Nadja's enterprising son is a delight to watch and puts in a performance much ahead of his tender age.The way in which horror is infused into the story is pure genius and backed up by superior special effects, the film delivers a spine-tingling, eerily scary experience.Special mention must be made of the brilliant German actor Alexander Scheer who makes an immensely loathsome antagonist.

77,jdring2007,"unique plot for a vampire movie, quite a bit of drama but well-acted and violent, albeit too long",7,31 October 2021,"Vampires on a plane? Might sound silly but the movie is tackled with solemnity and a unique story of a mother protecting her son. This is told through a series of flashbacks recounting her experience of being turned, as well as present day, aboard a hijacked airplane. To spice up the plot even more is the ambiguity of the hijacker's plans, and that one of them is crazier than the others. While a bit longer than it should've been, many of the slow parts were handled with strong music and great acting to convey emotional tension. By far my favorite aspect of the film were the cosmetic effects, especially for the main antagonist, making him look especially wicked once turned. I couldn't shake the fact that the main actress looked a lot like Noomi Rapace with her wig on, but once she turns that goes out the window. She and the boy were both excellent, I only wish they hadn't interrupted every other action scene with a lull of drama. And much of the unnecessary debacle could've been avoided if the son wasn't so careless and magically elusive. It sure isn't without its plot holes, but ultimately I'd chalk it up to a good time.",Blood Red Sky
78,Mivas_Greece,"An interesting mix of hijaking and zombies/vampires! Serious and dramatic style, definitely worth a watch!",7,17 September 2021,"Thriller movie. A very special mix of ideas, on the one hand the always interesting topic of hijacking, one of the best films of the genre was Non-Stop (2014) with Liam Neeson and on the other hand vampires / zombies. Placing vampires / zombies on a plane was first seen in Quarantine 2: Terminal (2011), but here there is a balance between hijacking and vampires. It is not mainly a horror movie, on the contrary it has a lot of emotion and dramatic style especially focusing on the mother with her child. It has a serious style, excellent actors and a lot of suspense, although it could have more action. It has a rather emotional ending. Definitely an interesting recommendation for fans of the genre.",Blood Red Sky

Though, I actually like both those movies more, especially '30 Days' since it's my favourite vampire movie. That being said, 'Blood Red Sky' isn't bad at all. A few head scratching moments, but nothing that can't be looked past.The movie definitely did not turn out the way I thought it would when reading the premise, for better or worse. Fairly entertaining throughout.The vampire look was awesome. Especially when compared to most vampires in movies, when all they have are the typical two pointy teeth. If vampires were real, this is how I would picture them.",Blood Red Sky
80,manuelasaez,A waste of a great premise. One of the worst disappointments of the year.,3,24 July 2021,"The first thing I want to say about this movie is that it's bad. Not just in the ways most bad movies are bad. This movie goes beyond what makes other movies bad and runs with it to hilarious proportions. I'm struggling to think of one good thing to say about this movie because everything was just so damn BAD, it was funny that anyone got this through focus testing.Person reading this review, Let me ask you this; what immediately ruins a movie for you? Is it bad acting, because this movie has it in SPADES. (Seriously, everyone sucks in this one. Not a talented individual to be found).Is it the waste of a great premise with a horrible execution? Well, this movie not only ruins a great set up, but doesn't even try to make up for it with gore, good SFX, or some effective horror segments. This film wasn't scary, it wasn't suspenseful, and so many things just felt ridiculously stupid. Again, I am AMAZED that no one butchered this before it was shopped to Netflix.Lastly (and this one is the worst cinematic sin of all), how do you feel about dead dogs? Not only does this movie show one but TWO dead dogs, killed in some of the worst ways possible, like it's nothing. Admittedly, I'm not one of those people who is more offended at a dogs death in a movie than a person's, but come on. It was unnecessary. I've seen much better films that at least had the decency to shy away from showing dead dogs covered in blood. That alone made me not only dislike the movie, but made me write this review in hopes of keeping anyone else from wasting tehir time.It's a bad movie. It does nothing new, interesting or unique, and the dead dogs just ruin thee whole thing. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible, and the special effects are stupid. Avoid this movie and tell everyone to avoid it. It does not deserve a single watch from anyone.",Blood Red Sky

You may think that can't work well for a high-grade production? But it does!The movie takes several surprising turns, all leading to more and more chaos and bloodshed. Amidst of it, a mother and her son, fighting for their lives.Expect to be drawn into a masterfully photographed nightmare where said mother is constantly hurt, and simultanely loses her binding to her son.But also expect some differences to the ""kanon"" of vampirism, as we were all instructed about.Very good acting, directing and production values here. I must say, I have not watched a similiar captivating movie in the thriller/horror genre for a long time, except the underrated ""Shadow in the Clouds"".

But the second hour was a bit over the top and would have been better if it was half an hour instead. Kids that are supersmart and acts smarter than adults are not my cup of tea, sorry. Also it was politically correct when the muslim guy says something like ""do you think all terrorists are Islamic?"". Emmm.. no... I do not think that and I totally agree. But I hate being brain washed and indoctrinated, even so. Please stop making movies where they teach us how to think. I get equally upset every time, no matter if I agree or not. We want movies for entertainment, not for indoctrination.If the whole movie had been like the first hour and I could have been able to just watch without being indoctrinated or disturbed by that too clever child, I would have given a much higher score.Two weird things:A) It took a long time for her to turn into a vampire after she was bitten. The people that are bitten later turn into vampires immediately.B) A guy loses his hand. But still the cops manage to cuff his arms behind his back.

100,andrewrye-06535,I don't Like Vampire Movies,4,29 July 2021,"I started to watch this without looking it up. If I had bothered to read about the plot I doubt I would have watched it.I don't like vampire, werewolf or super hero movies. Primarily because they rely too much on green screen, makeup and I just can't suspend my belief for those things long enough. I do like horror movies and this really isn't one.Having said that, I didn't mind this one. Good acting by the lead actress although the child actor playing her son totally lacked any supporting actor qualities. Possibly just badly written but others are more vocal in their dislike of him so I won't go on. The movie tried a little too hard such as when the passengers were discussing why they were being hijacked when it would have been easier for the hijackers to just say.The tooing and froing with the story kept throwing me out. Imagine how it would have gone if they had concentrated the story within the plane. Claustrophobia mixed with blood thirsty vampires could truly have pushed the horror narrative and made it a 'on the edge of your seat' thriller. The makeup was that good. But they didn't didn't. Combined with a mixed nationality and different languages and accents (American, German, Asian and Scottish) kept me out of the story.So a 4 because I don't like vampire stories and although this one was ok, it didn't convert me.",Blood Red Sky
101,BijeshNagesh,Fine Supernatural Realism,9,25 July 2021,"This German-English movie was an interesting take on the 'vampire-among-humans' cliché. I was afraid they were going to bungle it up in that regard, but the way the film was taken ended up being a respectful nod to its director, Peter Thorwarth, and Stefan Holtz with whom he co-wrote the screenplay.Peri Baumeister, who played Nadja, gave a stunning blended performance that more than added credit to her skills. She made me feel for her situation, namely that of a mother who will do anything to protect her child.Speaking of whom, Elias (played by Carl Anton Koch) provided great support to Peri's performance of a woman and mother who is willing to take a dark risk and become a vampire if it means saving the plane and everyone on it - especially her son - from a terrorist hijacking.As with most movies involving vamps, they end up courting clichés. ""Blood Red Sky"" Netflix was clever not to skirt that possibility but rather use it to its own benefit.By 'humanizing' a woman who is later revealed to be 'diseased' and harbouring what is clearly a vampiric gene-strain, this film kept the thrills coming and kept boredom at bay.I loved what the Production Design and Art Direction teams - led by Uwe Stanik and Jan Kalous, respectively - did with the Transatlantic Airlines flight featured in this film. The sequences that didn't involve the actual flight were realistic and craftily implemented.Their work helped provide the Cinematography crew - led by the skilled Yoshi Heimrath - with all the space they needed to capture shake-free footage and grant viewers good views of the events that unravelled inside the plane.It is actually easy to skimp on environmental details and assume viewers will stay distracted with the 'emergency' of the plot. I'm happy to report that was not the case with ""Blood Red Sky"". Details, more than anything else, 'sold' the movie and made it thrilling to the end.Musical Score was another major element that helped make this film work. It was subtle when needed and provided adequate action-energy, again only when needed. Smart work indeed, Dascha Dauenhauer and team.Great work on the stunts as well. Jan Loukota and the rest of the team certainly did good by the fight requirements in Netflix's ""Blood Red Sky"". They felt real and relevant.Adding Graham McTavish, who played Col. Alan Drummond, was an outstanding casting decision. I adore his acting. The man has a way with establishing 'screen presence'.Farid, played by Kais Setti, brought some well-applied empathy to his character.Berg, played by Dominic Purcell, further shored up the credibility of the ""Blood Red Sky"" storyline. Dominic is no stranger to giving intense performances. I was genuinely breathing a sigh of relief that they gave him a villainous role. He pulls off the 'bad guy' trope like no man's business.The rest of the terrorists also did right by their roles - especially the psychotic Eightball, played by Alexander Scheer.VFX was excellent in the ""Blood Red Sky"" movie Netflix. The team integrated subtlety and realism to brilliant effect. The same can be said for the Makeup department - special nod to the prosthetic and special effects makeup artists. They helped breathe life into Nadja's (and the others') vampire persona.I appreciate the filmmakers for relying on early European vampiric lore to inspire their creature design. It was how Nadja and the other 'turned' people were able to give off those amazing 'Nosferatu' vibes. It felt real and relatable, not to mention refreshingly contrary to the over-glamourized version of vampires that has come to prevail in cinema and series.""Blood Red Sky"" is worth watching for this reason, as well as how distinctly the filmmakers captured the fact that a mother's love transcends species. Humans are not the only ones to forge strong protective bonds with their children.That said, another pertinent reason to watch ""Blood Red Sky"" is that it doesn't have a happy ending. The film wraps on a tone of 'supernatural realism'. What this movie lacks in bombast it more than makes up for in credibility. It redefines the phrase 'Nature is red in tooth and claw'.",Blood Red Sky

This German action horror flick is WAY better than it has any right to be. It's a gory, action-packed, exhilarating ride set on an airplane, which in my opinion, is one of the best settings for this type of film. I'm a sucker for airplane movies and this one uses the geography it has on hand to maximum effect.For such a crazy concept, it's a surprisingly grounded film, with a powerhouse performance from Baumeister being its emotional centre. Her amazing physical performance humanizes the grotesque monster she becomes. I also applaud Koch, a child actor who is both a) pretty good at acting and b) written VERY well. He's a smart, resourceful kid who still acts like a kid. Love it.Shout out to the absolutely AWESOME final act. Everything just comes together so f***king well. It's the badass, adrenaline pumping s**t it needs to be.The Bad: the movie can be a *bit* hokey at times and I feel whenever English is spoken, the dialog sounds a bit off. The performances can be hit or miss from the most of the cast, but to be honest, it's not that big of a deal.The Ugly: Sexy vampires are overplayed. Bring back these guys: ugly, monstrous, animalistic and scary. I loved the depiction of vampires in this film; you're supposed to want to run away from them, not f**** them.",Blood Red Sky

123,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,The Airplane Flies Through the Blood Red Sky,7,30 July 2021,"Hey Streamers out there! It has been a busy few weeks, but that doesn't mean the streaming stops. This week we noticed the release of Blood Red Sky on July 23, 2021. The movie poster and caption peaked my interest, but the 2 hour runtime frightened me. I mean can I really pull myself away from the Olympics 2020 for a whole two hours? Well, I managed to do so and let's see how it turned out.Blood Red Sky is about a woman with a mysterious illness forced to protect her son when terrorists attempt to hijack their flight to America. I know you're saying... what illness does this poor, loving mom have? Well, that's for me to know and you to find out when you watch; but, whatever she has, I don't want. This movie is a mash up of a bunch of storylines we all enjoy. Hijacked planes, people fighting bad guys, and horror! Slightly creative but ultimately feels like a longer version of World War Z mixed with District 9 and 30 Days of Night scenes. It's a basic premise that takes a really long time to develop. And yet I know that I'm tired of these Monkey Loving terrorists on this Mother Fighting plane! *Samuel L. Voice* I will say the brutality of the terrorists was a little fun because a couple are familiar faces from other movies and shows. I'm looking at you Heat Wave/Mick Rory and Chidi Ajufo. Realistically, the actors do a good job of simultaneously making us hate the terrorists but also like them all at once. Otherwise, there's not much to the acting in this film but Carl Koch, as Elias, and Kais Setti, as Farid, do a pretty good job for their roles. Both are able to portray the severity, fear, panic, and empathy that the moment needs. I know that's confusing and intriguing at the same time.Needless to say, Blood Red Sky never needed to be made but I'm surprised that I'm glad it was. Honestly, I might have been a little mad if I'd paid to see this in the theater but for free, I'm pleasantly surprised. If you love a good vampire chase movie, then you'll enjoy this flick. Blood Red Sky keeps it interesting and full of anxiety throughout the movie, even though the storyline falls off hard midway through and the movie drags on for too long. If you're into horror flicks and don't mind the façade of a heist flick, I say turn to Netflix and check this one out with a bowl of popcorn. It's not must see TV but it won't let you down in a jam.",Blood Red Sky
124,gregoryroman-88635,Vamps On A Plane,6,26 July 2021,"Overall a decent film. Acting was superb as is usually the case in foreign pictures. I felt the second part of the movie dragged a bit too much and the ending looked ""forced"", almost like the post production/editing departments ran out of time. Lastly, the whole Mom/Kid clinging to each other was okay for a bit, but as conditions changed so must that relationship, otherwise it just doesn't make logical sense and the audience will disconnect because they're thinking, ""That's not what I would do."" When you're fighting for your life, yeah the adrenaline is flowing, but if logic and reason isn't used, it's ""C-ya wouldn't want to B-ya"". But I liked the concept and originality for a genre that's been around a long time. Grade: B-",Blood Red Sky

126,jakerocks,Mediocre,4,6 August 2021,The first hour was a decent setup but the second hour got slow and senseless. The vampires don't have any special abilities so what is there to do but play hide and seek for two hours? Does she have super human strength or not? Contradicting scenes are confusing as to her capabilities. If it were half an hour shorter it would have been a tighter story with a more satisfying ending.The heartfelt moments feel forced and took forever because there wasn't appropriate reflection between anecdotes and action. This story needed to sit in the incubator a little longer. Nice try but a throwaway.,Blood Red Sky

Alas, it turn out to be a chewed-up vampire story... on a plane (""snakes on a plane"" anyone?) Illness my a$$. Not super creative and not scary or shocking. There was also some green blood at some point, not sure why as it was not seem to be done for MPAA rating mending. There were couple of other things that did not make sense to me, e.g. Why the plane is carrying cars inside it?Overall this movie almost makes it, the acting is good, so if the filmography, the makeup and the story buildup (including the flashbacks). Unfortunately towards the end the movie becomes boring and the ending is good but does not teach us much. It is fine to watch if you like vampires, but really doesn't give us anything new or exciting we haven't seen before.Last words: This movie is mixed English/German audio. I watched with the German original audio.

132,NavyOrion,Better than it should have been,7,4 August 2021,"An interesting premise: vampirism as a medical condition.Despite all the early 2000s nonsense of ""Twilight"" and its clones, it's unusual for a vampire to be the protagonist in a film, but you really do end up sympathizing with the stricken woman and her son. Seeing her reluctance as she is forced to embrace her ""condition"" in order to fight a group of terrorists (who REALLY picked the wrong plane to hijack) keeps this from being just another run-of-the-mill monster movie.A nice touch was the series of flashbacks in which we see the incident when the woman was first turned
into a vampire, her discovery and adaptation to her new life, and her ultimately futile and unsatisfying vengeance.The last half hour or so very much declines in quality, unfortunately, and devolves into not so much a vampire movie as one about zombies of the ""28 Days Later"" or ""World War Z"" variety, as all of the passengers are quickly ""turned."" Although getting the plane on the ground (in daylight, fortunately) was necessary to give her son and his protector a way out of the situation, a quicker resolution would have been made for a tighter story arc: the last few minutes are a bit tedious, as we wait for the terror-response team to finally encounter the planeload of monsters just prior to a fairly ridiculous end.The film could have been better executed (and probably will be, when or if it is remade by an American studio with better-known actors) but ""Blood Red Sky"" is still above the average for never-heard-of-it Netflix movies, and well worth a look.",Blood Red Sky

Second, in order to move the plot forward, they had the entire cast acting in a wholly illogical manner
Third, they decided to put politics ahead of realism. In other words, the logical and most believable villains were turned into the misunderstood good guys; while the bad guys were ridiculous (seriously, it got laughable at times watching them).Fourth, they decided to grandstand right in the middle of the film; literally stopping all action to have a completely forced exchange about prejudice. Yes, that's why I watch a horror movie about a vampire trapped on a plane, to get a lecture on social justice.Fifth, they added some gratuitous scenes involving animals that merely offended your senses.Sixth, they failed to generate any real tension. They took a movie that had a vampire and the hijacking of a plane, then found a way to make it boring.I think reviewers are being overly kind to this movie by giving it credit for what it could have been, rather than what it was.For me, however, watching the potential this story had being completely squandered was worse than watching a mediocre plot that is well constructed and artfully edited.",Blood Red Sky

How surprised I was to enjoy this movie as much as I did.Horror movie? Disaster movie? Action flick? Kinda sorta all of the above. And somehow, overall, it still works.We've had snakes, spiders, and tons of hijackers on airplanes. Now we have vampires. Why not? Everything here is done competently enough. There aren't too many holes, that is, if you're predisposed to accept vampires to begin with, and the acting is good. Not great, but good.The filmmakers don't just plop us down in a plane with a bloodsucker and shout action, either. They give us a backstory by way of flashbacks that actually make some sense and not only establish the female lead's character, but also allow us to have sympathy for her in spite of her status as a Nosferatu look alike.Unfortunately, the filmmakers play on some stereotypes about Muslims and air travel that are overwrought and don't really further the plot. They also take a thoroughly unnecessary swipe at gay men/gay flight attendants that's right on the verge of inaporopriate.Nevertheless, vampire versus highjacker is something you don't see every day, and in spite of its identity crisis, this movie was still a fun watch.",Blood Red Sky
152,TruView,The only 10 Star-Rated Movie of the Year!!!,10,26 July 2021,"Vampires on the plane isn't altogether unfamiliar to us. We've seen it aplenty - but not for the entire duration. Such a concept immediately places a time limit on the ordeal putting the protagonist (and by extension, the audience members) on notice: This Too Shall END!!! But only because it has too. The sun's coming back up and they'll be hell to pay if you're caught in it... literally! So from the outset, we're all hoping for mom to touch down safely with little Elias in tow.Secondly, the bad guys aren't your average storm troopers either. They're savvy, focused, and imaginative. Their differing personalities add a thin layer of complexity scaling up interactions that would otherwise be one dimensional. They've even installed a joker element (a common theme these days). And the dynamic this introduces gives quite the rush; think survival instincts vs sadism.Someone really took their time with this film. I was immediately engaged to well after the end credits. Even their choice of music ""I Found You"" by Charles Newman and gang was a bone-chilling selection that reminded me of two other films of the genre, Thirty Days of Night 2007 and Let Me In 2008. What is it about vampires and a snowy backdrop that captivates so many of us? I don't know, but it tends to work and work well. This film is no different. It had good luck, bad luck, dumb luck, grit, clever gambits, bonehead mistakes, cowards, and heroes. The twists and turns kept me guessing.

174,afrocut,Fly The fiendly skies,6,4 August 2021,"In principle ""Blood Red Sky"" is a simple and cheesy premise (what if a recovering vampire were on board an airplane during a terrorist hijacking?), its also simple and cheesy in execution. But it turns out it's also kind of clever, endearing and fun to watch. Vampires and zombies have been done into the ground, both hoping for an interesting take to respark interest. ""Blood Red Sky"" kind of accomplishes that by mashing the two together with some fun make up and practical effects. Believe me, those practical ones need to be praised because the CGI ones can be laughable at times. The story lingers on a mother and son who harbor a deadly secret, her attempts to mask her growing blood lust, unfortunately for them the plane they just boarded is over run with Hijackers who want to fake terrorist attacks. One of those hijackers happens to be a blood hungry psychopath, theres always one ready to screw up the plan. This cliche is one that was unneeded and kind of hurts the movie. It would have been more fun to just have the hijackers deal with their new problem instead of having to constantly call out the serial killer in their group as well. Its almost as if the writers were more into a serial killer vs vampire scenario then the actual plot. As for the plot the story of son and mother and her need to protect him at all costs is a nice touch and really keeps you focused on what's unfolding. Both actors are quite good as well. It's just a shame that the logic the film presents is so filled with holes around them and their problem, it constantly has you questioning how things work.

184,jeffkresse-814-345969,Not half bad and I really don't like the vampire/zombie/monster genre,7,24 July 2021,"Enjoyable and better than average foundation for this type of film. No teenagers going to a cabin for the weekend and naively confronting a variety evil, this introduces a mother on a trip with her young son from Europe to New York for a speciality doctor to help cure her of onset vampirism. During the flight terrorists take over the plane and one of them shoots the mother three times. Yes, she should be dead.Introduce a self-sacrificing twist now: like every mother, emerging vampire or not, the instinct to protect her son kicks in full throttle, and she decides the only way she can survive is to fully give into vampirism. With this transformation she could resurrect from just minutes from death into a raging vampire that can by herself defeat the terrorists, knowing that in the end from this irreversible change of state.The rest is a vicious bloodbath until the end that all you that crave blood-dripping gore will enjoy. The whole mother sacrificing herself for her son is the unique premise that carries this movie to my 7 star rating. If they could have developed some of the passenger characters more and not killed them off almost cavalierly I think it could gain another star. I will let the genre aficionados lend their more experience critique on this.Watched in original German since I am German, but I don't think the original language makes it much better.",Blood Red Sky

Although we have seen some elements like this in other films. This film takes those elements and uses them in a way that it feels completely fresh.The Bad- The execution of it all could have been that little bit better. There were some points where I did start to lose interest because of the execution not because I wasn't having fun with this film. The second act does become a bit dull for my liking as everything starts to slow down.Overall Thoughts- Although the story brings nothing new to the genre it definitely gives you the intensity you want out of a film like this.

189,JICNZ,Very First Frame Defined This Movie For Me,1,7 August 2021,"An airbase in Scotland. A guy gets out of a helicopter. A female soldier is waiting to greet him. And with no beret on, she salutes him. She salutes him bareheaded. This is as wrong and jarring for anyone with a modicum of knowledge about anything as a film about a surgeon picking up a carving knife in the operating theatre. Do these people with their vast budgets not think to get one person onboard who could give their daft script a once over for credibility? Maybe no one cares.So, within a few minutes we learn the guy off the helicopter is a colonel. Uh huh. He has a beard. So what army is he supposed to be a colonel in? Not one in Scotland (British Army) that's for sure. Fortunately, the director must have spotted this error because the guy is called Commander at the end of the movie. Maybe he transferred from the army to the navy so he could keep the beard?Now we cut to previous events. A child, about seven years old, gets to an international airport on his own and goes up to an airline check-in desk. Woman asks 'where is your mother' (obviously she'd read the script because why not ask where is your family, or parents, or father?). Child replies 'oh, she told me to go ahead and check the bags in'. And the woman proceeds to do the paperwork, check the bags and issue him the boarding passes. Huh? What world is this international airport in? Not our post 9-11 one, that's for sure. No one checks in baggage except the person who packed it, who has to declare they packed it themselves. But no, she works for the airline that allows tiny kids wandering around on their own with a teddy bear to check in baggage.We know there are terrorists on the plane because the blurb tells us so. However, they are incredibly easy to spot. No mystery at all. Wait for the first white men to be shown and there you are--terrorists. Phew, fortunately for us there's an alert young muslim on board who notices what's happening and saves the plane. Personally I always feel reassured when I get on those international flights to see young muslim men on board with me. I know I'm gonna be safe from the white men.But wait. Not only is there one young brave muslim, there are two! And they know how to fly a plane because they are aerospace engineering students. Fantastic. So when the white pilot turns out to be one of the terrorists, it's our brave young muslims who take over the controls to save everyone. I can't believe an old white German guy objected to this. What a racist. He's probably islamaphobic too. Dreadful. At one point the young muslim chap was praying to Allah and praising Mohammed as he bravely defended the cockpit from the evil white guys. It was a particularly stirring moment. I was so glad to see that he was religious. It's about time Hollywood brought more religion into movies. When he ripped some explosives off the cockpit door with a 'not on my watch' I teared up a little. Honestly, I did.I can't deny some of the makeup was good in this movie. The idea was quite fun: instead of snakes on a plane, it's vampires. Not sure which I'd prefer. As there will probably never be any international flight ever again for us peons, I probably don't have to worry too much.Utter hokum from beginning to end.Without the messaging it would have been a brainless, but fun horror movie. With it? It's unwatchable for any person who actually lives in the real world.",Blood Red Sky

191,eeriechills,Well made,8,23 July 2021,I was a bit dubious when I first read that this was German but with a few known American actors in it so I didn't know what to expect. There was obvious dubbed voices for a few actors that I can only assume couldn't speak English. There were Scottish actors too lol so quite a varied array of nations. The story was quite unique and the movie itself was quite well made really. The dubbing and language didn't really interfere though with the movie. Dominique Purcell was a bit underrated in this and a bit out of place possibly (due to the international aspect of who made it) but I assume it was just a project that he was interested in. All in all it had me gripped and I would recommend this movie.,Blood Red Sky
192,indiana1981,Surprisingly entertaining!,8,27 July 2021,"I read some reviews before watching this movie... I wasn't expecting anything intelligent... it's a vampire movie, where all hell breaks loose onboard an aeroplane!Given its premise, the story however is put together quite well. I also like how this is a German Netflix movie, but half of it is actually in English, with an international cast, including Dominic Purcell. So the cheesiness of the storyline, is actually made up for with some good acting from certain cast members. I particularly thought Dominic and the other lead villain did a great job. Their storyline added a diffierent mix, to the typical vampire storyline.Definitely not a serious/oscar winning movie. But it's easy watching, entertaining and great for a Friday night.",Blood Red Sky
193,micz81,Stupid beyond ANY reason. Completely wasted potential.,1,31 August 2021,"I was hoping for a fresh view on vampire subject, but this is just low budget netflix rubbish. Sure, concept for the story is nicely unique here, it got me interested, but for god's sake the execution of this plot is completely stupid - even as for a horror movie. Characters act chaotic, no one's actions makes any sense at all not only on the basic psychology level, but even in terms of damn logic. From about one third the movie becomes just a McGuffin portfolio - almost every scene resolves itself with another nonsense staging, based on nonsense screenplay I suppose.So, it's not a spoiler to tell you that almost ALL of the suspense in the storyline comes from all those laughable turning points generated by absurdly unbelievable actions of seems-like-plainly-stupid characters. And when we run out of those laughable turning points... No, we won't. Let's not forget about the ""unexpectedly, the boy breaks free and runs away"" or ""unexpectedly, the boy stumbles and falls over"" Golden Screenplay Wildcards which comes handy every time when the basics of McGuffin are not enough...It's a mess! Sadly. Because the exposition actually makes some appetite. If you want something good about vampires, delivered with coherence and spark of intelligence (while still remaining sweet old horror fairy tale) - watch 30 Days of Night (2007).",Blood Red Sky
194,Leungzy,Painful to watch even if you forget common sense,2,31 July 2021,"Where do I begin with this movie....it had a lot of potential. I liked the direction it was going with the mother trying to keep her humanity and protect her son / the passengers on the plane while ensuring that the vampirism did not spread. But the characters just kept making stupid decisions after stupid decisions that went against any common sense just to suit the direction that the movie writers wanted the story to go to the point that it became painful to watch.Firing a gun on a plane...lighting a fire in a car on a plane... shooting a hole in a window on a plane,(granted it was an accident but then it just magically stopped being a problem after losing cabin pressure), purposely shooting yourself up with vampire blood, asking evil vampires to bite you because you're a greedy rich person who doesn't want to die.Also the random passenger who towards the end of the movie decided to stands up and says he was in the army and knows how to help the group defend themselves, yet at the start of the movie, was absolutely no where to be seen when the terrorists first took over. And the angry husband who's wife is trampled to death and who then managed to grab the gun off the army expert so he can exact revenge... what kind of soldier let's that happen.Also what sane woman with a baby in her arms would enter a house and follow a massive blood trail down to a basement? Just very lazy story writing to point the story in the direction that the writers wanted it to go without incorporating any common sense, you literally have to watch this movie with your brain completely switched off.On top of this, it was also ruined with just the stereotypical predictable characters, the rich guy who doesn't care about anyone else who you can predict will screw other people over to save himself, and the psycho idiot who will be drawn to power and who you know will want to become a vampire. And the son... the movie might have been more enjoyable if he had spoken and done way less.Ignoring the fact that he was able to use a gun when it was probably the first time he had ever picked one up, I couldn't forgive the fact that he hesitates to shoot a terrorist who is about to kill his mother, despite her being a vampire which would make you assume that the son is mentally a lot tougher for his age having seen some messed up things because of her.Finally, how can you handcuff someone who's missing a hand...
The mother and her story was actually a very interesting take on vampires that I had never seen before, but all of the above ruined the story for me, I'd never watch it again.Dominic Purcell was also wasted in this movie too, I'd have liked to have seen him with a more significant role.",Blood Red Sky
195,maxwellsnake24,A action/horror movie that truly kicks butt,8,23 October 2021,"Combining the high octane thrills of the action movie with the visceral chills of the horror flick is no mean feat. Many have tried, many have failed. Neil Marshall managed to achieve it with his sublime 2002 werewolf effort 'dog soldiers', Robert Rodriquez conquered it also with his 1996 Quentin Tarantino scripted bloodfest 'from dusk till dawn' and more recently the Ethan Hawke starring 'the purge' gave it a good go. The latest horror/action hybrid to hit our screens is the uk/German co production 'blood red sky' and it doesn't disappoint. A simple flight from Europe to new york, is turned into a living nightmare when a group of determined and well armed criminals and a passenger with a dark secret interact high in the night sky. I made my synopsis of the story deliberately vague,as I don't wish to reveal anything, I will say however that the movie 's stylish premise is brilliantly executed by a very good director and a fine group of well cast actors. Plenty of blood for those so inclined and enough edge of your seat thrills to keep your average Jason Statham fan happy for a week, 'blood red sky' alongside 'train to busan' has to rank as one of the best public transport set horror action hybrid movies in existence.

196,HeroOfTomorrow,Should've been a 10-minute short.,3,25 July 2021,"I always wonder how a movie like this gets made. Sure, ""vampire on a plane!"" sounds like a cool premise, if you're at a bar with your friends pitching dumb movie ideas, but as a TWO-HOUR movie without any plot? No.See, the plane setting doesn't actually add anything to the film, they do nothing interesting with it - and the vampire backstory is basic stuff you've seen a million times before. And with its insane runtime, they're almost begging you to check your email or fast-forward.It also doesn't help that the acting is really, REALLY bad, while the movie takes itself INCREDIBLY seriously. This creates a messy viewing experience that is so bland, you can't even make fun of it.

Blood Red Sky is a good example. I wouldn't have paid to see this movie in a cinema but, streamed to my living room TV, I chose to give it the time of day and I'm reasonably glad that I did.First the not so good. Try as it might, the movie can't quite shake its Euro origins, by which I mean the lack of any familiar faces and a certain rough-around-the -edges cheapness are very much to the fore. A lot of the characters seem a little stock, too. Stereotypes are played for all they're worth.The good, however, is VERY good. The vampires are excellent - especially in one very good scene where two of them fight it out with each other in the plane's cargo hold - and the claustrophobia of being stuck on a plane in flight while all of this is playing out is nicely handled.

231,joeraid,"A bit too long, but enjoyable enough",6,29 July 2021,"Nice, new story line (vampires on a plane!), with an excellent international cast. Film is a German/English production, so watch in original without the dubbing. Everyone speaking their native language adds to the tension and you wont miss any of the nuances that come with the actors. Use subtitles if necessary.Unfortunately, the film drags on a bit long especially the overextended fighting scenes. A little editing and I up it a star or two. Or give the great Graham McTavish more screen time!",Blood Red Sky
232,KyleDial,"Great beginning, decent end.",6,29 July 2021,"The film had a great start, The concept was a good unique twist and I thought the mix of foreign and English actors added a nice element. The movie is quite gory but done really nicely, the special effects and makeup are really good. There is not much to complain about the first half of the film other than the kid being quite annoying haha.The second half of the film seems to drop in quality in both writing and plot, with the characters throwing any logic they had out the window. The ending was a bit disappointing and didn't seem to do the first half justice, it left me feeling unsatisfied.Overall, I do recommend Blood Red Sky.

244,schrilax,Terrible storyline !!,2,26 July 2021,"My rating is primarily due to the lazy, poor, cringeworthy and predictable storyline which is full of plot holes throughout the movie. I could predict 10 minutes earlier what will happen next. My rating is not a reflection of the actors' performance. The actors perform based on script only. Here are some of the major plot holes :Why would a husband/father leave his wife/baby in the middle of the nowhere even if I assume mobile phones were yet to be invented ? Why not wait it out till morning protecting yourself and your family from the cold and/or wild animals and/or evildoers ?Why would the wife/mother then roam about in the forest searching for her husband carrying her baby in freezing cold temperatures ? Again why not wait it out in the car rather than risk harm to yourself or your baby ? How did sunrise happen and sun rays stream in exactly just a second later after the vampire in the old, dilapidated house had bitten the wife/mother ?Why did the vampire's son have to check in luggage early morning when the vampire herself checks in at sunset ? Why is the vampire bald when other vampires are not bald ?Why did the son who behaves so maturely all throughout the movie all of a sudden jump out of his seat and try to escape from the hijackers and hide in the cargo hold of the plane leaving his mother behind ? How did he manage to even jump so high ?When the vampire is in the cockpit trying to fly the plane to NY and the hijackers start shooting people and then vampire transforms for first time why did she stop after only killing one henchman ? Why not kill them all and be done with it ? Otherwise the movie would have ended in the middle.Why did the hijackers carry UV torch in first place ? Did they know there will vampires on the flight ? Why did the son when trying to get the remote just rush out to get it carrying the UV torch without knowing anything ? It seems like to create the climax scene.",Blood Red Sky

253,ciaranmarley,NOT-sferatu,4,30 July 2021,"Netflix were determined to spoil any kind of From Dusk Til Dawn type reveal with their giveaway movie poster but that doesn't detract from the initial premise of the film being an interesting one.What really disappoints is the poor acting and rudderless script. The cramped, claustrophobic environment of the airplane is never fully utilised except to provide convenient trap doors or obstacles for the unusually clumsy vampires to trip over. There was more fun to be had with the idea that 'I am not trapped in here with them, they are trapped in here with me' in my opinion.The bad guys don't really seem to know what they are up to and spout bad guy cliches by the mouthful without any real sense of menace.The 'heroine' is not much better at leaping into action either. Surely any conflict the mother character has about her darker side goes straight out the window when her child is in danger?Although there is gore enough to satisfy, the loose scripting, poor pacing and brutal acting make this as clunky as a vampire trying to negotiate the centre aisle of a 747.And, yes, the child became very annoying very quickly.Not one to add much to the vampire canon but passable (barely) for a Thursday night at home.",Blood Red Sky

259,Yarayaraman,Enjoy the ride,7,25 July 2021,"The critics reviews of this are far too harsh.Having recently rewatched Train to Busan, which it will inevitably be compared to (among others), it doesn't have the same emotional weight, social commentary, tension or action. However, it still manages to deliver a relatively original and enjoyable mash-up of genres, with a heart. Maybe the second half could have been stronger as others have stated, however, I was hooked all the way through, and the ending was well done, given the limited options available.While the back story was a little rote, it was still relevant, and helped frame the core mother / son dynamic.The tone is always the biggest challenge with this type of movie - if it's too tongue-in-cheek, it loses all emotional investment, and if it takes itself too seriously it's no fun to watch. The balance was good here, and I enjoyed the ride.I also enjoyed this a lot more than the recent Zak Snyder effort, the Army of the Dead, which also mashed up genres in a similar way. That had some fun moments but ultimately felt like a completely pointless retread of a very well trodden genre, offering nothing original and some painfully cheesy emotional family dynamics. Blood Red Sky was significantly better in my opinion, with relatively unknown actors and no doubt a significantly smaller budget.",Blood Red Sky

Shame on Netflix for even making this dreadful mash-up of BAD acting, a ridiculous script, Party City level special effects & make-up (I LOLed a few times at the XXL size mouth piece Momma vampire wears) seriously obnoxious stereotype characters, terrible directing and the movie is about 45 minutes too damn long.This movie is all over the place; It's like if a bad vampire movie (which this definitely is) had a baby with a blood thirsty Rambo while on a Die Hard holiday during a Weekend at Bernie's.I laughed several times because the movie got so ludicrous-like when the blond haired bad guy (who was chewing the scenery like he was starving) WANTED to become a vampire so he intentionally injected himself with Momma vampires blood. At that point, I was talking out loud and saying things I can't post here.Even the plot of this movie was dumb and not explained; how did vampire mom get the drugs (that were in a glass vile mind you!!) and was she trying to cure herself or what? And that kid!?! The kid was supposed to be the biggest hero with no fear whatsoever but I guess when your Mom is a vampire just waiting for you to misbehave so she has a guiltless reason to suck your blood dry that'll toughen up a kid, ya know?Even though this is one of the worse movies I've seen in a long time, I will admit I had to watch it until the end just to see how this garbage would end and even that SUCKED!",Blood Red Sky

And also it's crisis on a plane and I've always find this kind of theme exciting. Normally I would think at the end of it, the highest score will probably be like a 7 or less.But what made this movie a little more special for me is the love between the boy and his mother in extraordinary circumstances. For a vampire movie, It is refreshing and a little thought provoking and that is the main thing which kept me going throughout the rather long movie (2 hours). Even though I said ""love"", but don't worry, it is not cheesy and there is a lot of high tension and bloody moments.The movie is not perfect of course. But it exceeds my expectations for this type of movie. I think most people will maybe rate it between a 6 or a 7.

Given the current political climate I already saw some of the twists coming but it didn't make the dialogue less cringe worthy. White finance guy evil, false flag terrorism blaming Muslims, Muslims saves the day (one by being an aerospace engineer who also happens to know how to fly and the other by being a selfless hero who gets his arm chopped off and then gets patched up easily by female doctor).

So if you are not a fan of that kind of thing, just be warned. It is not over the top, but I'd much rather see a human die than a defenseless animal.If you are looking for just a fun vampire flick you won't be disappointed.",Blood Red Sky

Those familiar with planes would understand the goofs(no you don't have to be a pilot or engineer to understand them, basic knowledge would suffice).. then again, being a horror movie some may find it ok. It would had been nicer if they adapted the plane sequences and access to cargo compartments more realistically.

278,hawkinsuhc,Pretty good but the ending...,8,24 July 2021,"All in all, I'd say this was a pretty good movie. The main characters, the mother and the boy were great together. I think only two things bothered me. One being the fact that the mother seemed to not realize the power she held within her. I mean, at one point, she chose not to take the medication that kept the vampireism at bay in order to save her son. However when he saw her looking like a monster, more or less, she chose to take it, knowing the bad guys were still on the plane. This of course, resulted in the bad guys, at least one of them, the craziest one, realizing what she was and being able to overpower her and steal her blood. He in turn made a nest on that plane. The second thing that bugged me was, the guy that was protecting her son, got bit and she chopped his hand off to keep the virus from spreading. Okay that's cool I get that. However, in the end when they take him off the plane, they handcuff him with his hands behind his back! He's missing a hand and his arm is a bloody nub but you're going to put handcuffs on him?! That was really dumb. Then also when he goes to save the boy, he runs toward the boy limping with his hands behind his back? That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen! The movie started out strong and for the most part it ended really well but there was some parts that made me to ask myself 'what are they thinking'? Nevertheless, all in all, like I said, a good movie.",Blood Red Sky

The main female vampire is shown more like a dumb weak zombie than a vampire. The plot and acing is all over the place, and nothing to keep you engaged. I had to skip through the entire movie.

The performances are fantastic, the horror/vampire element is handled really well, and there are some unique story pieces that are added into the main plot that actually made me think.The mixture of English and German was a nice touch that I totally wasn't expecting, but really enjoyed. The writing and direction were expertly done, and although the movie is kinda long, I didn't notice it.Vampire flicks are either golden to me, or
Completely miss the mark altogether. Blood Red Sky's a winner for sure.",Blood Red Sky
297,dajsha,"It's okay I guess, overrated.",2,25 July 2021,"I give this movie a 2/10 because most of the scenes are questionable and doesn't make sense. Example, nadia goes looking for her husband/boyfriend in the night time, she finds an abandoned place and goes there and gets chased by a vampire, she locked her self in a room then when the vampire goes around to the other side to get in the window it's sunny out of nowhere, just doesn't make sense. Unless I missed something. I wouldn't watch it again to find out if I did. I don't recommend this movie. Save your time.",Blood Red Sky

Very well made movie. Recommended to watch with a quality equipment to enjoy.",Blood Red Sky

306,harishanifgala-325-494753,I'm really not sure if the kid needed any saving,3,24 July 2021,"So Blood Red Sky, an intriguing movie after so long based on vampires. BRS is when Snakes on a Plane meets 30 Days of Nights. It's Hijackers vs Vampires vs Passengers vs The Kid, except it only sounds good, but the execution? Oh man, it's just awful. It's definitely an opportunity missed and I was wondering if someone else could just take this project and do it right. Trust me, this movie starts out well, but just goes haywire once the mother twist is revealed. The mother vampire goes all out to protect her sun from the hijackers except its the son who turns out to be the biggest illogical twist of them all. He's practically a human superhero who ends up saving everyone. The bravest and the smartest of 'em all turns out to be kid putting everyone else to shame. Somehow he always ends up doing the right thing at the right time and it just gets irritating. I couldn't understand the physics behind some of the actions. The airlock is open and the enemy is pulled out due to the air pressure, but the kid and his mom aren't. Wow. The vampire mother is walking around passengers bleeding, but she doesn't crave for their blood. This was one of the most flawed representations of a vampire. Although, the concept is good, but they could have easily pulled it off creatively. Poor script, poor screenplay and pathetic climax. The kid ends up ruining the entire experience. I wouldn't be surprised, if he grows up to be Blade because he's already half superhero.",Blood Red Sky

311,leon_staples,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,24 July 2021,"A lot of people say in their reviews ""don't expect too much"". Maybe it's just me but my only expectation is to enjoy a movie, not every movie is going to have an all star cast, amazing plot or crazy good special effects, possibly even more so when the movie is not coming out of Hollywood and straight to Netflix. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Hollywood snob but the point is it's not exactly set up to be some kind of blockbuster.So into the movie, I thought it was reasonably good. Some things were predictable and some things were not. It's not fantastic but I felt like it was worth a watch. I was surprised to see Dominic Purcell in it but maybe that's because I have not seen him in anything since prison break. The story is actually somewhat unique, contrary to some reviews on here. Obviously horror in the sky has been done before but not quite like this! I also like it when a movies goes in one direction and then suddenly twists into another like this one, a dramatic twist!Overall it was not a waste of time watching it so in that respect it did it's job! It seems like so many movies are very similar lately, similar plots, similar locations etc that this one feels a little different so if nothing else, that seems like a good enough reason to give it a watch.",Blood Red Sky

315,hancifatih,Neither good nor bad.,5,24 August 2021,"In short; entertaining to watch with nice little plot twsits in the first half. But be warned; don't get too attached 'cause the connecters become the plot's worst enemies, and you'll feel betrayed even before the climax, like I did. But if you are a real horror fan, or what you want is not your intelligence to be insulted but to get solid satisfaction, SKIP.In the beginning, we see a bald woman, and assume she has cancer or something, and her son further explains that it has to do with her blood and that they're on their way to her American doctor for treatment. Then we see a couple of tough-looking guys making eyes at each other, having us think there's gonna be some banging either with guns or.. you know. Anyway, it turns out these guys are terrorists - which actually made me want to turn it off as I've already seen Hostage Flight and Air Force One. But then the twist comes; the sick woman is a vampire! Yeah, sounds cheasy, but the way the story tossed the terrorists and the vampire against each other both with action and drama was quite well-made. I expected Hostage Flight, but I got REC instead, minus the shaky camera! Aaaannd the good part ends here. Thanks.Now the ""mistakes"" begin as early as the first scene: no plane ever just ""stops"" like that. But whatever, not a big sin. My first main problem was with the kid who failed show emotions like fear, pain, or dread until his ""mama"" pushed him away, even though he was a very prominent character. I'm sure they could've found a better kid actor. But the face he made during rejection was great. Then another character that annoyed me even further comes along; the most obnoxious-for-no-apparent-reason ""psycho"" terrorist guy. It's so freaking obvious that he was written that way just to justify the moment when he draws the mama vamp's blood into a syringe to later inject himself with it: according to the writer, we're supposed to say ""Ooh because, you know, he's crazy like that, he's a psycho... Of course he'll inject himself with vampire blood."" Come the f OOOOOOOON. NOBODY will include such an erratic imbecile in their group. Anyway... Even though injured passengers begging vampires to bite them so they don't die is such a REACH on societal criticism, it's not as unforgivable as vamp mama and her son chilling next to a door that just exploded and caused a freaking vacuum of the air pressure in the plane. WHAT. You just sent a grown-ass vampire through that hole! But mama vamp and the kid are immune to physics, I guess?..And the moment I just bit my fist: the plane lands when the sun is still up, communication with the cockpit is available, the situation is (mis)understood; but the sergeant decides to wait till sunset to make a move on the guy who he thinks is a Muslim terrorist, and to send his men into the plane. WHY?!?!?! What have they done all that time, asked each other about their hobbies and stuff??? No. He was made to wait just so the vampires could come out of the plane and attack... etc. Degrading. Childish. Insulting. Stupid. And then the film proceeds to commit one authenticity crime after another using the kid: First, even though the kid is given a dose of tranquillizer, he wakes up in the middle of his transport from the airport to a hospital, and needs another shot again. But somehow he manages to take the needle out of the hand of a grown-ass paramedic and STABS HIM WITH IT, sending him to a sound sleep. And that's nothing, compared to the fact that the kid JUMPS OUT OF THE BACK DOORS OF THE AMBULANCE, ON HIS FEET, without a scratch, let alone breaking his legs... WHAT. The real monster here is the kid, I'll tell ya. And then he runs so fast that TWO SOLDIERS cannot catch up with him and give up... Yeah let's duck up logic for an average, predictable ending, shall we?By the way; the soldiers rear-handcuff the Muslim guy they think is the terrorist, BUT, the guy lacks a hand... THEY HANDCUFFED A GUY WITH ONE HAND BEHIND HIS BACK. THEY CUFFED A HAND THAT DID NOT EXIST. But the minute the plane explodes, without getting a release command from the sergeant yet, the soldiers let the Muslim guy go, walking behind him. Does the explosion change the fact (they think) that guy they just handcuffed is the one who caused it?! Only when he starts crying over the kid does the sergeant gives the command. My eyes are sweaty from too many face-palms.It's such a pity because the twist, the vampire transformation, the tension and thrill of some certain scenes, the drama between the son and the mom... there were quite good moments. A movie to just watch, and not question or believe its premise.",Blood Red Sky

It had enough action, good story, great characters, fantastic actors. It was a very enjoyable movie. Although some might find it scary, it really wasn't scary to me.The first half of the movies is definitely the better part of the movie and the second half everything gets so chaotic which I still loved!

A lot of gnarling, hysteria and BS. At the end, police cuff a guy who had his hand chopped off. How is that physically possible? Wouldn't his stump just slip out of the cuff?

After the beginning, movie slipped back to what it was probably meant to be - high paced horror movie, rather shallow than deep with respectful consumption of red color. But don't take me bad, it does the job well, keeping you entertained till the end. The original background savor stays as a cherry on cake.

The only thing that really bothered me was the fact that the interior has two passenger floors like an Airbus 380 or a Boing 747, but it's neither.Good: The action, cinematography and more depth than i.e Snakes on a plane or From dusk to dawn.

Blade would have been saying ""what the hell is going on here"". The heroine couldn't fight her way out of a paper bag, she was continually overpowered, and shot. The sum total of her lines appeared to be growling and calling for her son, who never did what he was told by the way. It was disappointing. I needed her to kick ass, it never happened. As an end note no terrorist group ever, unless they were recruited by Acme Corporation would have the completely over the top psycho cabin crew as a member....and probably the best line of the whole script ""don't press the big button"".",Blood Red Sky

The story is pretty straightforward, yet is able to show the evolution of the main character which leads to her desperate situation.This is the second time, I'm seeing vampires given the same treatment as zombies (like World War Z and Train to Busan) where there is a frenzied mass infection within closed space. By the way, the first time I saw vampires do a mass feeding was in Daybreakers.The first half was really solid but the second half seems to have lost the steam after putting all the cards on the table.

Of course her idiotic mistakes just makes everything worse and instead of saving everyone she just causes the entire plane to turn full vamp.In conclusion the mothers idiotic decisions ruined the whole movie.

The only difference is that this film has a budget and that many of the low/no budget films on Amazon Prime are much better. We have stereotypes galore in this one. A plane that doesn't seem to have an end nor bottom and nobody hears anything unless it suits the story. Which sums up the entire script. Bullets are being shot left right and centre and it does not harm the plane, until it's needed in the story. This film could have ended around 1.15 but I was amazed when I looked and it still was 45 minutes. It could have ended several times after, yet it kept going and going and repeating and repeating and growling and shouting and occasionally the extras playing the other people on the plane had to do something to show us, they were still there. If you, as a writer aren't imaginative enough, don't put your story on a plane. The flashbacks to explain the story, aren't working either.Netflix...

Here it's much better on the scenario and as good on action, so I believe it deserve a 7,5/10.Some bad things :
The English voice are not really good.The kid that can become annoying during some scene.The darkness of the movie, I mean literary : the movie is very dark, it is difficult at times to follow the action because I couldn't see anything.Overall a good experience.",Blood Red Sky

It wasn't terrible, but it just looked like a lot of bad choices and weird mishaps. First, I thought the kid was going to frustrate me, mainly bc he just started running to get to safety, but in the end just got his mother shot. However, throughout the movie he turns out to be a hero. Next, that one rich, selfish dude that ended up getting internal bleeding...glad he died. He's the main reason why everyone died. I liked how everyone had a system going and were actually doing well, but the ....rich, selfish dude happened. Another issue, how is it that blowing a small window causes all that suction, but when the cargo door got blown up no one got suctioned out? The mom had to push the one evil vampire out, but she or the boy didnt go flying out. Also, how did the vampires happen? Did I miss something? During the flashback, the mother decides to take her son to find help bc of the cold, runs into blood and thought, ""Hey, let's follow the blood! It could be my husbands!"" Ummm, you're willing to put your infant son in danger? Sure, let's go follow the blood that leads down some basement/cellar of an abandon house. How about go get help first, and have the authorities check it out. Then a vampire comes out of nowhere? Did I miss something? In the end, the military decides to wait all that time (until nightfall) to actually take action, and of course the vampires attacked.

I was ultimately disappointed.If you replaced John McLane's struggling marriage, hero character with a reluctant vampire, struggling mom, Nakatomi Tower with a transatlantic 747, and good writing and editing with its polar opposite, you would have basically this. Like in DH, the ""terrorists"" aren't really so. Although they broadcast ideological and political motives to the authorities, they're purely monetary. There's even a big explosion at the end. Sounds familiar, I know.Personally, I try to suspend disbelief when watching movies, and not point out the flaws as they happen, but with this one I actually had to pause it a few times, so that I could vent to my wife some of the obvious parts that were irking me. For example, the repeated scenes where the kid just runs off to do his own thing, the worst of which being at the beginning, which ultimately results in his mom getting shot.I guess it's worth a watch for some, but if I could go back in time I would have just skipped it altogether, and re-watched something else instead. 3/10 instead of 2/10 for the vamp effects.",Blood Red Sky

Continuity is rubber-based, considerations of aerodynamics and avionics only get in the way of the action and who hasn't at least once thought that Islamic terrorists wouldn't be adverse to involving a gay sociopathic flight attendant? Escapist entertainment Made In Germany (actually the Czech Republic but details are just that, details) which kicks ass and at some point leaves you rooting for the vampire, after all, she is also a loving mother.Crazy, absurd and most importantly, the one cinematic chance to see that a one-handed man can actually be handcuffed.",Blood Red Sky

459,mraajdar,Depth beyond arteries.,10,2 August 2021,"This film is about Elias, the boy, his story told behind the action.Elias looks roughly 10. There is only one other scene in the film where another child of a similar age is seen on screen and all she does is sob. She is a prop. He does not interact with her. He seems perfectly able to communicate with adults, as demonstrated by the large amount of dialogue shared with Navid. The situation with the girl precludes verbal interaction, but there was very little response from him to it in general. He could not intervene but he was witness, and yet he did not empathise, he was not suddenly overwhelmed by the realisation that kids (i.e. Him) weren't off limits. He did not lose control like the girl.Elias does not see the girl as a peer. Elias is socially isolated and mature beyond his years in a way that is immediately recognisable to any young career who has to hide details of a parent's illness, who has to learn objectivity young, who has to be the adult in the relationship, has to know when to mask, has to know when to remain calm. Nadja, through no fault of her own, has an illness that is taboo; she is unable to care for Elias as a mother typically would. She would clearly do anything for him within her reach, but her arsenal is different from that of a typical mother, so much so that it is impossible for her to give him an environment where the emotional needs of a child are met. The taboo nature of her illness and the secrecy that would undoubtedly come with it, as well as his interactions with adults and his demonstrated maturity suggest at least some level of neglect and social isolation. This is typical of many young carers in our world without vampires.Elias clearly loves his mother despite her shortcomings. Again, stressing how likely his social isolation is, she is probably all he has. She is his world and he knows that she loves him in her way so he stays with her, her lifeline to reality despite the danger and the cost to his childhood. He keeps her secret, and when it is out he helps her to manage the fallout. She screams and growls in his face, clearly losing control, but he is calm, he puts himself in peril to ground her.In the final scenes of the film he is still there, taking charge of the situation despite his age. Then, and only when he realises that she is too far gone to help anymore he takes decisive action to walk away.The entire film is a metaphor for the struggle of young carers of parents who display challenging and taboo behaviours. The plane reflects the confines of how small that works becomes. The other passengers are background dressing, the outside world, ""other people"" who are widely ignored until they insert themselves into the protagonists world, influencing it one way or another. The terrorists are the extreme of that potential - ""others"" who would manipulate the situation and intentionally harm, or harm as a byproduct of their own selfishness. Navid is a figure who would try to help but only ends up persecuted for his efforts. The explosive scene at the end is a new start, a visual representation of that boy's life as he knew it going up in flames as he has to make the painful decision to put himself first.This film certainly deserves more credit than ""generic vampire slasher gorefest"", although I suppose if you're not really paying attention it could come across that way. That's actually what drew me to it, I felt like watching something violent and brainless, and I trusted The Algorithm. It wasn't that at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.",Blood Red Sky

Although towards the end it gave me Snakes on a Plane vibes, it was way better graphics and acting. Nothing really scary about it, but it puts you in a moral dilemma save myself or save other people. I personally would save as many as I could until I realized ""I'm screwed"". In the case of the movie you get to see the characters make this decision all while dealing with the chaos aboard. The biggest shine to the movie was probably the order in which the story is told. I appreciate a good plot. The biggest disappointment was, once you get to a certain point in this story you know it can only go one of two ways.

The movie delivered very nicely, and kept us watching throughout. Isn't this what the world is all about now? Click and watch? Click and watch is the most important metric of our time, a world of brainwashed and obedient humans who accept whatever is said in whatever media has the most views, living room audience retention 100 percent, 10 stars! Four comments:Good to see Lincoln Burrows waddle up and down again making no sense whatsoever. This was a worthy reimbursement for at least two episodes of Prison Break S06.Eightball, the ballsy flight attendant, was no Gary Oldman for sure, but boy did he make an ugly vampire. Although dressed for the occasion, we need to give him that, his immaculate, pretty hair-do was completely upped. Tan France must have gasped! On the other hand Eightball for sure found his calling - this was beautiful to watch.The kid. Well the kid. For the acting I have to say: good job! I didn't find him annoying at all. This is coming from someone who gets psoriasis break-outs just by briefly glancing at Kevin home alone movie posters. Literally the only character that triggered my pain receptors was the kid's consultant at the airport. But that was not because of her acting, but because of the actual, real world evil she stood for.Refreshing ending. Let's ignore the religious undertones / hidden message of the Elias - Farid alliance conquering the darkness together. Instead, let's look at the surprising novelty: This kind of movie usually ends with at least one vampire crawling to safety and grinning into the camera: I will see to your demise, human!

The best example of which is the kid (Elias), making me actually miss Carl from first seasons of The Walking Dead. If something annoying and stupid has to be done he's already there.Too bad cause the premise is there, this could have been a really good movie, something along the lines of European Train to Busan.

The film therefore has a little original side even if it ultimately looks like any other film about a hijacked flight. The first part is convincing and promising with a concept well exploited in the same way as the mixture of genres only, the film collapses little by little thereafter. The main problem with the film is that it is too long. When we think that we are entering the final, we realize that we still have nearly 40 minutes to shoot, it's too much especially since what follows is messy and lacking in tension. We can also regret certain unnecessary lengths such as the scenes outside the plane. It's okay to want to know more about Nadja, but these aren't the most interesting moments in the movie. ""Blood Red Sky"" is a film that wants to be ambitious all the same, but struggles to keep up the distance.

The opening scene was a good way to attract the viewers attention because we didn't know what was going on, but the more we watched, the more that opening scene became a spoiler for the film itself. We know that the plane was gonna land anyways, despite how hard it was to find someone who could land it. We know Farid survived along with the little boy, it just gave all of it away. If the film happened in a chronological order then we could have been anticipating how the plane landed, as well as did the passengers survive. It could make us feel worried if something bad could happen but we know things already went well. The ending was also very bland, the boy's mother could have lived and maybe make people realize that monster still has some humanity inside of them. Or the part where she ran at the boy, we could replace it by having another vampire chase after the boy and the mother tries to protect him one last time (she is still conscious and knows that the boy is her son) and then the bomb detonates with a timer, instead of being remote controlled so the boy didn't have to press it and it was her heroic action that saved him.

That excitement waned when they ruined one of the more suspenseful aspects of the film right away by showing that the plane lands. Not a spoiler, this happens right at the beginning of the film. A bit later in the film the lead makes an unbelievably stupid decision just to move the plot along in the filmmakers intended direction. They could've gotten there without having the lead character make such a stupid decision, it felt like the filmmakers were questioning my intelligence by going the route that they did. I know that incompetence is a key to most horror films, making bad decisions is a staple of the horror genre. But this was too much. When you're trying to save your child, not to mention all the other passengers on the plane, you use your powers to your advantage not stifle them like a moron.

Endind left room for part two which I beg Netflix to make.One mother fighting to save her boy against terrorists who took the plane hostage but she is not your typical neighborhood mommy.

507,AdamGH86,Cool concept completely overblown,5,27 July 2021,"This movie desperately needed editing down for time, it had a fun concept and during the first act I was invested. Then the movie approaches what feels like the end and I noticed there were 45 minutes left.The signs of problems were there earlier in the movie when you have characters like Elias who was as annoying as most kid actors are in horror movies. He gets his mother 'killed' with the worst plan ever then spends the rest of the movie crying and saying 'Mama'. Then you have Eightball who is the clichè psychopath antagonist whose actions make absolutely no sense. Presumably he joined this mission for the thrill + reward, yet decides inexplicably to become a vampire when he has Nadja at his mercy. Everything he does reduces the likelihood of the missions success. Now, I get characters like Eightball and they can be compelling, but it was obvious the other hijackers needed to murder this guy and that he would cause more harm than good.Ultimately I was deeply frustrated and annoyed after the halfway mark. After such a promising start it was very disappointing but I suspect the violent vampire action will be enough for many viewers.",Blood Red Sky

It is the fact every decision he made from playing with a ball in the airport to running into a cul-de-sac resulting in his mother getting shot was excruciatingly hard to accept that one could dislike a young character so much that you felt you wanted to stop watching but I admit I persevered and finished watching the film.

Mix in some hijackers with some vampires and way we go.

I don't think so... I know the man (who flirted with a flight attendant and/or got kidney wound) is the fault because he killed everyone in the airplane when he can't alive continuously.If that man died or stayed there before all the happened, so everyone would still be alive, even the mom.And the kid is hero!How could be the kid hero? The kid was the reason of his mom to kill bad guys in a vampire way. I wish she killed a crazy psycho man already.

All settings are made all clear to the viewers and leave no confusion.Let's discuss the disadvantages of the film -- it didn't handle details well in some way.//the boy's acting skills generally is good, however when comes to the sad part he really can't show sorrow and heartbroken. Especially in the end of the film he ran towards the plane to Farid, he seems smile rather than eager and worry.//the ""infection over all passengers"" part was processed a little rapid and lack of details or scenes. Last moment the people were trying to break through the pilot room, however the next scene was they were all infected.//In general the clues and setting were approximately reasonable however they were not related and correlated well.

It doesn't have logic, satisfying combat scenes, deep epiphanies, humor or anything really what people watch movies for.And yet, once you let go of any expectations and hopes, it was a not too disappointing 2 hours! It has just enough to turn ""bad"" into ""so bad it's good"" without being an intentional parody. At some point I was even excited, waiting to see what ELSE they will throw at my face.

But what about its depths?!!!You have a mother who is fighting the evil in her for the sake of her kid... You have a kid who loves his mother regardless anything. And moreover, it is showing you some facts like plane hijacking and framing it to muslims... Just some thieves hijacking a plane, framing muslims to play with the stock markets.

It starts off fantastic and the relationship between Nadja and Elias was beautifully written and acted. , the second act is very action packed and the the final act is a bloodbath.Most of the negative reviews here seem to hate child actors. The story was about a mother infected with the vampire curse and struggling to maintain her humanity enough to protect here son. Apparently a lot of other reviewers missed that part. So if you dont like child actors, you would like this film as he does play a large as he deals with his Mothers transformation from Mom to animalistic killing machine.All the actors played their parts well! Very well in fact. There were some flashbacks that went on a little too long and didnt warrant that much screen time as they left more questions than they answered. They could have simply gave a brief history of how she was bitten and how she found came across the drugs which regressed the curse.The ending was harsh.

A critic at Ebert didn't enjoy it, but those guys are almost always wrong! Same in this case. The Ebert critic didn't care for the flashbacks. I did! They helped tell the story.

The act of hijacking a plane and a passenger who turns out to be a vampire, I'm not a spoiler, yes, because from the poster it can already be seen. What is interesting about this film for me is the theme of mother and child. How is the instinct of a mother who is willing to do anything for her child, including releasing the 'monster' side in her. Another thing that I like is the appearance and character of the vampire as well as the bloody scenes which are quite adrenaline-pumping. But I really hate the character of his son, Elias, who does a lot of dangerous things out of control. I think this film is quite good from the beginning to the middle, then it loses its direction, becoming a biting action that is quite chaotic. The focus is blurry, coupled with the execution of the ending which is quite bad, makes this film less memorable for me.",Blood Red Sky

Whatever happens do not let Hollywood do a remake, they will ruin it. I promise you if you watch this film you will enjoy it. Peri Baumeister (Nadia), Alexander Scheer (Eightball), Kais Setti (Farid) and especially Carl Anton Koch (Elias) are fantastic lead players who deserve both praise and more exposure internationally. You may get an idea of what the surprise element is as the movie unfolds before the actual reveal but it's brilliantly done. There are great deliveries throughout the cast, especially the Scotsman who consigns the entire plane to die for the most selfish reasons. Elias is worthy of praise as his character was like a mini-McGyver instead an annoying kid who constantly needs saving. I kind of like vampire films and this one was well thought out with a few minor plot holes, but id put it up there with 30 Days of Night and Near Dark. 8 out of 10.",Blood Red Sky

I wanted to hate it. I started out hating it. Twenty minutes in i could tell this was a marvelous gem of new twists and takes on the tired vampire story. The Netflix dub adds a level of B-rated camp to an elegant narrative- while the cinematography, makeup and costuming make this a visual delight. Character development is surprising and novel when put at odds with general American stereotyping and preconceptions. The jump scares are great, the abject violence is serene. I disliked that one character was scripted as both (spoiler , but he stands out). I loved that the overt matriarchal sentiment wasn't just simply a plot service, but had some extremely deep moments of dark sadness(pigtails escapes back down the aisle). The flashbacks grow the entire atmosphere and universe along a much deeper story arc. The catching up and, enjoyably violence and content filled, follow through, gave me some deep tingly neck hair satisfaction. Usually that type of scene organization simply attempts to mimick Tarantino, but in a dry and meaningless hack job sorta way. The unlikely protagonist finds a new return to admonishment by the end of it all, but the way it's handled absolutely leaves a clever director/screenwriter an out to pick up right from that moment. Plus who doesn't love a dramatic finish? Hard 9/10.",Blood Red Sky

It was never trying to be your typical horror film, like you would expect. It was scary in different way, something that we don't see often these days: you get invested in some characters. It was simply a good movie that kept you invested, with great pacing and not overly predictable. The characters were unique and the idea of a bond between an affliction-challenged mother and her son was quite clever, drawing parallels to real life situations and hinting at what it might be like to be a mother who is suffering.With that said, the only cons I personally saw were:
wishing there was more build-up. More history, more about the mother's past.while the way the movie started was exciting and thrilling, I do wish that this particular movie was played chronologically. I feel like it took some wind out of suspense and anticipation.",Blood Red Sky

Lots of good blood drinking, and a pretty decent story too! SO HAPPY to watch a GOOD vampire movie!",Blood Red Sky
671,MarKKhasan,Why the convention he went to did not exist?..,8,25 July 2021,"I will give it an 8, since it has this dark 'nocturnal' vibe to it that is mostly in European cinema: you don't see that in TWD or similar (at least after all these seasons, you know) - also reminds me of a French Netflix TV show, where the plane has to fly non-stop and avoid the sun (forgot the title). One thing still bothers me though: what's with all the convention the Farid was going to, and the military guy says: ""it doesn't exist, blahblah""?",Blood Red Sky

678,hotklm,Surprisingly good,8,20 August 2021,"There are some harsh review of this movie but any movie in this kind of genre, there are many mediocre ones but this is not one of them.The mix of mainly German and English dialogue is interesting but even without subtitles the pace and acting would be enough for you to know what is building-up. This tells a lot about the acting.The premise of the show is not new but the story through is quite original bringing a mix of vampire and zombies together in what can best be described as a cocktail of blood and mayhem.Sit back, relax and watch it with your significant other in the night and you'll find it to be surprisingly good.",Blood Red Sky
679,paulkentros,We really enjoyed this film!,8,25 July 2021,"This really had a twist on the your normal thriller. I was not expecting the story that developed, but really liked it. Loved the main character Nadia and all that transpired. Great effects as well.",Blood Red Sky

683,tntales,A great action thriller with an amazing central performance,9,31 July 2021,"Plays like a cross between Executive Decision and 30 Days of Night with a bit of Train to Busan.The film has a very basic set up for what could be a run of the mill thriller: a group of thugs hijack a plane where one of the passengers is a vampire trying to control her urges while taking care of her young son.But beyond that the film gets a lot of mileage out of the central performance of Nadja who fills her performance with ticks and urges somewhere between a drug addict, a person with a terminal illness, and an animal. Her struggle is constant and throughout the film she's able to modulate the expression of being a vampire with the humanity underneath.And that humanity is portrayed in the love she has for her son who she will do anything to protect. Even if that means unleashing the beast. But everything has a price and this movie is good at selling the heartbreak and tough decisions that people make in the film.This is the story of a mother's love for her son. It just so happens she's a vampire and there is a plane hijacking. Great action, great gore, very tense but human and satisfying.",Blood Red Sky

All of those cliche, stupid actings and, those stupid filler scenes (boy, there were a lot)...dude c'mon, writer wrote this movie while he was taking a dump. Why dump your money into it?",Blood Red Sky
689,Fledermausmannwagen,Don't watch if you don't like animals getting murdered...,1,7 August 2021,"I know it's not really a legit reason to hate the movie, but people who made this must really hate dogs. Not one but two dogs were murdered with their bloody corpses being shown afterwards.",Blood Red Sky
690,cmetzredskins,Train to Busan-esque vampire movie that fell short of the mark,5,26 July 2021,"Blood Red Sky was definitely a sub-par vampire movie, that had high expectations set from its promising first half. The climax was built up properly and left me thoroughly excited for what was to come. However, the action quickly lost me in what seemed to be an all over the place second half of the movie. Acting was great, blood & gore effects looked amazing. I couldn't help but compare this film to Train to Busan, an amazing (highly recommended) Korean zombie movie that takes place on a train. Every aspect of Blood Red Sky seemed noticeably worse than Train to Busan, and I was unable to become emotionally attached to any of the characters or their relationships. Overall, the plot of Blood Red Sky seemed very intriguing to me, but did not live up to its potential in my eyes. Definitely not a movie I'd recommend to a friend, but I've got sure seen worse vampire/zombie movies.",Blood Red Sky
691,kennie-vinkel,Surprise,7,23 July 2021,"I didnt know, what i was goind into. Maybe a action movie with twist or something like that. But man i got surprised.Funny to watch different kind of foreign actors in the same movie. Worked good.",Blood Red Sky
692,rampagegaming-47043,Decent attempt,7,29 July 2021,"Story-telling was a bit disjointed and could have more linear. Some flashbacks were poorly timed and ruined reveal too early.More time could have been spent developing the sequence of event leading up to flight. Plot points were told to you instead of shown through story-telling. An example was when the Arab students assumed they were being framed for the hijacking instantly, instead of revealed to viewer.Worth the time for refreshing story on the classic monster trying to live modern times.",Blood Red Sky
693,marek_ryden,A really enjoyable film behind false pretenses,9,6 August 2021,"I guess many people have an issue with the false pretenses. This is a vampire themed film, not anything else. If you expect something else, the risk is you will get disappointed and give a low rating.But as a vampire themed film it's actually one of the best in the genre. The acting is pretty good in most parts (not all, but mainly in minor characters) and the storyline is good. It got exciting and interesting - for a vampire themed film. I enjoyed it throughout the whole film. If you don't like vampires, stay away though!",Blood Red Sky

705,goran_nilsson,"Good beginning, but then...",8,23 July 2021,"I actually liked this movie.The start is pretty okay. You see an airplane is coming into a Scottish airfield, and there are no rescue vehicles there, just two police/military vehicles. And you see a little boy getting out of the aircraft.Then the story begins.It has the tensions before going on a flight, a little boy checking in both him and his mother. And the mother clearly has some medical issues,
And that is why they are on this flight, to go NY to see a doctor who can cure her.The flight goes along, then the hijacking begins. That was the best. You really hate the character Eightball. He's completely nuts. And when the other hijackers wants to kill him, that's even better because I wanted to kill him as well.However, in the end of the movie, there are too many vampires. I got lost when the mother bit one and he bit another.. and so on. Too many vampires is what's stopping me from going higher in the rating. It goes completely nuts.But it has a good ending, even though you wanted the mother to survive and get to the waiting doctor.Superb acting, especially from Carl Anton Koch, who played Elias.I was giving this a 7 at first, but I raise it to 8 just for the ending.Great movie, Netflix does it again. And I would certainly watch this again.",Blood Red Sky
