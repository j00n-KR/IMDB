0,SnoopyStyle,badly broad,4,6 April 2021,"Nikki Angioli (Emma Roberts) grew up in Toronto's Little Italy. She and her childhood best friend Leo Campo (Hayden Christensen) were inseparable. Their fathers were best friends until some unknown dispute made them rival pizza makers. Nikki left town to learn high class cooking in London. Her teacher needs her to renew her visa and she is forced to go back to Toronto.The Italian stereotyping borders on being racist except the filmmakers are probably Italians. It would help if Roberts and Christensen are less pale. I doubt they have more than a splash of Italian blood. At least they try to darken Christensen. Toronto has never been sexy but it has been the source of some funny talent. This tries so hard and the humor is so broad that it struggles early on. If ethnic broad humor is your thing, the two East Indian rivals would be funny. I don't think the groping policewoman is actually funny. A lot of this is not actually funny. The movie does settle down to mildly inoffensive or maybe I just got used to it. The same goes for the two leads' chemistry. It's rocky at first with the rapey naked wake-up morning but I grow to accept them as a couple. They're equally wrong for the premise. This is awkward for the most part and weakly humorous despite some A-list performers. At least, they seem to have had a good time watching the closing credits. Maybe the Chinese guy should talk more about his sack.",Little Italy
1,phd_travel,Could have been better,6,27 September 2018,"With a likeable cast of popular stars this could have been better. There's a lack of sparks and liveliness that makes this dull and B grade. There have been better Hallmark romances. The rainy soccer was dumb. The pizza thing didn't make me want to eat pizza. 
Hayden is actually part Italian but he comes across a bit of a caricature of an Italian Canadian. Emma isn't bad just a bit miscast. Both of them with their dyed black hair look strange. The supporting cast includes Alyssa Milano and Danny Aiello.It's okay but that's all.",Little Italy
2,inkblot11,The story and stars are a pleasure; the r-rated material not necessary,7,25 August 2019,"Nikki (Emma Roberts) is an aspiring chef in London. She has been learning from one of the best British chefs (Jane Seymour), who has just told her underling a secret. On the verge of opening a new restaurant, Nikki is one of two candidates the top cook will choose for her new venture as chief of the food production. But, Nikki will have to go back to her home in Canada and get some paperwork and plan the new menu. Reluctantly, Nikki does so. Back home in Toronto's Little Italy, you see, her pizzaria owning father has been feuding with a fellow pizza maker who once was his partner. The two men have shops side by side and have competed against each other for over five years, after winning a top pizza prize when they were together. No one knows why the feud happened. Not only this, Nikki's childhood best friend and crush Leo (Hayden Christensen) is the son of the rival Italian pasta family. Yet, somehow these two young people ran away from love, each in the opposite direction. As it happens, they meet again at once. One of their first acts is to stage a soccer competition in the rain, for Nikki always won out in the end at earlier times. Meanwhile, Nikki's grandma (Andrea Martin) and Leo's grandpa (Danny Aiello) have also secretly been seeing each other, as widows and widowers sometimes do. They, too, are aware their offspring will not be happy with a union. So, will romance blossom for two couples or will Nikki return to London as a hot chef? This beautifully photographed film is a joy visually. Toronto's Little Italy is a charming venue and the sites and sounds very pleasing. Likewise, although Roberts and Christensen are neither one Italian and have had to dye their hair dark, they make a charming couple. Martin and Aiello bring great fun and drama to their portrayals and the rest of the cast, including Alyssa Milano, are good, too. The script, too, has some creative elements, some a bit too much so, for most of the r-rated talk and situations do not enhance the tale, slightly damaging the enjoyment. Nevertheless, the energetic direction and the above good qualities listed, make for a recommendation to view it and fast forward over the offending parts.",Little Italy
3,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,20 November 2018,"Little ItalyThe single greatest contribution Italian cuisine has made to Western civilization is heartburn.However, this romantic-comedy maintains that pizza is a much better offering than indigestion.When her work visa expires, culinary student Nikki (Emma Roberts) must return to Toronto. While her family (Alyssa Milano, Adam Ferrara) is happy to see her, their pizza business has been suffering ever since they had a spat with their partner and his son, Leo (Hayden Christensen).As the former friends feud, Leo and Nikki form a relationship that will force both parties to make amends, and update their menus.Brimming with bad Italian stereotypes and even worse acting, this American/Canadian co-production is better left in the oven. Although it borrows from Romeo and Juliet, the leads lack the chemistry to dethrone the star-crossed lovers.Incidentally, if Leo plans on marrying Nikki he's going to have to get a divorce from his mamma first.

4,Thanos_Alfie,Good to spend your time with...,5,8 November 2021,"""Little Italy"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a young couple trying to balance their new romance with a competition of the best pizza restaurant. Their families are fierce enemies and of course rivals in this competition.Since I did not have any expectations from this movie and I just watch it to spend my time, it was simple and good enough. The plot was very simple, without any plot twists or surprises and full of cliché as what you would expect from that kind of movie. The direction which was made by Donald Petrie was good and he presented his main characters and their history pretty good in order for the audience to understand what is going on and the relationship between them. The interpretations of both Emma Roberts who played as Nikki Angioli and Hayden Christensen who played as Leo Campo were also good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Little Italy"" is a nice movie to spend your time with and nothing more.",Little Italy
5,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,2,20 April 2020,"Little Italy tried to give an italian spirit to the story, but it failed. The story is simple, and yet, boring.

I tried to skip ahead when the dads were tastelessly insulting one another after one framed the other for a crime that definitely was more serious than a misdemeanor.

I for one did not it funny. It literally felt like it came out of a can. The situations were so contrived every tiny aspect of this film has been done before and been down 100 times better. I do not know if I could come up with one redeeming quality that this movie had, every character was wooden, every performance was modest at best, there was almost a total lack of direction and the writing was beyond elemental. I did not find myself chuckling once. Give it a skip, you've got better things to do with your life.",Little Italy
11,akcenat,Bland old-fashioned predictable feel good rom-com,5,21 October 2018,"""Little Italy"" - set in Toronto's Italian community - details the rivalry between two side-by-side pizza joints with the movie following the grown-up children of both sides (Hayden Christensens & Emma Roberts) as they find themselves falling for one another. Basically, ""Little Italy"" is a millennial's Romeo & Juliet, but in 2018 film looks, feels and plays like a VHS movie from two decades earlier. The real problem is that ""Little Italy"" is just to bland, with nothing we don't expect happening and the whole show moving steadily to an ending that is threadbare to the point of see through. Alyssa Milano and Jane Seymour are wasted in a pair of throwaway parts well beneath their talents, and even if both do what they can there's just nothing memorably substantive the actresses can do to make their performances memorable. Grandparents of the main characters (Danny Aiello and Andrea Martin) for me, unfortunately, had more charisma than Christensen and Roberts. Perhaps if grandparents were the protagonists instead of younger couple, this film would've been a much more engrossing and entertaining slice of romantic comedy. Also be warned, you will be hungry and will have persistent pizza cravings after watching, at least I did. 5-/10",Little Italy
12,cgvsluis,Ridiculous but sweet,5,8 December 2020,"I loved the grandparents and their romantic liaisons at the local Starbucks! Childhood friends and would be star-crossed lovers Little Italy style.
This is worth seeing for the cast alone...I can't describe it, you just have to see Alyssa Milano all decked out as a hoop ring wearing, fast talking, bubblegum chewing Italian...and drop in Jane Seymour??? She is a big city fancy chef, don't ask. But it ends up with figs on a pizza and an airport ""please don't leave scene"".",Little Italy

19,bastos,Terrible Romcom,4,24 May 2020,"I have nothing against romcoms, I would argue that they are even my guilty pleasure, but there's no excuse for such a lazy and uninspired mess. I have no problems with the amount of cliches that usually flood these kind of movies, but for bad execution I have no tolerance. And here the execution is just bad, mainly due to the casting that is a disaster. Emma Roberts escapes mostly unscathed through this but Anakin is obviously way older than he should which makes their scenes together very awkward. Not to mention that there is zero chemistry and you never really root for them, one of the biggest sins in a romcom. Then you make a movie about Italians and you cast mostly non Italians for this? The most annoying example is Andrea Martin that has absolutely no right to play an Italian woman and whenever she tried to speak Italian my skin crawled with embarrassment!",Little Italy

I was ready to turn it off in the first 2 mins after seeing the sound stage scenery and the attempt to make the 1990's look like 1940's Little Italy. Why this is set in Canada I have no idea.",Little Italy
21,TheRadiobox,"A decent, albeit familiar little snack",6,22 May 2021,"Little Italy was directed by Donald Petrie, written by Steve Galluccio and Vinay Virmani, and stars Emma Roberts, Hayden Christensen, Andrea Martin, Danny Aiello, Adam Ferrara, Gary Basaraba, Linda Kash, and Alyssa Milano. It's about a couple trying to make their romance work despite stiff competition and rivalry between their families' restaurants.The Plot: Petrie has peddled what's generally the same story for most of his career and has garnered a considerable degree of success by doing so. His streak continues with Little Italy, a romcom that competently sets up and plays out its plot but does little else. Years back, best friends Sal Angioli (Ferrara), wife Dora (Milano), and mother Franca (Martin) alongside Vince Campo (Basaraba), wife Amalia (Kash), and father Carlo (Aiello) ran a pizza joint together but, predictably, it; along with their relationship falls apart. Presently, the kids of the two families, Nikki (Roberts) and Leo (Christensen) go their separate ways; with Leo continuing to uphold the family business, and Nikki pursuing a wider scale. The writers go for parody, with plenty of stereotypical Italian accents, gestures, and language; which mostly works but gets grating by movie's end. With Nikki back in town, she rediscovers an old attraction (and plot thread) to Leo and the two work to steady their love and fix broken family ties. It's clearly a lite Romeo/Juliet, but it's played with a competence and earnestness that entertains.The Characters: As far as hyperbolic characters in romance movies go, Little Italy doesn't quite reach the highest highs, but that's not to say there is nothing of value either. Nikki is relatively serious compared to all of the other characters, wanting to look professional in front of both families for the limited time she intends to stay at home, but soon falling back into form as a more despite her reluctance to get involved with family drama and questionable business tactics. Conversely, Leo is more lax in his dealings, still embracing the pizzeria life and quirks. The other family members play into expected Italian dealings via colorful and strangely charming remarks and occasional deadpan deliveries (pun if you want it). Although the main plot surrounds Leo, Nikki, and the business end; the movie makes a detour in detailing another romance involving Carlo and Franca, a mature (in one way) couple. The actors are aware of the kind of fluffy entertainment they're in and serve up some decent performances.The Romance: In accordance with the rest of the movie, Little Italy's romantic plot is familiar but marginally better written than most others of the ilk; most likely due to being written by actual Italians and directed by a man well-versed in the genre. Having the two lead characters virtually grow up in the pizza shop, surrounded by the same people, and eating the same meals makes a lot of sense in screenwriting terms; but can feel played out and maybe a little cheap. Some cutesy encounters such as Nikki accidentally running into Leo's girlfriend are better written than the semi-Shakespearian source and offer a bit of redemption from the more cliche scenes like a soccer match in the rain which leaves the two by themselves for an almost-but-not-quite moment. The fact that Leo has a girlfriend is also glossed over and only addressed when absolutely necessary which makes it seem like a couple scenes are missing. Still, the romance is palatable, if not at all original.The Technics: While the primary genre execution is good at best and mediocre at worst, the other general aspects of the movie are decent the whole way through, never especially great or remarkably terrible. Plenty of romance movies have a lackluster look to them. Polished and perfunctory. Petrie's latest addition to his growing canon of romcoms fares just like his others. It's to no major detriment to the movie, but it and the whole genre could do with more personal touches to the cinematography. The soundtrack is overbearing too, again like the majority of releases, Little Italy can't help but hammer the points home when the little moments of charm are on-screen. The biggest difference here is the location. An Italy-inspired setting is hardly original, but Little Italy has the look of its titular location which helps to set it apart from the generic cityscapes in nearly every other romance movie. Everything else from the pacing, plot, relationships, and characters are all passable.Like most of Petrie's films, Little Italy isn't very original and skirts by on a handful of genuine moments, good chemistry between the leads, and earnestness; and it succeeds more than most of his other efforts. While certainly not great, it's an above average dish on the menu.62/100.",Little Italy
22,dmasursky,Adorable modern romance,8,11 November 2021,"The comparison to Romeo and Juliet is odd because the story plays out quite differently. Leo and Nikki are childhood friends. Their fathers' feud started when they were still kids, but they remained friends. Nikki leaves for culinary school and, when she returns, sparks fly. There's a lot of nice modern touches, such as a side story about an octagenarian love affair, and some colorful secondary characters, including a flaboyant gay bar owner. The Toronto setting is used well and the leads have great chemistry. A charming addition to the rom-com genre.",Little Italy
23,Chrimle,The introduction set the bar,6,10 August 2020,"The story was not as predictable as expected, but felt badly paced.Every opportunity to slip in a joke was taken. Hence, the majority of the jokes felt forced and were not funny at all. Most of the better jokes were the non-verbal ones.The beginning of the movie, the introduction of the characters set the bar quite high.

26,Web_Of_Doom,Don't try to squeeze comedy out of art!,6,3 July 2021,"This movie had all the ingredients to be a really good rom com, however unfortunately more bad ingredients were added & good ingredients then were lost in the time of the movie. There really is some great moments in the movie that for me make it definitely worth watching, however the bad takes you out of these good moments too many times to ever want to watch it more than once.In the movie their is a nice moment where the Grandmother says basically don't try to squeeze love from a man's heart, as it he loves you he will give love freely.The acting of the main stars is all very good except the supporting cast are for the most part like 2D caricatures & quite a few of the forced comedy scenes not only are simply not funny, they in no way are required to move the story forward. This is clearly bad screen play writing & lazy directing that ruins the whole movie. What should have been a 9 out of 10 movie ends up a watchable 6 out of 10.This is supposed to be a rom com, as generally the romance side pays off but when you add comedy it is supposed to be within the realms of believability, move the story forward but most importantly actually make you laugh ( so this is where the film not only falls flat as a pizza but also takes away from the good parts of the movie ). Some of the unnecessary scenes such as a police woman searching the main actor made absolutely no sense on how it was done & was 100% not funny, as I felt bad for Hayden Christensen who stayed professional during the whole scene ( how this scene got past the edit is unbelievable ).I also have a problem with the ending as you have 2 people with a dream job idea & one can have their dream anywhere with the other needing it in a specific location... so in this movie they only give the option of one of them giving up their dream when in the real world the solution would be they could have both.They do try to find a way out of this at the very end however the patch work job is both ludicrous & unbelievable, as for a movie that tried too hard to be modern by having diversity in the cast ( who's scripted lines are more 2D offensive than of being more 3D & more respectful of the multicultural real world we all share ).Films should encourage diversity in our multicultural world but that means giving people meaningful parts with meaningful words that come across as realistic.So to sum up there are some lovely moments in the movie but also a quite a few frustrating moments that take you out of the romance, so if you can look past the movies many flaws there you can find something that is an OK watchable film.",Little Italy
27,Scarefish,Hey Deep Dish Pizza Fugget About It!,1,26 August 2018,"Little Italy is cheesier than all the pizza in the world. It tries desperately to be a modern day Romeo and Juliet story but fails to add interesting conflict or stakes. It is incredibly dull and low-energy.The acting is typical of a romantIc comedy, failing to be relatable or charming, and worst yet funny. Rather than have characters react realistically, they wait for a couple of seconds for the camera to focus on them to delivery their dumb one-liner response. The movie feels the need to show you the same moment over and over with each character in the scene getting their chance at dropping a dumb one-liner. It's a shame, since I don't think Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor, but unfortunately his long hiatus from film is ended by a bottom-tier romantic comedy. There isn't much chemistry between the two leads, as it basically equates to PG porn. There is barely any depth to any of the characters due to a lack of struggle or calls to action, and they just meander and execute simple jokes and the occasional gag from time to time.The music is rather awful, as the pop songs really contradict the more traditional Italian tunes throughout. The modern pop songs are some of the least romantic pieces of music that have ever been written and seen like a desperate attempt at pulling in teenage girls into this film that will probably be way too boring for them anyways. The sound design as a whole is pretty bad as their idea of adding energy is to just fade the volume of the music so it gets louder and louder as the scenes go on.Despite being a movie boasting Italian culture, there is a huge lack of it here. There are many beautiful vistas in Italy, but we spend the vast majority of the film's time trapped in unromantic cramped spaces like kitchens and restaurants rather than landmarks.This movie is funny - Not! It has stupid jokes that counter the way reality works. One of the most annoying tropes in dumb comedies is that of marijuana turning people into party animals. Pot is snuck into pizza sauce which leads to rambunctious grandma's dancing and getting frisky rather than just taking a nap. There are also several incredibly lazy jokes at the expense of an Indian character that equate to references to popular culture that dumb-dumbs would understand, like calling him Pizzadog Millionaire or something along those lines, or having him make a joke about an Indian woman's mom being a sacred 'cow' as an insult, and making bizarre innuendos in an exaggerated accent. There's also other standout unfunny jokes such as an art old man saying ""Ow, my vagina!"" rather than angina, which is a heart condition. There are a grand total of zero clever jokes throughout the whole film.There's some random social commentary thrown in the absence of character rather than adding personality to a character. Out of nowhere a character drops a sob story about how they got kicked out by their dad after coming out as a homosexual towards the end of the movie, and it's essentially a throwaway piece of dialogue that doesn't really amount to anything in the little grand scheme of things.Little Italy is a lame romantic comedy that isn't funny or charming and has nothing of interest to offer anyone but the least demanding of moviegoers. It almost feels like the theaters are where you go for films that are too bad, even for Netflix. If you're really desperate for some Romeo and Juliet, you'd be better off seeing them in Sherlock Gnomes. This film's more mind numbing than drinking a gallon of absinthe.",Little Italy
28,jamesbourke59,A Shocking Waste Of Time,1,12 July 2019,"So I left it to my wife to choose our Friday night movie, looking through the listings on Netflix we stumbled upon this alleged romantic comedy within the confines of Little Italy somewhere in Canada, although if you look this movie up on IMDB the location is Toronto(my own home city) but such a location isn't actually mentioned but then again why should it when the storyline revolves around an Italian family, their culture and of course their love of pizza.However to quote Peter Griffin from Family Guy, what really grinds my gears is when the whole scenario is totally forced, the characters are carbon copies from movies that did it with far more success, instantly Moonstruck springs to mind.Of course, with every passing decade a new breed of filmmaker and they believe they have conjured up something special! Sadly not so in this case.The main leads were fine, although Hayden Christensen does lay on the Italian charm a little too thick, Emma Roberts didn't really have to hard and really she didn't quite pass as Italian.As good and sometimes excellent as Danny Aiello has been in movies gone by, I have to ask why Danny, why tarnish your reputation with such a pithy role.However, I'd blame were needed to be bestowed, I'm not going to say Director Donald Petrie, but rather Vinay Virnani, who wrote the story for this as well as co writing the script, there are two Asian characters in the movie, who to be honest are just on screen to illicit laughs, if anything the storyline should've perhaps been a culture clash of Asian meets Italian, as perhaps this might've been a tad more watchable.My wife enjoyed it, I found myself rather annoyed with the entire proceedings, as a life long movie fan, I implore you all, avoid at all costs, go watch Moonstruck or even Big Night just to remember how tales of love and laughter can be viewed within Little Italy",Little Italy

She's a mediocre actress in less than mediocre movies. To give her some spotlight, they casted some wuss that doesn't take on camera and acts as flat as rolled out pizza dough.
The premise and plot are sweepings from other and better restaurant-comedy's. The result, a predictable cinematic medley of stolen pieces, BUT they can't make it work. I kinda watched the whole movie 'cause I started talking about other stuff most of the time. And nope, I never laughed.

35,tampajoey,Emma Roberts is the only good thing about this movie.,5,19 November 2020,"The movie is just a cheesy romantic comedy and not all that funny, but worth a watch in a pinch. I was originally going to rate this movie a 6 because anything with Emma Roberts in it deserves an extra star. But, unfortunately anything with Alyssa Milano in it deserves at least one star removed. Alyssa Milano needs to spend more time working on her acting skills and a little less time spewing vile hatred on social media as it's obviously negatively impacted her ability to act (along with contributing to her rapidly declining physical appearance). The movie spends too much time focusing on irrelevant family and friends of the romcom couple at the expense of greater character development between the main couple (Roberts and Christensen). My general rule of thumb is that movies with a rating of 6 or above on IMDB are worth watching, so this is borderline at best.

40,MyContribution,"Fluffy, formulaic fun",4,2 December 2019,"So bad it is good? You know what to expect and you get it. There are a hundred faults, but like watching a Disney show, somehow you just cringe and keep on watching. I happened to see it while on an airplane, where it fits the bill, passes the time with little focus needed. The movie does, however, overplay its hand on the Italian stereotype. It is clearly a superficial plot, but it could have been so much better had they brought some true Italy into play. . . like the actual Italian respect for real coffee. Like cheap, frozen pizza, though, it has its charm.",Little Italy

I love Emma Roberts and her acting, but this movie did not give her anything to work on. Her character arch just didnt deliver. It remained the same the entire film - in love with the boy protagonist enough for her to make weird and irrational decisions. For somebody whose dreams are almost reachable, her actions did not make any sense.I love the cast but the ploot is so poorly written. 😔 So sad about this.",Little Italy

44,Syakirin-Ghazali,"It's a great Cute, Romantic and Comedic movie",7,1 October 2020,"It is certainly not the best movie ever but this movie has an honest and sincere message it wants the audience to know and the feeling throughout the movie is well presented. I love the creative one liners throughout the movie. The casts did well. Emma Roberts is as gorgeous as ever. Hayden is typical Hayden but it suits the character in the story in my opinion.
The quality of the picture is immaculate. The story might seem a bit unrealistic but it never loses its main plot. Its a good little movie to escape and also all of the casts gets a decent proportion of screen time to. Establish their significance in the entire movie and everything seem so well taught out.Beautiful",Little Italy

They're all usually kind of predicable and a little corny, but that is what makes them feel-good films. Maybe if you aren't Italian you won't fully ""get it""- but I am and I loved it. If you are looking for something funny, upbeat, something that will make you smile at the end and that will remind you to appreciate family/friendship, i'm sure you will love this movie. I thought the actors had great chemistry, were very funny, and the movie really captured the feel of an Italian family and all the traditions. To me this reminded me along the lines of my big fat Greek wedding.

Truly multi-cultural, passionate and honest. It will bore many, but tickle the heart of those who remember what small community life can be at its best. Filmed on locations in Toronto, it is even more fun. Little Italy could have been filmed in New York, but really, the Little Italy in Toronto has as much character. Sure the ferris wheel was a bit over the top, but if you condensed the markets and other summer highlights, it wouldn't be far off.

Was it the over the top New York accents for people in Canada? Was it Hayden Christensen's interesting hair with a horrible dye job? Was it the absurdity of the entire block turning out for a soccer shootout in the pouring rain at night? Was it the over the top caricatures of gay people and Indians?This could have been a tolerable diversion.

The stereotypes (Italian, Indian, and British) are numerous and cringe-worthy and no Italian neighborhood has ever looked like this outside of a Hollywood set. You've seen this plot a dozen times before and you can predict every turn of events.The good news. The dialogue is witty and has a number genuine laughs and surprises.

The funniest part is probably the 3 minutes of bloopers at the end of the movie.But, I would say the movie is watchable. You won't see any trying-too-hard funny stuff which comes across cringy.

91,cknight-2,"If you like rom-coms, this one's a tragedy",1,26 August 2018,"Two households, each bereft of dignity,
At College-Bathurst, where we lay our scene,
With ""paisano"" stereotyped ethnicities
And more clichés than should be on big screens.
From forth the pizza shops of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life.
I'm kidding! None dies or even comes to blows
Though wish it otherwise I'll bet you might.Hayden Christensen and Emma Roberts are the unlucky, not-very-Italian actors saddled with performing in this modern-day Romeo and Juliet, set in Toronto's Little Italy and scrubbed clean of any poisonings, sword fights or deadly misunderstandings. (On the plus side, no gnomes!)In spite of a 10-year age gap between the actors, we're meant to believe Leo and Nikki were childhood buddies growing up in neighbouring pizza shops, one run by Vince (Gary Basaraba), the other by Sal (Adam Ferrara). The two pie-stros were once best friends themselves, but had a falling out years ago; the reason is revealed at the end of the film and is no more worth the 100-minute wait than a delivered pizza would be.Anyway, cut to the present day, when the kids are now in love but just don't know it yet. Nikki has just returned from England, where she's an up-and-coming chef. Leo continues to work in his dad's pizzeria, and moonlights at Luigi's bar, where the big joke is that Luigi (Andrew Phung) is actually Chinese.Oh, and speaking of ethnic insensitivity, both pizza shops have resident Indian waitpersons (Vas Saranga, Amrit Kaur) who hurl insults at each other and - is this a spoiler? I'm going to say no - eventually fall for each other as well. But my favourite bit of colour-blind, accent-deaf casting had to be Andrea Martin as Nikki's granny, who delivers all her lines while staring into the distance as though waiting for a paycheque. Between this and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, she's become the go-to older relative of whatever nationality you need.Little Italy was directed by Donald Petrie - Mystic Pizza; I know! - from a script by Steve Galluccio (Mambo Italiano) and Vinay Virmani (Dr. Cabbie). William Shakespeare's name is not in the credits, although the filmmakers were kind enough to include the rarely used scene from Act IV where Romeo chases Juliet through an airport. Otherwise, it's a pained mish-mash of rom-com clichés, including old people being horny and making Beyoncé references. The leads have a soupçon of chemistry, most of its predicated on Roberts' squeaky laugh and Christensen's ability to be gentlemanly while drunk. But it's not enough to recommend this tired outing.

111,june82000,Really?,1,16 January 2019,"I feel sorry for anyone that thinks this is a good movie. Not funny, terrible acting, weak story, and to top it off; an obviously Asian guy playing the part of an Italian guy.",Little Italy

113,eliksjutta,I can't believe this movie is from 2018,5,2 July 2020,"20 minutes into Little Italy I decided to check the reviews to see if other people were as shocked as I was.
Judging by the jokes, the stereotypes and the culturally offensive casting, you would think this movie was from the early 2000s, back when no one cared, but it's from 2018!
Having two famous, non-Italian actors play children of Italian immigrants is offensive in so many ways. - Let's just dye their hair dark brown and we'll be fine - seemed to be the motto.
At least Hayden Christensen tries to save something by putting on an Italian accent (I know), but despite his good effort it just seems unnatural because everyone knows he IS NOT ITALIAN. And Emma Roberts doesn't even bother to try, her role is just Italian on paper.",Little Italy
114,taiken-86279,Disappointed,2,1 August 2020,"Over the top Italian stereotypes, terrible acting, Canadians trying to talk like New Yorkers, Canada. All combine for a bad movie that felt like it should have been on Hallmark channel with all the other cheesy, predictable ending rom-coms.",Little Italy

118,Dannymalt,Super Cheesy Rom Com,6,28 August 2018,"PROS
I liked the relationship between the two leads and was rooting for them.The film is one of the few mainstream Hollywood movies to actually be set in Toronto.CONS
The overall story of rival pizza shops right beside each other, and Romeo and Juliet similarities was kind of ridiculous. As were the scenes involving a soccer game, marijuana in pizza, and a pizza bake off competition.Hayden Christenson was too old vs. Emma Roberts, he spoke with a weird Italian accent sometimes.Hayden Christenson getting sexually assaulted by a female police officer is played for laughs in a weird reverse #MeToo moment.Too much blatant product placement (Air Canada and Starbucks).Lots of Rom Com clichés, like ending with the airport scene where everyone has to publically declare their love for each other.",Little Italy
119,sqtjwrm,So much better than I expected!,9,20 October 2021,"This movie is so fun. I've seen it a couple times now and every time I watch it, I fall for the characters and relationships more and more. I love the relationship the two mothers have, I love the insults the helpers have for each other, and I absolutely love the two leads. They have great chemistry!",Little Italy
120,ameliarasmmussen,quite literally the most god awful movie i've ever watched.,1,22 October 2021,I hated this movie. Hated it. I was in a state of shock when I saw the decent ratings on this movie. I made an account just to warn people to not waste some of 2 hours of their lives.,Little Italy

122,Strgzr87,Cringe,1,23 November 2018,"The kind of movie that makes you cringe all the time. Full of cliches, very bad comedy and writing in general. The chemistry between the leads is basically non existent. A very bad movie I'm really glad I didn't pay to see.",Little Italy
123,raidermatt-728-303842,Not painful.,3,21 October 2019,"Typical rom com formula. Unfortunately there is little chemistry between the leads, who have done better work elsewhere. Not much in the way of clever or interesting dialogue. Odd choice of setting. On the plus side, most of the supporting roles were well cast and added a few enjoyable moments. But overall, it just doesn't work.",Little Italy
124,monied406,Need Italian actors.,4,26 January 2019,Cute and predictable story. Is it too much to ask for Italian actors to be the leads? They didn't have enough chemistry.,Little Italy

129,daniigc,Hard to watch,2,24 January 2021,"It was better to do a movie about the Nonnos.
The main character is introduced as an overachiever who is running so far away from home that she has not visit her family in 5 years.
Yet, as soon as she arrive to Little Italy she turns into a whole different person and suddenly decides to quit everything for a guy that could simply go with her to London and help her achieve her dream.
There are so many stereotypes that are simply wrong but for me they crossed the bar with the Indian jokes.",Little Italy

131,Twillybe269,A decent Rom-com!,8,2 November 2020,The acting was very good except for maybe some of the Italian accents. Some of them seemed forced. The story was different in a good way but the outcome was still very predictable. It was still an enjoyable movie. The chemistry between the main couple was good but the chemistry and the story between the grandparents really made the movie work.,Little Italy

I'm all for a predictable romance, but this is just like a stale doughnut. It could have been good but just lacks flavor and needs to be tossed out.
Writers out there watch some of the old black and white films to learn how to tell a story...and maybe you will see all the time you used with stupid sexual innuendos could have been better served by developing your story line.",Little Italy

150,peafellingford,"My boyfriend described it as ""the Olive Garden commercial of romcoms""",5,20 February 2019,"Here's the thing. By all standards this movie is terrible and you shouldn't watch it. When my boyfriend found out this was supposed to take place in Toronto's Little Italy, which is absolutely nothing like what is depicted in this movie and definitely does not have a ferris wheel, we knew this would be exactly the kind of hot garbage we like to hate-watch together. And hate-watch it we did.I would guess that the writers had done no research beyond reading about Italian people on Wikipedia. The characters eat nothing but pizza the entire movie. They drink nothing but espresso the entire movie. They drop everything for impromptu soccer matches, grow basil on their roofs, and have cans of tomatoes literally everywhere. At one point somebody says ""You can take the girl out of Little Italy, but you can't take Little Italy out of the girl,"" and that's both the best and worst line in the entire movie.This is one of those films that's hard to review. I give it 5 stars not because of its quality, but because it's interesting and it provided entertainment. I loved making fun of this movie. Sometimes I can't sleep without white noise, and the last few nights my white noise of choice was this movie, and I had the most peaceful rest ever. I've felt compelled to rewatch it simply because it exists in an uncanny valley that is neither so-bad-its-good nor so-good-its-good. I give it five stars because that's what it deserves.",Little Italy
