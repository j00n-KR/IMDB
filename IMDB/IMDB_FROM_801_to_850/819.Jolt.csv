0,Leofwine_draca,Not worth your time,4,26 July 2021,"A poor comedy/action/drama featuring Kate Beckinsale, never the world's finest actress and seemingly stuck on autopilot here. She plays a character supposedly diagnosed with a condition that causes extreme rage and violence which she has to keep in check, but we never really see much of that; it's not LUCY or anything. Instead we get a simplistic, low rent kind of mystery with an ending you'll see coming a mile off, and not much else. In the end, it's a bland, cookie cutter derivative Hollywood kind of movie, and not worth your time.",Jolt
1,SnoopyStyle,jolt peters out,5,4 August 2021,"Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) has anger issues since childhood. She was institutionalized but nothing helped except an experimental treatment from Dr. Munchin (Stanley Tucci). She self-induces electrical shocks to her body whenever she has murderous thoughts. It's a lonely existence until she starts dating nice accountant Justin. When he's murdered, she seeks revenge while police detectives Vicars (Bobby Cannavale) and Nevin (Laverne Cox) investigate.The idea is interesting but it starts to wear thin sooner than expected. The first part's issue is that it gets repetitive. She has murderous vision, she gets a jolt, and the scene resets to normal. It happens over and over again. Once the premise is stated, the whole series of cinematic moves is not needed. The comedy needs to be better and I'm not sure that Kate Beckinsale can deliver it. She can definitely deliver the cool but she struggles to lead in this one. I like the start but the movie peters out over time.",Jolt
2,Prismark10,Jolt,5,27 October 2021,Kate Beckinsale cranks up the action as Lindy. She has severe anger management issues which gives her incredible strength.Some experimental contraption from Dr Munchin (Stanley Tucci.) A special vest jolts her to calm down.All bets are off when a mild mannered goofy accountant called Justin (Jai Courtney) that Lindy dates is killed.Lindy goes for revenge and finds herself in a conspiracy as two cops are after her.There is nothing much original here. The twist is easy to figure out. Beckinsale delivers the kick ass action.,Jolt
3,nogodnomasters,I hurt people. Might as well put it to good use.,7,26 July 2021,Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) has severe anger management issues as well as extraordinary strength and quickness. She is rigged up with an electric trigger device so she can jolt herself and control her anger. She meets a guy she likes and then he is murdered. All bets are off.There is nothing like a Harley Quinn character on steroids. Sets up for a series. Good action and humor.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.,Jolt
4,kosmasp,Shocking or not: here she comes,7,10 August 2021,"Though I wouldn't call her a man eater. She is an equal opportunist. Or rather her rage is not aimed at one gender (or non gender for that matter). It is Kate Beckinsale and she does kick ... and punches what is in front of her, when she feels the urge to do so. Now hearing that from the start you should be able to understand that suspension of disbelief is necessary.The story is really easy to follow to put it mildly and nicely. There is also a twist that I think anyone who has seen a few movies can see from miles away. Maybe it isn't a twist at all - or just for a few people. Whatever the case, have I mentioned that Kate Beckinsale stars in this? Atomic Blonde one might say - if that wasn't already the title of another movie.There is not much substance here, but quite some action and even more humor. Again do not try to make sense of it all - you wouldn't be able to. Also remember: Kate Beckinsale is in this! All kidding aside, it isn't just Kate (though the humor of her character seems to be close to her own, judging from her social media and interviews, in a good way), but also some interesting other casting choices. Tucci, Courtney and then some .... with a cameo appearance very late in the game that might suggest there could be a franchise here.",Jolt
5,classicsoncall,"""You know what? I think I'm exactly that stupid.""",7,23 July 2021,"""Jolt"" - not to be confused with ""Bolt"", a movie about a dog with a lightning streak on his back. Though in this case, the film's protagonist needs an electrical charge to control her aggressive tendencies, something she derives from a vest full of electrodes she wears that attach to her body. Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) has Intermittent Explosive Disorder, a condition I'm sure the script writer needed time to come up with so that it's acronym matched that of an Improvised Explosive Device. Yes, Lindy is a walking and talking IED, who goes on a rampage after her one and only boyfriend (OK, that's up for debate) is murdered after only the second date. What follows is pretty much what you'd expect in a mindless romp of car chases and fight scenes in which our average sized heroine routinely battles and pulverizes brutes twice her size. There's a twist that comes at the finale regarding said dead boyfriend, which further propels the story into the land of disbelief suspension, but by that time the astute viewer will probably have figured it out. Lest you think I'm being too critical of the picture, I did find it quite entertaining, and Beckinsale is a super powered IED with a look that's easy on the eyes. And she has amazing recuperative powers, evidenced by the fact that she's up and walking around with no problem at all after getting shot in the leg by a detective who has his eyes on the prize.",Jolt
6,Tweekums,Silly but a lot of fun,7,24 July 2021,"Lindy has severe anger management issues. She suffers from intermittent explosive disorder; this means anybody who irritates her is likely to experience her murderous rage. Various people have tried to help her or at least channel her rage to their purposes with no success. Finally she finds a psychiatrist who gives her a vest that is wired so she can give herself an electric shock if she feels she is about to lose control. The condition makes it almost impossible to form relationships but one day she meets a man, Justin the accountant, who she doesn't feel urged to hurt... he might even be 'the one'. Unfortunately he ends up dead in a dumpster with two bullets in his head. Lindy is unimpressed with the police response so decides to track down the killer herself... for once her propensity for violence might serve her rather than ruin her life.If you are looking for realism or something vaguely sensible then this probably isn't the film for you; if on the other hand you plenty of solid action and just enough plot to justify it this is well worth watching. There is plenty of action from start to finish; this mostly means fighting but there is also an entertaining car chase, a couple of explosions and an amusing chase through a hospital. Kate Beckinsale impresses as Lindy; we know a woman her size couldn't beat up the large men she has to fight but if you can suspend ones disbelief it doesn't seem too silly... she can certainly pull off the moves in the well choreographed fight scenes. Bobby Cannavale and Laverne Cox as Detective Vicars and Detective Nevin are solid; I know some viewers weren't keen on having a trans cop but I thought she was a fun character. Tanya Wexler did a fine job directing. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting ninety minutes of action and nothing too serious.",Jolt
7,paul_haakonsen,Quite entertaining...,6,10 October 2021,"Well, this was actually a nice surprise of a movie.When I sat down to watch the 2021 Amazon original movie titled ""Jolt"", I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it. But with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen, and it having Kate Beckinsale on the cast list, of course I had to watch it.As it turned out then writer Scott Wascha actually managed to put together a wholesome storyline and plot that made for an entertaining movie. Sort of if you think ""Crank 2"" but with a twist, then you have ""Jolt"".I was genuinely entertained by what director Tanya Wexler managed to do with Scott Wascha's script. The movie was fast paced, had an interesting concept and interesting characters, and it was actually good old fun from start to end.It was nice to see Kate Beckinsale in a role as she played in ""Jolt"", and she was nicely cast for the movie. But the movie also have some interesting casted performers, such as Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale, Susan Sarandon and David Bradley on the cast list.If you enjoy a fast paced action thriller, where you just lean back, munch on the snacks while enjoying a fast paced ride, then ""Jolt"" is definitely a movie well-worth watching.My rating of ""Jolt"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Jolt
8,CinemaSerf,"Jolt with a volt, or just a bolt ... for the door.",5,21 October 2021,"Tanya Wexler has assembled an half-decent cast for this film, but sadly her execution - accompanied by a really poor script - offers us precious little to hold our attention. ""Lindy"" (Kate Beckinsale) manages to control her frequent bouts of violence by way of a vest that delivers electronic pulses into her body to calm her down. Without said gadget, she is lethal! She falls in love with ""Justin"" (Jai Courtney) - but when he is killed, she is bent on revenge and carnage ensues. Snag is, though it is quite an innovative concept, the plot has something of the video game about it. The vest serves as her reset button, but also as our's - the story moves on, then stops, goes back, starts again etc. It's cyclical and repetitive and Beckinsale just seems to be trying to resurrect the sort of character she had in the ""Underworld"" series - in which she was generally much better. There are also a few scenes from an off-form Stanley Tucci as ""Dr. Munchin"" - who devised her self-control mechanism, but they don't really add much to the general lack of menace or peril on display. It passes the time, this - the production standards are quite decent - but the story just runs out of steam far too early on and I was, frankly, rather bored by the middle let alone the end.",Jolt
9,zardoz-13,A Fun Movie with Plenty of Action,9,24 August 2021,"""Underworld"" actress Kate Beckinsale toplines ""Hysteria"" director Tanya Wexler's far-fetched, feminist, action fantasy ""Jolt"" (***1/2 OUT OF ****) as a doll suffering from anger management woes. The only relief for her ""Intermittent Explosive Disorder"" is self-induced shock treatment conditioning to curb her violent pugnacity. Basically, her savvy psychiatrist has created a Pavlovian mesh vest consisting of electrodes that transmit electricity to zap our heroine when she feels the urge to harm others. Clocking in at a nimble 90 minutes, this crackerjack outing in formula filmmaking bristles with surprises galore because you never know what our heroine is going to do. ""Jolt"" unfolds with a montage of Lindy wrestling hopelessly as a child with anger management. We're told she came from a broken home, with an alcoholic father and a mother slept too much. ""Some people cry,"" Lindy enlightens her sympathetic therapist, Dr. Munchin (Stanley Tucci of ""The Hunger Games""), during an office visit. ""Some people drink,"" she adds. ""Some people write s**t poetry. I hurt people."" Consequently, Lindy has never been a people person until she meets a young, handsome, bespectacled accountant, Justin (Aussie actor Jai Courtney of ""Suicide Squad""), on a blind date. They follow up with each other on a second date.Just as she is learning how to love somebody, Lindy Lewis learns to her chagrin that Justin has been murdered. The police pull his body from a dumpster with two bullets in his skull. This revelation makes Lindy's blood boil with rage. The police order her to stand down, but she launches her own investigation. Moreover, she sneaks into police headquarters and rifles their evidence locker for clues. Afterward, her life spins out of control into chaos. Before Lindy realizes it, not only do the police want to arrest her, but also the people behind Justin's homicide decide to knock her off. Although ""Jolt"" surges from one smackdown to another, with plenty of careening car chases and lots of sadistic dastards out to deep-six her, Lindy never gives an inch unless she is taking a pound out of her adversaries. Lindy's anonymous physician from childhood (Best Actress Oscar-winner Susan Sarandon of ""Dead Man Walking"") fills us in on Lindy's terrible ailment. ""Her condition made her extremely volatile and far, far angrier than normal. Lindy had a hair trigger. Once provoked, she would snap.""
You'd think this gimmicky actioneer would run out of energy, but the voltage in ""Jolt"" never slackens. Lindy's odyssey into the criminal underworld that Justin served constitutes a series of Herculean labors as she struggles to learn the identity of Justin's killer. One unforgettable scene finds our indefatigable heroine scrambling desperately through a hospital with a trigger-happy, African American cop, Detective Nevin (Laverne Cox of ""Charlie's Angels"" reboot) at her heels. Unlike her partner Detective Vicars (Bobby Cannavale of ""Snakes on a Plane""), who allows Lindy the benefit of the doubt, Nevin cuts her no slack. Nevin has no qualms about shooting Lindy. Cornered in a newborn nursery, Lindy faces the pistol packing Nevin with her finger on the trigger. Out of the blue, Lindy seizes a bundle of newborn joy and treats it like a hot potato. Meaning, she laterals the baby to Nevin like a football . The detective has no choice but to catch the kid rather than plug Lindy. Miraculously, Lindy escapes this close encounter with Nevin and continues her investigation. Earlier, she had interrupted an underground fight and offered to beat up any three men if a snitch will give her the identity of Justin's killer. Lindy is willing to deck three of the toughest guys, but the snitch insists she handle all three at the same time. Non-plussed, Lindy accepts his terms and reduces the trio to piles of quivering flesh.Inevitably, Lindy meets her match. This evil fellow, Delacroix (Ori Pfeffer of ""Hacksaw Ridge""), manages to get the drop on our usually alert heroine. Worse, in a fluke of circumstances, he knocks her out. When she recovers, Lindy finds herself zip-tied to a chair, while her sadistic nemesis activates a machine designed to drain blood from the body. Spontaneously, in a fit of titanic rage, Lindy snaps both zip-ties. She hurls herself out of the chair and hammers Delacroix with merciless fists until he babbles everything she wants to hear. Eventually, Lindy learns the truth about Justin's demise while trying to veer clear of the two detectives and the underworld minions that harass her at every turn. The repartee between the good cop Vicars and the bad cop Nevin adds to the comic relief. Eventually, Lindy learns Dr. Munchkin hasn't been entirely honest with her about her condition.Director Tanya Wexler doesn't let the momentum slacken between several hyperbolic action scenes that will prompt you to shadow box to Lindy's shenanigans. She doesn't pull her punches either, while everybody from our heroine to her adversaries never play by the rules. The voltage in ""Jolt"" never dims and neither does Kate Beckinsale's charismatic wattage. Of course, it qualifies as all-around preposterous pabulum, but every sizzling minute of it is a blast. The sight of this slender damsel with her patrician British accent smashing her opponents, like a heavyweight palooka, into pitiless submission is a cathartic treat you may enjoy more than once.",Jolt
10,Calicodreamin,"Comical, but stiff",5,31 July 2021,There were definitely a few good low brow jokes and some decent action scenes. The cinematography had a great dark vibe and some good shots. However the plot and dialogue were stiff. The storyline jumped around and didn't always make sense.,Jolt
11,trashgang,glad Kate is back but I had some issues with the one-liners,6,21 August 2021,"Where is the time you were looking out for another Underworld flick with Kate as main lead. After that particular franchise her career went downhill somehow. I totally lost her not knowing what she was doing.And then my best friend told me, hey, on prime you can see Kate her new flick and it's not that bad at all.That's true it's not that bad because it clocks in at 90 minutes, because they do have some surprising thespians in it and there's some nice fight scene's in it concerning Kate.The story itself is rather weak, in the beginning it's explained what is wrong with her but overall it's not believable but who cares. The only thing you want to see is a sexy Kate, and she is and a fighting Kate, which she does.So overall it does deliver what you expect from this kind of no-brainers but what didn't work for me, the one-liners and the to be funny bits.On part of the camera work, just watch the chase at the clinic, stunning work .Glad to see she's back but I'm honest, Atomic Blonde (2017) was a bit of the same but much better.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 2/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5.",Jolt
12,deloudelouvain,Entertaining movie with a never aging Kate Beckinsale,7,2 August 2021,"Another entertaining movie with a rather low rating and a lot of negative reviews. I learned not to pay too much attention anymore to the extremely negative reviews (and extremely positive as well). I get that some might not like this genre of movies, and there's nothing wrong with that, but scoring it the lowest possible is just ridiculous unless you don't watch a lot of movies. I watched thousands of movies in my life so I can recognize a stinker but Jolt isn't one of them. Jolt is entertainment from beginning till the end. The story is what it is, not to be taken serious, the kind you watch with a bucket of popcorn. As for the acting, it was good, and that from the whole cast. Kate Beckinsale looks like she never ages, still very good looking and certainly not looking her age. She can act so it's pleasant to watch her. I wouldn't mind another Jolt to be honest, a sequel could be possible, and I would definitely watch it.",Jolt
13,Cineanalyst,Could've Been More Shocking,4,23 July 2021,"That Kate Beckinsale, weighing all of a ""buck-o-eight,"" as it's suggested at one point, beats up a bunch of burly goons without as much as getting a scratch on her doesn't bother me nearly as much as the notion of an accountant being that buff. I mean, she's got some whatever make-believe medical condition that gives her anger problems super strength, so that checks out by movie logic. Hulk if his pupils dilated instead of him turning into a giant green Mr. Hyde monster. But, how was anyone supposed to believe the jacked Jai Courtney is a boring accountant? Talk about suspension of disbelief.Anyways, how is ""Jolt"" not a comic-book superhero movie? Marvel does have a heroine named ""Jolt,"" I see, but apparently she's unrelated, and this is supposedly an original scenario... well, not too original. Just last week, Netflix released their own pulpy female assassin revenge flick, ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" (2020), that every other person will compare to ""John Wick"" (2014). Amazon not to be outdone, here we are again. Beckinsale's blonde hair also invites comparisons to ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017). Not that I'm necessarily complaining; I oft like this trashy nonsense. This one benefits from being relatively potty-mouthed and sexually perverse with Beckinsale's BDSM play of electrodes covering her torso and handcuffing herself to keep her urges in check. Her apartment number plate falls loose every time her door slams, to display ""96,"" but I think we all know that number is upside down.Too bad there are some huge flaws here, though. The action scenes are rather poor in comparison to the aforementioned similar movies. When the cutting isn't choppy enough, it's evident that the stunt work isn't the best. Easy enough in itself to overlook, but worse is that the movie begins with five minutes of exposition, as narrated by Susan Sarandon, who only otherwise makes an appearance to establish plans for a sequel and tell the heroine, ""Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it, yet."" Or something to that effect. I mean, is this really not based on a comic book? Someone please tell me it is. Or have we just reached the point where random action movies attempt to be the next MCU? The fantasies and flashbacks also have the appearance of ""Family Guy"" cutaways, and that's not a compliment.I'm especially confused, too, by nothing seeming to be done with the protagonist wanting to be a photographer, which is a highly reflexive notion (i.e. Camera as character) to throw out in a movie and not do anything with it. She also later retrieves photographs from what appears to be a film cannister. Curious. Oh, and Stanley Tucci, among other familiar faces, is in it, too.",Jolt
14,UniqueParticle,Reminds me of Crank 2: High Voltage and just as fun,8,28 September 2021,I guess I'm one of very few that enjoys Jolt quite a bit it's a great concept and very entertaining more than expected. I'm not sure why a lot don't appreciate the film but I love how the dark humor like when Lindy is shown beating up random people so much fun! I barely have been on amazon in the last couple months weird stories like this make me happy to use it the service more. The cast is perfect and the madness is even better especially to me!,Jolt
15,cruise01,"Shockless action, thin plot, and waste of a great cast.",4,14 October 2021,2 out of 5 stars.Jolt is a bad action comedy film. Lacks the humor and comedic moments. Filled with cheesy direction that tries to keep the energy electric pacing. Plot about a girl Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) who has an impulse rage control which she uses an electric device to keep her anger down. When she finds a guy she may love. And something happens. She goes on a revenge spree to find the bad guys responsible.Plot is thin. And forgettable. A twist that may be predictable and lacks the surprises. Except for a fun surprise cameo of who shows up at the end.The action sequences are forgettable. And dull fight scenes with a fast editing scenes put together. Boring music score and dull direction.Kate Beckinsale is great but her talent is wasted in this action role.,Jolt

17,subxerogravity,"Not bad, just ok...I guess.",6,25 July 2021,"A little too long in the tooth when explaining what this movie is about during the opening minutes of this film, but the origin made me think I was going to be watching Crank or something, but it didn't go there.It just was not wild and wacky enough to head down that road
It was a cool premise, but it could have been pulled off better. I was expecting (or rather hoping) for more action than I got. What I did get did not hold up.Was not funny enough (if it was trying to be at all). It was not crazy enough and it was not exciting enough to full hold me in my seat.",Jolt
18,alindsay-al,A Below Average Action Film,4,27 July 2021,"This film was originally slated for a theatrical release but Amazon realised that nobody would go to watch it so put it on their streaming service and I watched Jolt this morning and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman with medical anger issues have to go on the hunt when a man she falls for disappears.Main Character
Kate Beckinsale plays the main character here and she is the best part of the film as she is really trying to carry this film on her back. She takes the poor material given her and gives this interesting protagonist that I actually ended up rooting for, despite the weak motivations. I'm not sure if there is a future for her in a franchise like this but hopefully we see her in more roles like this in the future.Supporting Characters
Stanley Tucci is in this film and what more is there to say, he is great because even in the worst films he usually delivers and he does here. Some of the best scenes in the film are between Beckinsale and Tucci and its a shame there weren't slightly more. Jai Courtenay plays her romantic interest and he isn't in the film much but he just doesn't do it for me, unless he is throwing a boomerang like in The Suicide Squad I am just not interested in him and find him really bland. Bobby Cannavale and Laverne Cox play cops after her and they just offered very little, they were basically comic relief and considering that the comedy is really bad in this film it means their characters are bad.Story
The story really hampers the film, it is just incredibly messy and ruins a somewhat interesting idea. I knew it was going to go wrong when there is this really awful exposition narration and it just continues with characters having poor motivations and confusing twists that just don't make any sense. The film overreaches and spends way too much time with elements of the film that aren't interesting at all and it ends up killing the film.Script
The script though is the weakest part of the film, the dialogue is so bland with the drama not hitting any emotional notes or make you really care. The humour is way overplayed and it is just really bad with somebody writing this who had no idea how humans interact by forcing humour that is really out of place.Style
The action in the film is okay, there are some decent pretty brutal action sequences and the film doesn't overstay its welcome with its length and the pacing is pretty good. But the action isn't standout, and there just aren't any memorable action scenes making it a pretty forgettable experience.Overall
Overall, Jolt is a below average action film. There are so many action films these days that are just forgettable and this is another one with no standout reason to watch apart from Tucci and Beckinsale giving good performances.",Jolt

[+42%]",4,24 July 2021,"Kate Beckinsale tries to pull off a Charlize Theron in her latest sci-fi actioner (in the same universe as Crank) to middling results. Not that her arse-kicking is any less exciting. The awkward wig, cosmetics and the obvious presence of a stunt double aside, she's quite solid as this I-hate-people protagonist with an anger problem. But the central plot is so thin and unexciting that the only fun the film offers is in its fast-paced set-pieces. The core element of aggression (being subdued with the aid of mild electrocution) is simply used to deliver short and thrilling but generic pieces of action. The supporting acts (featuring the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney, and Bobby Cannavale) are just what they need to be. The writing (by Scott Wascha) is utterly weak, with a nonsensical plot, zero character development, and some really silly dialogue at times.

23,markthomassintek,Still can kick it,7,26 July 2021,"REVIEW - JOLTKate Beckinsale is one of the most versatile actors from dancing to emotional acting but she is possibly most well known for the Underworld franchise.Now we are all getting older (unfortunately) but even though Kate was born in 1973 and is 48 years old she can still kick it.Honesty as with my Gumpowder Milkshake if Kate Beckinsale had played the lead, now what an amazing film that would be.Who recalls the Jason Statham film called Crank 2: High Voltage, this film is similar by using electricity but in this case rather than keeping her alive it is used to control her violence, which comes in very handy when her date is killed and the vest is removed.Nowhere near as good as any of the Underworld films but definitely worth a watch. Rating 7 out of 10.",Jolt
24,abisio,"Good beginning, decent second act but poor third",6,27 July 2021,"If you are interested in action movies with strong female protagonists; check La Femme Nikita or ANNA but if you do not like subtitles; Jennifer Garner's PEPPERMINT. None of them make a big splash at the box office but all of them are really good on their own and deserved a big success.But if you do not, you can get JOLT on AMAZON PRIME. A movie that starts interesting; a girl (Lindsey) with a very aggressive personality; whose exploits make her extra strong and very very uncontrollable violent.Later she meets a nice guy and basically start falling for a guy who gets killed so she decides to avenge him.Stanley Tucci and Kate Beckinsale play the movie with a cynically comically attitude giving some sympathy to a character who is basically a serial killer nutcase. Two not very orthodox police (man and woman) enter the game and from that point the movie becomes somehow dumb.But when the bad guy is found and the vengeance is fully on, the script becomes so stupid and predictable that everything good before get lost. The double ending (happy / prepare for the sequel), does not help at all; on the contrary.Kate is good in dramas; but comedy is not her forte; she holds her lines just fine but do not become hilarious. Also action scenes are not particularly spectacular or violent nor digitally enhancedIn brief: just a passable entertainment if you did not take it too seriously and free if you are PRIME member.",Jolt
25,AngelHonesty,Cheep,3,29 July 2021,"I have always loved Kate Beckinsale as an actress, she was perfection in Underworld and Pearl Harbor, but lately her movies have been terrible. I know she has the ability to be a great actress, but just because you put a great actress in a film, it does not make a great film. It takes many elements to make a film great and ""Jolt"" was severely lacking.I know they were going for ""funny"" in this movie, but every joke fell terribly short and made me role my eyes in annoyance. It felt like they were trying to make it serious, with a mix of romance and then funny too, but it didn't come off right. Everything was rushed from one scene to the next with very little ""get to know you"" moments in the movie. The concept of the film was great, but it was written and delivered very poorly. I knew how the film was going to end from the start of the movie because they made everything extremely cliche giving away all mystery. This film would have been much better if it had left behind the goofiness and went to a very serious context.

27,Sir_AmirSyarif,An explosive Kate Beckinsale provides spark,6,1 August 2021,An explosive Kate Beckinsale provides spark for Tanya Wexler's energetic 'Jolt.' There are twists and turns but they're mostly predictable ones - which often takes the intensity out of the film. Watching Beckinsale dig her heels into some comedy for a change while landing fun and frequent bloody violence is also a pleasant surprise that will charm viewers.,Jolt
28,kjproulx,A Cool Concept with Incredibly Messy Execution,2,29 July 2021,"When it comes to Kate Beckinsale-led films, I've always been conflicted. I've never liked the Underworld movies very much, but she has always been likeable in them, and other outings like Whiteout just left a bad taste in my mouth. Her career has been a little frustrating to me, because she always chooses projects that I don't end up liking, while still liking her in them. Well, this has happened yet again with Jolt, but I think this might just be the worst of the bunch. Here's why Jolt, one of Prime Video's most recent releases, fails.The film begins with an over-abundance of exposition to set up this character. Lindy (Beckinsale) has a very rare disorder that makes her extremely homicidal and will kill anyone who gets in her way. With the help of a vest that shocks her back to normal whenever she feels like it, she is able to contain her rage. Very much like Crank with Jason Statham, this film is full of energy. With that said, this movie is overly energetic to the point that it feels too frantic throughout the majority of the run time.The idea of the movie could've made for a fun time, but I always felt like the movie was speaking down to me as if I couldn't figure out certain details on my own. On top of that, there is a plot involving her boyfriend that just made me roll my eyes. This film takes a lot of chances in terms of surprising its audience, but it never works. A cool sequence early in the film shows what she wishes she could do to certain people. This scene was cool, but there are about 10-20 scenes exactly like it throughout the film and it just became repetitive.The character of Lindy deserved to have a better film built around her. I enjoyed her backstory (even though it was poorly told), but the action was very choppy and the villains felt way too serious. It just felt very different from the tone the movie was originally going for. Everything sort of clashed with each other the more the film progressed and I just found myself annoyed. Even the twist that I mentioned before just felt way too predictable and dumb. I never once was engaged with anything on-screen.Overall, Jolt is a giant mess of a movie. Very drab and gloomy with its colouring, even though it does go for some neon lighting at times. So even the Cinematography felt off to me. It's very hard for me to recommend this, even to fans of mindless action, because it's so quick and frantic to even focus on. Jolt is easily one of the weakest films I've seen in 2021 so far. If you still would like to give it a watch, it's now streaming on Prime Video.",Jolt

A skinny broad taking on and fighting a bunch of guys body slamming them. How did she get this part? She should have played one of the detectives instead?

That is exactly how it turned out; It seems, I was right all along!An unintelligible Script along with badly assembled dialogues; that's what ""Jolt"" is; in a nutshell. Even the Action (for which we all were excited) for the most part ended up being a damp squib!Technically, this was a bigger mess. Especially, the Score or I would rather say the mastering of it! At times, I could hardly hear the conversations as the music gets too loud in the background. And the bizarre selections of tracks aggravated the aforesaid situation. I often talk about Sound, and how fundamental it is for any film, let alone an Action-Thriller! Quite disheartening if I'm being honest here!Thankfully, Kate Beckinsale doesn't leave us in the lurch! She performed to the best of her abilities. Without her in it, I'm certain; things would have been worse. Can't really blame her for such a paper-thin plot with next to nothing characterization.In the end, even with occasional sparks of brilliance; the comprehensive outcome isn't on par with general expectations!

Director: Tanya Wexler
Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Jai Courtney, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale, Laverne Cox, David Bradley etc
Jolt is about a bouncer with a slightly murderous anger management problem that she controls with the help of an electrode lined vest she uses to shock herself back to normalcy whenever she get's homicidal. Jolt was an ok film, and definitely a guilty pleasure kind of film.My first few positives would be the fun concept, character background and fun set up. As well as the fun tone, interesting elements and set locations. The film's concept was delightfully absurd, and actually really worked throughout most of the first half. It was certainly a unique and fun idea, and despite the ridiculousness of it I have to praise the director for thinking of something outside of the box. I also thought the character background was good. The film explained a lot about the main character Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) it gave you good insight into her upbringing and how her character was perceived by others, and it made you understand her perspective due to people wanting to experiment on her, whilst also setting up the fun and absurd tone that was executed so well in the first half. I also thought the set up was great fun, I thought that the film set up the character of Lindy really well with her social awkwardness and her condition, whilst also establishing her relationship with Justin (Jai Courtney) it added a new layer to her character as she let her guard down. And for him to be mysteriously killed, and a police hunt for her due to her unstable condition was a fun set up and introduced a very fun element and good mystery to the film. There was also a lot of interesting moments, I think the worldbuilding in terms of explanation and detail into Lindy's condition actually made it believable and plausible when watching. It was fascinating to see how her brain reacted when people annoyed her and the different methods, she used to control herself with the electrode vest and the control to shock herself being a fun element to the film. I also thought the films set locations were great. It made its budget seem much higher than it probably was. With some really interesting set locations that were visually stunning and fascinating to look at, whilst also being big enough in scope for some fun action scenes.However, my first few negatives would be the use of exposition and voice over, the poor script. As well as the lapses in the logic and tonally the film for the most part being all over the place. This film really overelied on spoon feeding the audience into plot points that were honestly not that difficult to understand throught the action, it just felt like the film felt like it was more complicated then what it was. I also found the use of voice over at the beginning to be very frustrating. It was completely overused and ran on for too long. It set up things well, but then dragged on to explain Lindy's whole childhood, plus the voice over just wasn't needed for half of it. The script was also pretty poor, the dialogue was clunky and generic. The structure was very messy and slowly went more and more formulaic, it felt like they had the concept and about half of a good film in terms of understanding the absurdity of the idea and the characters, and then it just seemed to go off the rails slightly. There was a lot of lapses in the logic as well, the police officers in this film Nevin and Vicars played by Bobby Cannavale and Laverne Cox. In real life they wouldn't have a job its as simple as that. There were so many lapses in the logic and illogical decisions that didn't make sense and were too unrealistic. They were practically helping Lindy for most of the film, I can forgive a few illogical character decisions, but this was constant. Finally, the film tonally was all over the place. At first it was tonally focused and worked really. But as the film developed the film got tonally more confused and frankly just messy, bouncing far too often between the absurd, comedic, and serious and it just didn't blend well together at all.My next few positives would be the great cinematography, sound design and gore. As well as the main performances, chemistry between the cast and humour. This film was visually creative, it did a lot with its limited budget. With some visually stunning shots, in particular fun uses of colour grading that really made a lot of the scenes pop out of the screen excellently. It made it visually stand out a lot more then the script. I also thought the sound design was used very effectively, I thought the use of electric shocks with the sound design added a lot more impact to the film, it built tension and added an interesting element both to the film and to the main character. I also thought the humour and use of gore was excellent. I thought the comedic timing of the scenes were Lindy was trying to control her anger was excellent, it was clever to show what Lindy wanted to do to the people and what she actually did. They were hilarious to see and the over-the-top use of gore also made the scenes really stand out and were a lot of fun. I also thought the lead performance from Kate Beckinsale was great, she is an experienced actress and it really showed here. She made the film work more than perhaps it should have done. She delivered with the action as expected with her previous roles, but also delivered in making Lindy a fascinating character to watch. Kate also had fantastic chemistry with the rest of the cast and had some great back and forth interactions.My final few negatives would be the rushed pacing, how generic and predictable the film became. As well as the underwhelming villains and messy final act. The film was extremely rushed. It never allowed anything to really sink in or connect, as it was just rushing from one scene to the next trying to cram as much in as possible. The film just slowly fell into the genre tropes that it was trying to avoid in the first half. In a formulaically plotted and predictable second half. The film made Lindy as a character just so much less interesting just making her come across as needing a man and nothing much more, and the attempted twists and arcs for the characters were predictable and could be seen from a mile away. I also thought the villains were very underwhelming, when you don't reveal practically nothing about a villain and don't put in the work to create a mystery about them its very easy to have the reveal fall flat, David Bradley as the villain was just not a good choice and he was hardly even in it. And the predictable twist with Justin fell flat for me and he got hardly any screen time and therefore was an ineffective villain that didn't leave an impact. The final act itself was also a complete mess, the film just lost touch with what made it work for the most part, in a bland and forgettable final act that honestly didn't really go anywhere.My final few positives would be the development to the plot when transitioning from the first act into the second, as well as the fun action and partly entertaining moments of the final act. I thought that the plot developed well when Lindy was on the run from the police, her character went on a fun journey and really made her character interesting to watch, with the underground fight club scene a good standout. I also thought the action was pretty strong. It was entertaining and well-choreographed and pretty brutal in places, and the best of the action was definingly in the final act so that's why it was still entertaining to watch.Overall, Jolt is one of those movies that is technically very bad, but I still kind of liked it and it was a guilty pleasure film. Due to the fun and absurd idea. The charms of Kate Beckinsale and I was entertained throughout. But I am still scoring it low because it was tonally and structurally a mess. Not Committing to one thing enough in order to stand out from the crowd and frankly didn't give me enough of a jolt to want to watch it again for a while.Overall score 58/100.",Jolt

But outside of that this was a massive stinker.The acting from all parties was brutal which was a shame because this had good cast in it. The premise was completely idiotic and stupid. The director was trying to make movie similiar to the likes of Crank. But this film isn't clever nor engaging enough to pull that off. The comedic aspect the movie tryed to stride for was massive miss. I diddn't crack smile once, and the action was choppy and lame.Avoid this movie at all costs.

49,danybur,Could be a better story,5,26 July 2021,"SummaryA good initial approach in a comedy tone focused on a conduct disorder of its protagonist dilutes her interest when she uses it to carry out revenge, in what seems to be the beginning of an action saga with significant doses of violence.Review:Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) is a woman who suffers from an ""intermittent explosive disorder"", consisting of reactions of uncontrolled rage to situations that bother her, recciones where she also manifests an unusual force. When her clinical picture seems to be under control, a murder embarks her on a frantic quest to get revenge on the perpetrator.The voice-over prelude to the Tanya Wexler film is an ironic flashback that traverses Lindy's childhood and adolescence dealing with her disorder. As an adult, she lives some situations that can generate a certain identification and empathy on the part of the viewer.But Jolt is not a drama but an action film that exhibits a significant degree of violence but does not lose the elements of comedy that it has exhibited since its inception, with a gallery of characters that includes the psychiatrist from Lindy (Stanley Tucci), to a misguided and hilarious police detective couple (led by Laverne Cox and Bobby Cannevale) and a love interest (Jail Courtney).But it is in the action section (the main one) where the film begins to lose effectiveness (despite its scenes posed with solvency) due to certain implausibilities of the script and a main character who does not grow capitalizing on his disorder in other ways and seems to transform in a mere comic to the punches; in this way the empathy built in the first part of the story is diluted. It seems that the harshness of the character that makes up Beckinsale (and her physique and age) convinces more from comedy than from action or drama. Nor are certain twists (quite confusing or hasty, by the way) enough to rescue the viewer's interest in what appears to be the beginning of a La femme Nikita style saga.",Jolt

But not so overpowering theme to not be decent to watch. As a counterbalance, my wife really enjoyed it. Which I think is the case because there is a female protagonist who is the victor at every turn, despite any level of opposition. Normally a movie this aggressive in violence and near comic book feel repels my wife. Maybe it is how women are portrayed that matters more to her than genre.

Even the bad guy(s) are about as cliche as could be, but the script and decent action scenes made me forget about that aspect. Acting is on par throughout, but never really calls for something exceptional, except perhaps Jai Courtney, who I personally love. And he was particularly enjoyable in this. However there's a lick of weird sci-fi X-Men type of stuff going on in this that just gets swept under the rug like it's no big deal.

67,dfloro,Another Blonde of the Nuclear Kind,6,8 August 2021,"Kate Beckinsale knows a thing or two about action flicks from her Underworld days, and she and a reliably talented cast including Bobby Carnavale, LaVerne Cox, and Stanley Tucci (along with an end cameo that I won't spoil) try pretty hard to turn it up to 11. But, as Drive-in Movie Critic Joe Bob Briggs used to say, the ever-increasingly complicated plot starts to get in the way of the story. For example, if the CIA was going to appear again to kill that freaky old guy, then why exactly was Lindy's seduction and subsequent assistance needed at all? So this 5/10 gets an extra point because it's fun to see Kate B's face, hear Stanley T's voice, and listen to LaVerne C correctly identify a McLaren by its engine sound. (And yes, I know that the McLaren uses a dual-clutch semi-automatic tranny, not the fully manual (Ferrari?) shift plate, as shown. So sue the director for that one.)",Jolt

I have read other reviews comparing this film to Crank and Atomic Blonde, but not as good. I have yet to see those films, so I don't know.Honestly, I am more curious about the influences or inspirations for both director Tanya Wexler and writer Scott Wascha.The storyline, script and several scenes reminded me of Blade. In the best way. I LOVE BLADE.There were even traces of Tim Burton's Batman and possibly, just possibly a scene from Dumb and Dumber.At any rate, I loved the pacing, the casting and the story. I know Kate has done action before in the Evolution franchise, and sometimes comparing one actress to another may be insulting, however I could also draw a comparison to Keira Knightley in Domino. There is a subtlety in the discovering the person within the character which I enjoyed very much. WATCH THIS MOVIE!",Jolt

73,chris_rowe-881-168820,Fun which most movies lack these days,10,26 July 2021,"A lot of movies these days seem arrogant and miss the whole point of making something for people's entertainment. There's an arrogance and a nepotism that if you know the right people or get the right attention I feel people are pressured into liking things because the cool media and social media are telling you to.This film is fun, feels part crank and part peppermint which was criminally underrated. I cannot believe how amazing she looks, she's what 48? Fair play, I love her character, but vulnerable, bit depressed, fun and a badass, she plays it perfectly.I disagree with the pathetic people saying it should be women beaten up by women, women can be henchmen but it feels for more natural for it to be blokes, it's the norm to be big guys and I think it's fun as if trained right, any size or gender can woop butt. Stop focusing on stuff and making everything political about gender or sexuality etc just be entertained and not an armchair protestor. It's not fair that so many movies get unfair criticism. If you can't watch things now to get lost in the beauty of film or theatre without looking at a new Twitter rant just stop watching things and stay at home! You're not saving the world. Fight for what matters not what you prefer!!!Lastly, I'd say this film is up there with taken, the Jennifer garner revenge film peppermint was another female led badass movie and I genuinely love women in that role when done well, there are so many horrific male led action films. Women add such a beautiful twist because of perception and things only women can do, I find it frustrating these films almost get hate out of spite to people fighting against movements which is nuts.As an entertainment piece this is just brilliant! Keeps you glued, likeable characters, good twists, I like the dark sin city vibes and the comedy twists! Love the idea of the suit as it's actually not a far fetched method of controlling impulses.Too marks should be for films that do what they say on the description and this nails it .",Jolt

While dreaming of an awesome chick fight flick with great one liners , I got the same old market formula film. Beckinsale plays Lindy a woman who cannot control her emotions. Wow that's new. When aggravated her "" hormone imbalance"" causes her to go psycho. Novel. Also , when her boy toy of the minute is killed she loses all grip on reality and investigates his murder street fighter style.Anyone mention to the writer we have seen all this before , along with the uneeded sex scenes. Her co star must have been 15 years younger than her. Every guy I know wants a partner on a pension. Such an obvious stereotyping , suggesting all men are gold diggers right?I honestly believe the director wrote over several portions of the dialogue to include as many penis references as possible. The acting was barely passable. The cops chasing her in this film were so hammy and cliched. How many times have we seen the jerk condescending partner down her male partner while causing more trouble than the suspect. By the way , Mclaren's are all automatics , jus sayin. Or maybe it was an Easter egg of another penis joke we missed.The ham fisted misandrist tones of this film are over the top and it belongs in the 1980s with its Machismo counterparts.

I'm sure the money is great and more than makes you for it.But there was a day when actors were admired and respected for the deep volumes of talent.Now they demand respect without earning it from movies goers who are unmotivated to give them the praise they want, because they just flat out don't deserve it.Hollywood, put down the crack pipe and please start making some quality flicks again.

""You're fired.""
""For what?""
""Your tone.""I mean, you gotta admit that a female bouncer with anger management issues and self administered shock therapy, is ripe for levity. The several scenes with her and her psychiatrist (Tucci), are especially rich.As for cinematography, a superlative example is a shot showing Lindy running directly away from the camera at night, where you basically see her dim, shrinking silhouette with her feet coming down alternatively into a strip of light. It's as entrancing as the deep female tones of Beckinsale's voice.Even the fight scenes were well choreographed (without shakey-cam), and it's actually got a pretty cool non-teenybopper soundtrack.",Jolt

104,TheLegendOfThe42,Another masterpiece of contemporary cinéma!,1,25 October 2021,"Kate Beckinsale stars in this travesty of a movie which has bad writing and incompetent direction written all over it. It is intended to be cool, but fails miserably. It tries to be funny, but fails miserably.Where it doesn't fail at is reiterating the ""men are evil or idiots and women are amazing"" narrative for the umpteenth time, and it does so in a blatantly crude way.Lindy's journey is basically to realize that she needs to shake off her electrical shocker vest (the patriarchy) to savour her righteous rage. What rage, you might ask? Wasn't the big twist that even the apparently good men in her life betrayed her? Didn't all of the revenge thing turn out to be a lie?Well, it's a big experiment, you see? They tested her abilities to see if her ""special gift"" (aka a dangerous disorder) could be harnessed for more interesting purposes. It doesn't matter that innocent people might get hurt or even killed in the process. What matters is that she's amazing. Of course.Some things in this film are downright sexist, but because it's against men, it's absolutely okay. Because, didn't you know - you can't be sexist against men, duh!I'm amazed how studios are going with this narrative, turning off more than half their audience. I for myself am sure I won't be paying to get insulted anymore. And yes, I'm aware that this is included in Amazon Prime, and it still felt like I was ripped off.On a technical level, the film is a mess from beginning to end, shot in obvious studio locations that badly resemble real places. The writing is uninspired and downright insultingly bad at times, the direction can be summed up as ""wanna-be"" - but at least some camera work deserves praise.But so many shots are unmotivated and downright ""wrong"", telling a lot about the director's incompetence when it comes to set the right tone for the scene. Some edits clearly indicate poor scene coverage - usually more of a beginner's mistake.Beckinsale still delivers a decent performance with the ghastly garbage she has to work with, as does Stanley Tucci. Jai Courtney... well, at least he's not in much of the movie.If you like to ride the woke train and don't care about immersion, story-telling or interesting characters, if you like cringy wanna-be coolness and kinda dislike men, this might be for you.

However the dialogue/screenplay is so bad, it feels like a D-list film. The fight scenes weren't satisfying either. You can't even see her face, it's obviously a stunt double. And she moves really slow, it's badly choreographed. The storytelling in the beginning, where they show us her childhood was so badly done, it wasn't a great start... basically gives you an idea of how bad the film is going to be. The ""twist"" was so obvious from the start. The guy was obviously still alive and the villain. You don't cast a well known actor for merely a few scenes and kill him off. It was obviously not a cameo either, so he's obviously gunna show up again in the end of the movie. And his real death was lame too. This film was a waste of time.

112,warren-87235,Make another Underworld!,7,4 August 2021,"Jolt is a fun diversion, but there isn't much substance, either. Kate Beckinsale is great, as always. She plays Lindy, a woman who, for various reasons, has such anger issues combined combat training, that she requires a vest that provides electrical shocks on-demand, to try and control herself. Kate really carries the movie and, without her, this would definitely be a 5 or 6. Her ability to both sell the action and kick posterior, along with her dry delivery, saves it from being totally forgettable.In comparison, I watched 'Nobody' recently as well, which works because it strikes just the right balance between humour and action and violence. Whilst the action is 'okay' in Jolt, it plays in a very standard way. Likewise, the dark humour works, but it's also not enough to compensate.Bobby Cannavale's Detective Vicars helps lighten the atmosphere, but you can't help feeling he needed to be included in events more, to provide an amusing contrast to Lindy. Likewise, their (potentially) budding relationship is one of the more interesting character beats that would have made events more satisfying, especially if this was intended to be a stand-alone movie.Jai Courtney plays Justin, the reason for Lindy going off on a spree of violence and destruction. I'm not a big fan, and he's rather bland, but I must admit his eventual conclusion helps.All in all, it's a diverting bit of action, but the ending lets it down. They clearly want to start a 'John Wick' style franchise, but this isn't really good enough to justify being more than a one-off. They should have embraced that, and given it a more complete and satisfying conclusion.The best thing is that it shows Kate could easily jump back into her Selene costume and do another Underworld!",Jolt

Not least of which is Kate Beckinsale's performance as a professionally insane person. But mostly it's the movie's style and presentation.It's a fun little pizza and beer - film, until the third act happens and it just looses all it's air. Shame, really. The self awareness just dissipates and it turns into a shadow of its previous self, within the same movie.Jolt can be experienced, but hardly rewatched.",Jolt
119,deshan-78580,This Ain't It,4,23 July 2021,"Jolt tries pretty hard to be Crank, Atomic Blonde, and John Wick, but it ends up falling short in most key areas such as poor directing and writing, a plot that could've been quite interesting but ended up being a overcomplicated mess, action scenes ruined by weak choreography and too much quick-edits, and mediocre performances.There are a few redeeming qualities though such as decent cinematography, some cool music, fast pacing, and a pretty good cast lineup.Overall, this was just another bland, generic, and overall forgettable action flick, and I wouldn't really recommend it unless you just wanna burn off 91 minutes of your time & got nothing better to do.",Jolt

Lindy isn't even a government assassin or hitman or ex special forces type. She's just a gal with a severe fictional psychological-physical condition á la Tourette's Syndrome (""Impulsive Explosive Disorder"") trying to lead a normal life with the help of her psychiatrist and his novel electroshock therapy vest. Her martial skills are acquired not by military training but by a lifetime of experimenting with different ways to cope with and manage her disorder.

Laverne Cox,, and Bobby Carnavale, it was a reality-suspended, laws-of-physics agnostic adult animation like production.Two-dimensional characters, bad vs good, and, my favorite, size zero female physique able to dispatch 5 hefty muscly bodyguards without as much as a scratch, a bruise, or anyone getting shot; except one. If they had simply don't a animated version, there would have been less sense of impossibility - as one expects animations to be fantastic.The lead, played by beautiful, fit, quingenarian-close Englishwoman going on 25, was in the emotionless, robotic mode of the vampire-thriller movie series, Underworld.

The humor was kinda good and it had a couple of good action scenes, but there is no real character development beside the main character, almost every scene felt rushed.

That being said, at some point when 100lb woman can beat up 3-4 200-250lb men, it starts to get a little over the top for me.The premise of the movie sound very familiar; anger issue, jolt of power calms her down, else she kicks everyone's butt.I didn't feel like there was a lot of meat on the bone of this movie. You never get a chance to know the characters. The protagonist needed more building in my opinion, so I can have a chance to really like her, this would probably give more depth to her sudden ""super strength"" when fighting people.The good news is Kate is super hot and is getting better with age. She's an amazing actor and does a good job of playing crazy. The bad news is that its not super believable when there's no backstory to support the super strength other than some military type training.The love at first sight type storyline was also a bit off charm for me...

Both the cops in the film where at times bout as smart as a bag of rocks😂sometimes they sorta knew what they where doing. I don't know if it was the bad jokes or what but it was just not doing it.

Or Besson's Lucy, for a kick-ass female protagonist.Glad it was made with a neck snapping pace that it didn't weighted down with melodrama, or rose to power from failure nonsense.Here is another aced franchise for Beckinsale with more day shots and no more dark and dungy underworld.There are some good performance from A-listers - Tucci.",Jolt

Most unbelievable aspect of the film.Why did they let her go near the end if they were just going to kill her anyway? They had her in a kill room, locked down. They let her go. Then they plant the bomb at her apartment.The photography/camera... The hell was that garbage? Dude buys her a camera after he sleeps with her?

I don't think I've seen that so well executed in any other female action films, but I can't say I've seen them all. Great timing on ""upbeat"" banter among characters. The ending was a bit too comic book, ""sequelly"" (a new word for Webster), I think the ending would have been stronger absent the Susan Sarandon part. All made in Bulgaria! Is there a big supply of American actors there? There was a negative criticism about excess suspension of disbelief: Well, Duh! What? If you think this is some sort of realism project, you're going to be sorely disappointed, that's like criticizing Wizard of Oz because the flying monkeys could never dress themselves. As for comparing to Crank, don't. Crank is probably more memorable because it's so extreme and fast-motion, but this actually has subtle uplifting feminist message/or something and shows human vulnerability where not expected.

I believe that people should be given an IQ test before they are allowed to cast their vote on anything. I was very entertained by this film. There is a thing called suspension of disbelief that needs to be utilized in films such as this. I have never understood the need for people to go out of their way to say they didn't like something. This is the reason that TV shows like Firefly get canceled. Because it's more of those with severe idiocy that go out of their way to say they hate something. Even the most horrible film on the face of the planet deserves more than one star just for the mere fact they had a cast and crew and a budget and a will to make some sort of Art. 20 years ago this would have been the best movie ever made but now people are so desensitized things that are good that they have to hate it. The problem is with most things they don't hate the movie they hate themselves. It's like when someone says they read a book and it sucked. The actual reality is they suck. I've never read a book that sucked. Because you are the narrator, it's your voice and your imagination that takes you to great places a book allows you to go. But if you don't have a good narrator and you don't have a good imagination then of course the book is going to suck. It's no different with the movies.

Or, like my favorite Bond trick where he sneaks into the criminal masterminds lair and walks around unnoticed, peeks around corners, steps back as guards walk right past him. Well, Lindy our hero does a lot of things such as walk into a police station and manage to get into the evidence room. Yeah, right. But, if you get past silly stuff like that, it's an OK movie. Not one I would pay to see in a theater but it came free with my Amazon Prime, there's a pandemic, I'm retired with nothig to do so I spent 90 minutes watching this.The number one reason I even bothered to watch it was I absolutely love Kate Beckinsale AND Stanley Tucci. Tucci by far is one of the most underrated actors around.If you're looking for Casablanca or Gone with The Wind, don't bother it's not a film, it's a movie. A fairly decent movie.

That there might be some degree of depth beneath the beauty.But it's not and there isn't.So if you enjoy looking at the beautiful Kate Beckinsale then you'll certainly enjoy a part of this movie.But by the end of the movie you might walk out thinking who needs another Femme Nikita?,Jolt

It will be banned all across the world, and i agree but for both sides.Back to the technical sides, Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress and she's a master of these types of characters.Combat scenes are dope and brutal i loved them specially with the sound tracks effects it's even harder.In the end i would say that .. the movie is fine and it would add some action to your night but don't expect this to be the female John Wick.",Jolt

Security guards don't behave that way, CIA doesn't behave that way, I feel the director has never read a history book on the characters he was creating, and it really ruined the enjoyment of the film, because at heart, it was a neat premise.",Jolt

209,deepc185,It had so much potential,6,25 July 2021,"This movie had a lot of positives going for it - humor, action, an interesting character, and a fun premise. Unfortunately, what it didn't have was good writing and/or directing. The story moved along at such a fast pace that it was uninteresting and ridiculous. Lindy falls for a guy after what amounts to a walk through the city with a quick fast food dinner and a night of supposedly amazing sex. This alone is enough to turn a woman with an admitted inability to form emotional bonds into a woman willing to track down, maim and kill people who were responsible for the death of her date. Throw in a cop who can immediately recognize that she's really a good person who just happens to have extremely violent tendencies and trusts her to the point that he's willing to ignore her numerous attacks on his partner, a teenager with computer skills that not only allow her to hack into a locked phone in less than 10 seconds, as well as pull information from the internet faster than most people can open up a Google search, and Lindy's own abilities to track down the people responsible with no real leads in spite of her lack of any type of experience or investigative skills. To add insult to injury, both cops are completely willing to ignore the boatload of violent felonies she committed, because they knew she was a good person who only did what needed to be done. It just makes for a disappointing experience.Again, it's not horrible. I really liked Lindy's character, and I would have loved to see more of her relationship with her therapist play out in the film. It might also have been interesting to see more of a relationship build between her and the cop instead of the half assed attempt we got. And would it have killed the writers to make her work just a little bit to track down the bad guys?The movie was the cinematic equivalent of a nip slip. There's so much more that you want to see, and although you feel a tingle of excitement from what you got, that's all you are ever going to get.",Jolt
210,MoviePeek,Fun but not much more,5,15 October 2021,"Jolt stars Kate Beckinsale as Lindy, a feisty independent woman with a unique disorder that makes her lash out in unrestrained bouts of violence at anything that irritates her. We've all been in restaurants and had to endure some wide-mouthed moron chewing too loudly or been infuriated by other drivers' refusal to use their oh so helpful and necessary indicators, and wanted to take them by the scruff of the neck and toss them into a wheelie bin filled with leftovers from that uninviting Indian takeaway down the round that you never go to. The only difference with Lindy is that her violent fantasies are more than that and she must act upon them, the only way apparently to prevent this is with the help of a special shock jacket equipped with a handy hand-operated button that is able to deliver a painful does of electricity throughout her body and prevent any violent episodes.Lindy's otherwise isolated and melancholy life is changed when she meets Justin, a kind and caring accountant, who is able to look past her unique set of circumstances and love Lindy for who she is. But Lindy's newfound joy doesn't last long as Justin is murdered, and in her grief, Lindy takes it upon herself using her unique abilities to find those responsible and avenge Justin's death.Now if the premise of the film you are about to watch includes the phrase 'special shock jacket', you know the following feature presentation is going to be a little silly, Jolt however isn't a little silly; is outright daft. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, in fact, the film channels this daftness in interesting and unexpected ways delivering some fun action scenes and cartoonish spectacle. Most importantly of all Jolt knows that it's silly B-movie fun, and the film never slows down to a crawl or takes itself too seriously as so many silly films so often do. No Jolt is a brisk and breezy action film with a dash of comedy and all it wants to do is entertain you. In this regard Jolt succeeds and given that the film is free to watch for all Amazon Prime subscribers, the experience is a pleasant enough one to have piped directly into your living room and is worth giving a try if you have a free evening.However, this tone is a double-edged sword, while the film may be fun, it's little more than that. Let's start with the characters, first up is the high-heeled rage ball herself, Lindy. Lindy's best moments are when she allows herself to be vulnerable and show her many flaws and weaknesses, the scenes featuring her, and her therapist are some of the most compelling as Lindy becomes more complex and interesting.But, for the majority of the film, Lindy is a kung-fu quip vending machine that would put Tony Stark, or any other Joss Whedon characters to shame. While this can be entertaining towards the back half of the film it becomes somewhat tiresome and grating, frequently reducing the tension and deflating the stakes.Again, this is essentially a film about a woman how has to electrocute herself to stop herself from punching anyone who rubs her the wrong way, so it feels like a somewhat fruitless exercise to point out plot holes or things that didn't make sense. Oh, of course, there are. If you went into this experience with a critical eye, every ten minutes or so there will be something or someone that will make you pause and exclaim - 'huh?'. Let's just say that the script is not the film's strength, it's the action scenes and spectacle where Jolt feels like it's firing on all cylinders and having a blast.Jolt is a very silly movie the kind of movie that makes you think, 'huh? I'm sorry what the hell is going on?', but dumb as a bag of rock it may be, it's also brisk and a surprising amount of film. The screenplay is never going to win any awards, it's probably more suited for wrapping fish and chips in but it knows what it is. The only major strike against the film is the unnecessary sequel tease at the end that leaves a somewhat sour taste in the mouth and almost makes me wish I had a special mumbo jumbo science jacket that I could shock myself with so I could forget it. Jolt is a fun albeit shallow distraction that provides a decent amount of entertainment, but not much else.",Jolt

It was believable in Underworld because Selene was a vampire and you could attribute her skills to supernatural powers.

Add in a high speed chase at 30mph and there is still a car crash of a plot.

231,MrHomerJay,Embarrassment for everyone involved. An unfunny sort of a bad movie.,1,27 July 2021,"Writer and director never made an action movie before and it shows. The entire runtime is chore to sit through as a result.Primary issue is that the movie has no positive characters for us to root for. Absolutely character in this movie including extras is just the worst person, including our protagonist. Despite the debilitating condition she supposedly deals with it never shows up at inconvenient times throughout the movie past the introduction. It's used only as a power up at perfect times.The movie does a lot of ""tell"" instead of show. The characters aren't developed at all, we just hear about them and then they show up. We never even see the antagonist do a single bad thing; we just hear that he does them.The plot is moronic, events happen because the plot needs them to not because it makes sense. This requires characters having to behave unnaturally and stupid. When dealing with difficult tasks, they are accomplished off screen.The protagonist is equally stupid, she makes no plans, does no reconnaissance or any preparation at all, doesn't verify any information she receives. She just goes directly to the bad guy's strongholds and things work out.Worst of all, she has no character arc. She's the same person through out and nothing changes from start to the end. The message being ""Girl, you are perfect just the way you are, and you don't need to change a thing"".Pacing is atrocious, important things are rushed or skipped. Other unnecessary scenes linger.Fight choreography is horrible. She dispatches her enemies so quickly there's never any suspense. It's very basic just punches and kicks. In some scenes you can see the stunt double is significantly taller and bulkier than Beckinsale.This movie is just horrible, spare yourself the experience.",Jolt

Another Amazon prime made film rushed out with a decent cast that fails to deliver in a t8m3 when actors are a little worse off.God knows where this is supposed to be set as the cars and buildings say one thing, but the accents quite another. How the lead is supposed to be extra strong and quick and able to climb 15 stories in a ninja warrior style trial, can beat up 3 (very shabby looking) bare knuckle fighters but still gets taken out by the occasional blow to the head by someone the same size as her is all very strange. There's also directorial decisions that make it seem like an advert break is due.It's a mess but can't blame the pulled together cast for taking the money in these times. The biggest worry is it's set up for volume II (which we will of course watch because Beckinsale is in it...) but there really shouldn't be. See all the Crank mentions in other reviews to get an idea of how much a sequel would be welcome. (Hint: not at all).",Jolt

The writer sometimes had a problem on what set's Lindy off. Sometimes she could be touched by strangers sometimes she couldn't.But the biggest problem I had was with Justin (Jai Courtney). I had to watch the end twice, because I was searching for a reason Justin was such a sadistic ahole to Lindy. I can kinda understand his motivation for her being the fallgirl(but that was sketchy), but no reason for making her the fallgirl and throwing her face in it. It seemed the writer knew Justin should be a bad guy because of all the movies the writer has seen in his past, but just forgot that crucial piece of info.",Jolt

Though it would have served it better to really go for the extremes the same way Crank did.It's entertaining enough, with a script that had some fun ideas and turns, but most of the good stuff was underdeveloped.

And Jolt delivers that in spades.Admittedly, the plot is thinner than a ladder in sheer stockings, but as with Kate, also a 2021 release, who cares? It's entertaining, and I do love Kate Beckinsale's ability to kick behind while spewing profanities in that cultured accent.Also, thank all the goddesses that Lindy doesn't constantly wear high heels. Looks like Kate Beckinsale's become rather enamoured of those chunky boots she wears in Underworld, and no wonder. Much easier to move in them, for one.Plus, Stanley Tucci and Bobby Cannavale!

I will say, the photography is gorgeous at times. The flyover shots are carbon copies of the same type of shots in The Dark Knight (down to the same angle lens), but eh, it works.The lighting of some scenes is very nicely balanced. They were going for the John Wick look. If only they had taken a moment to emulate the cleverness of the script and quality of the acting. Not to mention to fight scene choreography.The use of stunt doubles for the lead actress here is atrocious and reminded me of that crappy 90s Mortal Kombat TV show. During many of the fight scenes, our heroine is shown from behind, conveniently fully clothed, with a totally different body type and body movement and wearing a bad wig. It's ridiculous and the funniest thing about the movie (which is sad, considering it's trying really hard to be funny).Amazon and Netflix churn out these low effort knock off films as if they're trying to be the new Asylum studios, and anyone paying for this stuff should be ashamed.",Jolt

It's full of overused tropes, unnecessary and even gross vulgarity, and questionable plot devices.I think people should excuse the nonsense of her fighting abilities because they are explained pretty thoroughly, even though you don't actually see how she is able to do what she does.Every single scene involving cops breaks EVERY rule in the book.

After that the film does much better at pacing and style to where hopefully more will love it than hate for what it is. Also - one HUGE star down for making firefighters look like idiots and drunk kids playing with garden hoses - which is a huge pet peeve of mine - seriously please stop putting that into these films.

Full of terribly obvious writing, late 90s cliches, awful bland 'energetic' music; it's absolutely terrible. Think the 2003 Daredevil film but worse. Much worse. Kate Beckinsale's casting seems off too but she does her best.",Jolt

It has a bit of everything - love, drama, action, comedy, blood, fights and more. The acting is good, the soundtrack is awesome, the cinematography is superb. Kate Beckinsale is amazing - great acting again, looks gorgeous and her accent is so adorable. I haven't watched such an entertaining flick in a long time.",Jolt

The trailer promised a lot ... but the movie disappoints.,1,24 July 2021,"I suppose their intention was to make a feminist ""John Wick"" with a lot of action, but they went through stupid and nonsense dialogues, which add absolutely nothing good to the storyline.

I expect something closer to 7 would be accurate.The twist ending and the extra twist were refreshing. I can't help but think it was at some point a pilot for a series. Detective, cop, and techie sidekick would make for a good show, though the shadow organization makes it a bit difficult to know how they'd architect that.I'm not sure it's worth a second view, but it was good to see Kate back to work.I especially appreciated the mid-credits scene, even if it was largely unrelated to the plot.",Jolt

321,alfrandell,this misunderstood film is the start of something. I have already watched it twice.,8,26 September 2021,"Kate is pretty much the new Angelina. No disrespect to AJ, who is making important movies now.Both of these actresses are able to add an aditional layer to a film.This is what is needed to create an action flick that laughes at itself.Most reviewers treat this film as a violent war movie that is trying to tell an important historical story.It is clearly not that. It is funny because the charactors seem to know that they are in a movie. They themselves are reacting to the absurdity, and having fun with it. It is comic book eye candy that is made to distract the viewer from a world wide epidemic. It does not seek to worry the viewer, or to give them some important takeaway.Will i delete this film?No way! I will want to watch it again and again, expecially after Kate has made other films.I do not have much idea what Tarentino is really like as a person, but have a hankering to see KB get into one of those rediculous roles.The best movies are often the least understood.",Jolt

There's Nothing else like it (some people mention crank) this is nothing at all like that movie. I guess they think the titles are too much alike. But I don't think the writers of this movie had ""Crank"" on their mind at all. You'll be satisfied if you are looking for a new movie to relax and watch during your free time. Stop picking apart movies and enjoy fresh ideas instead of remakes and sequels. 6.5 stars for me 🍻",Jolt

This film is taking the old cliches for a spin and spices it up with bold dialogues that flow effortlesly. Great antidote for all the other films about female superheroes now (not gonna say any names). Female anger is still a taboo in the cinema as it is in our society and it had to be labelled a 'disorder' to be shown but how many times a day an average woman wants to give back to the manspreader on the subway, to the catcaller who ruins your day, to the guy in the car shouting what he'd do... ?

The acting is generally good, even though there are some actors that seem to be wasted in their respective parts.I am not going into a full review, but suffice to say that it does live up (or should I say down?) to its name, meaning that it actually is a mishmash of other movies' ideas strung together by a rather dismal (mostly studio) decor.There is definite potential here and there is most certainly room for a sequel, so I really hope they do a much better job next time.",Jolt

Definitely a flick where you should enjoy the film that the trailers put forth as an action/thriller spiced up with some comedy. Kate Beckinsale delivers the dialogue and story as if the script kisses her bum, time and time again. Jai Courtney is one of those underrated actors who is very versatile in the roles he is given and even for the short time given in front of the camera, man does he deliver.

Kate Beckinsale is a super woman of action and humor in this movie that is begging for a sequel!Not too over the top unrealistic actions, but enough to say wow, pow and I want more!. She is plagued by inner-demon with an uncontrollable impulse to give the unjust some physical f@ckin' pain of justice.With some self-administered shock treatment to cope with her impulsive outrage, she's soon swoon over by a love interest, and then life takes a turn, and now she's out for justice.",Jolt

The premise is interesting in theory and I think they could have made something of it but this is not it.I felt absolutely zero connection with any of the characters and there was such minimal character development and storyline that I struggled to even watch half of the movie.

We care if the action fits the story, how well done that vengeance streak is played out, how many times we get to chuckle at the dialogue, and how it ends. Beckinsdale does a spectacular job in yet another action flick, and I had to wonder, how old is she? She's been around for a long time and she looks mid 30s and holds her end in the fight scenes. 48. So, going on this, gonna go out on a limb and suggest that her and Charlize are the reigning action women.A great movie to watch on the treadmill or whatever you're using to try and keep yourself in Beckinsdale's shape.",Jolt

371,clairepeleschka,So very bad,2,28 July 2021,"I finally finished it after the 4th attempt and it did not get any better the more it went on. Kate Bekinsale has proven that acting is not her strong point. Jai Courtney has proven that viewers need to steer clear of anything that he's in for longer than 4 minutes and Susan Sarandon & Stanley Tucci must have been in some Covid induced delusion to sign up.I appreciate a good switch off, don't think and enjoy bit of fluff film but this film is just bad. Acting = awful. Plot = actually a potentially good idea but sadly what was delivered was awful. Script & delivery = really quite painful.But if you want to watch a woman that weighs about 4 stone walk around in 10 inch heels attempting to look 'ard then you'll probably love it.",Jolt

I absolutely hated the female cop and how the character was written. A lot of forced situations. Also they kept saying they're in US but they were 💯 in London.... Fight scenes with Kate are epic especially in the hospital which I found to be the funniest! This movie proves that you can be one of the best actors and portray your character beautifully and the movie is still not good. I gave a 7 rating just because of Kate.,Jolt

Could have been a 4 due to Kate.. but.. it's that bad.The plot was poor, the acting not so great, sets? Were there any?No connection felt to any characters, I've seen better acting on 5th year school plays.Was it set in London or the USA ? Really couldn't tell. Editing was woeful, car scenes crazy stupid... over all a big shame.I can always tell if a film is worthy of watching. If I can wander off whilst it's on, do the washing up and return not pausing or rewinding, it's a 3.Actually.. I'm now in 41 mins.. and it's almost going down to a 2...
THAT BAD.Poor shame.",Jolt
382,lcurci-39649,Boring,1,23 July 2021,"I will spare a long post. I agree with majority of the above reviews. The previews looked awesome. However, no connection with any character, while her fight scenes are cool, I have to agree she weighs 90lbs beating ups dudes bc of anger issues. Very disappointing I love all the actors in this. The humor really isn't that great. I don't find the one liners funny.",Jolt
383,TruemanJr,Girl Power!!!,4,24 July 2021,"The premise was cool the execution was poor.Without going into what it could have been, it just ended up being about a witty girl who gets mad and beats up all the guys yeaahh! No.Can we stop with the feminism movies?Something to just have on, no big deal type movie.",Jolt
384,link-63673,Still looking for some kind of story,3,24 July 2021,"Kate is playing her role good, but there were more interesting secondary character, that got very little of space in the story line.I normaly like trash movies to laugh about but nothing to laugh about was to find here. Better same your time on this one, because it's more a bit of popcorn movie.",Jolt
385,danielvernblomberg,"A thrill ride, a bit unrealistic but so fun.",8,24 July 2021,"Sometimes you need to overlook a few things to enjoy a movie. Plot holes? It's got them. Unrealistic decisions by the characters? Check. But somehow, it also endeared me to the characters and held my attention, two things that are near impossible while my phone is nearby. Eagerly awaiting the sequel!",Jolt
386,conit-21197,I liked it.,9,24 July 2021,Somewhat different. Entertaining. I liked it despite what others say. Better than some of the other stuff on tv these days.,Jolt
387,dxgqfgxy,Don't waste your time,1,25 July 2021,Big fan of Kate but they tried too hard on a horrible script. Great I LOVE Kate Beckinsale but Jolt is awful... Is this action? Drama? Some depressed story? Total disappointment.,Jolt
388,frederikholle,Way better than 5.5,9,25 July 2021,"Normal you regred watching a 5.5, but this is way better. For that suprise i give 9 Stars.",Jolt
389,bertrampaul,Boring Movie with bad story line for people who like Kate Beckinsale,2,26 July 2021,"The plot is quite simple:A slim woman kills everything that provokes her. A scientist has built a power vest that allows her to turn off the urge to kill. She meets a seemingly boring guy who accepts her unusual nature. The guy is then ""killed"" and she gives free run to her aggression and in revenge for her one night stand throws babies through the air at a policewoman, kills the highest mafia bosses and infiltrates alone a building in that not even the FBI dares to enter, by climbing a 200m wall with heels. She takes out a few guys who easily weigh 3 times as much as she does, but can still be thrown through the air by her. There, in a horribly presented plot twist, the guy shows up again and it turns out he used her to kill the bad guy. She puts herself over the otherwise effective vest for whatever reason and blasts the former lover away with a piece of c4 which she had in her backpack unharmed during the whole intrusion into the building. In the end, the film is given an open ending instead of a simple ""healed and happy on Haweii"" ending. Now you don't know what happens next and have to watch a second weird movie.In summary, the film is only for people who like the actress.",Jolt
390,petehill-39612,It's Kate B,6,29 July 2021,"Come on!It's Kate Beckinsake, she is impossibly hot with a posh English accent doing what Kate B does!Just take your brain out, drool, and be entertained. No Oscars here but it's fun and to repeat, she is hot!Back and think.",Jolt
391,mlaprade-31641,Very entertaining,10,30 July 2021,"All these ""highbrows"" who gave this movie a low rating have given up on just being entertained.I enjoyed the movie. So what if some found it to be predictable....
I liked the premise and the characters. Overall a nice way to spend 90 minutes.",Jolt
392,craigkelly-50178,Action packed & cheeky bit of fun film,8,31 July 2021,"Thought the cast we great.A good little watch to be honest, take it at face value with action pack & cheeky but of fun.I like it's not taking itself too seriously while feeling decent quality.Far as I know the concept is kinda unique & it's got a vivid vibe throughout visually.",Jolt
393,vonbandit,Boring and weak story,2,4 August 2021,"I do not get why this movie has an average rating: it is absolutely horrible. Weak dialogues, boring and predictable. Find another movie to watch or waste your time starring into a wall instead.",Jolt
394,peachypaula-20630,Great film,8,13 August 2021,"I don't understand all the poor reviews.We watched this with no great expectations. We never heard of it, seen reviews or watched a preview before hand.Fantastic film which is well worth a watch. Can't say its like anything I watched before but I can see how comments comparing to crank have come about.",Jolt
395,schuntshunty,Funny action film we enjoyed it!,8,22 August 2021,Read some of the comments to the review of this. All I can say some of these people who rated this film poor have no sense of humour! It's funny action packed film don't belive the rating number.,Jolt
396,alexvirr,"Sexy, sassy and a lot of fun",7,8 September 2021,"Decent performances, well scripted and great energy make Jolt an enjoyable watch. It's well written, well cast and well acted. The plot's a little woolly around the edges but overall a highly entertaining movie with lots to love and little to complain about. Beckinsale, on gorgeous form, nails it as the angry, sassy protagonist hroughout and I think this is better than a lot of the other pulp action movies knocking around. For me Jolt was a refreshing take on a fun genre.",Jolt
397,fargokeith,GREAT MOVIE,9,25 July 2021,Kate was awesome in the movie. I think it was not quite violent enough for me. The acting I thought was very good.,Jolt
398,burakzdner,I like it!,7,25 July 2021,"It was fun and action... I dont understand bad comments.. what do you expect?! Kate is so good and cool, and i'm realy happy for her to get herself free the underworld series... This movie realy suits her...",Jolt

400,bradhollis,Should be a series,6,11 August 2021,"I started watching this not even looking at the 1 Hr 31 Min in the description. I was watching and thinking, this could be a fun show to watch since Prime has completely stopped putting anything worth watching on. I just finished it and realized it was just a movie. A movie with an ending that had me expecting the next episode. And I would have watched it too. It was entertaining. I have a various mixture of tastes in shows and movies. I mean from one extreme to the other. Like it said, it was entertaining, but gave it a lower rating because of the wide open ending. But if ya have a free hour and a half, it filled the time nicely.",Jolt
401,melodyaim,Its a Masterpiece after all,10,24 July 2021,"Well, Do not wait too long, it is not art, it does not change lives, it is simply a great action movie with a protagonist who hates everything (like everyone else) with the particularity that she dares to put people in their place. Involuntary comedy, punches, a simple story, what else does it take to have a good time?",Jolt
402,SailorDK,"""CRANK"" - Light, like a diet Coke but without caffeine",6,2 August 2021,"It's quite fun, I loved the bantering, the wierd and almost believable acting... It was harmless fun, and I could switch off my brain for some time.I give it 6 because it's too silly to get anything less, or more... It's good silly action, plot holes, bad acting and so forth... But I liked it.",Jolt
403,mikeyc-333-145926,Very disappointing,2,24 July 2021,The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is for the number of babies tossed in this movie. Stanley Tucci was the only actor that didn't feel like a piece of cardboard and the rest was disappointing. The opening scene explaining the background dragged on wayy to long and that's when I knew something was amuck. Everything felt forced and I really didn't enjoy this as much as I tried to. I went in just hoping for a Kate Beckinsale can of whoopass akin to John Wick and was thoroughly disappointed.,Jolt
404,ipsen-peter,Incoherent mess DOA,4,28 July 2021,"Story; you dont care anyway and feels like a rushed excuse for a 2 movie (franchise ???). Kates ok but clearly struggeling with a weak script and a non existing backstory. ACTION; mehhh - i have seen reviews comparing to a female John Wick !!,! The car chase is a JOKE, fight scenes somewhat watchable but NOT beleiveable. NO, this is not worthy of your time..runningtime 90 min or not.",Jolt

408,billcoop18,its alright,6,10 August 2021,"It has lots of plots holes and scenes that make you question the factual integrity or how things should really play out. It wouldn't surprise me if this movie was shot out of order. Dialogue at times seemed off. This film could not decide whether it was a superhero movie or a to real life movie. They kept riding that fine line making it seem really corny. The cast of actors was great. Another good thing about it was that the story telling was good enough to keep you interested and at the edge of your seat anticipating her next action scene. A six is a fair rating i would say. If you like Kate Beckinsale, then most likely you will enjoy this movie very much.",Jolt
409,chasedavidroach,Better than reviews let on,9,25 July 2021,"At least a 7 by anyone's standard, I loved it so gave it a 9. Hope to see a sequel!",Jolt
410,angiemar602,Female John Wick but to the point,10,24 July 2021,If John Wick can get 9 out of 10 stars there is no reason this female-led movie can't. The only difference is this movie actually got straight to the point instead of wasting endless hours.,Jolt
411,Surferpi,Better than most movies out there,7,29 July 2021,"John wick probably not, however Kate Beckinsale always delivers a solid performance. I believe this movie is suppose to be more towards entertaining
than a solid plot,
I enjoyed it, and would watch the sequel, if they decide to go that direction.",Jolt
412,eefox-92366,Funny and entertaining,9,24 July 2021,"Ok...suspend disbelief and just enjoy an entertaining film. Its not any stupider than the Wick films, but just as much fun. Pretty good cast too. Beckensale is fine, as usual, and will surely be back for ""Jolt II"". Looking forward to it.",Jolt
413,dilutral,Fun action flick,8,9 September 2021,"Had a blast with this fast paced action film. Interesting set up, great action set pieces, a few nice surprises and some laughs. Movie was shot beautifully. I enjoyed it and totally recommend it.",Jolt
414,zombiekidph,Really?,1,25 July 2021,"Crank did this better. This was so full of cringe it wasn't even funny. And she was in underworld. Stupid jokes, stupid action,characters you don't care about. Awful soundtrack. Watched it on a board Sunday but I wish I would have cleaned out my cat litter box instead. Hopefully peppermint is better I want to watch that I think I'll just watch atomic blonde again instead.",Jolt
415,cfederova,Hilarious and actioned packed,10,28 September 2021,"Not sure why this movie did not get the raved reviewed it should have. I thought this was absolutely hilarious.Beckinsale is known for her action packed roles, and this was no different. Simple story line of a woman trying to make her life normal dealing with a lifetime of severe anger issues in a bizarre way. It is full of dry humour and sarcasm, downright hilarious. Fellow aussie Jai Courtney has always portrayed great roles. This movie has twists, humour, great special effects.Great headliners including Stanley Tucci. Perhaps us aussies get dry humour more, haven't enjoyed and laughed that hard for a movie in a long time. Definitely worth watching.",Jolt

419,mbrasuell,Regarding all the low reviews,8,26 July 2021,"I thought this was extremely well done. Kate Beckinsale's performance I thought was really right on point she's normally a little bit aloof for me, but she really had a really hard emotional reaction in this.To say that the plot is unrealistic is very stupid to me. This is a movie, it is a fiction. No one says that the Lord of the Rings is unrealistic because it's a fantasy. Great action fun premise and really enjoyable. Don't take the advice from one star people.",Jolt
420,drewisamus,She's beautiful but the movie is meh,5,25 July 2021,It's worth watching if you're a fan of Kate because she's beautiful in this film. The film itself is just ok.,Jolt
421,angeladantonio,Just relax and enjoy.,8,23 July 2021,"My subject line says it all. People need to remember what movies were made for to begin with: entertainment. Simple entertainment. Stop being so darn critical. Oh, and enjoy Kate doing what she does best. This is a yummy movie from beginning to end. So pop that corn and kick back to relax and turn off your brain for an enjoyable easy-to-watch 90 minute flick on a day off from the constant rush of the world.",Jolt
422,ingecolje,Good movie,10,4 November 2021,Loved to see bad ass woman kick some ass. 10/10. Everyone should watch this movie. Some good woman power! Would love to see more movies like this. A woman who runs the world.,Jolt
423,mitchellleigh,Not a bad movie.,10,26 July 2021,I wouldn't give jolt a ten but I think it deserves more praise than it has. Not a bad movie!It has character to be better if they continue to make more. Girl power resolute's through the movie.Kate beckinsale or however you spell it is absolutely beautiful! So it's worth it just watching her.,Jolt

What little lines she had all seemed forced with no flow what so ever, came across as very unlikeable, which could be the writing , but I don't think so. The janitor from Hogwarts was another strange character, odd lines and strange performance, get past these two and pretty good way to kill a few hours.",Jolt
