0,TheLittleSongbird,Overlong but hugely enjoyable fantasy adventure.,7,19 March 2009,"I was actually worried when I saw the casting for Hook, but I watched it anyway. It is enjoyable, but I've seen better. Robin Williams is very likable and surprisingly good, but I personally wouldn't have picked him for Peter. Kevin Kline would have been a better choice. Julia Roberts is okay as Tinkerbell, but she has been better. Stealing the show, in a wonderfully pantomime performance as Captain Hook, is an unrecognisable Dustin Hoffmann, believe it or not. His performance was that good, that I was appalled that it wasn't nominated. He's not the first actor to be seriously robbed of an award.Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption? Tim Curry in Legend and It? John Hurt in The Elephant Man? Bob Hoskins was amiable, and the music by John Williams was very good, but not his best score. The plot is simple but well-told, if marred by overlong and unnecessary sequences with the Lost Boys that were sadly poorly handled. The film's main merit, aside from Hoffmann's performance is the art direction, beautiful sets and lovely costumes, particularly the brief underwater scene with the mermaids. The part with Maggie singing on the boat deck was heart-rending, and the scene where Peter suddenly remembers everything was touching. Above all, every scene with Hook and Smee was extremely entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it very much, but the film lacked magic. All in all, a slightly disappointing but fun and under-appreciated film, that is a 7/10 from me. Bethany Cox",Hook
1,bkoganbing,Pan Is Back,9,17 April 2009,"Purportedly Steven Spielberg is not happy with the end product of Hook. I'm at a loss to know why because I think it's an absolutely charming fantasy, using his own peculiar take on the Peter Pan story and extending it.Robin Williams as Peter Banning is a hard driving lawyer with a wife and two children Caroline Goodall, Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott respectively. He was an orphan kid who married the granddaughter of Wendy Darling who was Sir James M. Barrie's inspiration for the Peter Pan tale.But it's all real, Robin Williams doesn't know he's Peter Pan who left Never Never Land for reasons you'll discover in the film. But he left one nasty enemy there in Captain Hook and Hook captures his children to lure him back to Never Never Land where Hook can take vengeance upon him.Spielberg got some great performances out of his cast which also includes Julia Roberts as the elfin Tinkerbell and Maggie Smith as the aged Wendy. But stealing the film completely in one bravura performance is Dustin Hoffman. Captain Hook is one of those fabulous roles where the actor can just feast on the scenery and can just go to town with it. It's a role that it is impossible to overact in. I doubt if Dustin Hoffman ever enjoyed himself more in making a film.Hook got five Oscar nominations in the technical categories, but sad to say did not win anything in 1991. I'm surprised that one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator films beat Hook out for Best Visual Effects, this one is clearly superior in that department if anything.Robin Williams has his innings as well, trying to remember his past as Peter Pan and get back into Pan like behavior to defeat Captain Hook. As to why he left Never Never Land in the first place. Let's just say he took one too many trips outside his domain and something happened to him that happens to all young men at some point.Hook is a great piece of family entertainment from Steven Spielberg and Dustin Hoffman's fans will really enjoy it.",Hook
2,Leofwine_draca,A real mess,2,29 September 2018,"HOOK is undoubtedly one of Steven Spielberg's worst ever films and a movie that encapsulates everything bad about the director. This overblown rubbish has little to do with the source material, which is almost unrecognisable amid an overlong, overwritten story about father/son relationships (as per usual for Spielberg). An overaged Robin Williams mugs for all his worth and comes across as intensely irritating, and of course is completely miscast as Pan - the boy who could supposedly never grow old. Elsewhere, you get a pantomime turn from Dustin Hoffmann (nowhere near as effective as Alan Rickman in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES), Bob Hoskins as the sole saving grace Smee, a typically unlikeable Julia Roberts, huge dollops of sentimentality, cheesy, dated special effects, and uninteresting action. A real mess of a film, in other words.",Hook
3,SnoopyStyle,"Horribly fake sets, and Spielberg killed Peter Pan",4,28 September 2013,"Peter Pan (Robin Williams) had returned to the real world, married to Wendy's granddaughter, and became a father too busy for his kids. One night Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children, and Peter must return to Neverland with Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts). With the help of her and the Lost Boys, he remembers how to be Peter Pan again in order to battle Captain Hook and save his kids.The sets are big, interior, and artificial. Spielberg uses all his powers to make a big production out of it. He pours all his years of movie-making skills into this. But the magic is all gone. Although it makes a great Vegas hotel decoration.But Spielberg's biggest sin is making Peter Pan grow up. He's the boy who never grows up. Apparently Spielberg missed that part of the mythology. Are we watching his psychotherapy session here? Is Spielberg the real Peter Pan? Is he rediscovering his childhood? Too deep. Too deep.The same can be said about Robin Williams. Is he trying to reclaim his childhood after getting clean from drugs? Again too deep. Too deep. The joy is just gone. Peter Pan starts off grumpy and we have to watch him find the joy that's missing. Why is joy so much work?",Hook
4,Hitchcoc,Fizzles at the End With Kid Movie Clichés,6,30 December 2016,"This movie starts with a rather odd premise, taking J. M. Barrie's characters into the future. This presents challenges to a kind of magical situation that had closure. So Hook, still feeling revenge against Peter Pan, decides to do the ultimate evil, the kidnapping of his children. Neverland still exists and seems to be rather a thriving little metropolis. Hook hold sway. The Lost Boys are still lost, doing the usual dumb things to each other. One Peter (Robin Williams) gets there, he needs to re-establish his position as leader. One of the other boys has taken over and there needs to be a confrontation before they can get on with the business of rescuing the kids. OK. Fine. But once again, there are the usual food fights and juvenile lowest common denominator jokes to appeal to an audience that has already seen this stuff a million times. The conclusion is sketchy at best and has almost no suspense. Also, Julia Roberts fitting around is really tiresome. It's just a very expensive and not very original movie. Lots of eye candy with little underlying substance.",Hook
5,mark.waltz,Almost completely hooked with the exception of a few lost moments.,6,11 October 2017,"The legend of Peter Pan goes way beyond the play that James Barrie wrote in the early 1900's and has been performed mostly in the 1950's musical version that has been filmed several times for TV. Few plays not only get produced as much as this has, but along with prequels, sequels and dramatized studies of how it was created, it is even a far greater dramatized children's tale than ""The Wizard of Oz"". For this 1991 Steven Spielberg smash hit, the sequel (or ""fantasy follow up"" which I prefer) takes place many years after the original play occurred, and deals with an aging lady named Wendy (Maggie Smith in one of her sweetest performances) who is rumored to be the original, even if the tale is only indeed a legend. She is being honored for her philanthropy for finding homes for orphaned boys, and her grandson-in-law (Robin Williams) is one of them. He's a hard nosed lawyer, too devoted to his career to pay much attention to his wife and young children, but flying to London to see the woman who found a home for him get this award shows that in spite of all that, he's got a soft spot somewhere inside his prickly personality.While there, strange things start happening. Granny Wendy has a seemingly senile brother (the adorable Arthur Malet) who keeps looking for his lost marbles, and a big sheepdog buries Williams' cellphone which his wife threw out of the window after confronting him over his angry outburst towards his children for interrupting a business conversation. During Smith's award ceremony, sudden winds burst open the sleeping children's giant windows, and when the group returns home, Williams finds a note from the alleged Captain Hook who wants one last showdown with his old rival Peter Pan. This leads Smith to reveal the truth, that Williams is indeed the aging Peter Pan, having abandoned Neverland to marry her granddaughter and turning into the grown-up he always resented. Thanks to wise- cracking Tinker Bell (a perky Julia Roberts), Williams ends up back in Neverland where the lost boys, at first not believing that this paunchy middle aged man could be their beloved pal Peter, put him through the rigorous exercise of being able to recapture what he's lost so he can reclaim his children from Hook (a delightful Dustin Hoffman, emulating Terry-Thomas) and live happily ever after with them in Neverland.Sounds great, right? Yep. In many cases, it is, but the script doesn't know whether this is a family movie geared towards children or an allegory for adults. Some of the screenplay is very wise in its message, and at other times, it sinks to the depths of what makes little boys giggle and adults groan. Most of the boys are fine, although a few (especially the very overweight grinning black kid) will grate on some viewer's nerves with their insipid ""cuteness"". The Asian actor playing Pan's rival for power in Neverland is very good, giving a little political twist to how they run their little community, as is the little black boy who is the first to believe that Williams is Peter. A violent twist involving one of the boys towards the end will be shocking to everybody and horrifying to the very young. At times, the interaction between the kids comes off as a cross between the youthful gangsters of ""Bugsy Malone"", a re-hash of the ""Bowery Boys"" movies and the juvenile humor of ""Scooby Doo"". Where this film succeeds is in the lessons that Williams learns from this adventure. Hoffman, as well as Bob Hoskins as a delightful Smee, are the acting stand-outs. It is also successful artistically, making me wish there was a Peter Pan theme park that expanded it beyond a Disneyland look. It's also ironic to see Arthur Malet getting the final shot (getting to fly after regaining his marbles), having nearly 30 years before trying to prevent banker father Dick Van Dyke from floating to the top of the ceiling in ""Mary Poppins"". Spielberg combines the joy of childhood and the disillusionment's of adulthood come together, but the conflict in moods and messages prevents it from becoming fully successful. With constant revivals of the musical ""Peter Pan"", the successful prequel (""Peter & the Starcatcher"") and the fairly successful historical docu-musical (""Finding Neverland"", based upon another hit movie) having hit Broadway, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody tried to musicalize this, but after seeing the movie, that seems like a nearly impossible task.",Hook
6,gavin6942,"Good Set Design, But Very Superficial",6,12 August 2014,"When Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children, an adult Peter Pan (Robin Williams) must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy.This film is a bit divisive, with some loving it and others not being very impressed. Indeed, the makeup, costumes and set design are top-notch. Some of the dialogue is pretty funny, particularly when Pan and Rufio get into a match of insults. And Dustin Hoffman really becomes Hook (Bob Hoskins is even more attached to Smee.) The overall story, although clever, tends to fall flat at times, with an overly predictable arc with more than just a dollop of sentimentality. Maybe one should not be too hard on the picture, but...",Hook
7,lee_eisenberg,"After I saw this when I was 16, I caught a lot of jokes that I didn't catch when I was 7",10,22 November 2005,"""Hook"" is of course the story of an adult Peter Pan having to fight Capt. James S. Hook one last time. As Pan (now named Peter Banning), Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but does manage to make the most of the character. As Hook, Dustin Hoffman is almost unrecognizable but never gets dull. Bob Hoskins has some great lines as Smee, Julia Roberts is worthwhile as Tinkerbell, and Maggie Smith is her usual dependable self as an elderly Wendy.I saw ""Hook"" when it first came out, and mostly just interpreted it as a cool kids' movie. But when I saw it again nine years later, I caught a lot of jokes. There's Peter's comment about mergers and acquisitions, and the shots of the Beatles poster, for starters. Moreover, Glenn Close and David Crosby have brief appearances. All in all, Steven Spielberg managed to maintain the original story's magic without going overboard (pun intended). And now I realize that Tootles was played by Arthur Malet, who also played young Mr. Dawes in ""Mary Poppins"", and also once appeared on ""I Dream of Jeannie"" as Jeannie's Cockney uncle.",Hook
8,jboothmillard,Hook,6,2 November 2006,"This isn't a bad film directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), but it is certainly one his little career glitches, a reimagined continuation from the story created by J.M. Barrie. Basically it is all about what has happened to the guy who was once Peter Pan, the boy who never grew up. Peter Banning (a childish, but fun Robin Williams) is a businessman with wife Moira Banning (Caroline Goodall) and kids Jack 'Jackie' (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott). Not long after arriving at Granny Wendy's (Dame Maggie Smith) house, the kids are kidnapped by someone claiming to be Captain James Hook. Soon enough, Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arrives and takes Peter to Neverland both to meet his past arch enemy, Hook (Golden Globe nominated Dustin Hoffman), and to prepare in three days to remember his past, and fight as Peter Pan. Also starring Bob Hoskins as Smee, Arthur Malet as Tootles, Phil Collins as Inspector Good, Isaiah Robinson as Pockets, Dante Basco as Rufio, Raushan Hammond as Thud Butt, Gwyneth Paltrow as Young Wendy, and try to recognise Glenn Close as Gutless (the one put in the box with scorpions), and although you won't recognise them, George Lucas and Carrie Fisher are the couple kissing on the bridge, lifted by the fairy dust. Williams is fun to watch both before and after becoming Pan, but Hoffman does steal the show as a pantomimic villain lost without his nemesis, makes him a little sympathetic, and all supporting cast members make this a lot of fun for the family. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Art Direction- Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup and Best Music. Good!",Hook
9,ccthemovieman-1,Typical Spielberg Fare,7,17 February 2008,"This is such a typical Steven Spielberg kids' film, which means some good and some bad, but always an entertaining movie.The film is beautifully photographed, another Spielberg trait. It also has some innovative special-effects. The sets are magnificent. Robin Williams and Julia Roberts play likable roles, the latter playing ""Tinker Bell."" Spielberg also has the kids outsmarting the adults, or even outfighting them as in this film (gimme a break); some sexual innuendos that are not needed in this story; too much noise and activity for half the movie.At 140 minutes, it's a long movie, but the kids shouldn't mind while adults might get a little tired of it after awhile. All in all, it was okay but I didn't care for it as much as most people.",Hook
10,moonspinner55,"""Peter Pan"" meets a McDonald's commercial...",3,26 September 2007,"Steven Spielberg's distinctly nonmagical rendering of J.M. Barrie's tale of ""Peter Pan"", the flying, fun-loving boy who battled pirates and never grew up, casts Robin Williams as a crotchety adult who discovers his true origin as Pan. He returns to his island home and eventually takes on old nemesis Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) after his own children are kidnapped. Strained family 'product', with Williams in the unenviable position of playing Peter Pan like an amnesiac. Never Never Land, with its multi-racial Lost Boys, looks rather shoddy, as do the pirates (including Glenn Close, obviously in drag). The cast may have had a ball making this, yet the picture is an expensive lark, a personal extravagance--and everyone here is just playing dress-up. Julia Roberts is single-handedly misused as fairy-sprite Tinkerbell, though Bob Hoskins is well-cast (if too heavily bearded) as Hook's assistant Smee. All that's missing are plugs for Big Macs and Quarter Pounders and this would be the perfect example of a feature-length TV advertisement. *1/2 from ****",Hook
11,Quinoa1984,"disappointing years later, probably my least favorite of Spielberg's big blockbusters",4,28 July 2006,"Seeing a film that doesn't work directed by Steven Spielberg is still more interesting, up to a point, than watching an average work by a lesser filmmaker with similar material. Hook is probably one of those films that also probably worked a little better for me when I was younger (I even saw it in the theater as I recall), and had that combination of high flying special effects and kiddie humor and heart that made for a good enough time. But seeing it on TV recently I come across, maybe like Robin Williams's character early on in the film, not connecting with those same nondiscriminatory reactions (in other words just happy to see something colorful and big with over the top actors and ideas). By now, however, I've seen too many of Spielberg's films up to now that speak to his themes of re-imagining escapism and of a father losing responsibility to more satisfying, more entertaining heights than this. The film has its moments, usually among the cast of kids that make up the Lost Boys, but it's also adrift in its huge production design, lackluster screenplay, and sometimes odd choice- or rather portrayals- by the principle leads.Williams himself isn't too bad as the Peter Pan of the picture, as an adult without much heart who has to find it in the midst of finding his kidnapped kids in Neverland. He is re-introduced to Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts, decent but far from really being memorable), and of course the title character played by Dustin Hoffman with enough 'ham' to feed a starving family. It's hard now to take him too seriously as a villain when even as a kid he seemed a little too goofy for the part. Bob Hoskins interestingly enough is maybe a bit better as Smee, Hook's main underling. The film's main action centerpiece for almost all involved, where Peter Pan and the Lost Boys finally take on Hook and his crew, is an action-filled extravaganza that seems to not really have the focus of Spielberg's better set-pieces in other films he's done. This is contrasted with bits of comic relief by Hook and some others in the Lost Boys that are hit and miss. And the special effects themselves, while a nice precursor to what Spielberg would work with later in the 90s with his Jurassic Park films, aren't enough to support the flaws elsewhere. Mostly in the script, to be sure, where perhaps some of the lack of putting together stronger, less clichéd characterization with the fantasy and un-needed scenes, rubbed off on the director and his style.Would it be a good time for kids? Maybe, but then many of Spielberg's films are at least eye-candy and at most grand-old times where fantasy and adventure/comedy/drama all mix together for something memorable. Indeed, his were some of the first 'real' films I can remember seeing and getting into, even the slightly darker and rougher Indiana Jones pictures. But even as a kid my enjoyment of Hook was mostly for surface pleasures- and being a big fan of Williams at the time- and the memories don't stick as well fifteen years later. Call it not being able to be a Peter Pan or returning to Neverland or whatever, Hook is at best average Hollywood escapist fare and at worst an overlong, lacking in focus family-fantasy film that shows the lesser side of Spielberg's gifts as a storyteller and artist.",Hook
12,BandSAboutMovies,Eh,4,27 May 2020,"Sure, Steven Spielberg directed this movie, but it was developed by James V. Hart (Bram Stoker's Dracula) and the man who hoped that he would direct it, Nick Castle. Yes, the same person who played Michael Meyers. Instead of this movie, he'd direct Dennis the Menace and get a story credit.Seriously, let me blow your mind. Nick Castle also directed Major Payne and Mr. Wrong, a movie all about Ellen DeGeneres having bad luck dating men.I'm the wrong person to discuss this movie, as I've never enjoyed it. My hatred for Robin Williams is pretty well known. Julia Roberts being involved makes this a double threat to my sanity.But Sam, Phil Collins is in it, I hear you say. What, no one said that? Am I hearing voices again?Spielberg has mentioned several times how much he dislikes this movie, feeling that he had no real feel for the story beyond the start of the story and that he just made the movie bigger and more colorful to make up for his insecurity with making the film. He was happy that he made it, because it allowed him to become friends with Williams.Becca absolutely loves this movie, remembering exactly where she saw it as a kid and how many times she rented it. I don't say anything when we watch it, because it makes her happy and really, that's what being in a relationship is all about.",Hook
13,sunwarrior13,Hook Has Its Ups And Downs,8,2 October 2012,"Hook is a fantasy film that stars Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Robin Williams as Peter Pan/Peter Banning, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Smee, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, Caroline Goodall as Moira Banning, and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning. The film is based on the novel Peter and Wendy by J. M. Barrie and acts as a sequel to those adventures, focusing on a grown-up Peter Pan who has forgotten his childhood. Now known as ""Peter Banning"", he is a successful corporate lawyer with a wife and two children. Hook kidnaps his children, and Peter must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy.It was written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo; and directed by Steven Spielberg.Spielberg's deeply flawed but sporadically fun update of the Peter Pan legend is entertaining. The visual contrast between the adult Pan's bustling outside world and the insulated fantasy of Neverland is striking, but his ideas about the politically correct in their ethnic diversity, energetic on skateboards are contrived and cheapening. On the plus side, the story's theme about adults finding their innocence again through their children is very touching.",Hook
14,studioAT,Grow up Peter,3,14 February 2015,"When you look at the cast and director involved in Hook you would think it will be an amazing family film inspired by J.M Barrie's classic book. Sadly while the idea of a grown up Peter Pan is a good one the film ends up being overly long, dull and oddly for Spielburg, lacking in charm.Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are good in their roles and drag the quality of the film up a notch purely because they seem to be having such a good time making it. Robin Williams as Peter Pan - that's perfect casting.However the film spends too long setting up its concept and is full of overly long and dull scenes. The 1990's style lost boys are annoying and dated and the less said about Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell the better.Hook is a nice idea, it's just not fully realised in practice.",Hook
15,Doylenf,Even a misfire can have a certain charm...,5,10 June 2006,"ROBIN WILLIAMS tones down his usual manic personality to play a suitably aged Peter Pan who has become (of all things) a lawyer and the father of children he can barely spare the time to acknowledge. It's an original concept for a film about the legendary Peter Pan who, as an adult, has to save his children by sprinkling himself with fairy dust (courtesy of an ill-conceived Tinker Bell played by JULIA ROBERTS).Despite being an uneven and overlong film, there are some compensations, chiefly in the performances of Maggie Smith (as the aged Wendy), DUSTIN Hoffman as a wigged and mustached Captain Hook, and BOB HOSKINS as Smee, providing some much needed comic relief as Captain Hook's fawning pirate.There's a certain amount of charm in the nursery scenes that open the film--but, unfortunately, once Peter flees to Neverland, the film sinks beneath a plethora of clumsy looking settings and a peculiarly chosen cast of Lost Boys. Only the clever bantering between Peter and Captain Hook bring some of the Neverland scenes to life--and the final dueling match is well staged and fun to watch.All in all, it's like a pudding that has too many lumps in it for complete enjoyment. Even John Williams' score is less satisfying than usual, apparently because the material was not inspiring enough for his genius.",Hook
16,CinemaSerf,"Peter grows up, or does he...?",7,20 September 2021,"Ok, so it's not the original 1953 Disney classic, but it is still a great fun adventure that, surely, brings out the kid in all of us. ""Peter Banning"" is an hot shot businessman who rather carelessly neglects his family. When he heads to London from the USA with them to meet with ""Granny Wendy"" (Dame Maggie Smith) we learn that he was adopted, but only after being discovered by the old lady who looked after a great many orphans - not least his wife ""Moira"" (Caroline Goodall). It's only when his two children are mysteriously kidnapped from their nursery late one snowy evening, he begins to remember his life before his adoption - and with the help of some magic and sparkle from ""Tink"" (Julia Roberts) is soon back in ""Never Never Land"" facing his arch-nemesis ""Capt. Hook"" (Dustin Hoffman) in a battle royal to reclaim his children. Still sceptical about the whole thing - he must learn to believe, to hope and to feel joy again before he has any hope of convincing the ""Lost Boys"" to assist in his dangerous quest. It's great fun, this film. Hoffman is super as the hook-toting' sophisticate-cum-baddie, and even the kids are not too annoying. Indeed, they have some cracking food fights and there is loads of acrobatics and mischief too. I wasn't mad about the concept of ""the Pan"" - that seemed just a little too oppressive, menacing - sterile even given the whole purpose of Sir J. M. Barrie's book is to remind us about what is important life - people, loyalty, love - and most of all - fun!! Yes, it is a bit lengthy. It takes far too long to get going, but once it does it is well worth a chortle as the script offers humour for all ages and the score, well that is instantly recognisable from John Williams. I'm a great fan of this story, and if this goes half way to perpetuating the delightful sentiment (and partially funding London's Great Ormond Street Hospital) then that can only be for the better.

17,dbborroughs,Major Misfire,3,20 July 2004,"This return to Neverland was suppose to be a small scale film that writer Nick Castle was going to direct himself. Spielberg came across the script and then proceeded to toss huge sums of money to get the right to direct it, and then to make one of the most wrong-headed films ever made.The plot concerns a grown-up Peter Pan who has forgotten Neverland. Hook seeking to get a revenge on his enemy kidnaps his kids and forces Peter to try to remember who he was.This is proof that with out real vision all of the money in the world won't help you. It also proves that Spielberg's is a limited director. I could rip this film to shreds but will restrain myself by only sighting one or two major mistakes. First are the lost boys, who are skateboarding punk kids from the early 1990's. This should be a timeless tale and Spielberg in order to go for the kid audience instantly dates the film. Spielberg is a pop culture junkie and all of his films are riffs on other films. That can only take you so far with out dating your films and here his need to be now badly wounds the film.  Julia Roberts, while nice in theory, is completely wrong as Tinker Bell. Even with movie magic she just looks wrong as Peter's oldest friend. Worse the role as written isn't as feisty as she was in the original novel.The best thing in the film, and probably the one thing they got right, was Dustin Hoffman as Hook. He chews the scenery and then some and should probably won the Oscar for his role.Given the choice I would never watch this film again which left me crying in my seat as I became more and more heart broken with each missed chance to make a classic (or even a decent film.)3 out of 10See PJ Hogan's Peter Pan instead, thats a classic, this isn't.",Hook
18,Boba_Fett1138,The ultimate kids movie!,6,1 July 2003,"The movie serves it's purpose very well and that purpose is to entertain the young ones.Oh boy, did I loved this movie as a kid and so did all my friends. However now that I'm older I of course look differently at the movie and I've also more critic at it.It's a fantastic fantasy movie that suffers from a silly story and bad looking sets. It's so obviously filmed in a studio, that it truly reminded me of an old B-movie from the 50's. And sure, the story is original and fun but it also has some silly and just plain weird plot lines in it, that don't suit the movie because they distract too much from the main plot line and will probably bore the kids as well.The performances are excellent. Robin Williams actually plays one of the best roles out of his career! Dustin Hoffman is highly amusing as Captain Hook and the lost boys are just awesome! The movie has some excellent jokes and funny moments in it, which all makes the movie more than pleasant to watch. The action is Spielberg-like-good and the cinematography and music are more than excellent. The ending is somewhat disappointing because...well, it just looks weird and too fake, like it was rushed (which it probably also was).However I don't think it's really fair from us grown ups to judge over this movie since it was obviously made for kids. So let the young ones judge this movie. I'm sure they'll enjoy it and are capable of looking past the fake looking sets and other weaker points of the movie. They most likely won't be disappointed and shall enjoy watching it from start till finish, unlike probably most of the fair and objective adults.Nevertheless, I still consider this to be the ultimate kids movie!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hook

20,neil-476,No-one can get it right all the time,6,27 April 2010,"Hook presents us with the interesting and unusual phenomenon of Spielberg not getting it right.The idea is great - an adult Peter Pan, having eliminated the very notion of Neverland from his mind, has his children kidnapped by Captain Hook and has to return to Neverland where he rediscovers the childhood he had deliberately abandoned.And there is much to like about the film, not least of which are Dustin Hoffman's mannered Hook, and Maggie Smith's frail and aged Wendy.But when mistakes are made - and there are a number here - boy, are they whoppers! There are two huge casting mistakes among the principals. Julia Roberts is an absolutely awful Tinkerbell. Tinkerbell is a fairy, for heaven's sake. It's difficult to think of anyone more rooted in the real world than Julia Roberts, the least fairy-like actress I can think of (and whoever thought it would be a good idea to have a wincingly cloying scene of barely restrained loveydoveyness between Peter and Tinkerbell at the same size, should be locked up with no chance of ever getting near a word processor ever again. Preferably hide the pencils, too, just in case).And, I hate to say it, because I understand why it looked good on paper, Robin Williams is pretty awful too. If anything, Williams plays it too straight. I believe his uptight adult business man with not enough time for his kids, but I never believed his rejuvenated Pan.The Lost Boys don't convince, particularly the cockatoo-haired punk leader.The special effects fall in a clumsy halfway house between dream-like sheer fantasy and real life, and the set-bound interiors are too busy. The whole thing has a garish cast to it as if someone turned up the colour intensity on the TV.A misfire and, in Spielberg's filmography, only 1941 is a poorer effort.",Hook

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute fantasy movie which can be enjoyed by the entire family. Admittedly, there are some rather slow scenes here and there which drags things down a bit but overall it was still a good film for the most part. I especially liked the performance of Dustin Hoffman and Raushan Hammond who enlivened each scene they were in. That being said, even though it had it's flaws and its detractors, I still found it to be entertaining in its own right and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Hook
22,anaconda-40658,Hooked!,9,9 March 2016,"Hook (1991): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins, Maggie Smith: This is a version of the classic tale that positions it all into the future where Robin Williams is a grown up Peter Pan. He is married, has two young children, and a job that has consumed him so much that it erases his memories of Neverland. Captain Hook hasn't forgotten him and to ensure that, he kidnaps his two children. Enter pixie Tinker Bell who carries him off in his sleep and he awakens in Neverland. Steven Spielberg takes the fairy tale and throws it into an adult world and he is backed with top notch special effects. Williams is the ideal casting for an adult Pan who ventures to Neverland to confront Hook and rescue his children. He goes through awkward training where one's imagination is key. Dustin Hoffman embodies the intimidating dominance of Hook whose very presence evokes fear. Julia Roberts plays off the spirited nature of Tinker Bell who steers Peter in the right direction. Bob Hoskins plays Hook's head henchmen whose advice to him is to play it up to Peter's children in an attempt to win them over thus using that against him. Maggie Smith plays the elderly version of Wendy who was the teenage girl in the Disney classic. While this update may be too scary for really young children, older children and adults will enjoy getting hooked on it. Score: 9 / 10",Hook
23,HotToastyRag,Not for kids,4,3 October 2020,"A real-people version of Peter Pan might sound like a good idea, but not with the depressing touches added to this Steven Spielberg drama. In this one, the boy who never grew up finally does. He's a grown-up with no memories of his previous life as Peter Pan. He's unhappy and has fallen into the patterns that made children want to go to Neverland in the first place. In an odd coincidence, he's married to Wendy's granddaughter (weird, right?), but when Captain Hook steals their children, he has to turn back into Peter Pan and return to Neverland.I think it's supposed to be funny to have a cast that doesn't resemble their cartoon counterparts, but all I saw was bad casting. Robin Williams doesn't look like a spritely child who doesn't even shave yet. Julia Roberts is known for two things: her stature and her hair, yet she's cast as Tinkerbell, shrunken to make audiences laugh and with a cropped wig that's not even the right color. Yes, you get to see Dustin Hoffman in his red coat and funny wig as Captain Hook, with Bob Hoskins at his side (playing Smee). Maggie Smith plays Granny Wendy, and Gwyneth Paltrow makes her screen debut as young Wendy, but it's just not the same as the cartoon. This isn't a movie for children. It's a dark take about what happens to children who vow not to turn out like their parents and then do. The costumes and pirate ship are ancillary, in my opinion.",Hook
24,FlashCallahan,To live would be an awfully big adventure........,8,5 October 2012,"Peter Pan has grown up to be a cut-throat merger and acquisitions lawyer, and is married to Wendy's granddaughter. Captain Hook kidnaps his children, so Peter returns to Never Land with Tinkerbell. With the help of her and the Lost Boys, he must remember how to be young again in order to save his children by battling with Captain Hook once more......Seeing this in the cinema as a fourteen year old, I was truly blown away by just good the film was. Just getting into films, it was a rarity for Spielberg to get something wrong, and with Williams in the lead, I was quite confused as to why it was so poorly received.Twenty years on, after introducing my daughter to it, it's easy to see why. The film starts off really well, Williams is great as the grouchy dad, and Spielberg definitely has the golden touch in the first act.But as soon as Peter reaches never land and meets the lost boys, the film turns into a bloated mess, and you crave for Hoffman to get back on screen quickly.The films at least thirty minutes too long, and this should have been trimmed down during the second act, as this seems to go on forever and ever.The film does pick up at the final act, but it's a long time coming, but it just about redeems itself.Saying that, the cast are excellent, and the film still looks as good and fresh today as it did back then.So all in all, it's a good film, just really saggy and boring in the middle.The lost boys should have stayed that way..",Hook
25,Wuchakk,What if Peter Pan grew up and forgot who he was? What if he returned to Neverland?,6,8 August 2018,"RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Hook"" stars Robin Williams as a corporate American Lawyer who must go to the island of Neverland after his two kids are kidnapped in London by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). He has misadventures with the fairy Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts), pirates and a group of ragtag lost boys led by Rufio (Dante Basco); meanwhile hook tries to win the affections of his kids. Maggie Smith and Gwyneth Paltrow are on hand as older and younger versions of Wendy respectively.This is a family-oriented adventure/fantasy/comedy cut from the same cloth as ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968), ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (2004) and ""Into the Woods"" (2014); it's just not a musical like some of those flicks even though a song or two are featured. Depending on your tastes, ""Hook"" is no better or worse than any of these movies (although ""The Wizard of Oz"" is in a league of its own, of course).While I love serious swashbuckling, Peter Pan was always too kiddie/fantasy-based for my tastes. This is ironic since I have Peter Pan Syndrome, which Spielberg also admitted to; and my wife has The Wendy Dilemma (look 'em up). Fans of Peter Pan will favor this flick more than me.Nevertheless, it was made by scores of talented people and contains some genuinely amusing moments (I busted out laughing at least four times). Hoffman's titular character is iconic. And Roberts works surprisingly well as Tinkerbell, but they should've accented her beauty further. Speaking of which, the film needs more feminine sex appeal. Even the makers of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" knew enough to include a little bit.Both Spielberg and Williams liked the two bookend sequences, but have reservations about the long Neverland middle-piece, which is the bulk of the picture. Williams admitted he felt lost in Neverland, probably because he was thrust from one misadventure to another so briskly. But the pre-CGI sets are colorful and imaginative; it's a fun movie with a lot of energy. Peter Pan just ain't my thang.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hour, 22 minutes (overlong). WRITERS: James V. Hart, Nick Castle and Malia Scotch Marmo wrote the script based on concepts from the works of J.M. Barrie, particular ""Peter and Wendy"" (1911). BOX OFFICE: The movie cost $70 million (not including marketing) and made $301 million worldwide with $120 million of that domestically. While it was the fourth highest-grossing movie worldwide in 1991, it was still considered a disappointment by producers, the greedy bastages.GRADE: B-/C+",Hook

27,namashi_1,A Lively Entertainer!,7,18 November 2011,"'Hook' is a lively entertainer, that still has it's own charm. Directed by none-other-than Steven Spielberg, 'Hook' acts as a sequel to Peter Pan's original adventures, and comes up a winner, in it's own way.'Hook' Synopsis: When Captain Hook kidnaps his children, an adult Peter Pan must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy.Spielberg's Take on Peter Pan, is childlike & very imaginative. Also, bringing in a Middle-Aged Peter Pan & a Older Captain Hook, not only adds freshness to their legendary rivalry, but also a certain amount of inquisitiveness. His Direction, like always, is gorgeous. James V. Hart & Malia Scotch Marmo's Screenplay, is mostly engaging & lively. However, the first 30-minutes, are not really effective. Cinematography & Editing, are fine. Art Design & Visual Effects, are stunning. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams is lovable as Peter Pan. Dustin Hoffman performs superbly as the Captain Hook. Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, does fairly well. Bob Hoskins as Hook's henchman, Smee, is excellent. Maggie Smith as Wendy Darling is believable. All The Kids deliver decently. On the whole, 'Hook' isn't a masterpiece, but throughly entertaining nonetheless. Watch It!",Hook
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,Dustin Hoffman can easily can get you hooked,6,27 January 2004,"Hook is a spin off of the classic tale of Peter Pan, you ever wonder what life would have been like for Peter Pan if he had grown up? If he had kids, a wife, and a career as a lawyer? Not very much, but it happens here in Spielberg's tale of the boy who never wanted to grow up. Hook is a pretty good film, it was definitely very imaginative and creative story wise. The sets and actors were absolutely perfect for this film; did you know that Michael Jackson originally wanted to play the role of Peter? Pretty creepy, huh? But Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman were so great together, I really enjoyed their performances. But the only actress I questioned was Julia Roberts as Tink, I'm not so sure if she was the best choice for the role. But that's just me, while the story seemed to drag on a bit, it was actually pretty good.Peter is a bit of a grown up who just can't seem to have fun in life, he misses his son's baseball games, doesn't spend much time with the family, and is always focused on work. But when he and his wife visit England with their kids to see Wendy, the lady who raised Peter when he was an orphan, his kids are kidnapped by Captain James Hook who wants to challenge Peter, but when Tink takes Peter back to Neverland, he needs major convincing that he is Peter Pan and is given three days to do so to get back his children. The Lost Boys try their best to make Peter bang-or-aign once again with them and that he'll get his kids back while learning the importance of youth.Hook is over all a good film that I would recommend to people. It's not at all a bad film, it has good drama in it along with great comedy. Most people love the dinner scene between Peter and Rufio, mine is Captain Hook explaining to Peter's kids why parents don't love children. Dustin's delivery of ""I want to potty, I want a cookie"" was just so perfect and funny. This is a good family film that I think you'll like, it's just an honest film with a fun story.6/10",Hook
29,MovieAddict2016,I can't believe I haven't commented on this yet!,5,2 September 2005,"I could have sworn I already wrote a review for ""Hook,"" but glancing at my review archive just now, I realized I hadn't - what a shock! I've seen it so many times over the years... and each time it grows worse and worse. (But in a good way, if that makes any sense.) ""Hook"" is a terrible film, yes. But in some ways, it's also very good. The ideas that surface are unique - what if Peter Pan grew up? What if he forgot who he was? What if, what if, what if...? The movie's stumbling block is Spielberg. This represents his best and worst - it's imaginative (the good) but way too bright, over-the-top and exuberant (the bad). Spielberg's liberal impact on the material is always present - he represents the Lost Boys as a pack of minority kids, who ride skateboards and look like they just stepped out of Stereotypical Ghetto Number One.The movie's flashy coloring and vibrant overtones bring to mind his older failures such as ""1941"" - similarly ""Hook"" is a film that, despite its faults, remains somewhat interesting.The second huge slip-up is casting Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. Meg Ryan was originally considered for the role and she would have been about a million times better. Roberts is annoying and gives one of the worst performances of her career (which is saying quite a lot); Ryan's acting skills aren't too great either (take a look at ""The Doors"") but when she sticks to the right roles she's always great. This would have been one of her perfect roles.I could sit here and criticize this film to all ends but at the end of the day I always find just as much to like. Robin Williams is suitable as Peter and Dustin Hoffman absolutely steals the show as Hook - he delivers the best screen persona of Hook to ever reach the big screen, far surpassing Jason Isaacs in the 2003 J.M. Barrie version in particular. (I think Isaacs is a great villain in cinema and he was given such little to do as Hook.) The co-stars are all talented - British veterans like Maggie Smith add class - and the film's on-location shooting in London gives it an authentic feel.Overall I'm giving it a five-star (out of ten) rating because I don't really ""like"" the movie. But when it's on, I usually watch it. I used to own the VHS tape. I think some of the ideas are really clever and the performances are great. It's a shame about Spielberg and his wacky taste for the absurd, but at the end of the day, that's what has helped ""Hook"" retain its status as a beloved failure over the years - this is the movie everyone loves to hate.",Hook
30,Rainey-Dawn,Second Star to the Right...,9,23 June 2014,"I've always loved the story of Peter Pan! From the humble beginnings of the character as a pan-flute playing satyr to other transformations and interpretations including the film Hook! I love the idea of staying forever young... one of the main themes that has stayed with Pan since he was first invented. I myself try to maintain a ""kid at heart"" approach to living life - it keeps me happy and youngish - and, maybe, that's why I've always loved the story of Peter Pan.And Captain Hook... what can I say about him? A villain that I love and hate at the exact same time! Quite an interesting pirate that could learn a lot about love, life and laughter from Peter Pan.This is a great family film but even those of us who are single and/or childless can still enjoy this interpretation of the story.9/10",Hook
31,OllieSuave-007,Peter Pan grew up.,7,4 April 2014,"This movie is a continuation of the classic tale of the boy who wouldn't grow up, Peter Pan. Here, the infamous Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps the children of Peter Banning (Robin Williams) and takes them to Neverland. Banning must regain his youthful spirit as Peter Pan and return to Neverland to reunite with his old gang, including Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts), and rescue his children.It's a pretty good story filled with unending adventures and spectacular sceneries of the magical Neverland what is filled with colorful characters, played by a group of fun-loving, bratty but loyal boys. Hoffman played Hook brilliantly, perfect for the part, as did Bob Hoskins in his Mr. Smee role. Comedic and quirky Williams was a good choice to play the grown-up Peter Pan; it was fun seeing his character looking bizarre and confused in Neverland, forgetting his roots and adventures with the Lost Boys in the magical place. And, Julia Roberts played a good Tinkerbell and she had some touching chemistry with Williams' character.Although it's not Disney, this movie does capture the magic and essence of the original animated classic Peter Pan from Disney. There are plenty of action and adventure to enjoy, but with some filler scenes that dragged the movie somewhat towards the middle. It's a nice one for the entire family, but I think it's better fit for the younger ones due to its juvenile and whimsical nature.Grade B-",Hook
32,FeastMode,what is this garbage?,1,1 July 2020,"I loved this movie as a kid. unfortunately it has zero appeal to me as an adult. this movie is horrendous. it's so stupid. it's completely childish without a semblance of cleverness. nothing makes sense. it takes forever to start, about 30 minutes of boring setup. and everything ""cool"" in this movie is only ""cool"" to a child.it's filled with dumb moments (like 3-day amnesia.... WHAT?!?!), cheesy dialogue, cliches, and even things like continuity errors. and there are a bunch of REALLY weird things too. numerous parts made me cringe. i can't believe it was almost 2.5 hours. and i was shocked when the end credits rolled to ""directed by steven spielberg."" really? you made this garbage? lamesomething else i found odd was some of the content in here that doesn't seem appropriate for a PG kids movie. i actually looked up the MPAA rating because i thought it might be PG-13. just to be clear, this played no role in my rating. it doesn't bother me. but makes me question some of the decision making behind he scenes.peter banning is a married man, but his adopted mother who is 50 years older than him tries to kiss him. i legit couldn't believe it. so awkward. that same married man kisses 3 sexy mermaids underwater. i understand they were giving him air, but i question why this scene would be included. and that same married man has another kiss. what is happening. there is talk of killing children and ""indians"" like it's normal. there is one swear word, and a complement about julia roberts' ""lovely legs."" not one of these things fits the tone of the movie or the intended audience.the only thing i liked was dustin hoffman's performance. i was going to give it a 2/10 but the final shot of the movie made me cringe so hard that sunk it to a 1 (about 5 viewings, 6/30/2020)",Hook

Julia Roberts was miscast as her Tinkerbell role. I must also mention she looks ugly with that freaky hairstyle. Also, this movie was boring at some parts. I felt like going to sleep, then a good scene pops out. Here are the good things. The acting of Dustin Hoffman as Hook is great. He is hardly recognizable.

34,ericstevenson,RIP Robin Williams,8,3 January 2017,"I may in fact be biased with liking this movie seeing as how it's a cult film featuring Robin Williams, one of my favorite entertainers. I still believe that it's a good movie and it's weird how audiences like it a lot more than critics. I admit it's not a classic, but it's a fun cute little movie. I like the premise as it features Peter Pan actually growing up and having to fight Captain Hook as an adult. Yeah, it would have been nice to see a young Peter Pan, but this is still a cool idea. Dustin Hoffman is a lot of fun as Captain Hook too.I will admit this is a bit too long. It's not that complicated of a story. I remember reading about parts of this film as a kid in a little book. It's weird how I never saw it as a kid! Well, nostalgia can work well and it can show you cool stuff you missed out on as a kid. I admit it's pretty silly, but it's still really fun at the end when they use all these goofy weapons that fire paint and eggs at the pirates. It's hokey, but it is one of Robin Williams' finer roles. I'm glad to have seen him like this. ***",Hook

38,ironhorse_iv,I'm pretty hooked on watching this movie. It's alright.,7,14 November 2014,"When Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children, an adult Peter Pan (Robin Williams) must return to Neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to save his children & challenge his old enemy. Hook, line, and tinker. Some people might not think its Barrie good: but I think it's alright for a children film. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie ask the question, most people never thought before; what if Peter Pan grew up? This movie look like a sequel to the Disney's 1953 animated movie version of the novel J.M Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy. Still, it has some of the mature elements of the original novel, which was more geared toward adults than children. It digs deep into the psychological of Puer aeternus AKA Pan syndrome. Like Wendy in the original novel, the modern day, Peter Pan learns the bad side of never growing up, when he learn that due to his neglect, his relationship with both Wendy and Tinker Bell went soured. He was never able to witness the joys of adulthood. When he does choose to grow up, his quest for success, often came with the price of his family feeling neglected. It's nice to see the one-dimensional Peter Pan, have a character arch, here. The movie tells why it's so important, to grow up, but not too fast that you lose your inner child. The collision between responsibility and eternal boyhood is a great conflict. Not surprisingly, those portions of the film that involve Peter Banning and his family are considered the most genuine heart-felt and emotional affecting aspects of Hook. You really felt for him, when Captain Hook brainwash his child, in thinking that he can be a better father than Peter Pan. I love the clock breaking scene. The troubled relationship between Peter and his son echoed Spielberg's relationship with his father and you see it in this film. Robin Williams is great in the lead role. You would never think of him, as a Peter Pan character, but he tries his hardest to look and play the part. I just really glad, they never gave the role to pop singer, Michael Jackson, a over obsessed fan, because he doesn't have the acting range that can show that conflict. He never truly understood the reasons of growing up. Jackson was disappointed that he wasn't able to play the role on screen that supposedly he tried to put a voodoo curse on Spielberg. Talk about somebody needs to grow up. Another great memorable performance is that of Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook in one of his best performances, ever. He has the right balance of villainous. Even supporting characters like Dante Basco as Rufio, Bob Hoskins as Smee & Maggie Smith as Wendy were amazing in the roles. Julia Roberts as Tinker Hell is questionable. She has that sweetheart look, but lacks the jealous and deceiving nature of Tinker Bell of the original novel. She was hard to work with. It's weird to see cameos like Phil Collins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Glenn Close, David Crosby, George Lucas, and Carrie Fischer, but it didn't hurt the film. While Hook look pretty epic, Hook was shot almost entirely on sound stages rather than real life locations. It gave that felt of the early 1930s fantasy Golden Age of Pirates movies. The set designs were pretty good, despite it looking kinda unrealistic and cheap. I love the whole Pirate ship set. It's a bit weird, that Tinker Bell drop Peter Pan off here in the beginning of the film than the Lost Boys tree. It's like dropping off, a deer in a wolves den. I guess, she was indeed deceiving. I like, how Hook can't find the Lost Boys hideout, despite its being clear, that it's the tree, anyways. There were so misguide attempts to get 1990s children, watching this film. I found it a bit weird, for the majority of the Lost Boys act like children of the 1990s, than turn of the Century children. I didn't know, the 1900s had Basketball, Mohawk hairstyles and skate boards. I kinda wish that Michael and John from the original book made an appearance, but it does makes sense why they weren't there. The action is a hit and a miss. I know, it's a children movie, but why is the Lost Boys fighting the Pirates in such non-lethal ways with Eggs and pies? Children do die here, yet they're fighting them as if it's a fantasy kid friendly Home Alone corny style action. Despite that, the sword fights, the movie does have, are pretty good. The music is another good, about the film. John Williams's music is beautiful to listen to. The movie does have some stupid over the top whimsical music clichés moments like a child singing badly in the moonlight. She's no American Tail, Tanya. The movie does other stupid moments like the imagination food scene. Yes, children, rather than search for food, just imagine food, so you don't starve. Some stupid plot-holes things are hard to overlook like how a baby grown up to be 12 years old in Neverland despite the place, being a place, where nobody grows old. It's also seem odd, that the Pirates knows everything about Peter Pan's life after he left Neverland, but still shock to see him as an adult. I guess, there were a lot of foreshadowing; since there were lots of Hook symbolism. I like how the voice of the plane captain in the beginning was indeed Dustin Hoffman, and the trash sweeper in the end, could be Smee. Its Easter eggs like this that make it, a good re-watch value. Overall: People either love or hate this movie. Personally, I love it. I will say it, it was a great nostalgia family film that could need a little bit more work. Compare to other live action sequels to animated movies. It's a lot better than them. If you haven't seen it, check it out. Bangarang!",Hook
39,The-Sarkologist,A movie about finding your lost childhood,7,28 September 2012,"The minute I saw the Amblin Entertainment logo at the beginning of the film I said to myself, ""not another Spielburg film."" Still, can't really blame myself as I knew that Hook was a kids type movie and I should have expected it, though I did not realise it. Okay, I don't detest Speilburg films per se, rather I just find that they are generally not in my style. They do have some strong themes, but generally I see that they could have been much more powerful with a few modifications - and I am considering Saving Private Ryan at this point in time.The main comment with this movie is does Spielburg follow the advice that he seem to force through this film? The major theme here is that if we have kids, we should not only allow them to be children, but as parents, we should not let our professional life get in the way of the quality time we spend with our kids, or we may find that we quickly lose them.The bible instructs children to honour their parents, but it also instructs parents to love their children. This means that as parents we should not only raise our children appropriately, but we should be there for them when they need us, and we should encourage them in what they want to do. Having never had kids (except for those that I was able to give back at the end of the day) I cannot comprehend the difficulties of parenthood nor can I contemplate how to avoid the mistakes that my parent's made - and that is what we inherently try to do. My mother is constantly trying to shower us with love and affection, because she never received any from her mother.I would say I digress, but I do not, because childhood is the important part of this film. Not only does it instruct us to be there for our children, it also encourages us not to deny our childish side - the side were we simply forget that we are mature adults and have fun, and there are many ways we do that. I roleplay and play computer games. This is because we simply cannot live without fun.Hook is about Peter Pan when he has grown up. I assume that everybody knows who Peter Pan is, but the thing that I must mention is that he refused to grow up - that is until he visited Wendy one day and fell in love with Moira. He then shed his past and grew up to marry her. Now, many years later, he returns to London to be confronted with his old adversary Hook. The problem is that Peter has forgotten everything, and has three days to remember who he was so that he may confront the evil Captain Hook.The movie divides people into the lost children and the pirates. The pirates are the grown ups, and Peter is considered a pirate as he not only has forgotten who he was, but he has shed the idea of boyhood and considers himself an adult. Not only that, he refuses to let his children be children. In the end, he must confront his childhood and return to it, so that he may bring his children back to him.The thing that struck me with this movie is the sets - it is as if Spielburg returned to the glory days of film when everything was filmed on a set, and they were exquisite. I remember seeing the opening to Hans Christian Anderson and was stunned as to how beautiful this opening set was. If anything, Spielburg should be applauded for this.",Hook
40,slightlymad22,Misses The Mark On A Lot Of Levels,5,15 April 2018,"When it was first released, this movie caught me at totally the wrong time. I was 15 and my taste in movies was changing, I was a Robin Williams fan (thanks to movies such as The Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam and Awakenings) and I knew Dustin Hoffman was great due to the movies of his I had seen (Marathon Man, Rain Man, Tootsie and Midnight Cowboy) and based on the trailer, I was expecting something different to what was delivered. Dull, Bland, boring and (to steal a word from BobbyKlump) saccharine!! Spielberg's Daddy issues are right at the front and centre of this over long movie. Williams is your typical Spielberg Dad, in that he is absent (although he is present) with no time for his kids, as he is always at work. Or ignoring his kids whilst he deals with phone calls to do with work. When he is there he is usually snapping at them to shut up or grow up.It takes to long to get going, there are too many characters, too much bad acting (The Lost Boys are especially bad) and too many props. The whole thing looks like what it is, a movie set, right down to the unconvincing backdrops. Then there are the endings!! Not since LOTR: Return Of The King have I seen a movie with this many endings!! One after another. Farewells. Poignancy. Lessons to be learned. Speeches to be made. Tears to be shed. It is embarrassingly excessive.Of the cast Hoffman seems to think he is in a panto, Maggie Smith is a joy, I think the woman can do no wrong. Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott (as the Branning children) are probably the best performers in the movie. Blink and you will miss Gwenyth PaltrowJulia Roberts was nicknamed ""Tinkerhell"" because she was difficult to deal with, a reaction to her working conditions of solitude and green screen. Production had to be temporarily shut down, when she fled California after calling off her wedding to Kiefer Sutherland. A furious Spielberg threatened to fire her if she didn't return immediately.Hook grossed $119 million at the domestic box office, to end 1991 s the 6th highest grossing movie!! Finishing behind T2, Prince Of Thieves, Beauty & The Beast, Silence Of The Lambs and City Slickers.",Hook
41,zkonedog,"""Pan The Avenger Is Back...And The Hook Is Waiting""",10,1 March 2017,"Over a lifetime of watching movies, one thing I've come to understand is that criticism is just part of the game. One can make the greatest movie imaginable, and their will always be a sect that just doesn't like it. When it comes to ""Hook"", however, I still can't quite wrap my mind around the fact that it is so lowly-regarded by most critics. Have someone rank Steven Spielberg's films, and this one will likely be on the bottom. For the life of me, I cannot fathom such a statement about a movie where every single scene is either meaningful or poignant.For a basic plot summary, ""Hook"" tells the story of Peter Banning (Robin Williams), a miserly father and lawyer with little time for the ""distractions"" of his wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) or children Jack (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott). He also just so happens to be the heir of the family that made the Peter Pan stories famous, more specifically family matriarch Wendy (Maggie Smith). One night, a family outing on the town turns tragic when the returning adults are confronted by the empty beds of the children. The only evidence? A dagger and note bearing the mark of one Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman). It is then that Wendy reveals the family secret to Mr. Banning...that he is the real Peter Pan, and the only way to get his children back is to return to Neverland--with the help of a familiar little pixie (Julia Roberts)--and confront Hook.There are so many areas in which this movie succeeds admirably...-Every single scene is either pregnant with emotion or hilariously funny. -The soundtrack is one of the best from John Williams (and that is saying something!) -The acting is first-rate. Williams (always a bit under-appreciated in serious roles) shines brightest as the lead, but is closely match by Hoffman's swashbuckling Hook and the child actors. -The cinematography is stunning in how they create the look of the inhabitants of Neverland (Lost Boys, Pirates, etc.).Perhaps the main reason ""Hook"" is an all-time classic, though, is because of the themes it espouses. I mean, what better of an idea than to examine what a grown-up Pan would look like and how he could potentially re-capture that old magic. Of course, Spielberg being the master film-maker that he is, is able to relate those themes to everyday life. There is a particular plot thread in the movie involving Hook trying to turn Banning's son Jack into a pirate that will particularly hit close to home. Growing old and growing up is something we all can (and have to) relate to, so weaving those real-life themes into the Pan story is a genius move.Finally, ""Hook"" is a film that can be enjoyed by the entire family equally (and I truly mean equally...young and old). Youngsters will be intrigued and excited by the film's boundless energy (especially the ever-engaging Williams), while seasoned viewers will see the human commentary and be moved by the deep themes of family and staying young at heart.So, like I said in the beginning, I consider this to truly be one of my favorite films of all-time. In the words of Toodles (and blissfully ignoring the aptly-named critics, in this case): ""I haven't lost my marbles after all!!"". If you haven't enjoyed this movie with your entire family, you are missing a sincere treat.",Hook
42,filipemanuelneto,Return to Neverland.,6,9 February 2017,"Everyone knows the story of Peter Pan, the boy who never wanted to grow up and lived in Neverland, with the Lost Boys, fighting a pirate. In this Steven Spielberg movie, Pan moved to our world, grew up and forgot life in Neverland. However, when Captain Hook returns and kidnaps his children, Pan is forced to confront his past. Written in this way, the script summary seems even more appealing than the movie lets it show. The film is much warm and slower than I expected, and the simple fact that Pan has changed so much may displease those who expected a story closer to the original. Despite this, Robin Williams is convincing in the role of Pan and makes the character an element of humor, with his initial inability to remember the past and adapt to Neverland. However, he is much more restrained than in other more famous films. Julia Roberts plays Tinkerbell on a regular basis, but I did not feel much interest in the character, perhaps because of the way it was developed. Dustin Hoffmann shone on the role of the pirate villain, I loved seeing the way he played the character. Let it be said that the costume not only stayed exactly as I had imagined it but it was even more interesting, with all the exquisite details recalling the baroque aristocrats. Always around him, Bob Hoskins in the role of Smee, Hook's doormat, in an absolutely hilarious performance from an actor that I do not remember seeing much in comic characters. What I hated most about this film was the way the Lost Boys ended up portrayed, as if they were nothing more than bullies. A word still for the film's extraordinary settings, particularly for the pirate ship, which is literally the copy of what we can see in the animated film ""Peter Pan"" of the fifties, if I remember right.",Hook
43,leplatypus,Always Spielbergland ! (DVD),10,9 April 2007,"This movie brings back a lot of good memories. 1991: Before going to see the movie in theater, I had bought the sublime John Williams' soundtrack on tape! So, I got all the themes in my mind when I discovered the movie and it was a great addition to the pleasure !! (note for the coming of Indiana Jones IV: repeat this trick)2007: Now, with CDs, DVDs, Internet, entertainment is very different, but I still cherish much this movie: Maybe because Peter pan is a archetype for fantasy & Spielberg an archetype for great film-making so their meeting is unforgettable;Maybe for the exceptional cast (Williams, Hofman, Roberts, the kids,..);Maybe for the respectful and moving script which seems a natural sequel to the classic tale;Maybe for the great insight about fatherhood;Maybe for the incredible, beautiful & poetic sets, all done without digital effects Ah, you want some minor flaws: If Spielberg delivers as usual some great shoots (like the one between the jaws of the crocodile which is an echo both to ""Jaws"" & ""Jurassic Park), maybe he abuses of his ""glances-stare"" style: we don't see the action first but the reaction of the action on the faces of the characters...I read a critic saying that it is the first movie where Spielberg directs the death of a child! So yes, it is a bit strange that it happens in his Peter Pan. In addition, the lost boys are maybe too much impatient for war Again, it is Peter Pan !Finally, Peter's romances equal Casanova (he loved the mother but married the granddaughter while being the love struck of a faerie!At least, he stays faithful !

It a big and noisy and not that much fun. The sets are impressive and so is Dustin Hoffman's performance but the rest of the movie is pretty weak.

What a despicable premise for a movie-plot.HOOK could have only come out of the self-satisfied head of Steven Spielberg, one of America's most idiotic and over-rated directors, ever.The children portrayed in this flick actually made my skin crawl. Yes, they were that insufferable and obnoxious.According to this flick - Steven Spielberg is the self-appointed expert on rearing children. And, this joker says that mothers need only to be themselves. Yeah. That's OK. Mothers aren't required to do anything else, but, just that - Be mothers.But, on the other hand - Fathers must transcend beyond just being mere fathers. They must do cartwheels and, literally, turn into Peter Pan (just like Robin Williams did) before they can be allowed to gain acceptance from their snooty, little brats.It's the truth. If you pay real close attention to HOOK's unbelievably biased story it clearly defines the role of each parent in this ridiculous manner.And, with that in mind - I think that Spielberg should take a good, firm grip of HOOK, and shove it right up his keister.

48,smatysia,Total schmaltzfest,5,27 January 2015,"A total schmaltzfest. I get that Barrie's play was basically a children's story, but even so, it is a bit heavy on the melodrama. Let's face it, I am not in the demographic niche that they were going for. It was a bit poignant seeing Robin Williams' performance in light of his recent suicide. In spite of the criticism of Julia Roberts' performance, I thought she was quite good, whether she was an on-the-set diva or not. Dustin Hoffman was terrible. It looked clear that he thought that the material was beneath him, and he was right. Too bad they couldn't have gotten, say, Al Pacino, who loves to chew the scenery in whatever role he finds himself.

One of the things I liked most about it was Dustin Hoffman's villainous turn as the nefarious title character. If you ask me, it was funny when Rufio (Dante Basco) said, ""Looky, looky, I got Hooky."" If you want to know why he said that, you'll have to see the movie. Also, I though that the performances were top-notch, the casting was terrific, and the scenery was beautiful. Oh, and I also loved the music, especially the music that plays during the war. I hate to admit it, but that was my favorite part. In conclusion, I highly recommend this well-done live-action film adaptation of the J.M.

The storyline, which is none too inspiring until it gets going, follows Peter Pan back to Never Land where he must try to rescue his kids from the treacherous Hook. Here the movie becomes a delightful journey into fantasy, a must for children and the young at heart, as Spielberg lets loose as only he can.Many may find ""Hook"" silly, but I found it to be an enjoyable evening's entertainment.Tuesday, April 7, 1992 - Balwyn Cinema",Hook
51,ShootingShark,Brilliant And Very Underrated Spielberg Fantasy On Childhood Lost,8,15 June 2005,"Peter Pan grows up, gets married and forgets his past, turning into a fat boring corporate lawyer. He has two children but isn't a very good father, spending all his time on his work. During a visit to his Granny Wendy in London however, his past returns to haunt him when the villainous Captain Hook kidnaps the kids and holds them to ransom. Peter must return to Neverland, remember who he really is, and save his family.Hook is a terrific riff on J.M. Barrie's classic fantasy Peter Pan. Suppose Peter grew up ? And suppose Hook came after him for revenge ? Then suppose Hook decided not to kill Peter but to steal his son's affections instead ? Thanks to a great script by James V. Hart, Nick Castle and Malia Scotch Marmo, this movie combines all the high-spirited fun and adventure of the original stageplay with a wonderfully bittersweet nostalgia on childhood lost and the joys of parenthood. This isn't really a film for kids; like Drop Dead Fred it's really a film for adults with lots of goofy childish moments. Williams is excellent as Peter Pan, transforming from blinkered, out-of-shape, scaredy-cat into fighting, flying, crowing boy-hero, the kids are all great, and Hoskins has a scene-stealing role as the gleefully light-fingered, self-preserving Smee. An unlikely best of all however is Hoffman - whose method overacting I can normally just about manage to stomach - who is dazzling as the swashbuckling, iniquitous Captain James Hook, complete with batty wig, wall-to-wall histrionics (""Don't try to stop me Smee !!"", he bellows repeatedly, whilst faking a suicide attempt), a pathological fear of clocks and an accent you could curdle milk with. Hoffman extracts all the villainous comic potential possible from his performance, especially in a wonderfully wicked scene where he lectures the children on how much happier their parents were before they came along. Although not as acclaimed or as successful as many of his other movies, have no doubt - this is one of the extraordinarily gifted Spielberg's best films, and his talent shines through in every scene. Featuring fabulous sets for the Neverland locations, great flying effects and beautiful photography by Dean Cundey. My one gripe - the unnecessary romantic subplot with Tinkerbell, which adds nothing to the story and showcases far too much of the consistently awful Roberts. However, that cannot spoil what is a lovingly-made and ingenious fantasy, which gently reminds all adults what they once used to be. Good form !!",Hook
52,adamjohns-42575,Hook! Hook! Hook!,9,15 February 2021,"It's so nice to come back to a film that you saw with your Mother as a child and thoroughly enjoyed. Especially when you find that you still enjoy it, almost as much for the nostalgia of it as the story and production itself.If I ever get a chance to have kids I will certainly be showing this film to them.
Apart from Panning's mobile phone and Pan Am's decline, nothing has really dated it. The fantasy and the adventure are just as exciting and fun to watch now as a 40 year old as it was when I was 10 and I can't imagine even a modern 10 year old turning their noses up at this.Mr Williams, may he rest in peace, is superb as Peter, although a little hard to get on board with to start. It is such a shame that his star shines in heaven now, because he was such a wonderfully talented man and I miss seeing new things from him.
However, I think it is Mr Hoffman that really steals this show. He gives a fantastic portrayal here of the title character himself, Captain James T Cook (I'm not sure about the T, but it does have a familiar ring to it, don't you think?). As a kid I didn't even recognise Dustin. What a great performance. I love his banter with Bob (Smee) as well. It's a shame we don't see more of it. Bob, God rest his soul too, is great in these roles.
It's a shame then that they cast Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. For one thing, when last we saw Tink, she couldn't speak. Perhaps that would have worked better here too, as Roberts is just awful and her elaborated part of the story is actually a bit unnecessary anyway.There are also, so many great supporting actors as well, some of the kids are just the cutest things. Their lost boy characters really help to bring the fun to the screen.I remember having a crush on 'Don't Ask' and 'Rufio' even when I was 10. I also remember having the Rufio and Thudbutt action figures. You could roll Thud into a ball so he could speed down the stairs and bowl the bad guys over and Rufio came with the kick-ass sail board. It was very exciting and good fun.There are a few sickly sweet moments and I could have done without Maggie, the child, not Dame Smith who. . . Well words actually fail me as to how brilliant she is at everything she does, but there is also a lot of heart and well written humour to balance the sugar.
The film is well put together, with a great set and Spielberg gives his best as he always does.The story is lovely and I think it's an ideal follow on from Mr Barrie's original work that can be enjoyed by all generations for now and always.",Hook
53,truemythmedia,Classic,8,19 August 2019,"The themes of this movie resonate quite deep within me. It's weird to say that about a film that that has fat kid roll down a gangplank and bash into people like the boulder in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but, as I think about the lines that have stuck in my brain, attitudes I have adopted, and values I have incorporated into my being, a lot of them stem from ""Hook.""The first of these is the theme of growing up. I love me a movie about growing old, realizing what is truly valuable and understanding the nature of time and what it does to us time bound humans. I don't really know how much of this is touched on in the original Peter Pan stories or animated film or plays because I have never read nor watched them but it is one of the aspects of ""Hook"" that makes it hold up over the years.This theme may not be super obvious to a kid and was certainly lost on me as a child but the whole film is really about Peter (Robin Williams, ""The Fisher King"") reconciling the two parts of himself; the child who was Peter Pan, and the adult, Peter Banning. As a child he never wanted to grow up but as an adult he has so lost touch with his inner child that he doesn't even remember Neverland. He is a bifurcated man who needs healing.As Peter is learning to remember what it means to be a kid his son Jack is finding out what it means to grow up. He's learning that playing pirate all day may sound like fun for a time and it may seem that adults are unwilling to make time for him but in reality our choices have consequences and sometimes being a grown up means recognizing that your dad loves you even if he can't be there as much as he wants.Of course as a child, I didn't appreciate this at all. I just loved the fun of this film. I loved the sword fight between hook and Rufio, the food fight, the bangarang and the golden sword of pan. This movie is so 90s that a 90s kid like me can't help but love the inclusion of skateboards, spiky hair, and that most revered of all Saturday morning cartoon hero qualities, Attitude. I'm not sure ""Hook"" would play as well to a kid today but I loved it and still do, even as cringe at its lesser moments.Definitely, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell is one of the most annoying things in the film. She isn't composited well and at times it feels like they barely tried. It think I would have preferred if she had been just a twinkle of light the whole time, as she is during certain parts of the film.The child acting leaves a lot to be desired but that won't surprise anyone that remembers old Nickelodeon shows like ""Salute My Shorts"" or movies like ""The Sandlot"" or ""Heavyweights."" Even as a kid I couldn't stand the actor who plays Jack, although revisiting as an adult has revealed that he actually does quite well in some difficult scenes.If the child acting is just so-so, the rest of the adult cats is simply magic. Robin Williams really gives everything he has to both characters, Peter Banning and Peter Pan, who couldn't be more different. Banning is fat and tired, barely keeping up with the Lost Boys, and while dedicated to saving his kids, couldn't believe less in the whole Peter Pan thing. He's a classic cynic. However, once he's Peter Pan he is full of life, excitement, and the light in his eyes shine with hope and wild imagination. It isn't easy to play both of those roles and make them feel motivated, connected, yet dramatically different.Luckily, he's not the only one pulling his weight. One of the greatest over-the-top villain performances of all time is given by Dustin Hoffman (""Straw Dogs"") as Capt. James Hook. Cruel, petty, funny, manipulative, and cowardly. He's everything you want from a cartoon come to life and more.",Hook
54,Spleen,Even worse than you might think,4,16 July 1999,"I have the doubtful distinction of having seen ""Hook"" three times.  For the life of me I can't say how this happened.  Still, it's something to brag about in later years; for I very much doubt that even the misguided people who saw it a second time managed to see it a third time.What made me do it, you ask?  Well, it's like many fatalistic human impulses.  I continued to watch out of disbelief: for it seemed that something which was never very good managed to disintegrate more rapidly the more I stared at it.  Since I expect that no-one else in the world has seen it three times, I feel especially qualified to say what's wrong with it.Everything.  It's ugly.  The Lost Boys are loathsome (and so very 1980s). Julia Roberts is a ridiculous tinkerbell.  A hessian sack would have made a more flattering costume.  It's never clear to what extent magic is involved in the plot - whether, for instance, Peter's son forgets his father due to enchantment or for emotional reasons.  (It makes a HUGE difference to the story.)  The plot is lame and contrived.  The messages inherent in ""Close Encounters"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""E.T."" and ""Empire of the Sun"" - that only the especially depraved and wicked dislike children, that even the most appalling children are God's own angels - are rammed down the throat with excessive force here.But worst of all is the bitsiness.  I didn't have my stopwatch out (on any of the three occasions), but I think that ""Hook"" has the shortest romantic interlude of any film ever made.  It's between Peter Pan and Tinkerbell ... ""Tinkerbell - you're big!""  ""Yes, and I've always loved you.""  ""Oh - then I suppose I should kiss you.""  ""No - you should really rescue your children."" ""Okay.""  -It whips by!  And it's a scene that has no reason to exist; and, like every other scene, no relation to the scenes around it.  The entire film is like Spielberg's conception of Neverland: snow here, desert a metre away, sex just two paces to the left, childhood innocence two paces to the right ... all self-contained units, all tossed into the bowl hap-hazardly in the belief that a salad with every ingredient will taste better than a salad with just three or four.Anyone for a strawberry shortcake, gherkin and watercress salad?",Hook
55,Movie-ManDan,What If Peter Pan Grew Up?,7,6 April 2020,"Apparently the author of Peter Pan, JM Barrie had a thought of writing a sequel to his beloved classic some time before he died but it never came to be. Luckily Hollywood has its way of making something out of nothing. Take four of the hottest stars and the biggest director and greatness is bound to come. Is this truly a great movie? No. It is good. Nothing more.'Hook' is generally said to be one of those movies that was great when you were a kid but bad as an adult. I disagree. Sure the flaws are more noticeable, but there is too much good here to say it is bad.Robin Williams plays workaholic lawyer, Peter Banning who has no idea that he is the real Peter Pan. I never liked the first act that has Peter as a mean father and husband. Who wants to see that? Of course the idea is to show that Peter Pan lost his youth, but the movie goes too far the other way. He travels with his family to England where he reunited with his foster family. There, his children, Jack and Maggie, get kidnapped by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). Wendy (Dame Maggie Smith), now elderly tries to convince Peter of who he was, but Peter won't remember. Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) comes to take Peter to Neverland where a vengeful Hook awaits. His arrival the Neverland is when the movie gets good.So far, the movie is a dud. Peter is a terrible father and husband, but the movie was just in need of going somewhere.Director Steven Spielberg creates a beautiful Neverland. It is this setting that enhances the overall experience. It is inhabited by stereotypical pirates which is always funny, and very memorable children as the lost boys. The rulers of the fictional world, Hook and Smee are expertly portrayed by Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins. Hoffman is the closest thing this movie has to being considered ""masterful."" He's just brilliant.As Peter struggles to recount his roots to defeat Hook, it is the chemistry between the characters that keep this afloat. The biggest flaw is Hook trying to make Jack turn evil. I can see why they would try that, but it isn't executed well here. The other flaw in the Neverland sector is that it simply isn't ""great."" It is just good. The only ""great scene"" happens when Peter and the lost boys have dinner.In hindsight, 'Hook' is far from great. But it contains enough ingredients for any age group to be satisfied with. When the movie finished, Spielberg was not happy with the final cut. Considering when this was in his career, I can see why he would react that way. But from someone who has grown up with this and can see the good and bad, I can assure that the good outweighs the bad.3/4",Hook
56,nycritic,"Sinking, Sinking, Sunk.",4,9 June 2006,"The concept of innocence lost and regained has been done before. If Steven Spielberg wanted to do his own rendition of J. M. Barrie's story of Peter Pan, he should have done so instead of making Peter Pan become a 40-ish Peter Banning as played by the manic Robin Williams, living in the present, and being pulled back by a ruse that is as transparent as is it implausible. It's like reading one of the more derivative stories by Stephen King in which the adult character, having forgotten what made things tick, was forced to go back to face his inner demons and re-discover his inner child, not without some perils along the way.HOOK is not a bad movie. Well, it is. Sort of. It's just that for Spielberg to come up with something like this, he must have been fishing for ideas and nothing must have made sense. In any sense, this movie doesn't make much sense even when there are isolated moments that come through like the movie it should have and would have been had it not re-hashed the same material almost verbatim. Why would Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffmann) have to go through all that trouble to settle an old score with a boy who is now a man and is probably more interested in work than flying through the air in green leotards and electrocuted hair? It's unexplainable, but many things here are.See, I also don't remember Tinkerbell ever having had the hots for Peter. As a pixie reminiscent of Judy Garland and Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts is able to convey the elfish innocence of her character. It's when she start behaving like a woman smitten by the adult Peter is when I somehow lost focus, because it plainly did not make any bit of sense. Even Captain Hook seems like he belongs in a totally different story altogether, and those kids parading around with spiked hair were a complete nuisance. Even Glenn Close in her brief cameo as a bearded man was pointless.The only scenes that worked for me involved a young Gwyneth Paltrow as the eighteen year old Wendy, slowly changing to the more earthbound Maggie Smith. It's here where I stopped and paid attention, because in recalling his past, Peter Banning discovers how much he's lost, and how the world and Wendy moved on while he stayed in a state of arrested development. (Sounds like something a certain betrothed King of Pop has already done, but then again... someone needs to give Him a pebble -- he's light enough -- and tell him to go jump in a lake somewhere.) A tremendous misfire in almost every account, it's not Spielberg's best moment. That would happen less than two years later with his double whammy of JURASSIC PARK and SCHINDLER'S LIST.",Hook
57,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's fun but definitely has areas of question,6,28 June 2015,"The ability to make sequels to famous movies have been done but have proved to be quite a time consuming task. Even if the end result is lukewarm like Tron: Legacy (2010) or beyond expectation like Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), the amount of investment put into these types of cases take much longer to bring to fruition than your typical Hollywood cranked out ""every other year"" sequel. Unless the producers have a strategically laid out plan that goes beyond a couple years like Marvel Studios, the wait for how long it would take to make such a follow-up is unpredictable. The Terminator (1984) sequel came 7 years later while the Tron (1982) sequel arrived 28 years later, so it's hard to say. Take Walt Disney's Peter Pan (1953) animated feature. An actual animated sequel wasn't made until 49 years later but only on home video. Yes, it is a sequel but surely not something the studio probably put several decades into.Taking this live-action sequel into account is a whole different ball of wax. Unlike most sequels, this continuation of Peter Pan takes place several years after the events of Peter Pan (1953). Here viewers will see an older civilized Peter Pan (Robin Williams) during the modern day, married to the granddaughter of Wendy (Maggie Smith) from the original Disney classic. It is here that Pan and family travels to see Wendy in the same house the original took place in. Unbeknownst to them, Capt. James Hook (Dustin Hoffman) returns from Neverland and captures Pan's children Jack (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott), thus forcing Pan to return to a place he once forgotten. Directed by Steven Spielberg along with writing by Malia Scotch Marmo and James V. Hart, this sequel has its moments that don't all add up but it does have several fun parts as well. The best element to the writing are the characters and its overall message to its audience. Every actor that is shown on screen plays their roles well and even match the same attitude and tone of the 1953 animated feature.The actor who looked like he had the most fun was Dustin Hoffman who had numerous scenes that were quite comical. Hook still has a fear of clocks because of that pesky crocodile, we all remember that. Complimenting Hook is his partner Smee (Bob Hoskins) who sounds a lot like Jason Statham in this role. Nonetheless, Hoskins has a number of comical moments as well. The biggest subplot is the relationship between Pan and Jack. Charlie Korsmo best known for playing ""the kid"" in Dick Tracy (1990) is able to act in his role with more dialog this time. For Robin Williams, it is the transformation of his character of what he currently is back to what he once was. For that, the main idea is that no matter how old you get, it's important to never fully grow up and to live a little. For that reason alone, watching the transition of Peter Pan finding his old self is worth the watch. Plus like every Robin Williams performance, there's a bit of humor for everyone. There's also a bit of surprise casting, which include cameos from Jimmy Buffett, Tony Burton, Glenn Close and a couple others.What doesn't work in the movie's screenplay are its pacing at which scenes move, unexplained continuity and minor subplots. The running time to this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes - approximately clocking in as your typical Michael Bay time (minus the explosions) and after everything is said and done, it feels as if some cutting could have been made. There are some scenes where for example when Peter Pan reunites with the lost boys, feels drawn out for too long a time. Mind you this is just meeting them not working with them. For continuity, it's not bad in all places like the homages made to the original but when it comes to knowledge some things don't make sense. Do characters that live in Neverland really have the power of the ""all seeing eye""? Or do they just carry a magic crystal ball with them wherever they go? In some ways they seem more omnipotent that usual. Even a main character asks this question and no clear answer is given.The other issue is a minor subplot dealing with Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and Peter Pan. I'm pretty sure it was noticeable in the original that their was some kind of romantic tension between Tink and any other female that wanted to spend time with Pan, but there's one scene where Tinkerbell just comes straight out and kisses Pan and its never addressed again. Okay,...weird. Anything else used in the film however was well made. The special/practical effects for 1991 look well meshed with the live-action and cinematography. Dean Cundey who was director of photography got nice looking landscape shots along with beautiful matte paintings, which look great. As for music, legendary John Williams composed the score. Although the main theme is not as highly memorable as his Superman (1978), Star Wars (1977) or Jurassic Park (1993) motifs, the music is still lively and entertaining. There is one track though that takes place at a baseball field and it sounds like it belongs to The Peanuts. Odd.For 2 and a half-hour movie, it certainly feels like there was unnecessary padding. That and it has continuity issues and an unfinished subplot. However, other than that the actors perform well, the music sounds good, the cinematography is in large scale and the main message of never growing up is always something to keep in mind.",Hook
58,rannynm,Everything looks real. You want to jump through the screen and fly with them.,10,8 January 2013,"Tick Tock Tick Tock hum Who is afraid of this noise? The great Capitan James Hook (Dustin Hoffman). He is lonely and misses his rival Peter Pan. Peter is all grown up with a wife and two children living a normal life. When he goes to London to visit Wendy who found him a family when he had none, Hook steals his children. Peter has forgotten all about Neverland. Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) who still adores Peter Pan comes to the rescue and flies him back to Neverland. He cannot fly anymore because he has forgotten how. Hook is sadly disappointed to find that Peter is all grown up and has forgotten how to play, much less fight. Tinker Bell has three days to get Peter Pan back in shape. He has been gone a long time and the Lost Boys have a new leader Rufio. They do not believe that Robin Williams is Pan the Man. My favorite scene was the food fight. It was funny and a great idea. In order to have food you have to imagine what you want to eat, and there it is. If you lose your imagination, you will just be hungry. I love the mermaids. They look so real. Tinker Bell is my favorite character because she is the cutest pixie ever. She is small, could fly and has an adorable house. Captain Hook is the best I have ever seen. He is funny yet has a mean streak. Snead (Bob Hoskins) the Captain's assistant is played perfectly and Hook would be no where without him. Steven Spielberg makes another movie which has me laughing, crying and cheering. There are the coolest sets. The great pirate ship, the Lost Boys hideout and Tinker Bell's space are all done with great detail. Everything looks real and I wanted to jump through the screen and learn how to fly and live there for a while. It looks like I always imagined it would. Second star to the right and fly on until morning. The costume designers and make-up artists are outstanding. They do a believable job of making all characters look perfect. Is Peter Pan ever going to remember how to fly so he can rescue his children from the pirates? Yes, there are a lot of pirates. Children and adults of all ages will love this movie.

Oh, and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. I'm sorry but Julia Roberts is a one-character actress. All she ever plays are vulnerable women with social interaction problems. It's just boring predicting every shy look that she's about to give!Compared to the new film, this doesn't stand up well, either as a direct comparison, or even allowing for the ten odd years since it was made. Even as a flat out comedy it just isn't funny. The combo of Hoffman and Williams just doesn't work.If you have any say in the matter, don't bother with this one. It's not worth it.EDIT: Oooh!

This crass, dismal, predictable, shallow effort seems to be expressly intended for just such an audience of spoilt, fat, junk-food addictive brats as those who feature in it.An almost unrecognisable Dustin Hoffman plays the titular Captain of the story, Bob Hoskins is Smee, the first mate. They make a rumbustious effort to bring 'fun' into an idea that was doomed from the outset. The biggest mistake of all was to script Mr Lachrimosity Williams in the role of a grown-up-and-passed-it Peter Pan. This part was absolutely made for Whacko Jacko.The script is cringeworthy, the sight-gags silly and predictable. Big Stevie's attempt at modernisation with 'street cred' is enough to pucker the most self-respecting sphincter.Quite simply; it's a junk movie aimed at the junk-food, junk-entertainment, junk-education generation.

Until today, the best captain James Hook played is from this movie( with a great work of Dustin Hoffman) and so is Tinkerbell(Julia Roberts). The whole idea about Peter Pan being an adult,married, with kids, in our modern world is very original.Peter needs to rescue his children that were kidnapped by the captain James Hook, who wants revenge,but first Peter needs to remember how is to be a child again and make his imagination and memories to work.Hook is a masterpiece and I would really recommend it for people from all ages.:)",Hook

Peter (Robin Williams) has grown into a successful lawyer and has forgotten his past. He must return to Neverland and learn how to fly once again.This film, shown often on cable, is one of those movies I can't watch because I know that one of the lost boys gets killed viciously near the end, by Capt. Hook, in a sword fight. Other movies that I can't stand are ""Sophie's Choice"" (I hate the ending) and ""Lost in Space"" (Dr. Smith becomes a giant mutated bug). If I ever end up in the ""fiery furnace"" I would expect to see all 3 of these films, along with ""Star Wars Episode III"" and ""Star Trek V"". That would be torture, indeed. This film has so much going for it. Dustin Hoffman is deliciously wicked as Capt. Hook. Robin Williams is great as an all-grown up Peter Pan. Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell is sexy and terrific and has a real ""thing"" for Peter Pan. If only that one unexpected nightmarish scene wasn't there. It even seems out-of-place. Films are often revised and have portions re-shot after audience previews. I remember the ""gasps""when this happened at the movies.

63,sme_no_densetsu,An unfairly maligned Spielberg effort,8,23 August 2016,"Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" may not have the cachet of some of his other films like ""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan""... well, you get the idea. In a career studded with bona fide cinematic classics, ""Hook"" is easy to overlook. Even Spielberg himself isn't very fond of it. However, it's my opinion (and it's an opinion that seems to be shared by many) that ""Hook"" is a lot better than people give it credit for.Certainly, the mere involvement of Steven Spielberg in a directing capacity is a big step in the right direction. The movie unabashedly bears his trademarks; not just a masterful grasp of visual storytelling but also his ability to coax memorable performances from youngsters and his exploration of father-son relationships. Bolstering the visual presentation, the production design, costumes & cinematography all show meticulous attention to detail. On top of that, there's a score by John Williams. What more could you ask for from a technical standpoint?Of course, all of the production values in the world wouldn't make any difference if the story was no good. Here, the movie hooks us with a unique premise whereby Peter Pan has grown up and must rediscover his identity in order to rescue his children from the clutches of the villainous Captain Hook. Some viewers seem to find the story schmaltzy but I feel that it has some real dramatic heft rather than being built on routine Hollywood artifice. There's also no shortage of action & adventure, though that's (understandably) tailored to a younger audience. That's not to say that it isn't entertaining to the nostalgic or the young at heart, though.As for the cast, Robin Williams & Dustin Hoffman both shone in their respective starring roles as Peter Pan & Captain Hook. Williams is his usual affable self while Hoffman is nearly unrecognizable. Both appeared to enjoy themselves immensely in bringing this fantasy adventure to life. In support, the always reliable Maggie Smith is a welcome presence while Bob Hoskins & Julia Roberts also made an impression. The cast's many children, guided by Spielberg's directorial expertise, held their own next to their elders.It's most likely that the keenest fans of this movie are those who first saw it as children, like myself. Nevertheless, I was surprised to find out how well the movie holds up after 25 years. Granted, it's not even in my top 10 Spielberg movies but that's more of a testament to the quality of his work over the years. In the end, ""Hook"" is a worthwhile fantasy adventure that would probably be lauded as a classic kids' movie if it had been directed by anyone other than Spielberg.",Hook

65,BrandtSponseller,"If this were wrestling, I'd call it a 'Reverse M. Night Shyamalan'",8,29 January 2005,"What if the Peter Pan story was ""real"", and Peter had finally decided to depart Neverland, grow up, get married, have two kids and become a lawyer? M. Night Shyamalan has become famous by using a very clever ""gimmick"" of sorts--he makes films that are largely realist dramas, but that have a ""twist"" near the end where it's revealed that the whole film was really a genre film (""genre films"" is a general term that is used primarily for works made that fall under what are normally considered the ""fan boy"" genres, especially the fantasy genres, which includes most horror and sci-fi). Director Steven Spielberg's Hook, although structurally the same as a Shyamalan film initially, brings its twist earlier and more literally transforms into a genre film, so that it ends up being primarily a kid-oriented fantasy (partially meaning that it's a bit heavier on the comedy) where the twist is that it is actually a realist drama--it's a kind of ""reverse M. Night Shyamalan"". Shyamalan does horror, or fantasy, or sci-fi masquerading as a realist drama. Hook is realist drama masquerading as a fantasy film.The above fact is probably a large part of the reason why some viewers end up not liking the film very much. The animated Peter Pan by Disney, which is certainly the most famous filmed version of Pan, is manically paced and plotted--it's almost anarchic in a way. It's big on action, comedy and what sci-fi fans used to call a ""sense of wonder"", which is a kind of awe in response to a thoroughgoing portrayal of a captivating fantasy world. Except for small doses and a climax that is very different in flavor from the rest of the film, Hook is not very big on action or a ""sense of wonder"", the comedy is closer to a classical literary sense of ""comedy"", and the pacing is closer to, say, Big Fish (2003). The film is even bookended with material that suggests that all of the fantasy may have been merely a dream. This is really a more adult Pan in many ways. To appreciate the film, a viewer has to slow down and not expect chaotic merriment at every turn.Both of the main characters, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, are excellent. Hoffman is almost unrecognizable. For the little bit that she's in the film, Maggie Smith is also excellent. The rest of the cast is good. The only performance I don't care so much for is Julia Roberts', but she is far from my favorite actress. I tend to dislike her as often as not.With the realist drama approach, Spielberg manages to give the performances in the fantasy portion of the film a bizarre turn, as most of the characters in Neverland seem to be bordering on a hammy insanity. That might not work for a lot of viewers, but I love it--keep in mind, though, that I especially love surrealism, camp and absurdism. Some sections of the Neverland material, especially the scenes with the Lost Boys, also have a colorful everything-but-the-kitchen-sink flavor, ala The Wiz (1978) or Batman & Robin (1997), both films that Joel Schumacher was involved with, curiously enough. I also like that approach, and I'm a (rare) fan of both of those films.It's interesting to note that even with the very different tenor of Hook compared with Peter Pan (1953), Spielberg translates almost every major character and plot element to his film in some way, with the most notable (and to me, lamentable) absence being the American Indian characters, who were surely omitted for reasons of political correctness (the 1953 Pan film being now seen as ""offensive"" by some people in its portrayal of American Indians).Some of the technical elements are rather nondescript but certainly competent, such as the bulk of the cinematography, and some are rather pedestrian or clichéd, such as the score. But overall this is an entertaining if unusual film. My final score was 8 out of 10.",Hook
66,jeremycrimsonfox,A Good Twist To A Classic Tale,8,17 March 2020,"Peter Pan is a classic tale that has had its fair share of movie adaptations (the best one being the Disney adaptation, which led to many sequels and spin-off series involving characters from it). Hook adds a twist to the classic tale, as Peter stays on Earth and is married with two children, Jack and Maggie, with his wife, Moira. Sadly, Peter's work is causing strain to his marriage as he ends up breaking promises he makes them, and during a visit to London, his kids are kidnapped by Captain Hook, who is seeking revenge on him. Brought back to Neverland by Tinkerbell, Peter must now relearn what made him Peter Pan in order to save his kids and Neverland from the evil pirate, who has managed to take over while Peter was away.I actually like this film. Robin Williams does a good job playing Peter, and Dustin Hoffman makes a good Hook. Other notable actors include Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Bob Hoskins as Smee, and even musician Phil Collins makes an appearance as a minor character. Also, the Neverland scenes are impressive, with some good props, and even a good underwater scene with the mermaids helping Peter recover.

68,vip_ebriega,"A disappointment, but quite an interesting one.",5,3 January 2009,"My Take: A profound disappointment from Spielberg that does have its savory moments.After a big disappointment in his below-average remake ALWAYS, Spielberg gives us yet another, this time with twice the budget. HOOK, released a year or so after ALWAYS, is Spielberg's big budget disappointment packed with some astonishing special effects, imaginative settings, colorful costumes, a big cast and a helluva budget. Unfortunately, its also bogged down by a half-baked story and potential that is never really fulfilled. Although bubbly and colorful, we're expecting more from a $70 million-worth production. Actually, with its elaborate settings and appealing charms, I actually loved HOOK as a kid. But after seeing it again one night, after all these years, HOOK hasn't aged real well. For a movie directed by one of the most reliable men at Hollywood, HOOK is quite a disappointment. Though sometimes, the imagination that went to the production design and special effects are noteworthy.Peter Pan has grown up. Now Peter Banning (Robin Williams): married, successful, and a workaholic, Peter is no intention, or even memory at all, about his past as ""The Boy who Never Grew Up"". But when his kids are kidnapped by his old nemesis, the evil Capt. James Hook (Dustin Hoffman, serving up a loaf of ham), Peter has no choice but to head back to Neverland, be sprayed again by Pixie dust, courtesy of his old friend Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts, slightly uncomfortable), and reclaim his forgotten destiny. The story seemed fine on paper, and I actually like how the story is. It's how it goes that isn't very good. In addition to Spielberg's decline on overdone slapstick humor (the film does cost a lot, so why not spend it?), they also throw in a band of annoying, screaming Lost Boys who look more like they escaped from an audition from a GOONIES sequel. Other than that, Spielberg doesn't have much control on a few scenes, which are either tedious (when the film requires the characters to talk) or downright overcooked (the boys tormenting Pan with all sort of pie-on-the-face mayhem).HOOK, however, earns points for the creativity and imagination devoted on special effects, costumes and set designs. The environments at Neverland couldn't have been more faithful to pages from a storybook. John Williams also deserves some credit for composing a dazzling score (including a sentimental song titled ""When You're Alone""). But considering the potential that went into production, we could have expected something more.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Hook

That's what Hook does. Robin Williams plays grown up Peter Pan, under the pseudo name Peter Panning, who has no memory of life before he was adopted at the age of thirteen. His own children are kidnapped by the evil pirate Cpt. James Hook (Dustin Hoffman) and his sidekick Smee (Bob Hoskins), who are planning on making Pan return to fight a final battle. Grown up, out of shape, and unable to imagine or believe in fantasies, Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and the lost boys must help Pan remember, and get him into fighting shape to face off against Hook and win back his children.Directed by Steven Spielberg this is a fun 90's film which at the time of its release did really well. Re-watching the film 23-30 years later shows it to be a little dated in CGI and special effects but none the less, remove yourself from the judgement of things like this and the charm of the film makes it enjoyable still. John Williams' music score carries Spielberg's vision to another level with it's enchanting pacing and melodies.I was never a massive Robin Williams fan but this isn't his worst performance by a long way. The standout showing in the film though has to be Hoffman as the almost pantomime villain Cpt. Hook. He looks like I'd image and carries a performance off that feels as though it's authentic.I'd aware this 6 out of 10.

Hook, it's up to Peter to get them back, but that's easier said than done. His memory of how he came to be, and especially his time in Neverland, isn't intact and it takes a lot of effort from everyone and especially himself to regain it.And let me say that the sets and the backgrounds of Neverland still haunt my mind.

72,Atreyu_II,One of the movies which create more mixed feelings,7,24 November 2007,"""Hook"" is positively one of Steven Spielberg's least appreciated movies, maybe even one of the most underrated films of all time.Although nowadays I don't appreciate Peter Pan's stories as much as I used to, the truth is that this is a different and unique take on Peter Pan's story.This motion picture has many good things: adventure, magic, special effects, humor, beautiful landscapes and sceneries and a wonderful John Williams's score.Speaking of attention to detail, check out the Neverland, for example: it looks nice, quite detailed and carefully made. Captain Hook's ship is a nice ship and he's got a nice and valuable museum of clocks of the finest quality.The worst things about this movie are: when Captain Hook sends a pirate to The Boo Box (a very hard scene to watch) and also when Peter and Rufio exchange insults to each other during the dinner - in fact, there is some really nasty language here. There is also some rude language in some other scenes. Plus, the movie is quite long.The Banning kids (Jack and Maggie) are likable. Maggie is loving, while Jack is a bit wilder. Both are well played by the actors.Captain Hook is obviously very evil, but a humorous villain. Dustin Hoffman's performance as Captain Hook is incredible. He's almost unrecognizable in this film. Even when his long hair is briefly taken off, he still looks so different. What a brilliant actor! Dustin Hoffman, more than playing the characters, seems to become them.Bob Hoskins is great as Smee. And he looks so different here to the point of being nearly unrecognizable, with that beird and those pirate clothes. Not to mention his English accent, another thing that sets him apart from Eddie Valiant (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""). Robin Williams plays well the role of Peter Banning/Pan. But his constant ""Bangerang!"" or whatever he says can become tiring.Julia Roberts is great as Tinkerbell. This is her best role ever and her best acting ever. And it's amazing how they made her look so tiny. Besides, unlike in Disney's version (which Tinkerbell is jealous, cold and a traitor), Tinkerbell here is kind and likable. Julia Roberts even looks pretty in this film and her legs are lovely.The funniest gags of this film are: when Peter Banning says «I'm not that kind of lawyer!»; when Maggie yells «You needed a mother very badly!» to Captain Hook; when Maggie says that Hook «is just a bad man without a mother»; Captain Hook's last words, which ironically are «I want my mommy!»; Hook's fear towards the sounds of clocks; when a miniature of Captain Hook's ship is on fire and sinks; when the pirates yell «Run home, Jack!» by mistake instead of «Home run, Jack!»; Captain Hook's funny attempt to commit suicide, repeatedly forbidding Smee to try to stop him and suddenly ordering him to stop him; Jack yelling «Bang! Bang!» after a sarcastic comment from his father.This film is probably the best prove why Steven Spielberg is considered the «Peter Pan of Hollywood».",Hook

Then, something happens - we leave the real world for Neverland and meet a great Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, so far so good, but already in Neverland we sense that things are falling apart. The story looses its magic, it's mystery and excitement, and although there are many famous actors around, few makes much impact apart from Hoffman, Charlie Korsmo (as Peter Pan's son) and Robin Williams, which I think does one of his best performances. The emotional aspect of the film is at times very capturing, and one can sense that Spielberg is quite personal throughout with his strong will in children and everything they symbolize and represent.

Watching it recently as a young adult, I still love this movie. The performances are wonderful. Robin Williams always makes a good protagonist and is thoroughly entertaining with the funny voices he makes and the lines he delivers. In Hook, he's like a big kid. Julia Roberts, as usual, is lovely as the stout and comical Tinkerbell. But I felt the real magic came from Dustin Hoffman as the infamous Captain Hook and Bob Hoskins as his sidekick Smee. Both not only fit their roles perfectly, but they are also funny and steal the show a little bit. Maggie Smith is also an excellent addition as Wendy Darling.I heard it took thirty or so sets to make this film, which makes the costs very high to make this film. However, each one adds a uniqueness and grandeur that does not necessarily recreate the Neverland that I remember from the 1953 cartoon, but makes it bigger, elaborate, and real. The costume designs, artistic work of the make up, and visual effects plaster the film and imagination of such a world created by John M. Barre. Now a junkie of Oscar history, I'm very surprised that this film did not receive those awards.Like with all of Spielberg's movies, John Williams makes an outstanding score, although I will admit that it sometimes has a slight feel of Home Alone. Nonetheless, it helps bring the film to life at intense levels.As with the plot, I did not find any of it hokey that some other critics complain about the film. Sure, it's not in the league of The Godfather's or Schindler's List's, but it's a fantasy. It's not supposed to be serious. On a side note, the movie has the moral of ""family coming first over everything else"" and that happiness and imagination cannot die.

The problem is, however, that HOOK turned out to be perhaps the most self-indulgent film he has ever made, certainly since the overblown ""1941"". Everything about HOOK screams ""Gaudy!"".  Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are well-matched as, respectively, Peter Pan and Captain Hook.  But the Lost Boys are simply the most irritating bunch of brats ever seen on the screen; Spielberg simply lost me right here.  And Julia Roberts, who is normally quite appealing (PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL), is absolutely awful as Tinkerbell.  And that's not all: the production design and the cinematography, normally great things in a Spielberg film, are barely average.I like much of what Spielberg has done, but HOOK is the one film (besides ""1941"") that I wish he either had never made or had made much better than he did.  Luckily, however, he survived this debacle as he had ""1941""--with flying colors.",Hook
80,Peach-2,Spielberg missed this one.,7,20 December 1998,"Hook is one of Steven Spielberg's near misses. At least it shows that he is a normal director sometimes. I mean he cranks out great film after great film, so he was due for a weaker film. This one is overlong and very pretentious. Don't get me wrong this film isn't bad, it's just not as good as it could have been. A lot of great talent in this film. Dustin Hoffman's turn as Captin Hook is inspired, but Robin Wiliams portrayal of Peter Pan is very goofy. I will say that the film's score is awesome. Kids will probably dig it, but most adults won't care. I think making adults care is the whole point of this film.",Hook
81,departed07,A crummy beginning leads to a better conclusion,8,20 May 2008,"A lot of people must've been pulling hairs out of their head once people saw Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"" in the big and small screen; critics also commented the film for being too much sad for a Peter Pan movie unlike the Disney cartoon. But knowing Steven Spielberg, he always has tricks up his sleeves to make things better.The film starts with Peter Banning (Robin Williams), an uptight business man who doesn't have the guts to say no to a deal and yes to his family's needs. Everywhere he goes, Peter carries a cell phone with him and interrupts moments from his daughter's school play to missing out on his son's baseball game. Peter's very uptight about a lot of things and doesn't know how to relax and just say ""what the hell."" It's not until him, his wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) and their two children Jack (Charlie Korsmo of Dick Tracy) and Maggie (Amber Scott) go to England to visit their Granny Wendy (Dame Maggie Smith) for a benefit of a children's hospital before the children are kidnapped. What's strange about the kidnapping is that it's from Captain James Hook, Peter Pan's old nemesis, where not even Peter Banning can't except the fact that he was the young boy in green tights that fought the devilish pirate.Now what kind of life is that? Peter Pan all grown up and fat! Peter Pan's got a cell phone and doesn't know how to be a kid again! So now with the help of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts), she brings Peter to Neverland where he sees that Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) has his kids. When Peter and Hook meet face to face, the captain himself is laughing that his nemesis is old, fat, scared and doesn't know how to fly which even shocks all the pirates in the boat. After being booted off the boat and taken to another part of the island, Peter meets with the lost boys, a group of orphans who defend themselves against Hook and his band of pirates, while meeting with the rebellious Rufio (Dante Basco) who doesn't believe the old man is Peter Pan until later on in the film.The first part dealing with Robin Williams as a frustrated Peter Pan doesn't work where fans are not used to him being an angry person but more funny and charming nor seeing Peter as an adult, but the rest of the film on Neverland works like a charm where the set designs are sculpted beautifully. The acting works on some levels where I couldn't believe that Dustin Hoffman could play a somewhat kooky version of Captain Hook; Julia Roberts doesn't work as Tinkerbell, but it was probably Steven's choice to bring in an all star cast from Williams, Hoffman, Roberts, Smith, Bob Hopkins, Phil Collins, Glenn Close (playing a man) and others for this film.I like it!",Hook

85,DavidSim240183,Definitely a Spielberg misfire,4,9 November 2007,"Everyone seems to agree that Hook was one of Steven Spielberg's great disappointments. It was a reasonable hit after the financial failure of Always, but it was unanimously critically savaged. Even now, 16 years later, and unlike some of Spielberg's less regarded films, people's opinions of it remain unchanged.When Spielberg has his eye on the ball, he can be a fantastic filmmaker. Duel and Jaws were gruelling experiences that left one physically and mentally drained. Terrific entertainment! And when Spielberg concentrates on more sentimental stories, they can be incredibly tender like Schindler's List and AI. But if he indulges child-like sentiment too much, he turns out overrated mush like ET. And Hook.Hook is more flawed than any other Spielberg film. Yes it does ask the intriguing question, what if Peter Pan grew up? But the way the film answers it simply doesn't work. There's a clumsiness to its storytelling, and bar a few genuinely exhilarating moments here and there, much of Spielberg's usual magic is sadly absent.The grown up Peter Pan, now Peter Banning, and played by Robin Williams is a ruthless corporate raider. In a bizarre twist, Peter has become a modern day pirate. He has little time for his wife Moira, and even less time for his children Jack and Maggie. When he visits London for Christmas, Wendy (Maggie Smith) is not the young lady she once was. And she's devastated to learn Peter's not what he used to be either. All the child like innocence and youthful exuberance he once had have all but vanished over the years.But he must get it back. Because Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) has just kidnapped Jack and Maggie, and with the aid of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and the Lost Boys, Peter must rediscover his long forgotten past, and become Peter Pan once more.I think the reason why Hook is such an abject failure is because Spielberg's need for mawkish sentiment really goes into overdrive here. There are all the usual Spielberg trademarks. The inattentive father. Carefully calculated emotional cues. And most importantly, the idea of the fantastical coming into contact with the ordinary. But really, nothing comes off. I was so disappointed with the film. Robin Williams is certainly impish enough. But he only falls into the usual woolly headed sludge that would become his trademark in the 90s. Hook was just for starters.Dustin Hoffman is much too pantomimic and theatrical as Captain Hook. He adopts a perfect Etonian accent, and looks every inch the character, but never elevates it to threatening status. Even if he looks like he's having the most fun. Julia Roberts is horribly miscast as Tinkerbell. The Disney version had more screen appeal and she never even had to say a word. The miniaturised Roberts struts around the set with giant size fairy wings on her back not doing much of anything else. And her American accent quickly grates. At least Bob Hoskins makes for an entertaining Smee. His scenes with Hoffman are fun, so I suppose the film isn't a total waste.Roger Ebert thought the Lost Boys looked like they'd walked off the set of Oliver!, and as I was watching the film, I was thinking the same thing. Spielberg is usually reliable for getting good performances out of children, but this time there are just too many to take into account. They're skateboarding(!) and foodfights are frankly just boring.And I thought the film wasted Maggie Smith. Such a fantastic actress as her should not be shelved aside. The idea of an elderly Wendy is a fascinating one, but it doesn't even try to explore it. Hook sadly underutilises one of Hollywood's greatest unsung actresses.But the biggest disappointment of all is Never-Never Land itself. I was expecting an extraordinary fantastical wonderland. What we get instead is a curiously stagebound setting. NeverLand looks exactly like the set that it is. And the special effects are well below the high standards of Spielberg. Obvious back-projections. Flat surroundings. Spielberg must really have been having an off-day when he made Hook.There are a few moments that show some of Spielberg's magical touch. I loved the scene when Peter rediscovers himself as Peter Pan. Its quite well written and ends in a haunting epiphany. Its just a shame that it takes so long building up to it. Still, the scenes of Peter soaring through the sky are wonderful, and makes your heart truly sing. Its the one genuine triumphal act of the entire film.But the rest of the film seldom flies as high. Hook is too juvenile for its own good, and the journey from Peter Banning to Peter Pan is much too long. Even the climax feels too wound up to make any kind of impact. An utter disappointment. Spielberg's worst film of the 90s.",Hook
86,moviemanMA,A Great Adventure,7,15 July 2005,"The story Peter Pan has fascinated children and adults all over the world and has been made into movies and musicals. The idea of never growing up and always having fun and adventure seems to captivate people of all ages. But what would happen if Peter Pan did grow up and left Never Land.In Steven Spielberg's Hook, Robin Williams plays Peter Banning, an orphan turned into a work-aholic father of two children Jack and Maggie, and wife to Moira. Her grandmother is called Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) who claims to be the real Wendy from J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. When Peter and his family go to London they star with Granny Wendy. One night after coming back from a dinner in Granny Wendy's honor, they discover the children to be gone. They find a note signed Captain James S. Hook. The police have no leads and Peter is upset. Granny Wendy decides it is time to tell Peter his true identity...he is Peter Pan. Peter is freaked out and doesn't believe it until he has a visitor that night; his long time friend Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts). Tink, as she likes to be called, takes Peter back home to Never Land.The story revolves around Peter trying to get his kids back from Captain Hook played wonderfully by Dustin Hoffman and Peter trying to find his true identity. The change from civilization to fantasy is a little hard for him to handle. Trying to convince the Lost Boys that he is Peter Pan and that he has kids is difficult and they put him through a lot. With the help of Tink and the Lost Boys, they try to get back Jack and Maggie from Hook and his plan with the help of his first mate Smee (Bob Hoskins) to make the children love him.What makes this movie so enjoyable is the combination between the real world and the fantasy world of Never Land. Williams is a very believable Peter Pan, despite his size and age, as well as Roberts as Tink. These two make a great duo to face off against Hook. This movie isn't just for kids. It's a perfect mix of adventure and fantasy that is fun for the whole family. It will bring a smile to anyone's face. How can it not with music by John WIlliams? This movie is ""Bangarang!""",Hook
87,djfrost-46786,Grew up with this movie,5,19 May 2018,"I grew loving this movie. Maybe I watched it too many times. The production is great/ graphics. The story could be good. This movie isn't really that good. Could be good for kids, but Goonies IS great for ANYONE even today. This is average with HUGE actors.",Hook
88,kdnor2011,I like it,8,20 June 2011,"Hook seems to be a love it or hate it film. And I bet that there are some people who hate the film they will say that the only reason people love the film is because they're looking at it through ""nostalgia goggles."" That they only like it because they liked it when they were younger. Well I loved it, or at least really enjoyed it, and I didn't see it when I was younger. I didn't watch it until I was eighteen years old, and I liked it a lot. Maybe it's because I'm a Spielberg fan-boy? Well I wasn't that big a fan of Amistad, Minority Report, Catch me if You Can, and I will fully admit that 1941 sucked.Now this movie wasn't perfect, there are quite a few plot holes, like how Peter keeps growing up despite being in Neverland, the place where you're never supposed to age. I don't really like the beginning, I just find it so mean spirited that I hate watching it. Some may not like that Tinkerbell can talk, I didn't mind this. And some also feel that it get's way too ""smaultsy."" Personally I think it has a nice balance, but at some points, yeah, it can be trying a little too hard.Robin Williams and the lost boys are all funny and likable, but by far the best parts of the movie are the ones with Captain Hook and Smee, Dustin Hoffman and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely hilarious, and their plan to steal Peter's children away from him is a great villainous scheme. I heard that Spielberg was on autopilot with this one, which I can't agree with. In my opinion the set designs, makeup, and overall scope and feel of the movie showed that Spielberg really loved working on this movie. Most of the special effects hold up well too after 21 years, I could tell how most of them were done, but they still look pretty good, most of them at least. And I really like this story, how Peter must find his inner child and yet can still be an adult. And how Hook tries to ruin Pan physically and emotionally by stealing his child.Hook certainly doesn't rank up there with Jurassic Park, E.T. or Close Encounters, but it's a very enjoyable, very well made, movie with great, funny characters. And remember, I don't have any nostalgia for this film.",Hook

When I first saw it I had rented it on a VHS Tape and after I watched it I read Terry Brooks novelization. and I thought why does every one hate this film. I thought it was marvelous. And Fun. The film was fun. You can't take it seriously because really it is a tale of Peter Pan. Peter Grew up despite his promise never to. And He has two kids. Who are Kidnapped by Captain James Hook. Peter has to remember how to become Peter Pan. The fun here is in the journey. And fun it is. There is action. comedy . Drama. and most of all a great story. I think Hook is a film that failed at the box office and became a hit after it's release on VHS and it became a classic after DVD and Blu Ray. Hook is the family film.

94,Donatien3,A Predictable Missed Opportunity,7,1 January 2021,"It's 1991, and you've got a blockbuster family film directed by Steven Spielberg and featuring a top-shelf cast: Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts, Maggie Smith, and Bob Hoskins. Surely that's a no risk smash hit, right?Unfortunately, the interesting ""what if Peter Pan grew up"" premise is ruined by its going-through-the-motions predictably. Uptight, work-obsessed Peter Banning (Williams) is forced to become Peter Pan again to save his kids from Captain Hook (Hoffman). With an unrealistic three-day deadline (seriously, just three days to recover 20-plus years of lost memories?), Banning becomes Pan, defeats Hook, and gets his kids back. It's never really in doubt as - after a training montage with the Lost Boys - Peter quickly rediscovers his mojo during an imagination-fuelled food fight.Hook's demise is odd as he gets swallowed by a seemingly inanimate giant crocodile and disappears. If this was a more adult horror movie, then Hook would burst out for one last scare, but in this movie he's gone forever.The standouts are Williams and Hoskins: after a few serious roles in the late 80s, Williams has a lot of silly fun as Pan, running the gamut from uptight businessman to embracing his inner child. Even that transformation feels predictable, despite Williams' enthusiasm. Again, the tight three day deadline doesn't leave much room for any character exploration of ponderous moral choices. Peter has to save his kids, so the quicker he becomes Pan, the better.While Hoffman hams it up big time as Captain Hook (complete with a massive wig, shiny collection of hooks, dapper moustache, and toothy grin), Hoskins seems content to play second banana as Smee, yet rises above Hoffman's hamminess to become a more memorable character.If you want a predictable family film with a big cast and plenty of nostalgia value, then ""Hook"" is fine (though the two hour-plus run time may deter younger viewers). If you want an interesting take on the classic Peter Pan tale, then best to stick with the Disney original.",Hook
95,ayoreinf,more than a good film for children,9,31 May 2010,"I'm sorry to say this is one of the best Spielberg movies ever. Personally I prefer his fantasy to his ""true life dramas"" because his flare for melodrama is more at place and the great story teller that he always is can really shine through. But I want to make some other points here. This is more than a story of bad parenting, and more than a simple retelling of Peter Pan. It's a story of what it means to grow up and how hard it is to be a grown up and still remember what it feels like to be a child. It's also a story about the realness of the imagination, as the film shows it more than once and ultimately proves when it doesn't sum it all up as a dream - this would've been a real cliché, if it did choose the easy way and called it all a dream - it didn't. It does dwell on some cliché situations but those are being told with an original twist and with a fresh attitude. No it's not perfect, at moments it does become a bit too melodramatic, but the superb acting by most of the actors involved compensates. And I simply love it",Hook
96,Christopher_Reid,"A childhood favourite, still magical",9,19 January 2018,"I fondly remember watching and loving Hook as a kid, maybe 10 years old. But re-watching it was a more vivid experience than I expected. I FELT things I hadn't felt since seeing it so long ago. We get excited at that age, we fill in the gaps. We believe flying is possible, why not? As adults, I think we sometimes become more cynical, much like Peter Banning in the movie. That was the irony: this movie is nostalgic for me, but the way Spielberg directs it, the movie itself is clearly about those feelings of nostalgia.Peter Banning (Robin Williams) has forgotten who he is. As he discovers himself, I was realising how much this movie captured my imagination as a kid. I can now relate to Peter, perhaps more than to his children. Spielberg uses swelling music and close-ups to suggest profound things, as if we should be familiar with something - it creates this feeling of deja vu. For example, when the crazy old man says a riddle ending with ""got to save Maggie, got to save Jack, Hook is back..."" We feel like we should know what this means. It draws you in. The same for when Peter gets back to Neverland and everyone has sudden moments of realization when they recognize him. The filming exaggerates those emotions, paralleling my own memories coming back as I watch.I find Dustin Hoffman very funny as Hook. He openly hates the pirates who surround him, but they remain oblivious, taking his insults as merely playful. He is facing a midlife crisis. A proud, successful pirate but with no great enemy to battle. Where's the fun in that? He enjoys the sport in a good fight, which is why he seeks his old nemesis, Peter.The music by John Williams is among his best which is no small feat. It captures the feelings of loss and sadness that surround Peter's mysterious and forgotten childhood, the pure adventure of flying, fighting and crowing and other things.The child performances are of a high standard. Both Maggie and Jack come across as real, with mixed emotions. The daughter is more pure, loving her parents, wanting to be saved, being full of hope and strongly disliking Hook. Jack is more conflicted, being somewhat let down by his father being too busy for him at times. He goes through several changes of heart, many of which are quite moving. Hook can't corrupt the girl, but he comes close with the boy.Hook is more about emotions than the specifics of what happens and why. It's about rediscovering yourself and that place between dreams and reality which Tinkerbell mentions. It's about jubilation, finding your happy thoughts, reconnecting with loved ones, reassessing one's life. There are many moments of humour which I don't want to spoil. There are plenty of aspects of the plot which are silly and may not hold up to scrutiny but it doesn't matter. Hook isn't for everyone, but kids of all ages may well love it if the story suits their taste.",Hook
97,ThomasColquith,Average film,5,18 August 2021,"""Hook"" is an average film in my opinion; it is not as bad as some say, nor as good as others say; it is simply ok. The main negative for it is the length, it is too long. This long length makes me unlikely to watch it again, but it was ok to watch once. It needed to be edited down at least 30 minutes shorter.I thought all the actors were fine, including Julia Roberts, not sure why so many complain about her here. Though I did find the costumes odd, why did everyone except Captain Hook look so ragged all the time? Though I am not real familiar with the original Peter Pan story. This film is definitely geared toward children but it is still ok for an adult as it explores issues adults grapple with such as finding enough time for your family, for fun, for hobbies, etc. While still fulfilling your work obligations necessary to make a living. Unfortunately, adults as they age inevitably lose some of that wonder, innocence, imagination, fun, and spontaneity so common in children. Of course adults can't actually be kids again, but they can from time to time reassess their priorities and how they spend their time. Good music too. 5/10.",Hook
98,ryan_kuhn,"""To a ten-year-old I'm Huge.""",5,29 April 2005,"Hook is one of those movies where the premise is brilliant, we just wish the rest of the movie was. It's not that it is a bad movie, but it could have been better. The idea that Peter Pan migrated to the real world and grew up is interesting. The idea that Peter Pan has kids is interesting. The idea that Captain Hook kidnaps Peter Pan's kids is interesting. Directed by Steve Spielberg, the pacing and emotional value of Hook seems off. The points where Peter Pan (Robin Williams, which is good casting, the forever 14 year old plays a man who's spent most of his life 14 years old) is trying to rediscover who he really is feels forced and kind of painful. There are few laughs and few moments of whimsy. The points where Peter Pan is with the Lost Boys should have been fun, but they are not. Perhaps there are too serious of undertones in the movie to keep it completely jovial. The only characters I found interesting were Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) and Smee (Bob Hoskins), which follows the Darth Vader theory that the bad guys in a movie are always the most interesting. The movie also features a real life Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) who at one moment decides she wants to be big, so she does it. For one moment, Tinkerbell is a big person, and has a crush on Peter Pan. I personally liked it better when Peter Pan and Tinkerbell were just coworkers. I also found it annoying that throughout the movie, Peter Pan's daughter kept yelling to Captain Hook that he was unhappy because he didn't have a mother.

102,dkncd,"Misses its full potential, but is still fun",9,8 September 2007,"""Hook"" brings together director Steven Spielberg with material from J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" stories. The combination sounds perfect and ""Hook"" is generally a good film, but unfortunately it doesn't realize its full potential. However, that's not to say that the film's premise isn't sound. In fact, it's an interesting twist on the Peter Pan stories: Peter Pan has grown up into a work-obsessed father that neglects his kids and has forgotten ever being Peter Pan. Along comes Captain Hook to rekindle the old rivalry between himself and Peter and Peter has to relearn his old ways to combat Hook.I'm not sure why a film about Peter Pan was titled ""Hook"", though, as catchy the title is. The film seems to try to justify this titling by inserting numerous references to hooks early in the film. Putting aside the title, the film has decent though few sets and a great score from John Williams.The film does have a good cast. Robin Williams is appropriate to play a Peter Pan that has grown up but needs to rediscover his past. Julia Roberts proves a fine choice for the role of Tinker Bell. Charlie Korsmo does well as the more focused on of Peter's two children and the rest of the supporting cast is suitable as well. Maggie Smith has a notable appearance as Wendy. The outstanding performance in the film, however, is Dustin Hoffman as Captain James Hook. Hook is portrayed as flamboyant and foppish with a haughty laugh, yet also sinister and at times sarcastic. It was quite amusing how he denoted acts as being either ""good form"" or ""bad form"". Bob Hoskins is also amusing as Hook's sidekick, Smee.Where ""Hook"" isn't as consistent is in the story. Initially a good story is developed, but from there the execution of the premise is mixed. Most of the film is solid and the film has some great moments, particularly where Captain Hook is involved. However, it tends to get bogged down at times by lingering on scenes such as the insult battle and subsequent food fight. More of the film's time should have been spent on the conflict between Peter Pan and Hook. The final conflict left something to be desired as it relied too much on random contraptions and one child's girth as weapons. The ending is satisfactory even though it is very much expected. Despite its flaws, ""Hook"" is a fun Peter Pan film.",Hook
103,ohlabtechguy,Godawful!,5,17 February 2007,"Just saw this movie on VHS. Had no idea what to expect. First 15 minutes, showing William's family and work life bored me to death. But I was hopeful and decided to see more. When they got to London, I was intrigued by the lovely architecture of the brick townhouse where Wendy lived. My intrigue ended there. The problem with this movie is that not one character was endearing. Emotions ran high on occasion among the characters playing their parts, but these displays fell on neutral hearts since the viewer could not connect and feel empathy for any of the characters. At times, I became irritatingly aware that the orchestral background music sounded just like Spielberg's other blockbusters. And his overused techniques for highlighting dramatic moments(in this case anti-dramatic) were painful to watch. Blockbuster, mass audience appeal went into every gimmick he employed.Also, the intended ideal age group to see this movie remains a mystery. Certainly, it was a children's movie, but it was too sophisticated and overdone for children to enjoy. At the same time, it was too boring and nonsensical for adults to bear. Spielberg was likely shooting for a mass audience, but he ended up getting none with this stinker.I thought of other children fantasy movies that did work, such as ""The Wizard of Oz"". It was not nearly as sophisticated in cinematography, sets and storyline, but it worked because all the characters were endearing, especially Dorothy. Even the Wicked Witch had a certain charm. So even though it was abundantly clear that ""Oz"" was a complete fantasy, like ""Hook"", it managed to capture the human heart and mind with lovable characters and the simple theme - I want to go home because there's no place like home.I must give credit to Hoffman for his portrayal of Hook. He was so good he was unrecognizable in sound and appearance. Still, the way his part came across, he was neither a likable nor despicable villain. I just keep thinking, why is he obsessed with fighting a war with Peter Pan???",Hook
104,Ginger87,Pretty Good,8,14 August 2004,"I was flickering through my guide one day when I saw ""Hook"" on the ABC Family channel.  I decided to watch it since I played the prologue to ""Hook"" in my band class.  The movie was pretty good but I loved the music especially in the prologue.My favorite scene was the food fight, that was pretty funny.  I also liked the scene when Hook, Jack, and the crew are playing baseball.  Robin Williams I believe played a good Peter Pan. I also believe the children played good roles.Overall I suggest people of all ages to watch this movie and I give it 8/10 stars.

105,AnishMisra,Hook Review,8,27 January 2018,"Hook is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. I read about the film some time ago and critics especially had trashed the film for not being upto Speilberg's standard. But watching the film last night on TV, I found it quite good.Plot: Peter Pan, now, Peter Banning has to return to Neverland when his arch-nemesis James Hook kidnaps his kids.Story and direction: I Have always loved Spielberg and his films. He is quite a genius when it comes to film-making. Give him any kind of film, dark or light, in tone, he will deliver it. So I was curious to find what the hell went wrong with this film. First, lets see the positives. I liked the father-son relationship that is shown in the film. A son always has some expectations from his father and when those not fulfilled the son is disappointed. Also the working environment in present days where you get no time to breathe and no time for your family is very well shown. Then we have the scenes from Neverland. Most of the scenes especially with the Lost Boys were awesome. I chucked each and every moment in those scenes. And finally, the battle between Pan and Hook. That was the kind of battle you want to see in a swashbuckling film (although at some places it felt like Star Wars' lightsaber battles). John Williams' score was awesome too. Now for the negatives, the production design of the film felt very poor. The sets actually felt like large giant sets constructed. Then it would be the interaction betwen Peter Pan and Tinker Bell just before the finale. I mean that actually made no sense. And also, Hook's ultimate fate with the crocodile. I didn't get that also. Also the interest in the film during the first hour was on and off. Also as a character I felt the villains were given nothing much to do.Performances: Robin Willaims was great from the scared and taget driven Peter Banning to the child-like Peter Pan. Dustin Hoffman was good too, but he wasn't actually given much to do. Julia Roberts was also excellent. The Lost Boys especially Rufio and Thud Ball were awesome. Bob Hoskins was OK. Maggie Smith was great in her role. So as Caroline Goodall.Favorite Scene: It would be the food eating scene where everyone just starts eating and Peter begins to wonder where the hell is the food. And suddenly he lets his imagination go wild and sees food in front of him. My mouth watered seeing the scene. And the subsequent scene, where there is a war od words between Rufio and Peter. That was hilarious.Verdict: Hook is an enjoyable film. I had a great time with it. Yes, it has some issues regarding themes, characters and some random scenes, but it is still very entertaining. I am going with an 8/10.",Hook
106,jephtha,It could have been so much more,5,27 May 2016,"When asked who I consider the best American filmmaker, an admitted rookie like myself might consider Martin Scorsese, Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg to be fair contenders. In any case, it's not Stanley Kubrick, who, while undeniably skilled in his craft, is primarily remembered for messing with people's heads. Those who denounce Spielberg on his proclivity for crowd pleasers or family flicks take his versatility for granted (Munich and Lincoln come to mind), as well as his gift for reminding us why we go to the movies in the first place. Nevertheless, he's not immune to misfires, a fact eternally reinforced by ""Hook"". One thing that most, the director himself included, seem to be in agreement on is that the section of the movie that precedes the Neverland sequences shows good promise. It effectively establishes the life that Peter has made for himself, as well as the disconnect between himself and his family, and we are drawn into the mystery of the story by the surprisingly solemn Wendy. Furthermore, the scene of the kids prior to being kidnapped is frightening, something I can attest to having seen it at an early age. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a dull affair. Much of it is devoted to Peter's attempts to rediscover the spirit of youth within himself, but there's no sense of wonderment, fun or wit to this, thanks in no small part to the embarrassing settings. What's more, the objectives behind this (to battle Hook and rescue the kids) are obligatory and not utilized very well. Hook's plan to sway Peter's kids is fruitless and its excisement would have mostly strengthened the movie. I say ""mostly"" because the daughter is rather endearing and actually manages some rather funny moments. Her reaction to getting an ""F"" is priceless in context. The real shame about ""Hook"" is that it has the raw material for an insightful extension of the messages from the original Peter Pan tale, but it derails itself by giving the central character objectives that detract from each other. The idea is that Peter learns to reconnect with his kids through this new adventure, even though (a) he's separated from them for the majority of the run time and (b) he never draws any insights from his earlier adventures that allow him to do this (unless you want to count the embarrassing dinner scene that devolves into a series of insults too childish for even this type of movie). Such missteps rob this aspect of the story of substance and momentum, and in the end, despite the ending saying otherwise, the whole thing just feels like an excuse to get an adult Pan to fight Hook. In the one truly interesting scene from the latter two thirds, Peter realizes that his motivation for growing up was the desire to become a father. Again, the idea behind this is very promising, and could have been the other side of the coin. The original tale showed the tragedy of running away from adulthood, while this one wants to say that through all the challenges there are wonderful things waiting in adulthood. But ""Hook"" largely doesn't focus on Peter's relationship with his family or his dissatisfaction with adulthood. Not to mention, why not focus on Peter's marriage? Isn't such an undertaking a more intriguing aspect of adulthood from kids' perspective? From the flashback itself, it seems that he was more concerned about companionship. This would have been a more direct and poignant direction to take, especially considering the aging of Wendy. That's another thing. Unlike the all-around superior 2003 adaptation, there's no strong ally or opponent for the hero to play off of. Sure, there's Tinker Bell, played in that awkward ""adult acting kiddish"" style that I hate so much, but her relationship with Peter doesn't evolve beyond an outline. And, while there are a few well-done moments with some of the Lost Boys, they don't amount to much. By far the best aspect of the production is John Williams' soundtrack, which occasionally elicits the feelings that the everything else fails to. The track ""Flight to Neverland"" is particularly good. Much less can be said about the special effects, which make Neverland look artificial and flat rather than expansive and lively. The only exception I can think of is the fun scene of Peter soaring above the clouds. Whatever bits are done right, far better (non-CG) efforts were produced before and since. Just three years later, ""The Flintstones"" would give us a real treat in set design (though, admittedly, little else). Despite its cult following, ""Hook"" remains amongst the lower echelons of Spielberg's filmography. Not abysmal, but, with uncapitalized ideas and a distinct lack of enchantment, it's bound to disappoint.",Hook
107,eyeintrees,Hook - Brilliant and ahead of its time.,9,3 January 2013,"Brilliant. I have watched this several times since its release and I realise why it had so much negative press when it first came out... it was simply too far ahead of its time. In my opinion this movie is something of a masterpiece, glorious tongue in cheek brilliance, super performances and some powerful serious moments. Glorious to look at. I love this movie... oddly perhaps because the original story of Peter Pan bores me senseless and I'm SO grateful that someone breathed some LIFE into it!For all the reviewers who looked askance at Hook, I say that perhaps you've been hit with the same syndrome as Peter who forgot.",Hook
108,jaredpahl,"Spielberg Delivers A Rollicking Family Adventure, But Misses Out On Crafting Something Truly Special",7,30 January 2016,"The pieces were in place for Hook to be a Kubrick-esque, once-in-a-lifetime film. The myth of Peter Pan, an all-star cast, world class director Steven Spielberg at the helm, and an utterly fascinating concept promised a unique and haunting modern fairytale. Unfortunately, this potential was not realized. Instead, Spielberg plays it safe. Hook is a competent, at times rousing family adventure, but one can't help but think what might have been.The premise of Hook is a great one. An adult Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams, has become a typical yuppie businessman, abandoning his days of adventuring for the hustle and bustle of modern day America. On a trip to London to visit Grandma Wendy, Peter's children are kidnapped by an old rival, Captain Hook. Peter is then compelled to return to Neverland; a Neverland that has moved on without him, to retrieve his children. This setup is pure gold. An adult Peter Pan returning to Neverland presents a number of potentially enthralling ideas about the nature of youth, childhood, and adult disenchantment. There's also a chance to explore the Peter Pan mythology in a serious, adult manner. However, while the first part of the film does have a slightly sinister edge, Spielberg and company abandon these potential themes in favor of a sugary sweet holiday romp. Once Robin Williams' Peter Pan arrives in Neverland, we don't see anything that we haven't seen before in countless other family films and Saturday morning cartoons. That's not to say that Spielberg mishandles the adventure. If you can look past the movie Spielberg didn't make, you'll find that what he has done is pretty entertaining.To start with, the cast is nothing less than superb. Robin Williams is the perfect man to play the boy who never grew up. He's natural as an inattentive father and delightfully charming as a man rediscovering his youth. When he's flying through the air, there is a magic in his eyes. It's something no other actor could pull off in quite the same way. On the other side, as Captain Hook, Dustin Hoffman makes a great camp villain for the film, even if he isn't totally committed to the role. The rest of the cast including Bob Hoskins as Hook's sniveling sidekick Smee, and Maggie Smith as Wendy are great fun to watch. Julie Roberts even has a cute role as Tinker Bell.The other saving grace of Hook is the production value. Hook is technically superlative, with detailed sets the size of city blocks, bold and colorful costumes, special effects that work convincingly, and a stirring John Williams score. There is a pleasant consistency to the production design in Hook. Every frame of the film feels of a piece. Hook is a watercolor storybook come to life. Credit Dean Cundey's wonderful soft focus cinematography for selling that illusion. The film can tend to take on a muted, reddish haze, but overall, Spielberg and company make the most of the film's budget. Hook is nothing if not nice to look at. It's full of visual splendor, even if it is not Steven Spielberg's most inventive work.Hook is lesser Spielberg. It has neither the emotional power nor the filmmaking prowess of Spielberg's best movies, but lesser Spielberg is still better than almost everything else. Hook is fun, charming, and visually attractive. Where Hook disappoints is in its safety. Spielberg takes no real chances with the fascinating premise, and that's a shame. Hook is not a haunting exploration of the human psyche set within the mythology of Peter Pan, and it could have been. What Hook is, is a very pleasant, wholesome bit of family entertainment. Steven Spielberg's confident direction and Robin Williams' twinkle-in-his-eye performance make Hook well worth your time, even for those expecting more from the concept.73/100",Hook
109,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,Very nice reimagining.,5,17 July 2012,"Robin Williams is a so-so actor. He's been in great movies like Aladdin and Jumanji, but also bad ones such as Man of the Year. But he did a good job here, alongside Dustin Hoffman, who is one of my favorite actors. Hoffman reminded me a lot of his character in Stranger Than Fiction, mostly due to his awesome voice. I wasn't that big a fan of Julia Roberts, but I can't think of anyone who would've been better.As for the movie itself, it's really long for a kid's movie, and the whole Tinkerbell love affair was rather disturbing. (Also, did nobody else freak out when Peter went from being in love with Wendy to being in love with her daughter?) It's imaginative and fun though, and that's what's important. It didn't capture my interests like it did when I was younger but it's still a good film.",Hook
110,Keemshave,Charming and uplifting,8,13 November 2020,"Hook is not perfect, but it takes a unique twist on a classic story and works very well for it. As an older Peter Pan, Robin Williams is perfect and takes this film to places it may not have gone without him. The set design is vibrant and gives you the feeling of wonder that brings you into this realm of fantasy. There are some tonal differences and some scenes that could have been removed to minimize the run-time, but Hook is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen. A flawed classic, but endlessly watchable.",Hook
111,moviemattb,An Underrated Spielberg Movie That Can Crow,9,5 May 2018,"I understand that critics really don't like this movie. Even Steven Spielberg, himself, doesn't really like this movie. However, five years ago, he did say that he really wants to see it again and see if he can appreciate a bit more. I think he should, because I don't thinks its that bad, nor one of the worst movies that Spielberg has made. The movie has developed a strong cult following, and has many fans that grew up with this movie during their childhood. I, on the other hand, am one of them. I have watched this on an old VHS copy of the movie; as an adult, I watched this in its high def glory on Blu Ray, which it really deserves to have special features than just a bare bones release. The movie deserve a documentary about the making of the movie, a vintage featurette from back in the day, trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, outtakes, and possibly a loving tribute to the two most gifted actors that we lost such as Bob Hoskins and Robin Williams. I was devastated to hear what happen to Robin Williams, and it sucks that he and neither is Bob Hoskins will be interviewed for a future Blu Ray release. I couldn't watch this movie, due to them passing away; until 2017, I was able to get over it as I watched it for the first time, and still love this movie; as well as how much I missed them. With that said, the movie is about Peter Pan, who is no longer the boy who didn't grew up as he is now; he goes by Peter Banning a husband and father who is completely obsessed with his job over his family as he goes on a trip to dedicate a children's hospital for Wendy, who she and Peter had once a romantic relationship; moreover, Peter's children have been kidnapped by his old nemesis Captain Hook, as Tinker Bell arrives to bring Peter back to Never Land as he must rediscover who he was, defeat Hook and save his children. To start out the with the positives, I love the concept of having Peter Pan growing to be a husband and father as the movie itself does deal with the psychological aspects of our main character as Peter is so drawn to his life's work, rather believing in fairy tales as he thought were nonsense. Once Wendy tells him the truth, Peter wonders whether he believes or just out of his mind. Now he does believe, he continues to know more about himself as realizes what were his happy thoughts as all he ever wanted was to be not only a good husband, but be able to be a good father. The movie really has good message, as while there is nothing wrong with work; you just can't put push your family away. Family is always the most important, and as they say ""Family comes first."" This is definetly one Robin Williams' best performance, and he will always be Peter Pan as he captures the child like quality as well as being a workaholic. Dustin Hoffman is very well cast as Hook, and definetly having a blast with this role; the makeup on him is also good too. Bob Hoskins is really good as Mr. Smee, and really knows how to give a good performance. For Maggie Smith, her performance is also good too, and I thought this is what she look like just as she did in the ""Harry Potter"" series; it wasn't, it was actually makeup, and that is also good too. The child actors that play Peter's children were good too, as well as the Lost Boys. I didn't think they were as bad as some make them out to be. Of course, you have Rufio, a fan favorite played by Dante Basco is also a really good actor, and still is well known for that role. The sets are, of course look like a set, but still they are really there as you feel that you are in Never Land as opposed to being in place in front of a blue or green screen. The action set pieces are a whole lot of fun, as you get some enjoyment for a good old swashbuckling action adventure. The movie does have some really good laughs, as Spielberg knows how to make the humor work, as well as I thought his direction is pretty darn good. He was able to accomplish for what he had to do, in order to make this concept worked. The concept for Peter Pan growing up may be hard, but should proud on what has done. The run time is over two hours, and I was never bored by it as it kept me going with the story. John Williams' music, I thought, its one of the best scores he has ever done, as I find it both memorable and unforgettable. There were moments that made me cry, like Peter rediscovering his past, Peter saying ""Thank you for believing,"" and Peter crying into tears for every happy thought; its not because of how beautiful the music is or how great Williams' performance is, but its how much I missed him. That is what made me cried. For any negatives, the special effects, don't get me wrong are really good and thought that ILM really did really good job with the matte paintings, the flying scenes, and Tinker Bell's size. However, there were some shots that I find them obvious, as well as being dated. Nevertheless, the effects for the most part are really good. Of course, there is a goof where Tinker Bell takes Peter to Never Land to never grow up, but all of the sudden he is. It may be a plot hole, but sometimes, I like to think that when Peter becomes a teenager, he will never grow up to be an adult as long as he can have all the fun he wants. Not the best interpretation, but its the least that I thought of. Lastly, I am not a fan of Julia Roberts' Tinker Bell, as while its not horrible, its just that she really doesn't have that much of a personality like maybe be a little feisty or be somewhat interesting. I think Spielberg could've picked a better actress for someone to play that role, but if he really wanted her to play Tinker Bell, then she could have done something to make her character interesting. I don't hate Julia Roberts, as she is a fine actress, but just awfully miscast. She did fine, but could've been better. Overall, ""Hook"" is an underrated Spielberg movie that can crow, as it has a great cast, exciting action set pieces, beautiful music, and has a heart to it. Give this movie a chance, and think many happy thoughts. I am giving this childhood of mine a 9 out of 10.",Hook

114,CherryBlossomBoy,Kline would be able to sell it,2,14 November 2013,"I remember this film well. It has been maybe 20 years since the last time I watched it. The first time I rented it, the second time I caught it on telly. What I remember the best is the rage I felt because of lack of comedy in it and even more because of underlining politically correct family messages and wishful thinking.The reason I expected comedy back then was Robin Williams. My expectations were based on hype about that guy. At the time he was praised as the comedic genius. Only now I realize that I never liked neither him nor any of the films he starred in. He might in fact be the main reason why ""Hook"" turned out such a lousy effort.Other things in it didn't click all that well, too. I've been going through the reviews and the critics mostly got it right. The script is pretty bad. Dustin Hoffman looks tired. Julia Roberts is wasted. Bob Hoskins is irritating. The direction is more concentrated on special effects than on coherent storytelling. The effects themselves often scream ""second unit"" and are way too obvious to serve the story.What critics were wrong about is the premise. Having Peter Pan grow up is not sacrilege. Granted, it's a high concept, and as such can easily backfire and make for a boring movie, but I see nothing bad with the idea itself. It is in fact what attracted me to give it a try, since I like cynical takes on common lore.It's just that it required a much smarter development to work. And most of all, in case of this high concept, it required a convincing actor in the starring role. To make us believe Peter Pan can really grow up, the actor has to have something of a devilish boyish charm to him. The producers obviously knew it and had Kevin Kline attached to the project. Unfortunately he had to drop out, and it's a damn shame because, judging by his then looks and body of work, it seems to me he was perfect for the role.Robin Williams, the replacement, has a different type of ""charm"". He's a retarded goofball. That's his thing. You can see it in his other movies and you can see it here. He's just playing Robin Williams ""doing his thing"". When you look closely you'll notice that he hasn't got the knack for physical comedy. He seems too slow and sloppy for that. He also makes much of his detestable gum-faced, smirky-eyed grimaces. That might have worked in ""Popeye"" but it's horrible in ""Hook"".With someone else on board, other bad things in the film might have been more tolerable. Or not. Hammy moralizing towards the end would have been less hammy but it would still require a much better script to not appear forced. The main point in this movie, the point that occupies Steven Spielberg in his other movies as well, is the family. Or a broken family. The turning point for the story is when the protagonist realizes that his children are his ""happy thought"" and the source of his ""magic"". That would have been far more convincing had those children of his had any significant script time by that point. Since they were nothing more than props, while Lost Boys took the spotlight, one has to ask ""Why?"". It was well established that Peter Pan hardly ever notices his own flesh and blood. Why are they so important all of the sudden, without proper build-up?And why is the film titled ""Hook""?",Hook

116,byson5186,I Remember Hearing Hook Laughing,8,9 December 2014,"We all miss one of the most famous actors ever, Robin Williams. Of all the movies he's done, this movie while definitely not the most memorable, as the most memorable movie is probably Mrs. Doubtfire, it's definitely one of his more memorable movies. Robin Williams does great in this movie as Petter Banning/Petter Pan with both his serious and comedic abilities. I'd say this is a movie everybody should watch at least once in their life. It's not one of my favorite movies, but it is still somewhat entertaining to watch. What makes this movie great, well it is directed by one of our favorite directors who always makes movies entertaining, Steven Spielberg. Spielberg naturally knows how to direct movies to make them really good. What else is good about this movie, the music from the movie is really good. I like the song we hear at the beginning of the movie, ""Banning Back At Home,"" that's relaxing pleasant music to listen to. What else makes this movie good, for one this movie is from the early '90s, so I forget where but I read something about this on the internet recently, of Spielberg talking about how the set for Neverland was made from natural things, real life things where if it were done today, it would have been all CGI. They did a great job showing Neverland, I mean it can be annoying when everything is digital, and sometimes they can make the set from art and some natural things in life which they do for this movie. What else is also great about this movie, well the characters in the movie seem to have the right parts. We like seeing Robin Williams as Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Hook, Bob Hoskins as Smee, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, and Maggie Smith as Wendy. They all play their parts well. There are also numerous pirates in this movie that act like pirates, and we even see beautiful mermaids in this movie, but just in one scene. The Lost Boys, while not the ones we are familiar with in the novel or from the original story do a great job playing the Lost Boys, showing their feelings toward a grown up Peter Pan. Basically, these characters are all good to make the fictional Neverland, a real place again without CGI effects. It has lots of comedic humor and is fast paced. It's a beautiful movie to watch that will remind us of our childhood. This movie is frequently on ABC Family. My parents still have an old VHS tape of this movie. About watching it on VHS, I can remember once watching it on VHS at a friends house when I was 12 years old with a couple of people. Going along with my title for this review, I remember how it was like towards the end of the movie, I forget what scene it might have been the end credits. But, in a scene Hook wasn't in the few of us watching all of a sudden heard Hook laughing, I mean like a switch in the audio from what was happening to a quick evil laugh from Hook. We thought it was weird, and since then I'm not too sure what it was, and this would be better for a topic in the questions section below for IMDb. But, yeah we have it on VHS without the same thing, so I'm not sure if it was just some kind of problem with their video, or if somebody recorded Hook laughing and put it in the video as a prank. It's funny thinking about it, and also a little creepy to have heard Hook's laugh in a scene he wasn't in. If that laugh was recorded and added, I can't even remember what scene with Hook in it where that laugh would have been from, where somebody just added that recorded laugh from an earlier scene to have it voice over in a scene he wasn't in. Oh well, I thought about sharing that memory. In all, I'd give this movie an 8/10. They do a good job with the effects and story. There's just something about it, I can't explain what it is that keeps me from giving this movie a 9 or 10.

You can really see when Spielberg has made a movie. The color is like it would have been painted out in crayons. And it creates a massive feeling. Just take a look at the finale. John Williams ain't leaving us yet, and thank god for that. In HOOK it is just the same feeling spreading in the body while the themes plays on.

119,Andreas_N,You just have to believe,9,6 November 2005,"This movie is generally underrated. I loved it when I first saw it. It made me sad and happy, all at the same. Peter Pan is grown up and has displaced his childhood adventures from memory. He has turned in a cold-hearted father who is not able to live up to his son's expectations, which is very annoying and painful for Charlie Korsmo's character. Then Tinkerbell turns up and ol' Peter's life is turned upside down. Here the whole story starts. Hook has kidnapped his children and ol' Peter has to accept who he was and eventually starts to believe. The way he encounters the Lost Boys, how he struggles to learn how the old magic works and how he starts to turn into Peter Pan is very funny. Robin Williams is doing a great job. Dustin Hoffman, trying to control Jack, Peter's son, is diabolic and absurd at the same time. What appealed to me so much is this: The themes of being a good father, of growing up, of accepting yourself, of magic and imagination, of endurance and courage, of love and witchcraft. At the beginning Peter's wife talks to him about how temporary a kid's wish to be together with his parents is. All too quickly kids turn away from their parents. There's only this short period when a dad is a kid's hero, and this period must not be wasted. That's something we all ought to remember. Magic is there, we just have to believe. Love and affection is there, we just have to open our hearts and let it in. At the very end Granny Wendy says: ""So... your adventures are over."" And Peter replies: ""Oh, no. To live... to live would be an awfully big adventure."" Let's adhere to this simple message of anyone growing up. Let's preserve childhood imagination and dreams in your hearts forever. We'll be much better parents and humans if we do that.",Hook

Robin Williams has some great comedic lines (though far too few), and there are some genuinely heart-felt moments to be sure, but the main purpose of this film is to give teenagers a chance to say good-bye to their childhood.  They knew Peter Pan when they were children, and now Pan is back for one last adventure and to pass the baton to a new generation.  And once that baton has been passed, it's time to move forward.  That is what I and most adults have done, and that is why I highly recommend this film for teens while I advise adults to pass it by.",Hook
121,sc8031,Needs More Plank-walking,8,2 June 2008,"This movie is way cheesy, but the Peter Pan fantasy is a good one. It's also a good idea to have him come back to NN-land years later, after having abandoned the Lost Boys in pursuit of that boring quest to fulfill his budding teenage urges. You know the drill: Pan grows up to be Robin Williams (it's a sad day for anyone who grows up to be that), who goes by the subtley changed name ""Peter Panning"" and is a lawyer-suit jerk who marries Wendy's granddaughter/niece or whatever (the point is it's a blood-relative, despite the implied long-standing relationship between Pan and Wendy)and ignores his kids.There are some slick sequences at the beginning, like when Hook reappears in Pan's adult life. Dustin Hoffman steals the show and drives the movie playing Captain Hook. He has some great lines and demonstrates real acting chops, as opposed to Robin Williams who is just playing himself, albeit slightly toned down. 'Twould be interesting to see someone else have done this Pan role. Jim Carrey? Gary Oldman? Hell, we should just cast Gary Oldman as every character in every movie. ""(Gary Oldman) for some, miniature American flags for others."" Frankly, the only things keeping this from being a masterpiece are some random unexplainable circumstances in Never-Neverland's time-line, and the overemphasis on kids and how great they are. The underlying message of the movie becomes a Robin Williams pro-children schmooze-fest. What's the message, guys? Adopted children (i.e. the Lost Boys) are not as endearing or important as one's biological offspring? Also, Pan's son kinda sucked. As did the lines written for Smee (Hook's second), who is played by Bob Hoskins, an actor that is criminally underused here. And as I said in the title, this film could use more walking of planks and so forth. But surprisingly, this is a watchable Steven Spielberg movie with music by either Hans Zimmer or John Williams which doesn't detract from the experience.Personally I would like to see a Pan spin-off/sequel where Pan's son goes back to Never-Neverland and finds the Lost Boys have grown up to become Pirates, and Peter has replaced Capn Hook. (Just an idea, you fledgling Hollywood writers!)A sufficiently entertaining and scary movie for kids and adults alike. 7.5",Hook
122,nelliebell-1,Do You believe in Peter Pan?,8,24 October 2004,"This is first rate family entertainment.The musical score is excellent, providing both entertainment and expression while all the while we behold a view that is beautiful and interesting.That seems to be one of the understated attractions that while we hear and look we indeed witness a grand stage in which is choreographed some really great dance numbers.This really is a very fine film,interesting,challenging and maybe I should not say,contemporary.I remember from long long ago the song""tender shepherd,tender shepherd"",or the refrain to ""I wont grow up""or may be even.""teach me to fly peter""or ""I wanna crow"",that of course was from the days when Mary Martin played Peter Pan and it aired on NBC.Iam not certain about what may in fact constitute acting but the film or at least its presentation provided for a unmistakable adventure to never never land.Do we draw a line as to what it is that this may be about or is what it is about not what not growing up is about.Thats why I never want to grow up,not me ,not I.The film attempts as a starting point to establish a level playing surface from which this gunslinger of a lawyer played by Robin Williams,who in fact is Peter Pan, now grown up is sought out by the infamous Captain Hook played By Dustin Hoffman.Hooks servant smee is played by Bob Hoskins and tinkerbell is played by Julia Roberts.There really isn't anywhere to start outside of the fact that Peter found his shadow and now the adventure gets very interesting.It would seem that if you were to watch the Peter Pan on stage as say with Mary Martin you would know that it was quieter and sentimental and as well a first rate experience,however when you witness ""hook"" you find yourself involved in the equivalent of an event,an truly extravagant presentation.This was an expensive film to make as the production numbers were as impressive as the story itself.The scene with the baseball game was so enjoyable that I felt that this was indeed the right ballpark for all concerned and though indeed this is being a-bit clever about all this, it is nonetheless first rate entertainment.The place mostly for Peter Pan is in our youth and indeed perhaps even in our hearts.We don't want to see our mommies and daddies die and I don't want to grow up!The only road block to all this,is this is about make believe and about pretend.I guess this is about the imagination, for instance the big meal the children have with Peter Pan present for the first time in a while.It is not so simple even in acting to convince someone that they are actually having something to eat and then to make it appear to the camera if you will that you are in fact having something to eat.It was interesting to see how that number was worked out on the silver screen as perhaps it may of been dealt with on the stage.However this was entirely theatrics and if your interested young girls liked this picture more than young boys and it seems that the older you got the less likely you were to enjoy this film.I gave ""Hook"" an 8 for many reasons some of which have been mentioned but mostly because of its entertainment value.There is indeed much to know and that maybe an impediment too,as knowledge does not seem to be present only the medium.This film does bear all the ear marks of a very well produced film and very professional in its approach.In fact its so good in that area that you would be better seeing the film than reading this.",Hook
123,ikrani,Why is this a bad movie? Why is this even a mediocre movie?,8,30 July 2014,"I'm not one of the people fortunate enough to catch this in the theaters. I am, however, one of the people who loudly objects to the negative critical response to this film.Peter Pan growing up is a wonderfully refreshing concept and saying ""it adds nothing to the Peter Pan mythos"" confuses me to no end. The beautiful practical sets would never have come to pass in an age where Spielberg and Lucas have gone crazy with the CGI and accusing them of being cartoony is rather superfluous seeing as Peter Pan's not exactly known for its realism. The actors all turn in decent performances, the best being Robin William's uptight Peter Banning and childlike Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman's deliciously evil Captain Hook, and Bob Hoskins. Nothing to say about Bob Hoskins; if he's on screen, he's giving it his all.I deduct points from the film do to the third act with the war, not because the Lost Boys use incredibly implausible weapons to fight the pirates but because Peter stops being savvy about Hook, there's a rather unnecessary dark moment during an otherwise cartoony climax, and about a half dozen inconsistencies appear in the span of five minutes. But, other than that, Hook is a brilliant film and its ""Rotten"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes is simply a travesty, for not only is it a heartfelt Spielberg experience, but when the movie wants to be funny, it's REALLY funny. Listen not to the critics unless they are Jim Sterling or Doug Walker, because this film is one of the best.",Hook
124,Tyson14,Rip Robin Williams you will be surly missed,10,12 August 2014,"I loved this film when I was younger and nothing has changed about that, even though I'm now 22! Now Robin Williams has died I felt like the world came crashing down on me I couldn't believe he had gone so I had to rewatch hook and remember Robin as he was, a great actor.Robin Williams is, as always, brilliant. He's hilarious and I think he makes a great Peter Pan - definitely one of my favourite portrayals. He plays the grown-up Peter fantastically, as a man who has forgotten all about Neverland and his life before growing up. Once he returns to the magical world and finally remembers, his take on Peter was wonderful to watch. Who'd of thought Robin Williams in tights would have been so cool? I loved the lost boys in this. They were so dependent on Peter and had clearly missed him so much and the ending when he left again just ripped my heart out. They were also so funny (BANGARANG) when they were 'training' Peter to become himself again (the dinner scene was just awesome). Also: Ru-fi-ooooooooooooooo.Dustin Hoffman as Hook was just splendid. He's such a great actor and I've learned to expect nothing better than AWESOME from him. And he delivered. Hook is perfectly creepy but also kind of strangely likable.The puns in this movie provide a lot of laughs (perhaps more now, watching as an adult: see the dinner scene when Peter and Rufio get into an argument) and the film is just a joy to watch throughout.Okay, so it's not a completely Oscar-worthy masterpiece. But it's a film that will keep you entertained throughout and get you back in touch with your childish side, something we all need once in a while. In my opinion, it's a must-see for anyone who's a fan of Williams or, you know, fun. RIP Robin Williams",Hook
125,amiranda-39274,To Live Would Be A Big Adventure: Deep Analysis,8,15 February 2021,"Hook is remembered as a nostalgic piece of the 90s, and that any merits it has exist only in the past. i have watched this movie at least once a year, and as an adult i believe i can disapprove of the idea that this movie is not just good because of the nostalgia it generates. i believe this is one of the best peter pan films ever made and that it posses many merits as to why that is, allow me to explain.The Characters: The late Robin Williams plays peter Banning a workaholic lawyer who doesn't have enough time for his kids, it is revealed he is in fact the legendary Peter Pan. As he regains his memories throughout the story, he becomes more childlike in nature, allowing robin to utilize is dramatic and comedic acting in a healthy blend. Dustin hoffman plays Captain Hook, who is depressed and suicidal that he comes to the real world to abduct peters children to force him into one final confrontation. from the moment we see the pirates cheering his name, Hooks presence is intimidating, despite being so formal and speaking softly. Hoffman really gave this character all his energy, the scene where he's teaching peters children to hate their parents alone is one of his best performances ever. Bob Hoskins has a small role as mr. Smee but is so charismatic that he ends up being very memorable. Julia roberts plays a funny tinkerbell, and i enjoy her performance. The lost boys are all a wonderful cast, but of course Rufio is the best, Dante Basco just brought a lot of likeability to the character. Peters wife and kids are all good actors as well, the wife has her moments to shine, but grandma Wendy possesses so much grace, she overshadows the rest of peters family.Foreshadow: The foreshadowing done in this movie, is impeccable, peter is shown to afraid of flying, and tends to do a heroic pose unintentionally. there's this great scene where peter is hosting a ceremony honoring Wendy's work running an orphanage, all the elderly people present are revealed to all be the orphans that she helped find families for, including peter himself.
To add more funny foreshadowing, the plane that peter is riding on is called ""PANema"" and the pilot captain over the intercom is dustin hoffman! The dialogue is so grandiose that i have so many favorite lines from this movie, that just give it so much whimsical gravitas. "" When are you going to stop acting like a child. i am a child!"" ""So peter you've become a pirate"". ""Ive lost my Marbles"". ""Your children love you, they want to play with you""."" There you are peter"". ""Death is the only great adventure left"". A lot of the dialogue was taken from the book so it really honors the source material.Neverland: never have i ever seen a fantasy world brought to life in such a whimsical way like this. While the pirate kingdom and the lost boys treehouse are clearly sets, its these practical effects that add this veil of fantasy to the film. the mermaid scene is short but is so magical to look at, you will remember it long after. The imaginary food scene has to be my favorite part of the movie where the lost boys are eating invisible food, but once peter begins to join in on the fun and use his imagination, the grand banquet of colorful desserts and delicious foods become clear to him. The final battle on the pirate ship is a lot of fun and is an excellent climax.The Music: Again John Williams proves to be the master of his craft as he create heart string pulling music for every scene, that just elevates every scene its used in from the whimsical moments to the pirates tune for the Hook, to peter pan being reborn. Maggies song is the only musical moment in the movie and it is very cute and endearing.Conclusion: This movie really does make you feel like a kid again, perhaps its the nostalgia but there is the feeling that there is something deeper in themes in this movie. Spielberg is a great director and i feel he handled the story of a grown up peter pan rather well, so much that an entire generation of children remember this movie with such bittersweet nostalgia. The movie is not perfect, there are some outdated effects, a few unexplained plot holes, and too many whimsical moments to count. The Final act is definitely the weakest part of the movie, since the final battle is not taken too seriously, which makes sense since this is all supposed to be a game. Peter and Hooks final duel is still impressive. Hook disappears when he is eaten by the dead crocodile, peter and the kids return to the real world with a question of ""was it real"" which could be left for interpretation, except toodles ends up flying around London with nobody questioning which makes the purpose of questioning if this is real or not pointless. But these minor issues do not stop this from being a great movie about imagination, regaining lost childhood and love for life. The nostalgia this movie generates has nothing to do with the gravitas of this film, the sets the acting, the dialogue and whimsical moments make this a spectacular fantasy to behold, you will feel like you are in a dream while watching it. only those who have lost their sense of wonder and their inner child could dislike this movie, but i believe this movie can make even the most hardened cynics believe in magic again.You know that place between asleep and awake that place where you still remember dreaming, that's where this movie will always exist.",Hook

127,cwbellor,"Think positive, fly high and get Hook'd.",10,16 October 2020,"Kids are kidnapped, an adolescent boy is stabbed and a pirate suffers scorpion torture in this endearing family film.When a boy grows up fighting pirates, getting high on faerie dust and causing general mayhem, what kind of man does he grow into? Well, a stuffy, stuck-up, neurotic dork of course! Robin Williams plays stick smuggler Peter Banning, a man who would surely find the real Robin Williams insufferable and immature. The Peter Banning character is not really a character so much as he is a caricature of buzzkill adulthood. When Peter's kids are kidnapped, he must rescue the tots from certain doom. It's off to Neverpupertyland with the help of pesky pixie Julia Roberts and a band of orphans with lethal weapons who are just a bit cuter than the ones you see running the favelas in City of God. When Peter lands on the Disnified set of Pirate Plaza, complete with pirate hookers - Ron Burgundy would love this place - he dons a disguise that doesn't actually hide him from Hook! After plummeting from a plank and getting some underwater action with some mermaids, Peter takes a giant seashell elevator up to boystown. When Peter lands in the playground of the lost boys, he is treated to a stimulating itinerary of aerobics, name-calling contests and food fights. He's got some adolescent competition though. Enter a skunk-headed delinquent named after the date rape drug and you've got a recipe for infanticide.This movie is chalkful of awkward cameos - we have Phil Collins, David Crosby, Glen Close as a bearded pirate and even a completely unidentifiable George Lucas and Carrie Fisher getting high as they make out with each other.None of that matters though. What matters is that Hook is in fact, an endearing heartfelt ode to childhood wonder. When you finally cut through the cheese, it is genuinely moving.",Hook
128,eyesour,Another of my stonking blunders,1,7 June 2012,"Seduced by the low, low price, I quickly glanced at the cast list, and chucked this DVD (dud?) into the supermarket trolley, without checking out the rest of it. I saw it said ""Hook"", but I knew it wouldn't be the malingerer from Zulu, so it had to be the other one, the Captain. Anyway, after slotting the disc into place, and starting to watch it, I fairly soon had this funny feeling. No credit list? Why was that? Precious. Funny, I thought. Funny. Then an unpleasant sense of overly twee schmaltz began to overwhelm me, along with mounting unease and confusion, of an infantile nature. What was this about? Where were the celebrity stars, Hoffman, Hoskins, Roberts? Why had Maggie Smith, a much greater actress, spookily materialised out of the dark at the top of the stairs? After about 15 minutes of nothing very much happening, and slowly, I started to fast forward, seeking escape from this increasingly incoherent mess. It got worse and worse. Hoskins and Hoffman did nothing for this disaster. But I've always felt there was something fairly cute about Roberts, in spite of her two-mode facial expressions, and over-worked sidelong glances.It wasn't enough. What a ghastly muddle! What a blithering load of astounding silliness, fake sentiment, aimless plotting! Brainless, feckless, pointless. The Neverland sets were hideously over-furnished. Could have been the Island of Dr Moreau. Was that a Polynesian Maori from Hawaii, pretending to be a skate-boarding Red Indian? Had that Obese Boy been lifted out of something by Dickens? Interminable sludge. The height of inanity. Whoever heard of an English housekeeper called Liza --- with a zee? Ugh. Baseball ? Huh? Huh? Finally the end credits rolled, and everything became clear: directed by Steven Spielberg! No mystery here. Close Encounters, ET had consisted of nothing much except interminable doses of murky atmosphere. This was the same, only worse. Let us not mention that risible Looking for Soldier Kelly. Kubrick once said, according to another reviewer, that some film-makers adapt stories without understanding them. The pot blackens the kettle! Neither of these two directors understands anything, except how to rake in silver dollars. Hype, Hype, Hurrah!",Hook
129,charlieoso,Fun Filled Fantasy Flick,8,31 January 2021,"Steven Spielberg does a pretty darn good job in recreating some of the Peter Pan magic in this early 90s fantasy flick. Story by Nick Castle and James V. Hart. Screenplay by Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo.Robin Williams is great as Peter Banning an overworked workaholic dad who doesn't seem to have enough time for his kids. Not to mention he also lacks any kind of imagination. His family with his wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) and his two kids Jackie (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott) are off to England to visit his Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) who helped find him a home when he was a young orphan. His kids are kidnapped and Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts in a nice energetic role) comes to get him to get them back. The big problem is Peter is unaware that he is actually Peter Pan. So The Lost Boys try to get him in shape for the final battle against Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) and save his children.To me the biggest casting homerun they hit was in getting Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook. He is perfect in the role and works excellent against Williams who is also just great in his performance.If you or your kids have read Peter Pan this should be a big hit. What is also nice is thirty years later most of the effects still stand up pretty good. Also starring Bob Hoskins as Hook's right hand man Smee, Phil Collins as Inspector Good and see if you can spot Glenn Close. Lots of fun to be had for sure.",Hook
130,kira02bit,Bland and clumsily made misfire,3,8 November 2006,"Not as awful as some would have you believe, but this revisionist updating of the unforgettable Peter Pan tale is a bland misfire from the start. None of the elements gel together into a satisfying viewing experience. There is so little magic or energy on screen that it seems impossible to believe that a director the caliber of Steven Spielberg is responsible for the final result. The story imagines Peter Pan as an adult workaholic husband and father of two children (a boy and a girl). He has no memory of his past in Neverland and makes a habit of neglecting his family. While visiting Granny Wendy in London, his children are kidnapped by nemesis Captain Hook and, with Tinkerbell's aid, Peter returns to Neverland. Unfortunately, he has no clue on how regain his old magic to save his children. One certainly must give credit for a novel and promising concept, but it never takes flight. Robin Williams, certainly one of cinema's most energetic comedic actors, seems constricted as Peter. Dustin Hoffman seems to be having a fine time as Captain Hook, but for a legendary villain he is surprisingly toothless and devoid of menace. The film's worst misstep is in the handling of The Lost Boys. Whereas the characters as related by J. M. Barrie and in other cinematic incarnations seem ones to capture the imagination, Spielberg and his writers have re-imagined them as glorified skateboard hoodlums whose shenanigans inspire more tedium than magic. These boys are dreadfully uninteresting, as is Peter's irritating son, played by the usually reliable Charlie Korsmo. Viewers should be on his side after the neglect suffered by the hands of his dad, but he emerges as vacuous as his adolescent compatriots. Ironically, for a film that features a stellar casting trinity of leads, they are oddly wasted in favor of the tiresome adolescent cast. The women in the film really have it bad. While Peter has two kidnapped children, one could easily forget that his young daughter was held hostage considering that she is all but forgotten in favor of young Korsmo. Similarly, Maggie Smith is wasted in a brief cameo as the aged Wendy and Caroline Goodall is left behind in London to fend for herself. Julia Roberts may have had a fighting chance if anyone had a clear conception on their vision of Tinkerbell. Instead of the mischievous sprite with a huge jealous streak, we get a wishy-washy tomboy who has little to do during the course of the film. The much-celebrated sets are alternately busy and tacky, and the editing is amateurish. Some scenes are cut so clumsily that it is unbelievable that someone with Spielberg's talents failed to notice, or perhaps he simply did not care. For a much better take on the Peter Pan legend, look for P. J. Hogan's Peter Pan.",Hook
131,rachelgallit,Excruciatingly Nostalgic,9,6 May 2020,"In almost every aspect of his performance, Robin Williams has delivered flawless and memorable performances. This is no exception and is in my view a jewel in the crown of his career. Peter Pan rejoined the human world and grew into a man, forgetting his fantastical past. When Hook kidnaps Peter's children, he returns to Neverland and must reconjure his boyhood magic, for the sake of his children and his own happiness. Emotionally, this film packs such a sucker-punch, as the nostalgia and bittersweet memories of childhood are shown in such detail. The audience shares Peters wish to return to the happier, innocent days. But just like Peter, we cannot rewind time. Conceptually, this is a logical continuation to the Peter Pan story, and brought it into the adult world, as the original audience had grown older. The movie was directed by Steven Spielberg (a man with a much of a reputation as Williams) and was a splendid showcase of his directing ability and vision. Taking inspiration from his family, Spielberg crafted an entertaining, if emotionally painful, version of events. When Rufio, who took control of the Lost Boys in Peters's absence, is killed in the final battle with Hook, it is excruciatingly symbolic of the true and final death of Peter Pan in Neverland. Michael Kahn was the lead editor on this project and had worked with Spielberg on many films before. This pairing no doubt resulted in a finely tuned product, as they had a feel for each other's style and vision. I give this film a 9/10 rather than full marks for the sole reason that I was left feeling so emotionally wounded, I cannot fully endorse a perfect score.",Hook

The original story was written by an English writer who would never had thought to populate his film with multi-racial Lost Boys. Spielberg made a mistake in veering from the formula.While I thought Robin Williams was fine as the older Peter Pan in this vibrant, beautifully-colored film, Julia Roberts was plainly terrible as Tinkerbell.The film was a huge missed opportunity and to this day I think what this film could have been had it been left in the hands of writers and a director who were not worshippers at the shrine of left-wing idealogy.",Hook

Who cares? It doesn't change the fact that ""Hook"" really is a bizarre, maudlin, overacted effort from whoever directed it. The messages that ""you're never too young/old to change your life"" are virtually hit over your head with a sledgehammer in true Spielberg fashion. But then again, that is why he is Hollywood's go to guy, Hollywood films generally don't have a lot of respect for the intelligence of the average film goer (although who can blame them?) and ""Hook"" is no exception. I keep thinking of the Edward Bulwer-Lytton joke from the snoopy comics every time I see a Spielberg film where he caters to 10 year olds. Even 10 year olds can appreciate intelligent work.

137,Jona1988,Underrated Spielberg,7,12 February 2011,"Many seem to hate Hook and specially most film critics, one I read stated he could not stand this film. It sure has quite a few flaws and doesn't hold up to many perhaps most of Spielberg's other movies. Even with the many problems I still feel: Hey it's not that bad! Actually I don't think it's bad at all, sure could have been better but it's still very good entertainment. Steven Spielbergs forgotten grain of gold. I really like the idea of Peter Pan growing up and forgetting everything, very interesting take on the tale. The movie starts out great feeling mysterious and dark toned. The cast is not entirely satisfying. I agree with most that Julia Roberts is really miss cast as Tinker Bell and I think Robin Williams is not the perfect choice as Pan but he works, Dame Maggie Smith is great as always but she isn't in the film much. The villains make the greatest performances Dustin Hoffman steals the show from the hero and Bob Hoskins is brilliant as Smee. When the film gets to Neverland is when a little dubious feeling sets in. What is meant to be an fantasy island looks way to much as a big set, not convincing. The lost boys are OK even though they don't make the best impression and performance throughout the film. This Neverland tale is very different from the original Disney most know, feels like something else completely. Even if I really like the idea of the story the execution of it has many problems. For a big production the plot has a ridiculous lot things that don't make much sense. Many obvious plot holes (why is Peter sleeping in the snow at the end when the kids flew into the house?) but also some major ones (Why does he grow to like a teenager if Ting took him to Neverland when he was a baby?). Much of the dialogue is very cheesy(My Jack?) but still the overly sentimental stuff(I wish I had a dad like you) doesn't ruin much for me at least. The plot could have been carried out more successfully but deep within the story has some pretty sentimental points that work well. The action scenes are fun to watch even much of them also are pretty dumb like that the pirates attack Pan one at a time, still it's superb entertainment and the sword fights has a nicely working theatre feel to them. The film has it fun parts but I think it has more of a sad tone to most of it and specially at the end(Peter leaves Neverland forever). The story is definitively not wooden or empty rather the opposite it has heart and like stated earlier even an emotional depth. John Williams fantastic music greatly contributes, he is absolutely one of the best composers and for Hook he is just as good as usual. Some have said they liked this film when they were young but realised it was pretty weak when they grew older. Not so with me I feel just as joyed as I used to after seeing it. A feel-good film for everyone young, older and family. Is this a film that you either hate or love? Maybe some would say that but I don't and I admit it has many mistakes but still I like Hook.Hook has many misses and could have been more successful in more than one or two ways. If one looks at Spielberg's entire filmography it's among the weaker ones but it doesn't mean that it's not any good. For me Hook is somewhat of a classic.Peter, don't you know who you are?

140,johnmichael-2,I never would have guessed that Steven Spielberg could produce such juvenility,2,21 November 2007,"I wish this film wasn't directed by Spielberg. I wish the music wasn't done by John Williams. And I wish so many big-name actors (Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts) weren't in these roles. This movie was a real bomb, dissatisfying in every way possible.First off, the plot was so contrived , I was practically in tears while watching it. It was like a Peter Pan fan fiction written by a particularly stupid group of giggly seventh graders. A father who's too busy to spend time with his family, who suddenly finds himself going through highly fantastical and unrealistic circumstances which eventually lead to a happy family circle? How many times have we seen that before? Too many bleeping times to count. I found it especially annoying at the end when Robin William's character had to go crazy just to show us how ""happy"" and ""changed"" he was. Really, I'm spoiling nothing here, because you've seen this kind of tripe in films since you were old enough to stare at the movie screen.Then there was the overblown, over-budgeted nonsense of the whole thing. The lavish sets and special effects are painfully obvious, but the whole story is so juvenile that nothing good ever comes of them. All it does is make us realize just how much wasted effort went into this mess. Oh, and speaking of the sets, there were some true ""what the bleeping bleep?"" moments going on in the movie. I'm not talking about the countless clichés involving family breakup and family reunion, etc. I'm talking about Tinkerbell turning big and kissing Peter Pan. I'm talking about those friggin fraggin skateboards. Ideas that make you want to line up the movie crew and execute them for being so stupid.Okay, I love John Williams with all my heart (""Harry Potter"", orchestrations for ""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", etc.). I thought his music for this movie could be moderately good, were it simply separated from the movie entirely and played by itself. HOWEVER, he decided that it was necessary to score each and every moment of this movie. And he went full-out on the pretentious show-off stuff. Sure, those violins racing up and down the scales have become quite an idiosyncrasy for John Williams (who doesn't remember those strings whizzing merrily all over the place as Harry Potter goes to get the mail in the first Harry Potter movie?). But, unlike Harry Potter, these orchestral tricks weren't subtle. They were loud, glaring, and simply EVERYWHERE. Every single scene was dominated by the music, it seemed, as if John Williams had spent the last ten years locked up and in desperate need of an energy outlet. Poor guy--I felt his heart wasn't in it; he seemed to just go through the motions. Why did he waste his talent on this movie? That's the real frustrating part--all the talent wasted. I've already mentioned the names above. But I'll focus on Spielberg's involvement. I love most of his stuff (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Minority Report"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Munich"", to name a few). But ""Hook"" was like a sweet tooth that's had too much sugar: rotten to the core. How could Spielberg torture his audience with such childlike garbage? I correct myself: not even children should be watching this. They can watch ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and other such fantasies without having their intelligence insulted.Ah, now we come upon the juvenility of the whole spectacle. It was bad, folks. Ugly, ugly, ugly. It was so bad that all sorts of aberrant desires popped into my head. I longed for Jack to side with Captain Hook and STAY sided with him (instead of inevitably turning back to his dad in the end)--denounce his family and break poor Peter Pan's heart in two. I longed Tinkerbell and Peter Pan to start an illicit affair and do all sorts of nasty acts of infidelity. I longed for Spielberg to dish out some of his ""Saving Private Ryan"" gore during the (horribly fake) battle scenes. I longed for ANYTHING that could possibly make this movie less purposefully-innocuous than it is. I longed for some deus ex machina to come in and turn the whole movie into some sick joke, seeing as such an intervention could only make it better. Huh, at least then the movie might have been entertaining.After all this complaint, I don't know why I'm still giving ""Hook"" a 2/10. Maybe because I see the effort, even if it was wasted. Maybe because this movie can serve as an example of how even the best filmmakers can go wrong. Hey, if that's the case, it's not totally useless after all.",Hook
141,donovandesign,Believe... This movie IS an absolute mess!,1,13 January 2021,"I have a general rule of thumb about movie reviews. When they start out with the words, ""Don't Believe the Haters"", you can be sure the ""haters"" are 100% correct in their critical judgement.It still amazes me though, even 30 years later, just how many confused, soppy messeges they managed to stuff into this overly produced, ham handed, musical, fantasy, comedy, adventure, fairytale, family/divorce-traumatized, after-school, ""the more you know"", grammar school morality play.Spielberg rarely, if ever bombs. But just this one film almost wiped out the blindingly artistic and humane brilliance of his other masterpieces. It's almost as if he produced it to show off to his kids just how wonderfully ""child-like"" he can still be as an adult, parent and artist.",Hook
142,carljessieson,"""Thank you for believing""",8,11 October 2010,"Hook I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little. I hadn't seen it for probably 12 years when I saw it on TV and decided to watch it. I really can't think of another time in my life where I have been flooded with memories. For all these years, I've had all these images floating around my head and I had no idea where they came from, and then I watched this movie and I found that they were all from it. I must have watched it a hundred times when I was a tiny tot, haha.All right, to the review. This is a Steven Spielberg film following a grown-up Peter Pan, who works as a lawyer and completely forgot about his life in Neverland. He is pushed back into his childhood when Captain Hook, hungry for a rematch, kidnaps his kids and holds them ransom. I think it's a really cute, original idea. I never wondered anything beyond the Peter Pan fairytale, so it was cool to see someone else's vision of what happened.It's a movie aimed to be another Spielberg blockbuster; therefore, it's full of jokes designed to satisfy a large audience and overflowing with enough cheesiness to make your tears taste like Gouda. It tries to appeal to a large audience, and that's it's biggest downfall, I think. It seems like the only funny jokes are the ones where it didn't seem like they were trying to get you to laugh. I liked that though, I love hidden gold.The actors were pretty good. I didn't hate Williams' character. I didn't like him so much either, but I didn't feel the same way I did about him in RV. Most of the child actors were awful, but I don't mean for that to sound as bad as it does. Usually I can't stand child actors, usually I think they all suck, but some of the Lost Boys were adorable and acted like real kids, instead of cute little robots. I laughed a lot during this movie, and most of the time it was because of those little boys. They're funny.I'm certainly not saying this is the best movie ever, or Spielberg's gem, but it has a special quality to it that I'm not sure I can describe. It has all the qualities of a movie I'd hate, but somehow I love it. Why is that? Just nostalgia? I don't know. Maybe it's the message, maybe it captures my hatred of becoming an adult and losing all powers of imagination. I love the moral of the film, it's cheesy, yes, but delicious. I hate to sound like a sentimental grandma, but I feel like this film contains a lot of that ""movie magic"" that makes cinema so special. It's a cute movie, it's a feel-good thing. It's full of creativity and happiness, family and love. Nice things. I'm definitely gonna buy it some day and watch it with my kids over and over. I love it. I recommend it. :)",Hook

144,timefreezer7,One of the best fairy tales ever to be seen,9,1 June 2001,"Another movie which everyone trashes . WHY ? WHY ? WHY ? OK it does not have such a great plot (on the action side) but it is one of the most beautiful stories printed in celluloid . The first hour of the movie is probably the best one . Even the fact that 30 minutes pass before the trip to Neverland without any action and you don 't get bored (and I have seen it several times) is a very positive sign . We are introducedto the family of Peter (Robin Williams) a workaholic lawyer who travels to London for Christmas to meet his dear step mother Wendy (Maggie Smith) . One of the most legendary one-liners is said when she hears that he takes advantage of bankrupt (""sinking"") companies . "" So , Peter you 've become a pirate! "" . When his children are mysteriously kidnapped he encounters a fairy (Julia Roberts) who tells him he is the long-lost (and short of memory) adult now Peter Pan . She forcely drags him into Neverland where they meet his old nemesis , the one armed chief pirate Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman) who still wants his revenge. The sets and costumes are brilliant . Hook belongs to a kind of movies which prove that cinema CAN MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE . There are classic scenes such as the first scene where Tinkerbell meets Peter or Peter on the pirate ship meeting Hook . Unfortunately the plot utterly falls flat during the second hour but the marvellous finale hopefully restores our interest . Despite the lack of plot the story itslef isvery engaging . The kid becomes an adult and must deal an old enemybefore leaving this fantasy world forever . Julia Roberts and Dustin Hoffman give good perfomances . The latter , to me , is STILL unrecognisable under the make up , after the 6 or so times I have watched the film . Is it really him ???!!!. Maggie Smith is very good and Bob Hoskins as Smee is enjoyable . One of the reasons I wrote this review is to declare that this IS Robin William 's best dramatic performance to date (forget the Fisher King or Dead Poets Society) . He is purely excellent in both aspects : a typical-mannered, obsessed with career yuppie initially , and at the end he finds his old madness and is a campy and WILD hero which looks like a restless and hypercinetic kid. (I don 't believe there would be another actor capable of playing Peter Pan). In the middle of course he is very confused and sceptical about what is going on . Nevertheless Hook is one of Stephen Spielberg 's better works to date . For you who like fantasy films it is a must see . Forget the bad comments from cynical people . Maybe they lost the kid inside them forever .HOOK                                      8.5 /10",Hook

149,DanielRobertRoss,"Difficult to love, but I don't hate it...",5,17 May 2016,"Oh Hook. Never before or since have I had such a love/hate relationship towards a film. As a kid, I loved this film, as an adult, it's more complicated. The first 45 minutes is some of Spielberg's best work. The build up is atmospheric and foreboding, which really pulls you into the story. Caroline Goodall and Robin Williams depict marital strain really well, and Maggie Smith is great as an elderly Wendy. The acting is across the board excellent, and Spielberg handles the build up with a light touch, which is sadly missing in the heavy- handed braggadocio of the second act. Because once Tinkerbell takes Peter to Neverland, the film changes, becoming an awkward mix of juvenile slapstick, maudlin sentimentality and disappointing, bloodless action scenes. And Julia Roberts is horribly miscast as Tinkerbell. The sets never feel believable, Neverland feels more like a Peter Pan ride at DisneyWorld, which is appropriate, considering that there were plans for a theme park based off the movie before the critical and box office disappointment.Dustin Hoffman's Hook is just bizarre, I'm not sure what he was going for, but he comes off as a buck toothed buffoon. His back and forth with Bob Hoskins as Smee is fun though. The final battle scene between the Lost Boys and Hook's pirates is a disappointing damp squib, filled with uninspired slapstick and a weak sword fight between Hook and Peter. The postives? Dante Basco is fun as Rufio, there are some strong scenes between Peter and his son, and the cinematography is impressive. John Williams' score for the film is up there with with his best work. It gives momentum to the weak mid section of the film, it's one of his most enjoyable scores ever. And near the end of the second act, there's a brilliant flashback, showing why Peter left Neverland. So I have mixed feelings towards the film. Did it deserve the critical derision that that it got when first released? No. Does it deserve the cult following and reassessment that fans of the film have given it over the past 20 years? Kind of, it's still a deeply flawed film, but there are some amazing moments amongst the flotsam.",Hook

I saw this movie at the movie theater when it was first released and have seen it many times since then. It seems that many of the comments about his movie are much like Siskel and Ebert's old arguments, Gene leaning more to the technical merits of movie making and Roger leaning towards entertainment value. The actors alone provide tremendous entertainments value in a place where life and death since to matter even less than it does on this planet now, if that is possible. How Dustin Hoffman, who plays the indomitable Captain Hook, ranges from whimsical to cold-hearted with the flick of his ruffled wrist, ""Kill them...kill them all."" The movie raises and answers questions about the power of the mind, the will of the spirit and the transforming loves which comes from the heart. Put yourself in the mind of Peter's children and ask yourself how you would react after finding out Peter Pan IS your father.I highly recommend this movie for young and old, if only it reminds us to pay more attention to those who are most precious to us.",Hook
152,conspracy-2,Something undefinable just went wrong with this flick.,3,20 October 2006,"This is one of those movies that leave you scratching your head. Where exactly did it go wrong? After all, we have a solid high-concept idea (""what if Peter Pan grew up?""), we have a director with a stellar track record used to making both action-adventures and children's movies, we have a magnificent cast (keep a look-out for a young Gwyneth Paltrow and a bearded Glenn Close in the scorpion box!), we have great-looking sets, good costumes, a big budget... so how did it all end up feeling a bit too much like the crappy kid's theater production in the beginning of the movie? The whole movie has this matinée feel to it. Dustin Hoffman is phoning it in, Robin Williams is doing that ""oh I can improvise better lines than scriptwriters can write for me any day!""-shtick which really gets on your nerves after watching a few of his movies, Spielberg's feel on the direction is evident but in no way heartfelt... oh, and Julia Roberts' performance as Tinkerbell is so out-of-place and ridiculous that I remember finding it off even when I saw this movie for the first time as a young boy.""Hook"" proves that sometimes, all the right elements needed to make an unforgettable classic sometimes turn into... well, something like ""Hook"" instead.

153,trixie-k-88,Hook! Hook! Hook!,8,2 March 2013,"Ah, Hook. This is one of those movies you either love or you hate. I love it, and honestly like it better than the actual story of Peter Pan, or other spins on it like Finding Neverland. But, let's see why Hook is near and dear to many hearts, and hated by others.Peter Pan (Robin Williams) has grown up into Peter Banning, a man who has no memory of being Peter Pan, and is ""a workaholic who is cold to his wife and children."" But when his wife Moira (Caroline Goodall) insists they take a trip back to England to visit her Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith) he gives in, despite his crippling fear of flying. But when Peter, Moira and Granny go to a ceremony in Wendy's honor, their children Jack (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott) are kidnapped by Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). While the logical Peter calls the police, Wendy tries to remind him of his youth—but he thinks she's lost it until Tinkerbelle (Julia Roberts) comes in the night to take him back to Neverland. While there, Tinkerbelle and the Lost Boys must help Peter remember who he is, teach him to fight, and help him get Jack and Maggie back home.It's been said many times that Spielberg considered this movie a failure, but I really don't understand why. It captures the innocence and adventure of the original Barrie story, and gives a new spin on it by questioning what it means to ""grow up"", as well having a ""cat's in the cradle"" vibe to it. The sets, wardrobe and look of the characters in Neverland are hit and miss. Some things look very fake, others look really cool. However, it is clear was the film was made in the 90s. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Hook, and I also loved Robin Williams as Peter Pan and Charlie Kosmo as Jack. The lost boys like Rufio, Thud Butt, and Pockets were interesting and unique. I also think all the actors fit their characters, except Julia Roberts. I might be pulling some thoughts off The Nostalgia Critic but Julia Roberts was way toosweet in her role of Tinkerbelle. In the days of ""Fairy Hollow"" and other Tinkerbelle popularity, people often forget that Tinkerbelle in the Barrie story (and even the 1950's Disney film!) is often jealous, vindictive, and downright mean. There was NO trace of that personality or allusion to her past indiscretions in this performance. If anything she just weirdly comes off as a ""friend zoned"" character who is still sadly in love with a man she can never have. However, plenty of scenes and characters are just epic and unforgettable. How can you not love the ""make-believe feast"" scene? Or the ""Run Home Jack"" scene? This is a great film for kids and the kid in all of us. Although you might want to fast forward through the ""boo box"" scene if there are kids under 7 in the room.",Hook
154,lerkim,Steven Spielberg Did It...,10,25 May 2008,"I have found out why, everyone in IMDb hates this movie, the reason is that they are idiots and have lost all sign of imagination, i was 15 when i first saw this movie it shoved me off my feet's. Hook is a Peter Pan story, and i think the reason it became as good as i believe it is, is simply because of imagination and of course robin Williams, but now to my ratings.Story 10/10 Right from the start you can see this is a fantasy movie, you did know that but what you didn't know is that this fantasy movie is much greater then many out there. We meet Peter Banning who is afraid of flying, of course this is the guy who was born as Peter Pan because of a mistake as a child. He is never considered by his kids, and do not have time for them at all, when Peter gets home to his kids granny Wendy, the fantasy slowly begins to start, here Peter meets his old friend Tinkerbell, at first he doesn't believe it of course because he forgot it. A letter from Captain Hook is placed on the door with a large knife saying he took his kids, this is where the true fantasy begins when Peter takes back to Never Neverland and has to prove to his kids that he loves them, and has to prove to himself that he used to be Peter Pan the boy who never became old. This story is worth everything, of course it has its bad moments but that is easy to overlook, because the story sucks you in.Actors: 10/10 Everyone plays a really good part, everyone lightens the mood, but the one who does the best is of course Robin Williams who didn't like his way of playing Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman is of course the next best, i don't think anyone else could have played a better part as Captain Hook then Dustin Hoffman, and of course Julia Roberts were perfect as Tinkerbell, i don't like the many movies she have starred in but she did this great, all in all the actors sets the mood just right, to an hard movie as this is.Music: 10/10 Fantasy music all the way, this is your typical music from Steven but the music from him have always been welcomed into the movie collection family, it does a great turn in making the movie more amazing and more enjoyable, and if that isn't something great then i don't know what is, i personally love the ending in the movie, it is normal of a Steven Spielberg, love it, or at least try.Special Effects: 9/10 The special effects are from early on so not much should be expected, but in the other it is expected because it is a fantasy. But it is actually really good for its age, you cant say that they didn't do a great job back then, it is hard enough as it is, so a great work for an old movie, for an old decade, an fantasy just needs Special Effects and it surely gives good effects for a good price, in a movie.Overall: 10/10 Everything is great, the people hating this movie, well they have lost their imagination, the have lost that little thing that should trigger a person, Steven did a great job, the wrong people just saw it. I love this movie and i know there are many millions who did also, and the many who never saw it, well bad for them. This movie is a best buy no matter what it costs it should be bought, i wouldn't want anything better then this anyway, and believe i am a movie fan i know what good movie is, and what bad movie is.Please don't destroy other with your bad comments because we all know, that you just didn't have that magical imagination.

It is visually stunning; straight out of a fairy-tale with mermaids, pirates, and flying lost boys.Robin Williams is kind of an odd choice for Pan, but the film plays out well, and the other cast members interact with him in a charming and satisfying way. The script is lighthearted and witty and gives one the same sense of timelessness the lost boys themselves must feel.Dustin Hoffman is particularly dastardly as Hook. No one upstages Hoffman in this film, not even Williams himself. His extravagant costume and flamboyant demeanor steals the scene every time. He is conniving, clever, and diabolical; a perfect villain. You learn to fear his approach in a scene as much as his bumbling pirate minions. Hoffman will never live this performance down. The magic of this film is enhanced by a variety of things, namely the lively choreography and lavish sets. You will walk away from this film ready to take on the next adventure that awaits you.",Hook

I found Julia Roberts a little saccharin at times.. some of the child actors also were a little short on believability .. but that was easy to miss if you are lucky enough to be caught up in the plot as I was .. I only noticed those small faults while watching it recently and with a more critical eye .. most of the child actors were something to behold .. especially the small child that felt Peter Pans face and discovered him to be Peter ..all that said..Hook is a movie I place in my top ten greatest movies.,Hook
163,youaresquishy,Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.,1,1 March 2007,"This movie is absolutely horrible. Everyone is cast wrong. The acting is poor. I hate all of the characters in this film. The script is completely stupid, and every single portion of the dialogue is terrible. Every single part of every aspect of this film is cheesy and stupid and bad. If IMDb used a -10 to 10 scale, this film would be well worthy of a perfect -10.Of all the hours I've wasted in my life, the hour or so I spent in the theater viewing most of this is the time I most want back. Please do not see this. Please do not show this to your children. Let's all try to forget this unforgettably horrible film, and just hope that in the future it is somehow obliterated from existence. This is very clearly Spielberg's worst film. It is probably one of the worst big films ever made by such a famous Hollywood director--so bad that there is no humor to be found in how bad it is. One just feels sorry for Spielberg messing up his rep with this piece of garbage.Audiences were leaving the theater in droves midway through it, where I saw it. I am certainly not the only one. Try seeing it again, if you genuinely still feel there was any merit to this. I dare you.As with many truly horrible films, its only value is as a litmus test. If you know anyone who claims to have enjoyed this film, it is probably very safe to completely ignore all other reviews by the same person.",Hook
164,Oz-27,Shows me the power of Believing,8,8 May 1999,"Many people have given the movie Hook a lot of negative criticism. Some say it's Steven Speilberg's worst film. I think it is one of his best. The direction is simply excellent. Every angle is captured just right. The scenery is excellent. It gave Never, Never Land a hip look but it also kept some of the original elements of the fairytale. Costuming was very well put together and when you first see the pirates you know what you're seeing. The best thing about this film is that it shows the power of believing. If you trully put you're heart and soul into something you can make it happen.The acting is pretty good. This isn't Robin Williams best film but he does have fun playing Peter Pan. Dustin Hoffman is really funny as Captain James Hook. Everytime i see him on screen i just crap. He is in top comedic form here. Julia Roberts is pretty good as Tinkerbell. I wish she would've had more screen time though. All in All a great film. Go out and rent it now. *** out of ****",Hook

166,tobybunning,Seriously Underrated,10,12 October 2020,"Admittedly when you think of Steven Spielberg you think of the greats like the legendary Jurassic Park franchise or the notorious Schindlers List,
so Hook does not get mentioned much when asked ""what did he direct"" however this film does need to be recognised more as one of his better films that is aimed for the younger audiences.
Many people class this film as one of his ""flops"" at a rating of 6.8 on here but explain how it is a flop when it is up for 5 different Oscars including Best Music Original Song.
So in my mind to call this film a flop is just plain and utterly wrong.This was always one of my favourite films growing up and I used to save it for special occasions when I used to see my family
and it was always one of the highlights when we used to meet when we all watched it together. Even now I have some of the music on my Spotify playlist
as it reminds me of those memories (kind of ironic as part of the film is about remembering certain memories)
Robin Hood and Dustin Hoffman were easily the perfect actors to play their perspective roles for this film as they portrayed them incredibly well.
The supporting cast also did a great job at representing their roles as well especially Maggie Smith as Wendy and Julia Roberts as Tink.Although to many kids (including me at the time when growing up) this is a film about Peter Pan trying to be himself again after growing up, it also has a deeper meaning
to it as well. It is about how family is important to everyone and how someone who's life is totally fixated on work needs to have a change of priorities and shift it towards
family more. With that in mind I would say this film pulls that aim off perfectly. Again when you think of Steven Spielberg apart from a few of his films, he is known for the action and special effects
like Saving Private Ryan and Jaws so its nice having one that had a deeper meaning to it, was aimed at family more and personally, I think he should do films aimed towards kids more instead of adults.",Hook

They all fit in well together so well. A magical story of Hook which take me into a wonderful fantasy land of what kids should dream about. This superb production should not be pulled down, for it is essentially a children's film but I love it. My kids thinks I am a big kid but I don't care. Julia Roberts as Tinks id Fab !

169,PL1981,Not as bad as all that,7,1 June 2009,"When I first came to IMDb to look up this movie, I was very surprised at all the negative criticism and backlash that it had generated. I had watched the movie when it came out and found it very pleasant and enjoyable and, re-watching it again just recently, I still found it a very good movie The movie's strong points to me are the scenery and design, the storyline, the music and the quality of acting by most of the cast. These factors combined ensure that the movie for the most part lives up to its potential and remains intriguing, gripping and heartwarming throughout. It has all the hallmarks of a successful Spielberg production and the movie is all the more better for itRobin Williams's performance as Peter Pan/Peter Banning is very good in both his roles as a professional businessman too busy for his children andas the reincarnation of Peter Pan later on in the movie. I do understand where many critics are coming from when they say that he has a propensity to go over the top in his acting during some parts of themovie but he's good at portraying both a serious and funny side and I think that makes him the perfect choice for this role. Dustin Hoffman and Bob Smee are both delightful in their roles as the evil villains and Maggie Smith does a great job as Wendy.There are some points on which I agree with the critics. Julia Roberts was a horrible choice to play Tinkerbell. I found her annoying from the start and she failed to give the character the charm and depth that it needed to succeed. The Lost Boys were terrible -they came across as bratty, overindulged hoodlums rather than young, innocent, mischievous children and it was quite impossible to feel any empathy with or them -they were good actors but badly written characters Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is still a worthwhile and enjoyable movie that I think young children will enjoy.",Hook
170,Richard-Nathan,James Barrie would hate this film,1,28 March 2010,"One of the main points that Barrie stresses in his ""Peter Pan"" is that childhood is a special time, but eventually there comes a time when everyone (except for Peter Pan) has to stop being a child and assume the responsibilities of adulthood. At the end of Barrie's play, Wendy cannot return to Neverland, even though she would like to, because Neverland is reserved for children.This film is typical of the selfishness of many in the ""Boomer"" generation. They steal the specialness of childhood from their children by refusing to give it up themselves.Barrie would have hated this abomination.",Hook
171,gracegibson,Just Plain Didn't Like It,4,26 January 2005,"The original Peter Pan and this movie seem to be in totally different dimensions. Robin Williams looks so unlike the original Peter Pan that it's unconvincing. Plus, I thought his wasn't that great: he still had some mannerisms of a stuffy lawyer even after he discovered his old cocky self. What wierded me out was Dustin Hoffman's performance as Captain Hook. It seemed too out-of-the-ordinary. Cpatain Hook was like some cunning devil than a pirate. This movie is known as a kid's movie but it's really not once you think about it. What about that scene where they put that pirate in that chest with the scorpions? What about that other scene where Captain Hook attempts to commit suicide? Since when was suicide and murder kid's stuff? I also thought that Peter's little drinking and anger problem was mature. It was an overall weird adult movie masquerading as a kid's movie. I don't recommend it.",Hook

Very well done!",Hook
173,gporcelli-41235,James Matthew Barrie would hate this movie!,5,8 May 2019,"I know there are many people in the world who actually love this movie but let me explain (in my humbly opinion) why I don't. Looks like Spielberg screamed ""I'm a wannabe!"" to the entire world with this movie. He tries to imitate the famous writer Matthew Barrie and his worldwide famous novel ""The adventures of Peter Pan"". In this movie Spielberg gives to Peter Pan the role of a grow up busy lawyer and a mediocre family man, one of the most distant characters from Peter Pan's soul that completely destroys him. The Peter Pan of this movie is absolutely pathethic. The movie also fails to reiterate the concepts from the novel ""The adventures of Peter Pan"" which were a hymn to innocence and childishness. It's more a hymn to procreation. The movie is also heavy to follow, unlike the novel, and the powerful cast (Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Bob Hoskins) can't save this movie from mediocrity. Also 142 minutes are way too much for a family flick.Final score 5/10 (mediocre)
Hook (1991) simply spits on Matthew James Barrie's ""The adventures of Peter Pan"".",Hook
174,Catscanfly,Magic that has to be taken on it's own terms,9,27 March 2005,"""Hook"" is one of the classics of my childhood- I don't remember when I first saw it but I've loved it for a long time.The reason that this movie is pretty unpopular with some people is not because it's a bad movie- quite the opposite- but because of it's origins.JM Barrie's amazing and well loved ""Peter Pan"" is one of my favourite books- there is nothing that has ever been written quite like it and there never ever will be, including the movie sequel, Hook. The idea of making a sequel about the grown up Peter- let alone a Hollywood movie one- would have made me cringe if i'd been old enough to contemplate the idea prior to seeing the movie.True enough, ""Hook"" is, on that level, a travesty. No actor can live up to playing Peter Pan- least of all a short fuzzy American comedian. And what was with the lost boys in this movie? American punk kids? WTF? As for the idea of erotic overtones in Peter and Tink's relationship, let's just not go there.But before Barrie's fans shudder and swear to never ever watch this movie- let me warn you that you'd be missing out.Hook may not 'work' as a worthy sequel to Peter Pan, but this doesn't mean it doesn't work on its' own terms, in its' own right.Forget all about the original when you watch this, and you will appreciate ""Hook"" as it's own movie, filled with magic, pathos, wonder and adventure. Sure, it might not be the work for the ages that Peter Pan is, but just learn to accept that fact and you can take delight in the inspired Dustin Hoffman as Captain James Hook (one of his finest performances), the endearingly unbelievability of the plot, the fantastical landscape of Neverland, the cinematography and light, the magical, dreamish quality of the Lost Boy's haven, Hook's galleon, and John William's gorgeous, sweeping score.This film has the look of a story that has lept off colourful pages and sprung to life in the minds of a billion children. I defy you not to swept along by the sight of Peter finally discovering his happy thought and swooping through a shimmering sky. I defy you to not be filled with childish wonder at the sight of the banquet appearing on the table. I defy you not to be close to tears at the end, as this Peter (who may not be the Peter we have adored in Barrie's tale, but a new peter, and one we can warm to and love readily enough) leaves his lost boys for a life he must return to.the cast too contribute to the excellence of the piece. In addition to Hoffman, we discover that although at times a little annoying, Robin Williams can turn in a funny, energetic and genuinely affecting performance (just don't bother complaining that he is hardly a fitting performer to portray an adult Peter Pan, since that performer simply doesn't exist.) Bob Hoskins is a great choice for Smee and though the idea of Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell might seem slightly dubious, it just does seem to end up working. She was pretty cool in this movie! And hey, Dante Basco was hot stuff (I don't care who knows it!) After all the years i've known this movie, I've come to love all the lost boy performers, especially the fat kid who first has faith and believes in Peter. Maggie Smith, too, deserves a mention for her lovely performance as Wendy.Sure, the film begins weakly. The characterisation in some cases is pretty bad. the script can be stupid and gets sentimental in parts. there are silly ideas in the plot, and even the premise is, when you think about it, kinda lame. One can almost hear the studio execs pitching their idea- ""hey guys, we wanna make a picture where the boy who never grew up... wait for it, wait for it..... grows up!""As I said at the start, though, this film only works when you banish all thoughts of Barrie from your mind. Some purists might argue that it's cheap, Hollywood, americanised and insulting towards the original- and who knows, they might be right- but for me, this film has so much spirit and magic that i think thirty years from now, my kids will be watching it.",Hook

176,shuichi_shindosan,The beautiful side to Spielberg's imagination,10,30 July 2006,"Hello, I find this film so intelligently magical. I watched this many years ago with my dad. It was amazing. I knew Robin Williams from 'Mrs Doubtfire' and I knew Steven Spielberg from 'Indiana Jones.' I sat down and watched. This film truly unlocked my imagination. I was 4 or 5. And this film was just truly magical. I always after seeing this beautiful movie dreamt of going to Neverland with Peter Pan. My wishes came true in my dreams. I flew with Peter to the faraway place called, Never-Neverland. I was in heaven. It was my dream and i have concurred it. I thought myself the luckiest person in the world.This film is a look at an adults imagination. I believe 'Peter Pan' is of course based on the character written in the novel by J.M Barrie. But i think the 'Peter' in this film is based loosely on 'Steven Spielberg.' I remember reading once, that Mr Spielberg had lost his childhood and he got it back by watching films and reading books full of imagination. I think he based some of that character on himself. I think Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors in the world who has one of the best imaginations in the world.I think this film is beautiful. It is a heart warming story about an adults loss to gain of imagination. Spielberg re-lives J.M Barries story of Peter Pan, and graciously gives a spectacular film of beauty and imagination.Robin Williams is awesome at playing 'Peter' he knows how to play a adult and a child. If anyone else played that role, it would have been a flop. In all fareness, Spielberg, Williams, Hoffman, Hoskins. There just kids in adults bodies. That is why i respect them so much.Love this film....10/10",Hook
177,tilloscfc,'Hook' Reviewed,7,5 August 2015,"Great film from my childhood, when I was 11 I wrote this in script format and cast school pupils in roles as a school play (that never came to fruition!) I think it was just an excuse to watch it over and over again and memorise it! A dream cast of the late great Robin Williams who is perfect as a grown up Peter Pan, the brilliant Dustin Hoffman is Hook, Julia Roberts is gorgeous as Tinkerbell the fairy and another late actor Bob Hoskins plays Hook's mischievous sidekick Smee. Directed by Steven Spielberg with John Williams scoring the music...it's all perfect! Maybe if I were to nitpick, it's a bit long winded at over two hours long and I've never quite accepted how Hook is destroyed - eaten by a dead, stuffed giant crocodile, but when we're dealing with flying humans, fairies and pirates I guess there are films where you've just got to switch off and go with it. I'm sure most people reading this have already seen 'Hook' so I won't bore you with my scene by scene account on what happens. If you've not seen it, Peter pan is now an adult (Robin Williams) forced to return to Neverland after Captain Hook kidnaps Hook's kids, and remember who he is and learn to fight the evil one handed Captain all over again. The slanging match at the Lost Boys' dinner table is a classic scene, and look out for a cameo from Phil Collins as the Police Inspector after the kids have been kidnapped!",Hook

And Hook had an actual message. It was about family and remembering childhood. A REAL moral that is presented perfectly is something that family films of today sadly lack.Robin Williams is excellent as Peter Pan. He plays both the youthful Peter Pan and the busy Dad well. Hoffman is absolute perfection. He puts in a flawless performance. I was amazed to hear that Hook was played by Dustin Hoffman because he completely immerses himself into the character. Julia Roberts is surprisingly cute and the kids are surprisingly not annoying.",Hook
180,hepnershadow,This is an enjoyable film...,9,27 September 2008,"After reading through many of the negative posts, I just had to comment. Every time I watch this film, it makes me laugh. It asks and answers the big question, ""What if..."" Is Neverland never suppose to progress? Most of the comments I read seemed to come from people who have lost their sense of imagination. I read some who said ""I was a little kid when I saw it and loved it, but now I hate it."" So in a sense, they ""grew"" up and lost that magic of make-believe. All the negativity reminds of the one scene Banning has with his daughter:""Tootles made this for me (holds up flower), it smells real nice"" she said.""It's just paper,"" Banning replies.This best describes all of you who have grown up and forgotten what it's like to be a kid, have fun, and pretend. In other words, you've become ""pirates."" Lucky you!

Wow, What a Concept!!!",9,26 March 2021,"While I suppose ""Hook"" could, if one wanted to stand on semantics, be considered a sequel to any and all of the existing versions of 'Peter Pan' storty already out there, this movie deserves high marks if for no other reason than the fact that this movie took an existing story and went off in an entirely different direction. Such a refreshing change from an industry already over-run with producers, writers, directors, and studios whose only intent seems to be to either create a cash-cow 'franchise' upon which to build an empire (think ""Star Wars"", the Bond franchise, or the Marvel universe, just to name a few) or to crank out sequel after sequel (like ""Jaws"". ""Friday the 13th"", or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies) until the viewing public themselves finally say 'enough'. And of course, there's always the fact that Spielberg, even at his worst (and this wasn't his worst; ""1941"" will forever retain that 'honor') , when supported with music by John Williams, is still better than a helluvalot of other directors at their best.",Hook

I'm dead serious, because this is, if not my favorite movie of all time, is definatly one of my favorite KIDS movies of all time. The movie differs from the 'traditional' Peter Pan storyline; Peter is now a 40 year old workaholic lawyer. When his children are kidnapped by the evil Hook, Tinkerbell takes him back to Never Never Land to have one last battle with the evil captain. This movie is well done in almost all respects. The acting is top notch, even by the young Lost Boys. The music is well done as well, even getting an Oscar nod. My only (minor) complaint is the fight scenes could have been done slightly better, but that's just a minor quibble.

185,Hecate-3,Sentimental or Sweet?,8,26 July 1999,"Hook is a vigorous, imaginative sequel to the Peter Pan story.  The movie boasts a delightful cast (Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins are excellent together.), superbly lavish sets and costumes, a good deal of charming humor, and a stirring score.  A visual feast, a heartwarming story, and a gentle sense of humor - this film offers little for deliberately angst-ridden cynics of the 90s, but it's a marvelous confection for anyone who still has a child's sense of fun and wonder, or for anyone who no longer has them and misses them.The visual representation of London and Neverland are true enough to both Barrie and Disney to avoid nasty jolts to those expecting a recreation, without being enslaved by either.  The only change that jarred was Tinkerbell's transformation from common, foul-mouthed harridan to mature, caring lady.  (I will bypass the fact that Tinkerbell died in the book on the basis that she was too integral a character not to be included.)So is the movie sweet or sentimental?  How about sweetly sentimental?  And to the critics who call it syrupy, I can only ask what's so terrible about a little sentiment?  Couldn't our world use a little more?",Hook

I'm not sure what people were expecting when this movie came out, but it is basically a children's fantasy geared up to appeal to the lost child in all of us. I guess it missed it's mark on most, but for me, it was a great, nostalgic ride. Steven Spielberg still counts it as one of his favorite and also as one of his biggest disappointments. He has said so on numerous occasions. Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams, and Bob Hoskins all give excellent comedic performances and the supporting cast is likewise appealing.If this movie doesn't make you yearn for the good things of your childhood, then you may be beyond the point of being able to reach back and capture it.",Hook

He is the greatest director of all time in my opinion. At times the movie does drag but it's a charming, heart-warming, family flick that entertained lots of people, while those who like Hook say, it's not one of Spielberg's best, I disagree, I consider it to be one of his best. The story was great, the acting was amazing, I mean seriously, Robin Williams? That guy is a great actor. Aladdin, Good Will Hunting, Runaway Vacation, honestly this guy is a brilliant actor. Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook? Perfect decision. The issues of father-son relationships, learning how to behave, those issues could not usually work in a movie, but this one did it very subtle.

190,martinjacob49,"Fun, More Fun Than What I Thought!",7,26 March 2014,"Steven Spielberg adds a twist on his take of the classic Peter Pan story, where an adult Peter Pan, one who has completely forgotten his time in Neverland, has to return to his past to fight Captain Hook and rescue his abducted children.Ever since Hook was first released, the critics have tore up the film. And I have their respect, as its their opinion. But being a fan of Spielberg's work and one that has never watched the film before until now, I was quite surprised that I actually enjoyed this film. Sure it's not as great as some of Spielberg's other films, such as Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film.I'm guessing the film is criticized mostly for Julia Robert's performance as Tinker Bell (definitely a massive miscast), and there was that one awful scene where she ends up turning into a human. Yeah that was just plain awful. Didn't care too much for The Lost Boys either. Most of them seemed to be rather annoying and obnoxious rather than fun and rebellious like in other versions of the past. Oh and the pacing was also a bit of a pain as well. But the film was still quite a bit of fun. Other than Julia Roberts, the rest of the performances were great. Bob Hoskins as Smee? Great as it sounds!!! Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook? While not completely menacing, still fun to enjoy? What about Robin Williams as Peter Pan? To me, he pretty much sums up why I liked the film. Williams uses what he does best, which is his comedy, and just has the most fun I've seen him in a film, and that's why Hook is such a fun film. Spielberg's direction of the classic story is highly original, the visuals are decently passable, the comedy was fun, John Williams score is adventurously awesome, and I enjoyed the energetic performances. It's cheesy and sometimes painfully awful, but I have to admit it was fun.",Hook
191,k_jasmine_99,Wonderful!,9,18 July 2000,"This movie is really great.  Robin Williams gives a marvelous performance as the workaholic father who slowly begins to remember who he really is. Towards the beginning of the movie, when Peter Banning's son tells Granny Wendy that his dad is a corporate raider, she has a great line:  ""Why Peter, you've become a pirate.""I'm not sure why some folks hate this movie so much they seem downright angry about it, but I think it is a sweet, well-told fairy tale, fit for the whole family to watch.  (Smaller children may find the scenes where Peter's two children are kidnapped a little frightening.)Dustin Hoffman plays Capt. Hook to the hilt, and seems to have a lot of fun doing so.One of my favorite moments in the movie is when Rufio challenges Peter Banning (who still hasn't remembered that he is Peter Pan).  One of the smaller lost boys walks over to Robin Williams, who kneels down in front of him.  The boy then starts to touch his face, pushing the wrinkles aside, if you will, and then his eyes light up and he says, ""It is you.""  Very sweet and captivating.My only complaints with this movie are the unnecessary death of one of the characters (I won't say who), Julia Roberts is out of place, and the ending was a little off.  But despite these minor problems it is still a great movie to watch over and over again.  Kudos to Steven Speilberg and Robin Williams!",Hook

But as Peter Banning, the way the character is written for this film, he's just likable and naturally funny enough to make the best of a mediocre script.Julia Roberts...well, yes, she was terribly miscast, bless her soul.But Dustin Hoffman....yes it is over-the-top, yes it is hammy, and oh boy, is it fun to watch him. He embodied Captain Hook so fully that neither I nor my parents recognised it was him for the first time we saw it. Deliciously evil, his menace feels real while never becoming horrifying. And his scenes with Bob Hoskins as Smee feature some truly clever (and funny) dialogue.The music by John Williams is simple and repetitive, but very catchy and thrilling. It does the job quite well, and is used wisely such that I never got tired of it.I am grateful that this is not the only film made about Peter Pan. For the direction Spielberg chose to take this, he did it well enough that I have a grand time at every viewing. There is a certain magic about it that makes one smile and want to be a Lost Boy.....it is only in small part the magic of Peter Pan (which is generally much diminished due to all the Hollywood-Americanized touches), but mostly due to Spielberg's magic. It may not be the best magic for a Peter Pan story, but it is a considerable one all the same.",Hook

Sometimes i truly wish this were the top-grossing film of 1991. Taking place a few years after Pan has technically left Neverland, he has entirely forgot about his Happy Neverland Life and has became a Father of 2 working as a governmental lawyer and Wendy Darling's Granddaughter as his wife, But ever since Hook (Dustin Hoffman) Steals his children, he must find a way to win them back by learning how to fly and remembering as much of Neverland as possible! He remembers being a baby who got lost but quickly went to Neverland with Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) And then after that, he arrived home and felt replaced, but quickly joined Wendy Darling! Years passed and Wendy grew too old to fly, That was when he first saw Mora and he deeply fell in love with her!

This film will probably be most appealing to kids, silly at times, but full of swashbuckling fun. Dustin Hoffman does a superb job in the roll of Captain Hook and with Smee at his side I'm reminded of the Luthor Otis relationship in Superman giving a humorous side to our villain's evil persona. Robin William was also perfectly cast, after all who better to play a man who was the boy that never wants to grow up? Neverland itself is exactly what it should be, a wonderful fantasy world full of color and magic. And John Williams score is, in my opinion, truly one of his bests. I say treat this film like you'd treat Phantom Menace, as long as you're not too picky about some cheesy lines and bad kid acting it's a pretty enjoyable film.",Hook

Wendy is very old now, having cared for orphans during the decades. Among her former charges is corporate lawyer Peter Banning (Robin Williams), married to Wendy's granddaughter Moira (Caroline Goodall). However, Peter's obsession with his work is rapidly destroying relations with his two kids, Jack (Charlie Korsmo) and Maggie (Amber Scott). One Christmas, Peter and his family journey to London, where Wendy will be honored for her charity work...but disaster soon strikes, with Jack and Maggie missing. The only clue left behind is a letter pinned to the door by a dagger, signed ""Jas Hook, Captain"".With no options left, Wendy tries reminding Peter about his past, but he dismisses her as crazy...until an old friend spirits him away for an amazing journey. To save his kids, Peter must not just fight Hook, but embrace the childhood he'd long since forgotten.I was 11 years old when this film came out, and I've seen it more times than I can remember.

198,Studio Morye Reviews,"Underrated, with bad spots",10,31 March 2001,"Spielberg's ""Hook"" is often critized as being too childish. Why? Some may say the same thing about Jurassic Park. ""Hook"" is a film with some glaring bad spots - John Williams' occasionally irritating score, Julia Roberts' Tinkerbell (and even worse, the minor romance between she and Peter) and a few bits of Hallmark-ian dialogue are basically all I can think of. Let's start at the beginning.Peter Banning, middle-aged lawyer extraordinare, doesn't do a whole lot with his kids. He misses his son Jack's big baseball game, but makes it to daughter Maggie's play. He frequently has to answer his cell phone. On a trip to England, the children are kidnapped by someone claiming to be the literary villain Captain Hook. Peter's adoptive grandmother tells him that the Peter Pan books are all true and that he IS Peter Pan, after leaving Neverland. Unbelieving this, he is confronted by Tinkerbell while drinking and taken off to Neverland to save his children.Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins steal the show as Captain Hook and his assistant Smee in some truly hilarious scenes, including one in which Hook decides to kill himself. The sets, costumes, and dialogue (with some exception, mostly revolving around the Banning children) are good, and the crocodile with the big clock in his mouth is truly, well, cool.
Robin Williams looks outrageous in tights, but fortunately, the writers poke fun at themselves. The lost boys are much better portrayed than Disney did and the atmosphere is very piratey (even though in some scenes the viewer feels like they're trapped in a Disney amusement park). It has some real poignancy and then some mock hallmark sentimentality. Williams' score blasts throughout what seems to be the entire picture, which does, in fact, get irritating. Overall: 7.5 out of ten.",Hook
199,Mathewdixon42,Wonderful re-imagining of a wonderful story,10,11 May 2016,"Hook would not appear to be a perfect film to everyone. Obviously. But to those who do love this movie, we are more than happy to tell you why. This film is wonderful. From its stars, to its take on the story, to its sets, to its sense of wonder and childlike amazement. No, this is not the greatest movie of all time, but there are a lot of people out there who will tell you it is one of their favourites. It is the consummate crowd pleaser. First of all, the actors. There are many great performers filling the cast here. Robin Williams is unusual in this film, in that he's not trying to be funny. In the first half or so, his character is very unlikable. This was a somewhat new choice for him at the time. He had always come across very lovable until then, before his foray into playing serial killers later on. Williams is impressive in how he handles his characters movements from uptight lawyer and bad father, to 10 year old kid, to legendary warrior and back to lawyer again sans the uptight/bad fathering. Dustin Hoffman. This man is simply here to have fun. His performance is neither definitive or great. Its not even award worthy, its just plain fun. Dustin Hoffman is more known, even today, for his dramatic roles. He threw caution to the wind with this one to give us a Captain Hook who was both sophisticated, and psychopathic. If anything, he captured hook perfectly. Julia Roberts is difficult to critique here. She can neither be labeled as good or bad, because I don't think she fits the role of Tinker Bell. She is one of my few issues with this film. The child actors are all very passable. Their performances did not feel as awkward as some child actors can. But the standout for me Raushan Hammond as Thudd. This kid just tugs at my cold black heartstrings. This kids is wise beyond his years and not even for a second does he seem fake. It is a real shame he never broke into major acting later on. He made me remember him for life, Him and his Mother. (Tear in my eye)I have read that viewers say the sets in this film look more like a theme park ride than actual sets. They are right, but that is what is so fun about them. They reminded me of Williams earlier film, Popeye. They felt like something out of a dream and I maintain that they fit the tone of the film. This film can veer from serious to silly too quick in its treatment of the Pan story for sure. Taken separately however, the first half is very well done. It had a mysterious, almost horror like tone to it. The second half is very fantasy/cartoon like, which appeals more to its demographic I suppose. This shift in tone can be jarring for some. I believe the transition is handled smoothly and works positively for the film. Mostly because it is a fantasy, and reality is supposed to change when you go to Neverland. Some would say this is a failure for a master like Steven Spielberg. I don't believe so, I see what I believe he was trying to do with it, and I believe he succeeded with flying (no pun intended) colors!10/10. I may be biased as a grew up with this film, but looking at it even as an adult it still makes me feel the same way. I feel like a kid again. The only downside in the film is Tinker Bell, I don't know where they were trying to take her character and I believe she was miscast. Minor flaw in an otherwise very enjoyable film for families.",Hook

203,scyker,Magic,10,17 March 2007,"I love this movie. It was a great childhood movie. I find it much more consistent with the original play then that god awful Disney version was. That movie had a sense of darkness but also had a lot of childish wonder. Sure, Spielberg annoys me from time to time. And he's kind of overrated. But I liked his vision of a sequel to Pan. I always loved this movie. I loved the never-food scene when he can suddenly see the food. Whose imagination wasn't captured by that? Peter Pan is not really intended to be happy play. Just as Mary Poppins wasn't intended to be. This movie is wondrous for everyone, young and old. The acting could have been a little better. Oh well. I never really thought Julia was all that great anyway. This movie is worth more than what it is considered. It should have made more at the box office.

204,hmf_oze,Nostalgia Factor,8,19 May 2006,"I was drawn by Steven Spielberg's vision of Neverland. An impressionist and impressive vision of Peter Pan's surroundings. Spielberg tries to wake in each of us the child within, or at least make us remember it. It had a bit nostalgia effect on me, a very deep feeling of innocence. In this movie you can feel a kind of spirit floating, you feel the weight of the past, the legend. I mean, you feel like reading Peter Pan's stories since you where a kid and now you get the chance to know Neverland, where all those stories happened a long time ago. It is a very good feeling of fantasy and Spielberg's magic! I won't say it is a ""must see"", it's not. But for some people like me who can feel that ""magic"" in the movie it is a very good movie worth to see more than one time and to be remembered. Excellent directing! Good actors, specially Robin Williams and of course, Dustin Hoffman. Great soundtrack, the eternal John Williams.I understand the fact why some people hated the movie, if you never seen it i would recommend it.

I would have liked to see more interaction between Peter Pan and Captain Hook, and also more screen time for the Captain Hook character generally.Also, Neverland is supposed to have pirates and Indians in it, and there WERE a LOT of pirates. But I never once saw an Indian.Maggie Smith was a fine actress and it is always great to see her on screen.I thought that the end of the film, with the old man flying out of the house, was kind of nutty and really unnecessary, a la the all-too literal ending of ""Cocoon"", in which the senior citizens are shown flying away in an alien spaceship.My problems with this movie, though, are minor, and I generally consider this a very good fantasy film for kids and adults--at least those of us who never quite grew up--alike.",Hook
206,clarkpark,Barrie would have been pleased,9,5 September 2006,"Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is a 90's kind of guy, a driven workaholic who spends too much time on his cell phone and too little with his children. He is a premature old fart devoid of imagination or playfulness. Then he and his family return to his boyhood London home to visit Grandma Wendy (Maggie Smith) the philanthropist who took him in as an orphan, raised him and whose granddaughter Maura he married.On their first night, Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) has Peter's children kidnapped. To spur him to rescue them, Grandma Wendy reminds Peter of his long-repressed origins  he is, or was, the real Peter Pan. He refuses to believe this until Tinkerbelle (Julia Roberts) shows up, sprinkles him with pixie dust and, before he knows or in any way approves of what's happening, he's sailing past the second star on the right. In Neverland, Peter must find his original qualities somewhere inside him to win back the Lost Boys and battle Hook for his children and their affection.Robin Williams gives a performance only he is capable of in this lovely tale of recapturing youth and realizing that the most important things in the adult world really aren't very important at all. If you have no capacity for innocent romance, like some other posters here, you'll hate this movie. If, on the other hand, you consider being likened to Peter Pan as one of life's greatest compliments, you need to get a copy of Hook and clear some time in your adult schedule to reconnect with your own sense of joy and wonder.",Hook
207,JoeyCunninghamLennox,The Perfect movie.,10,16 November 2013,"I was shocked at the low rating of this movie. For me, although not nearly my favorite picture, it is the complete, perfect movie. There are so many cute little references to the earlier stories of Peter Pan and one of the key themes which appeals to me is Fatherhood, which is an obvious extension of the original which is largely concerned with Motherhood. I love the character development in this movie. Not only in transforming captain Hook into a genuinely fearful villain rather than the traditional coward as seen in the Disney cartoon, but in that we see Peter finding the correct balance between growing up and staying young. The score is instantly recognizable and consolidates the movie as an epic.",Hook

Just don't come complaining to me when your brain turns to honey and oozes out of your ears. Anyway, ""Hook"" is certainly the worst movie Steven Spielberg ever directed and seems even more politically correct, family friendly and syrup dripping than the most colossal Di$ney fiascos.The sets look more fake than those in ""The Flintstones"" and the acting is miserable on all levels. Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts look forced and never seem to enjoy their roles - not that I can blame them. Oh, and did I mention Robin Williams sucks in this turkey?The dinner scene with the Lost Boys is enough to make even the youngest and most inane viewers puke marshmallows all over the floor. I am talking sugar OD here; honey and cinnamon catatonia. Movies like this are an insult to kids all over the world (not to mention adults). ""Hook"" must have the worst quality/budget quotient in movie history.Reference - 10 Star Kiddie Movies:""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" (the animated 1979 TV movie which is better than all modern Di$ney productions combined)""The Dark Crystal"" (surprisingly original Jim Henson puppet movie)",Hook
210,bollekeceuninx,Use your imagination,10,24 April 2002,"I don't get it.  Why are a bunch of you hacking this movie to pieces ? With criticisms that are as farfetched as ridiculous.  This movie is a tribute to imagination and fantasy.  It shows you what happens when you loose your imagination.  But of course we don't want to accuse ourselves of loosing that, so we call it ""growing up"".  It really doesn't matter whether we're 12 or 40 or 80.  Which to my opinion is exactly mr. Spielberg's point and couldn't be portrayed any better than by mr. Williams.  Obviously the bad criticisms are written by people resembling Peter Banning more than they do Peter Pan. Personally I have a few simple criteria to judge a movie. If it ""touches"" me in that special place we all have deep inside of us, a movie is already well on its' way to land in my Toplist.  If it has a story to tell and is accompanied by music that underlines it organically it is certain to have a place on that list. ""Hook"" has a story to tell.  And a nice story.  Even the bad guys are fun. Mr. John Williams music fits the scenes like a glove.  I dar anyone to say that he or she is not touched by the scene where the little Lost Boy tries to erase the wrinkles out of Peter's face exclaiming : ""There you are, Peter Pan !"" Mr. Hoffman and mr. Hoskins are hilarious in their various scenes, but getting in to that would be spoiling your fun. I am not afraid to say that I gave this movie a wholehearted 10 ! And as for the critics : I'm sorry to say that you have grown up.  Or with Wendy's words : ""Boy, you have become a pirate..."" By the way, gentlemen critics, hearken to the saying : ""Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.  And those who can't teach, criticize.""",Hook
211,subteacher-imdb,My favorite movie of all.,10,13 April 2021,"The title of this review is no reach in my mind. ""Hook"" is my favorite movie, and I don't see any others surpassing it anytime soon. I remember seeing it as a child not long after I saw the original Disney classic Peter Pan. I liked it then. Watching it as an adult, I find it to be a fantastic, fun, deep and profound story.The story covers pretty much all the bases when you ask the question ""What would happen if Peter Pan did grow up?"" The story tugs on your heartstrings as an adult, especially if you have kids. Often times, life can do such a number on us that it can seem like an overwhelming burden. That angst that builds up can affect your work life as well as your family life. If you let that angst boil over, it can leave your kids scarred in one way or another. They will come to resent their coming adulthood, refuse to grow up, and mentally and sometimes physically run off and become a ""lost boy."" That's what Peter Pan was for a long time before deciding to become an adult. However, he tragically became the very person he once resented; a Captain Hook type figure. A scared, scatter-brained tyrant. The irony is... heartbreaking as you see him struggle against the real Captain Hook to get his children back.Then, we meet the gang of the Lost Boys. There is a new leader, and a new cast of characters. This gang embodies how times have changed. They are a diverse bunch now. The casting choices were no coincidence. While the original Peter Pan as told by Disney has a lot of good, it also, to put it lightly, was very culturally insensitive. This movie was made to reach a much wider audience, and it seemed to have succeeded. After all, the lessons of this movie apply to all of us equally regardless of race.Author, clinical psychologist and lecturer Jordan Peterson once suggested in his talks, ""Find what you lost as a child and regain it."" That's what this story is about. We have our responsibilities as adults, but we should never lose sight of what gave our individual lives purpose. This is our ""happy thought."" For parents, it's their children. For a single adult, it can be an appreciation for what you have, the work you're putting in, etc. If you're a child, maybe it's dreams of your future, your hero whether it's a parent or even a sports legend or superhero. Peter, upon deep reflection, remembered why he wanted to grow up after all: to be a father. Upon regaining his inner child and appreciation for his life, he discovers he can fly again! A very earned and inspiring moment.A great tragedy of ""Lost Boys"" is that they don't physically stay boys. We all are familiar with people who refuse to grow up, be mature, and accept responsibilities for at least themselves. It can be a very ugly sight. Tragically, many ""lost boys"" don't get a chance to mature before it's too late. Rufio, the new gang leader, takes on Captain Hook and, to the astonishment of the audience, loses and dies as a result. When I see this, as a teacher, I think about young children who grow up physically, but end up growing down the wrong paths in life. They get involved in gangs, drugs, alcohol, etc. Some of them end up in jail, or worse, dead from drugs or guns.Captain Hook's persona can take the form of physical beings like tyrannical parents, teachers, and law enforcement officers. Maybe they're snake-oil salesmen you encounter throughout your adult life. It could be your own inner demons. Perhaps he's the embodiment of the Devil himself. This movie ultimately teaches us not to allow those tendencies to take our eyes off of what makes our life whole. It inspires us to embrace life and all of its suffering and unpredictability, but also its wonder and adventure. It certainly doesn't do us any good to finger-wag and talk down condescendingly to our youth. When you encounter Peter Pans in your life, don't be a Captain Hook.10/10.",Hook
212,sjdean-1,Cheated by Hook,5,28 December 2004,"As a ""young"" kid, probably of about 16 when I first saw it, I loved this movie.Then I grew old, and I started to find it embarrassing - ""Bang-a-rang"" and the whole stupidity of it, the sickly, sweet, brightness of it all. It felt too cheesy, and I couldn't explain why.I picked up a copy of Peter Pan (2003) the other day after wondering whether it would be too childish, but I found it an absolute delight - fluffy and dark at the same time, complex, full of metaphors, a really intelligent film - something to think about, and I just had to compare the two movies because now I feel cheated by Hook.On reflection, Hook is very simplistic and mundane, and if that's what Steven Spielberg's films are coming to, simplistic ""eye candy"" then maybe he's not my favourite director anymore.First we have to accept the challenges that he is orphaned to an American family though he marries the English grand daughter of Wendy and he forgets who he is. Then has to go to Neverland to rescue his family, where we learn that Smee has his medical records. Peter Pan then forgets who he was as Peter Panning but somehow remembers from some strange romantic rendezvous with Tinkerbell, who should have been long dead by then.We have to accept the terrible sets, where there is no background to the pirate ship, the lost boys now have some kind of Roller Coaster, and play basketball, and for some bizarre reason, Rufio is wearing tights.Then we have to accept things that seem like gross over simplifications on the original story. For example, in Hook, it seems that the only reason Peter was afraid to grow up was because everyone who grows up has to die.We also have the oxymoronic features of the film of political correctness AND stereotypes of fat people being used as rolling bombs to splatter the pirates like bowling pins. Then also the pirates are really rather cute and beautifully choreographed.Don't get me wrong, this is classic family fayre, its typically ""Disney"", mundane, sweet, and appealing to the ""lowest common denominator"" as I've heard it touted. But it's hardly a cinematic masterpiece full of scenery, and emotion, and dialogue full of heart. Also just because it has lines from the original story, doesn't make the film good. They're unnecessary and just serve the film makers to attempt a pathetic demonstration that they have read the book.",Hook

I still cry during the scene where Pan goes back to the tree where the lost boys hid out in the original cartoon. He starts to remember this past of how he was orphaned, taken to neverland, and watched his best friend Wendy grow old as he forever stayed a young boy. Reaching deep into his past of sadness and happiness, Pan (Robin Williams) evokes real emotion from the audience. Perhaps this is not one of Spielberg's better films, but to me, this is saying alot about the man. The fact that love one of his lesser effort as a childhood favorite, makes me want to watch all the rest of his films, such as Encounters and the Color Purple. Spielberg is truly a great director, and this movie, while not showing every facet of the man's ability, is truly an enjoyable and memorable ride. Please watch this movie (with an open mind) and judge it for what it is, not as a flawless work of a master director.

I have loved this film since my childhood, and recently was on the verge of tears during one particular scene.Perhaps people just don't know what to make of this movie... and they critize it as being kiddie and trite and whatnot... its a KID's MOVIE, for God's sake! Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams are great in their characterization of Hook and Pan. The beginning of the movie builds great tension with the ""After-the-fact"" kidnapping - the hook slashes down the hallway build up great suspense. Just...MAN THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!Like I said before, just pretend this movie is rated ""7.5"" and go RENT IT! You will love it! Just don't except an all out Spielberg masterpiece, you might be just a little (yes, maybe just a little) disappointed.

220,mlk960,"You know, I like it.",7,19 May 2013,"Looking through the reviews I see so many people with 1 star reports, giving reviews with large, multi-syllable words. What do you think you are doing here? You clearly watched the movie with the clear intention of criticizing it from an intellectual standpoint. The absolute truth is: that is wrong. This is a movie of feeling on a whim. It is not to provide some existentialist analysis. The first time I saw this, I was probably about three. I still feel as good watching it now as I did then. That is the true testament to it's good job. Sure, it has a lot cheesy and cliché moments, but those are only undertones to the film as a whole, which feels like an adventure that belongs in Disney land.The bottom line is: If you didn't like the movie, it is because you didn't want to.Just let yourself enjoy it.

221,bignastybastard,Never forget your inner child,10,5 July 2013,"Back in 1994 when I was 10 this was a favourite of mine, I even had all the action figures. As I got older I never really thought much of it until the other day when I decided to watch it just for the hell of it. Now as an older person with more understanding all I can say is that this is one of the most amazing films ever. There were points in the film where I even started weeping and getting emotional.Hook tells a great story about A grumpy lawyer named Peter Banning who takes life too serious who has forgotten about his childhood as Peter Pan. Captain Hook kidnaps his children and takes them to Neverland to lure him in for one last battle, the only chance he has of saving them is to remember his forgotten past as Peter Pan and do battle with Captain Hook. The film is a huge reminder that I should always keep in touch with my inner child and never let go.Acting wise Robin Williams brings his A game as does Dustin Hoffman, Bob Hoskins and the rest, Julia Roberts is in it too but she's nothing to write home about.If you've never seen it then you should watch it, whether your a child or adult it doesn't matter, the film is one of the best adventure tales ever. If you've not seen it for a long time then re-watch it because like me it is a great reminder of how I was back when I was 10 and even helped me find my less cynical side.10/10",Hook
222,crossluke21,Sadly over-criticized gem.,9,24 June 2021,"I don't know what people expect from this movie. I can't understand the low reviews. Spielberg has a way of making movies that bypass your mental faculties and go straight to your heart. When I watch this movie I experience it completely on an emotional level. It fills me with childlike awe and wonder. It is a movie to be experienced, not analyzed.One common critique is that the sets look fake but I just don't see it. The little bit of artificiality they portray gives the movie a quaint, charming quality. And they don't even look that fake. It is a massive step up over the cartoony CGI green screen back drops we are subjected to today.Another common complaint is Julia Roberts' performance as Tinkerbell, but she did fine. Maybe not the strongest part of the movie but I like that they have Tink some emotional depth beyond a little hug that flies around.This is a beautiful, awe-filled movie, made by Spielberg at the top of his game, showcasing all the hallmarks of the filmmaker at his best and most creatively uninhibited.",Hook

226,NoodleFromWithin,"There's no more difference between reality and imagination, between being a kid and an adult...",10,21 September 2021,"I've watched this movie countless times, since I was just a little child. It's always been one of my favourites, and this has never changed. After 30 years from its release, to celebrate its anniversary, I was able to watch it for the umpteenth time, but at a cinema! The emotions this movie can excite are uncountable, nobody can watch it and remain indifferent. For me it was like another trip down memory lane, it brought me back to my childhood, when I was innocent, happy, pure, eager to live a thousand new adventures, like every other kid! When I went to the cinema, I left the venue with joy in my heart and tears all over my face... Memories of my childhood were reappearing before my eyes, like a mix of light-heartedness and sadness. The wonders of this movie? Starting with an exceptional cast - Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Julia Roberts - and going all the way to one of the most loved tales of all times - Peter Pan: what else could we possibly ask for? This film focuses on an adult version of Peter Pan - here portrayed by the superb Robin Williams - who has forgotten all about his past days and needs to go on a mission to rescue his own children and retrieve those missing pieces of a broken memory. Every time I watch this movie, I can appreciate something new - the acting is superlative, the storyline is full of surprises and sweet moments, the dialogue (especially between Hoffman and Williams) is epic, the soundtrack is masterfully recorded with the aim of grabbing the viewer's attention and luring them to a world made of magic, mystery, and a pinch of fairy dust: Neverland! Let's face it: who hasn't thought about traveling to Neverland, at least once? I personally know a lot of grown-ups (including myself) who still keep, deep down, the desire to find their own Neverland, a place where everyone of us can always be happy and surrounded by people we love the most. Today we have forgotten that our world can be full of magic, in everything we touch, everywhere we go, every person we randomly meet, and ""Hook"" helps us to remember all of this, day after day - we just need to believe! Take your children to watch this movie: they will enjoy a memorable experience, they will learn important values like family, love, loyalty, friendship - values, nowadays, too often forgotten.",Hook

What a wonderful cast for this film, and I feel that this one carries the original message of the novels better than any other Peter Pan related movie out there.Watch it with your children, or amongst those friends who remember watching it when they were young. I feel that movies that spark the imagination are rare or coated with too many special effects and hardly any substance these days.This is a classic. It is fun and warm and familiar. Relax and enjoy it. Children movies are not meant to be watched with a stiff posture and an eye for mistakes or flaws. Be a kid again, think happy thoughts, and remember how to believe.",Hook
228,LexiWolfe,Your Childhood Will Love You For Giving It This Movie,9,1 September 2013,"It's hard to believe that 'Hook' the film based on Sir Barrie's amazing Peter Pan story is over twenty years old now. I found it on beloved LoveFilm one Sunday night when I was at a loose end and in need of distraction... And what a movie to provide it!Peter Pan eventually found love back in London England in the form of Wendy's granddaughter Moira. But Captain Hook, stuck back in Neverland forever fighting off the Lost Boys and Indians, has not forgotten or forgiven, and kidnaps the now very-grown-up, business-orientated Peter's often-overlooked kids, holding them as leverage for Pan's assured return so Hook can have the final war with him and the Lost Boys he's been gearing up for for years. Peter returns with the help of Tink but, has completely forgotten everything, including his own real identity over the course of the years in which he's been in the Real World. So both sides start to prepare for a fight to the death, prepared to do anything to gain an advantage...Robin Williams makes a convincing Pan, who has literally given up his wild youthful days and forgotten all about them, needing to be put through rigorous tests before he can remember and do what is needed of him. With such a role and how it has been written, one needs to balance the comedy with the more serious moments with gravitas and, proving even here that he's not just a comic actor, Williams strikes it very right!Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins make a wonderfully formidable and naturally funny team as Captain Hook and Smee, bouncing off each other splendidly (and probably with a good pinch of ad-lib) in several scenes. It's hard to believe it actually is Hoffman under all those eyebrows, but with his usual Method style, completely throws himself into the role and is unidentifiable within it. (As a fellow actor, I'm in awe of when actors can do this)A lot of the kid actors in it as well are quite obviously having the time of their lives and hold a good performance despite their young years. Maggie Smith is on top form, as per, as Wendy, as is Caroline Goodall, most recently seen as the bitchy Duchess Cecily in The White Queen (who'd have thought it???)It is a wonderfully feel-good movie, even with the short but hard- hitting death scene (no spoilers here, me laddie!) The added touch of making Neverland a young kids paradise to live in, complete with proper treehouse with a built in skate park, weapons which fire eggs and rotten tomatoes and a real Us vs. Grown-ups feel to it, makes one feel both nostalgic for one's own childhood and proves very endearing in the overall feel of the film, without being overly twee. We also see a very endearing take on where Peter Pan may originally have come from, which is never really touched upon in the book (if memory serves). The more tender moments are of course needed in such scripts, coming in the form of realizations of what life's important moments are and should be. These softer moments are also very reminiscent of Barrie's writing style, where happiness is mixed with reflective sorrow, proving almost surprisingly shocking. It completely takes you back to being a kid, its overall message being it's okay to get older, but you don't necessarily have to give up being a kid.",Hook
229,lillambie,Who could NOT love this?,10,27 June 2011,"Who can not fall in love with such a crazy masterpiece? Not I and here's why! The story starts off with a grown up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) who, now a lawyer and family man, doesn't seem to get along with his children very well and often tells them to grow up. As the story progresses you meet up with the lovely Wendy Darling (Maggie Smith) who exclaims 'Peter, you've become a pirate.' Later on when Wendy goes to a celebration for her work on looking after children, fostering them, Peter's children are kidnapped by the evil Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). Later on meeting up with the mischievous Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts), she takes him to Neverland where he once came from and gets in to all sorts of trouble, especially when he needs to prove to his replacement Rufio (Dante Basco) that he IS 'The Pan' so that he can get an army - The Lostboys - to defeat Captain Hook and save his children.It's a wonderful tale and I won't spoil it all by saying everything that happens.

Oops - If you're reading this Mr Spielberg please ignore that last comment. Add to this Robin Williams who has two acting styles: manic and schmaltzy and Julia Roberts miscast as Tinkerbell.

231,Dash_Rendar,Not for the Pan Purists,9,28 April 2006,"Let's make one thing clear first. This film was not meant to be a direct follow-up to J. M. Barrie's famous novel and some of his rules are discarded so that the story can fit the filmmakers' vision. If you believe that Barrie's work is sacred and should not be tampered with in any way, then avoid this film at all costs. If however, you can accept the changes and are in the mood for an exciting adventure, then ""Hook"" is more than worth your time.The film offers an alternative vision of Barrie's novel and a side story of what might have happened if Peter Pan decided to abandon Neverland and live a life in the normal world. The story introduces us to Peter's alternate life (now adopting the name of Peter Banning) with his two children, his wife Moira (Wendy Darling's granddaughter), and his hectic lifestyle as businessman. Though Peter's days in Neverland are long over (so much that he's lost all memory of them), his old nemesis Captain Hook still seeks to obtain his revenge and finish the feud once and for all. When Peter and his family visit Wendy at the Darling household, Hook somehow finds a way to enter Peter's world and kidnaps his two children, holding them hostage in exchange for one final showdown. After Wendy reveals the truth of Peter's past to him, he reluctantly finds himself back in Neverland on a quest to settle his unfinished business and return his kids safely home. And that's when the fun begins.The all-star cast is outstanding. Dustin Hoffman is nearly unrecognizable as the devious Captain Hook and has an awesome on-screen presence. Even the toughest of critics will admit that Hoffman nailed the role perfectly. The casting of Robin Williams as Peter Pan/Banning was more controversial, but as usual, Williams exceeded expectations and was brilliant with what he had to work with. Bob Hoskins almost steals the show as Hook's right-hand-man, Smee, and provided a good portion of the film's comedic relief. The only major drawback is Julia Roberts who didn't provide anything unique or special to the character of Tinkerbell. That's not to say that it's her fault, but in all honesty, her absence wouldn't have made much of a difference.I have read reviews that bash this film left and right, saying it's an embarrassment to Spielberg's legacy, should never have been made, and is an example of his limited manipulative style. What a manipulative style means is something that I'll never understand. Isn't that the whole point of movies? To be manipulated into seeing something that you're not? Anyway, some of these film snobs need to do some growing up themselves and give this film the credit that it deserves. Hook is a fun fantasy adventure that illustrates the importance of staying young at heart and I would recommend it to anyone seeking a good time.",Hook

233,faith40,A Peter Pan Sequel,9,22 September 2009,"I thought this movie was VERY interesting, picking up where Peter Pan left off. At one point in the movie Wendy is reading from the actual Peter Pan book that J.M. Barrie wrote. I'm wondering if J.M. Barrie had anything to do with the writing of this movie as well. Even though this movie has a message that fathers should spend more time with their family, it doesn't really get in the way. The movie is still adventurous and actually gives you the feeling that Neverland is a real place. I really like the scene where they have the imaginary feast. When Peter actually sees the food in front of him, it really is wonderful. I think that scene pretty much sums up this whole movie. I swear, if J.M. Barrie didn't write this, I'd like to know who did. They must have been pretty darn talented, because this movie is great. I think it's as good or better than any of the Peter Pan films, including the animated Disney one, and classic animated Disney films are tough to beat. The lost boys in Hook are a lot more wild than the VERY tame lost boys in the animated film, and I think it gives Hook an added sense of realism. This film has a great musical score too. Obviously, since it's by John Williams. Although John Williams did do the score for Daddy-o also, which wasn't all that great. Robin Williams delivers another great performance that'll entertain adults and kids alike. The man has talent, even if in this movie he's old and overweight. I would call Hook a must-see family film.",Hook
234,jackmuley,People forget....,8,13 March 2006,"I have read some horrible reviews for a great movie. Complaints about Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, etc. But they were perfect. Captain Hook was never meant to be a menacing villain. He's afraid of a dead crocodile. And Robin Williams was perfect as the chubby Peter Panning, mainly because he's perfect in pretty much any kids show (see Alladin, Mrs. Doubtfire). This movie is tons of fun for kids, or anyone else who has a youthful imagination. If there is a downside of the movie, it is the subplot of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts, who is horrible in Hook) being in love with Peter. This never goes anywhere, and I think we often look for the plot to follow the big name celebrities. She really wasn't needed and didn't help the movie. But the overall feel is fun. I recommend it for anyone who is or ever was a little kid.",Hook

Just the right blend of straight and funny as only he can.  And once again, John Williams provides a superb musical score.  I'm beginning to think the Academy is more jealous of him than they are of Spielberg (come on, 33 nominations, only 5 wins).  The film has that magical ability to draw you into a fantasy world.

240,GaryIndianna,"A Big, Awful Adventure",1,13 February 2007,"Why is this film so awful? It's the highest of high concept - 'Peter Pan grows up' - but because a film is high concept, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Maybe it's just coincidence, then, that 'Hook' is so dreadful. It's hard to think of a movie so chronically misguided, but it's easy to see how it got the greenlight, given the tried and tested material and the talent involved.Peter Pan has grown up. Not only that, he's moved to the USA and become a corporate raider, obsessed with the bottom line to such an extent that he neglects his family. But Neverland, and Hook himself, are still out there somewhere, and Hook is still smarting for revenge. So he kidnaps the adult Peter's kids, and takes them back to Neverland in the hope of provoking Peter into a definitive conflict. Peter's soft and middle aged now, he fears he's not worthy of his kids, and it takes concerted action (plus most of the films running time) by Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys to spur him on to his former greatness.In précis, it doesn't sound too bad. But everything about it is wrong. Peter has, in a sense, become Mr Darling, but the script writers seem completely unaware of this. They're content to spin out the tritest of confrontations between Peter and Hook. The very fact that Mr Darling and Hook are actually the same character shows the ambiguity and sophistication present in the original but totally lacking here. Peter is the good guy, so he must win. Hook is the bad guy, and so must do bad things and loose. And that's basically it.This is not really a kid's film at all. It's a bitter, cynical film made by men who get through the day on numerous cups of coffee and cigarettes, complaining about their divorce and their wife's new boyfriend. When Hook kidnaps Peter's kids, Peter looks on enviously as Hook tries to make himself into their father. Peter is afraid he's a terrible father, in fact he is a terrible father, and this film is a hardened cynic's version of the warm, sentimental films that hardened cynic probably loved as a kid.Why does Hook try to become a father to the children? Because the plot says he must. Why does Peter not remember his life as Peter Pan? Because the plot says he must not. If Peter does not remember Neverland, why is it that he's still in touch with Wendy, and that Wendy has 'saved' generations of lost boys? Why do they have a tribute to her? Not because these elements have a cohesive unity that adds up to something resembling a story, but because the scriptwriters have decided it must be so.The physical production is equally terrible. It's only right and proper that Neverland should not look 'real'. It should be a fantasy, unobtainable, but did it have to look so purposefully designed and constructed? It makes the real, and generally derided, Disneyland look charming in comparison.Then there are the performances. It's easy to criticise Robin Williams, but when he faces up to Hook with the words 'Dark and sinister man, have at thee', it's laughable. Williams might as well be reading a road sign for all the passion he brings to it. In addition, there's nothing dark or sinister about Hook, as played by Dustin Hoffman. You only have to look at Jason Isaacs as Hook in PJ Hogan's version, to realise how anaemic Hoffman is. Julia Roberts plays Tinkerbell, and she's OK, but she has nothing to do - nothing. Then there's Bob Hoskins, as Smee. He's an exhausting screen presence, horribly out of place here, and utterly lacking in charm.A couple of elements are OK. The transition which uses the device of Peter kissing the mermaids is a clever way of moving from one scene to the next, and then there's Maggie Smith as Wendy. Death might have been an awfully big adventure for Peter Pan, but for this film, it would be a mercy.***Update 12 August 2014***I take back what I said about Robin Williams.I was wrong.",Hook

When you wake up, you'll just be Peter Banning - a cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success, and runs and hides from his wife and children!""Everyone has watched Hook many times. Many do not understand what the movie is truly about. Its about Peter Pan, once a hero and leader, who became a terrible father, husband and person. And receiving one final life lesson from his own Father. Yes, Hook is Peter Pan's father, don't believe me, go watch the movie again and try to convince me what I'm about to tell you isn't true. In a way, Hook is the father to all of the lost boys. He's the authority figure in their lives that prevents them total anarchy, especially Peter Pan. Young Peter was an arrogant jerk, he even cut of Hook (his father's) hand and fed it to a crocodile. Hook did whatever he could to keep PP in check, but it was time for Peter to grow up, when it was time Hook allowed him to leave Neverland and become a man. What happens next Hook could have never believed. PP once an arrogant boy, has turned into and awful father, who is obsessed with work and ignores his family. As soon as Hook was able to help correct his parenting mistake, he seized his opportunity. He ""kidnapped"" or as I see it, babysat Pete's kids. He knew he needed to show Pete that he needed to care about his kids and nothing helps like a lesson in losing your kid. That was the first of many lessons ol Captian Hook provided Peter. He forced Peter to fight for his kids, and when he arrived in Neverland, Hook was more disappointed in Peter then ever. Hook contemplated taking his own like, because he was so disappointed in how Pete turned out. If Hook wanted to harm Peter or his kids he had more then ample chances to do so, but that was never his plan. He simply told him ""Fly up and touch your kids hand and go home"" virtually saying, if you love your kids you will find a way to get to them. Peter failed miserable, what a weenie. After Hook release Peter and hoped that Tink could help him find his old self, Hook stepped in a raised Peters kids. He was every bit the father to them, that Peter never was. Hook showed up for Jack and help put Maggie in her place when it needed to be done. Hook even gave Jack some sweet threads and a dope wig and hat. During the great war at the end of the movie, Hook kills Rufio, and I know what you think, only a bad guy would kill Rufio. But the way I see it, Rufio was a terrible influence on the Lost Boys and they needed a new leader once Peter went back. This led to Peter naming Thud Butt the leader of the lost boys, more on this later. You may even say, that Hook was trying to kill PP during their ""battle"" seen. That battle was Petey's final test, to prove to his dad he's ready to be the good father Hook was. Hook could have ended them a bunch of times, even dropping that line from the top enforcing to Peter what this whole thing was about. It was about Pete not being there for his kids, not caring for his wife and most of all caring too much about his work. Hook was never the best man, but he expected more from his kids, Wendy specifically called Pete a Pirate in the beginning of the Movie and shortly thereafter, Hook intervened. So once Hook realized at the end, when Peter showed Mercy on him after he listened to his kids, that Peter learned his final and greatest lesson. Hook decided to disappear and please, save me the ""crocodile ate him"" Hot takes. That croc was dead.Other great things about this movie. The Thud Ball by Thud Butt, that was totally dope. I'm glad he pulled it off two different times. Thud Butt was the perfect replacement for Rufio. Rufio was a war driven tyrant, whereas Thud Butt was a pacifist he preferred not to use swords. Making him the leader of the lost boys was part of Peter fulfilling his father, Hook's legacy. Neverland needed peace, not war and Thud Butt was the person they needed. This movie has some glaring plot holes as well. How the Heck old is Peter Pan? He has to be at least 100 years old. When he ran away as a baby (Baby's can't runaway, that crap made no sense) he immediately wen to Neverland. There is no indication on how much time passes in Neverland compared to the real world, But when he first meets Wendy and fam, he's roughly Wendy's age. In this movie Wendy is in her 90s, I'm assuming Peter was living in neverland at lease 30-50 years just get to the age he was when he left. But its hard to tell. His age however may play a role into him forgetting his past.I'll leave you with compliments about Hook from his closest confidant, Smee. ""Good Mooooooooooooorning, Neverland! Tie down the main mast, mateys, 'cause here he is, the cunning kingfish, the bad barracuda! A man so deep, he's almost unfathomable. A man so quick, he's even fast... asleep!

243,BuddingMovieMaker,incredibly bad film that wastes Dustin Hoffman and Maggie Smith,2,18 January 2004,"I can take sentimentality, but in sparing doses. John Williams' syrupy music is only one of the many shallowly presented pieces of trifle that are abound in ""Hook"". Disastrously directed, it doesn't trust its audience enough to think that they will spot the poor continuity and charmless script. Robin Williams has some decent one-liners when playing Peter Banning, but when he starts acting like Peter Pan, its the equivalent to watching a grown man trick or treat. Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins rise above the mess with their sterling characterizations as Captain James Hook and Smee, respectively. Julia Roberts is awful as Tinkerbell, and is symbolic of star casting gone horribly wrong. Except for Charlie Korsmo, who plays Peter's son Jack, all of the child actors are terrible, especially the Lost Boys, who were so interesting and charming in previous adaptations. Now they've succumbed to politically correct times(Notice the lack of Indians in this version), and are a racially mixed bag. The kid who plays Rufio is particularly bad. Immature and lacking in anything that made J.M. Barrie's play and novel so magical, ""Hook"" is a family film that will bore kids and annoy adultsOne plus: David Crosby as a pirate",Hook
244,v_n_sclub,Great Show...,10,22 November 2004,"Hook, as a general comment, is a great movie and it really draws laugh from those who watch it. It is a family comedy where you can watch while enjoying yourself. The actors were all quite good, as a general. I enjoy watching Rufio, acted by Dante Basco. He is a really good actor. But then, all the others were good. ""Death is the only adventure I crave"" was the sentence that cracked me up by Captain Hook. The only part of the move that has me confuse was that of the last part where captain Hook vanished after the crocodile fell over him. It is impossible that he was eaten.This is a show that you can watch over and over again and will not get tired of. In fact, this show may be film in 1991, but it is a good movie and until today, I am still watching and just lately purchased the DVD. As a whole, I enjoy the acting,setting and everything, especially the good acting done by the actors of the show.Nice Show!! :-)",Hook
245,samanthaoehley,The magic of my childhood in one movie,10,18 March 2021,"Growing up with Robin Williams, us millennials were a lucky generation. The magic of our childhood was largely due to Robin Williams, and this movie was a huge contribution to the nostalgia I hold for the 90s. I know so many lines off by heart from the movie that I don't have to see it for ten years and yet I'd still remember every word.The movie has been over-critiqued and over analysed and no one can seem to pin why they hate it, or why it's bad.I can tell you why people don't like it. It's easy.It was simply because they took an old British classic and made it ... American.It's a poor quality knock off that cost 80 million dollars.Put that aside, it's actually a wonderful concept and story, with brilliant actors and clever filming and mis en scene. If I ignore the Americanism, it's wonderfully magical.Next time, they should have kept it British, and then it wouldn't have been so cheesy. No tough-guy Rufio and obnoxious American orphans. No baseball juxtaposed with cool pirate scenes. No punk kids singing songs that aren't funny and Julia Roberts crushing on A-Type American lawyers.Honestly? Williams, Hoffman, Maggie Smith, Hoskins and the supporting and guest cast were amazing. Their parts were funny and enjoyable. I think we need to cut Spielberg some slack and thank him for this classic kids movie.",Hook

Hook is a film that reminds us of the fun it is to be a kid, to have adventures and to live in imagination. It shows us what great times we had when we where young, when we didn't had to work or cope with financial situations.Robin Williams journey to become Peter again is one of the greatest cinematic joy. A miracle of film that works on every level; the cinematography, the direction, the action, the script and above all; the music.

Don't look for plot holes and acting flaws - it's not that kind of movie. Enjoy the ride that this takes you on and have fun with one of Robin Williams' best performance and Dustin Hoffman's absolutely brilliant portrayal of a lovable villain.

The score is great, and the script is powerhouse (""So, Peter, you've become a pirate."")  Dustin Hoffman is outstanding as the aging Hook, and who could play an  adult Peter besides Robin Williams?

(Robin Williams - Peter Banning/Peter Pan) comes back to see Wendy (Maggie Smith) and finds out that she has grown up and is now a grandmother with a granddaughter whom Peter decides to give a real kiss to, and then falls in love with. Leaving Neverland, Peter is returned to time and begins to age, having children of his own. (Dustin Hoffman / Capt. James S. Hook) has decided he wants a showdown with the legendary Peter Pan and so orders for the abduction of his children to lure Peter back to Neverland. Upon finding out Peter has grown up, both the pirates and the lost boys are dubious as to whether or not it is Peter and whether or not he can cut it when it comes to fighting, playing and crowing, but Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) arranges for 3 days to get Peter in shape. Peter finally gets back into the spirit, but not before Hook brainwashes Peters son into becoming a pirate. The lost boys rally behind their leader of old but in the fight (Dante Basco / Rufio) is killed. Hook is finally slain and Peters children are saved, and everyone gets to go back home, leaving the lost boys and Tink' sad but with a new leader ... ends on with an upbeat feel, nice feel-good movie for the kids.",Hook
253,Ashley_The_Little_Rogue,One of my favorites,10,11 April 2009,"I was 10 years old when I first saw this movie (and I was born in 1993), and it was one of my favorites. The 90's had a lot of very great movies, and I had to watch movies when I reached an age where I'd understand them. At 10 years old, I began to watch movie after movie to catch up to my older sister. Hook has many talented actors in it, and the plot was very good. The action scenes were very well done, the pirates were incredibly detailed in their clothes, and the whole island brought me back to the world of wonder that is Never Never Land. The Disney movie of it was what led me to watch this one, and because I watched the Disney one, it made me love this one even more. Sure, there are some of you who say it could have been better, and in some ways, I do agree, but for what they had to work with, I say it was a spectacular adventure.",Hook
254,davidcinnella,the impossible Neverland finally made possible...,10,22 December 2008,"Everyone by now knows the famous story of Peter Pan, the story of a boy who never grew up and learned how to fly that has traveled worldwide and that has never stopped enchanting the hearts of millions around the globe. It has been considered now a literary masterpiece thanks to the great James Matthew Barrie. But somehow the classic tale, even as a kid and even with Disney's magical touch, never attracted me all that much, and I have found out why that is. The reason is that Neverland has always seemed to me as ""too good to be true"". Peter Pan flew, he never grew up, never went to school or had any particular troubles the likes of which life seems to offer, he plays around all day long with the Lost Boys, was friend with Indians and admired by Mermaids and in his free time he had even more fun fighting off Pirates. He never even worried about food, water, sickness, loneliness, hygiene, wild and dangerous animals, criminals or anything else. Neverland to me has always seemed like a Utopia that was too good to be true and an inevitable life that will head eventually towards boredom. Even in the various adaptations made from the tales of Peter Pan we always see it as a too perfect utopia that can be ridiculously surreal, rather it be a winter movie, a Disney animation, a TV series or a stage show. But all that changed when one man decided to ask himself a rather curious question that is the main theme of this movie: ""What if Peter Pan grew up?"" The apparently immortal boy completely isolated from real life would suddenly realize that his eternal dream would eventually bring him to an inevitable wakening tot he real world that was full of imperfections, but that would bring also it's benefits if played well. The man in consideration is none other than one of the biggest fans of the Peter Pan genre, the legendary director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg finally brought the Flying boy's adventures to an end, but this time with a big twist in Peter Pan's life that's probably more human and realistic than we ever dared dream of. Spielberg's ""Hook"" tells us what really happened to the great Peter Pan. He has left Neverland, returning to Earth from the clouds to be able to live a real life filled with something that has always been missing in him: love. And so he remained there on Earth for many years, going to school, finding a job, getting married and even having kids of his own... completely losing his memory of Neverland. That is until Hook learns of his whereabouts and decides to kidnap his children, forcing Peter to return to the distant island and try to remember his true origins and, in the process, learn to be a better father. None other than Spielberg could've accomplished such a task in such a tender way. He finally turned Neverland, the impossible and surreal island into a very realistic and possible one where everyone, even doubtful adults, can escape to. Aside from Spielberg's supreme directing and wonderfully emotional touch in this film, it's success also goes to the rest of the cast and crew: To Robin Williams who prorated the once flying boy and turning him into his greatest nightmare, an Adult, only to make him open his eyes again to who he truly was and is. Robin Williams is my favorite actor, and he's the perfect role for this character thanks to his great acting, his ""real"" inner childishness and his wonderful expressions of great delicacy and emotion. To Dustin Hoffman, who brought to life the fearsome Captain James Hook, Peter Pan's eternal enemy, with an unrecognizable makeup that hides his true features and with a great acting that reflects the mind of the most famous fictional pirate of the last century. To Julia Roberts, for turning into the most famous and loved fairy of them all -Tinkerbell- giving her a good heart instead of just showing her off as the usual spoiled brat who tries to mess everything up when she sees her precious Peter in the hands of another. To Maggie Smith, for showing that everyone, even the ones we remember as always young, grows up and becomes old, but doesn't necessarily mean that it is a bad thing. She has portrayed a perfect version of the lovable Wendy Moira Angela Darling who lived a full life without any regrets and who one day will rest forever, but in an eternal peace that is one of the rarest things at the end of life. A true example to follow. And finally to John Williams, who with his musical talent has given the background of the emotions of the characters in such a perfect way that can give at long last the chance for everyone to feel like Peter inside. This movie is one for anyone and everyone to watch, seniors especially, for it has began a hundred years ago to when they where young and could feel the magic of the classic Peter Pan story, and has developed now into an ending that can satisfy us all and make them return to their childish selves one more time and see through this movie what their life has been like before one day going to the next big adventure after life, which is either the bright light up ahead at the end of the tunnel... or the second star to the right that goes straight on 'till morning...",Hook

I love the film not only for the childhood memories it evokes within me but also because of the costume, the sets, the script, the cast, the action but most of all the story. Its all so well done, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are all time greats and they both did brilliant in this movie. I remember how my grandmother and grandfather had the film on VHS and one of my favorite memories as a kid was watching Hook with them when I slept over at their house.

Then, his kids are gone and look who tells him that Captain Hook kidnapped his kids.  In comes Maggie Smith.  She is a wonderful Wendy!! This movie has it's ups and downs, of course.

It has much of the same ""it is real!"" charm as other films in the updated fairy tale vein. To see a well done Peter Pan film that takes as its starting point the reality of the story is a simply wonderful experience. Robin Williams is charming as Peter (though I never really believe him to be the meanie he tries to be at the beginning), and Dustin Hoffman is both scary and laughable as Captain Hook. I have only good memories associated with this film, so it's low ranking surprised me. I think that it is a charming and delightful film, and helps kids (and adults) reinvent a classic tale. Certainly worth seeing still, and one of the most colorful, enchanting live action kids movies I can think of. Disregard this film's low ranking, and see it anyway. It's well worth it.",Hook
258,harmonia16,There's never been a better recreation of a timeless tale.,10,11 October 2004,"In a brave move Steven Spielberg took on the greatest adventure ever told for children and made it his own. After seeing this movie again recently after an absence of more than 10 years, I feel like a kid all over again. Elements of the story can hardly be forgotten once they've been experienced. More importantly, I finished the movie feeling a glow which can only come from knowing that, ""to live would be an awfully big adventure."" Recent movies like ""Peter Pan"" have captured a truer essence of the original story by James Barrie. ""Finding Neverland"" will be complete this story by telling this timeless tale from its beginning and ""Hook"" tells the tale at its end. Once all these are on DVD, I will have a decent looking Trilogy in my collection. I've grown up reading stories and then waiting to see if any film maker would ever have the courage to make it into a movie. I have been disappointed in the past, but ""Hook"" captures the imagination in a way no other film ever has. Especially those of us who have grown up and have started to feel the pressures of everyday life and its responsibilities. This movie offers a fan of the book a real treat by becoming a guessing game to find out which parts of this movie actually came from the book and where they can be found in relation to each other. The score offers melodies almost as eternal as ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Star Wars"" and for good reason since the score was done by John Williams. In Robin Williams we see first, a man too busy with being a success to spend time with his children. But by remembering what it was to have an adventure, he was able to find his happy thought. He began to live again...with his family whether they be ""Lost Boys"" or ""Family"". I've grown up and life doesn't seem as magical as it used to be, but Steven Spielberg reminded me of that magic by making ""Hook"". This is a film about a time when life seemed without end.

When I watch this movie, filled with imagination. It makes me relive the feelings I felt as a ""Young-un"". The acting is terrific with mega-famous actors.

In fact, I am watching it as I type this. This movie captures the human imagination in only the way that a Peter Pan movie can. I have seen all the Peter Pan movies to date, so I know. Robin Williams puts on a great performance as a father named Peter Banning who is too busy for his children. When his kids get kidnapped by Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman), Banning must try to remember his true identity, Peter Pan. Helping him are a wonderful cast of characters, including Julia Roberts, who plays a great Tinkerbell.The actors and actresses in this movie do a wonderful job of developing their characters. One of the best character developments is that of Captain Hook. In the original story of Peter Pan, it's mostly about the title character and we don't get to know much about Hook except that he is evil. Hoffman gives us a glimpse into why Hook is so sad and why he really hates Peter Pan.The child actors are good in this movie. I especially like Dante Basco, who plays Rufio. He did a great job as the young Lost Boy Leader. He made a lot of the scenes funny, especially the Neverfood scene! I LOVE that one! People who hate this movie don't seem to get why it is in the movie. It's all about imagination, people! Pretending is the name of the game in Peter Pan movies! Charlie Korsmo, who plays Jack Banning is also great, especially in the clock scene. It's so dramatic.Robin Williams is hilarious as well as dramatic in this movie! I wish he still did movies like this instead of the creepy old man ones he does now. The memory scene and the never-food scene are the best. I love how we get a glimpse into Peter's past during the memory scene. I could not think of a better actor to play Peter Pan (Banning) than him.Finally, the music by John Williams makes the movie complete.",Hook

Yes, it's a great kid's movie but I can't explain why it's more emotional as an adult, Spielberg got some genuine performances out of everyone and the only thing that felt familiar was the amazing John Williams score. I remembered all the melodies somehow.As for the story, you really feel that there's lots at stake, sure there may be plot holes or whatever but I don't care, this movie is a BRAVE new re-imagining of the legend.Also Dustin Hoffman is still as intimidating as I remember him. In one scene he has this hilarious dramatic plea for attention where he pretends that he's going to commit suicide.

267,psychuai,One man and the search for his inner child...a great message in a great film,9,11 July 2004,"For a movie going on lucky 13 years old, it's still as fun to watch as it was the first time I saw it in the theaters. Peter Banning is a well off American lawyer married to the great granddaughter of Wendy Moira Angela Darling...Mora Darling. He also has two kids, Jack and Maggie. However, supporting for his family has become a full time job and as such he's forgotten all about having an imagination, playing with his kids, spending time with his family, and enjoying his life. And in the middle of all of this, there's Capt. James S. Hook, life long enemy of the Peter Pan (Banning, though unbeknownst to him). In an act of vengeance, he kidnaps Banning's kids in the night, and tinkerbell comes home to bring Peter back to Never Neverland and make Peter remember the life he left behind and the fight that was never finished.Mr. Spielberg went all out on this movie, and it shows. There's a lot of heart and soul here from the pirate ships to the lost boys hideout to London and back again. At the same time, there's a lot of heart in both the screenplay and the actors embodiment of the characters. I don't think there will ever be a Hook as good as the one that Dustin Hoffman has done in this film, Bob Hoskins is always a pleasure to watch and his comedic timing is near perfect, causing everything from a slight chuckle to uproarious laughter to pass your lips after each scene he's in, and William's Peter Banning/Pan, while extraordinarily silly and misguided at times, comes around brilliantly, and the first time you watch him fly you can't help but grin from ear to ear.The child talent is always a risky business, but if you accept that the kids are not going to be the best actors in the world, you realize that most of them do the script justice, whether they know they are or not. Charlie Korsmo, along with Dante Basco, are clearly the most talented, carrying their scenes with Williams and Hoffman very well. John Williams score is as wonderful as it ever was (you can hear some of the framework for the Harry Potter music in this particular score)...And finally, there's the message...""never grow up"". It's the same message from the original movie, but how it gets there is slightly different. As we watch Peter Banning remember and relive the life he left behind, we realize what he realizes; growing old doesn't mean you have to grow up...and you have to live...for that is the ""great adventure"". At 2 hours and 20 minutes, the movie drags here and there a bit from time to time. And on no fault of the original production, the special effects of the film have not held up as well as they could have in the last 13 years. The movie is starting to look it's age. But I think no matter how old this movie gets, there will always be people who will be taken back by the simple premise of this movie and embrace it for the wonderful way it's taken the original Peter Pan story to a whole new level...and beyond.",Hook
268,cpeters1987,Hook has something for everyone if you have the right attitude.,10,6 May 2007,"For those of us who were in the target audience during this movie's release, it was one of the most entertaining and influential movies of our childhood. Hook taught us what life should be about. Life is not about having a lot of money, it is about having a life rich with imagination, fun, and most importantly love/friendship. Although the message is very apparent throughout the movie, it does not take away from the entertainment aspect. In fact, I feel it adds to it. Hook, in my opinion, is one of the most creative movies ever made. The older audience may have felt that the food fight scene was stupid, but it made nearly every face of my generation light up. While on a road trip to Mexico with about eighty other college kids on the bus, we voted to watch hook over the numerous other movies we had with us and not even one person had a problem with watching it. Since each of the guys brought a date, the bus was split evenly between guys and girls. Maybe most of the people who have rated this movie were not born at the right time to truly experience its greatness because it is truly a classic film and should not be detrimental to Spielberg's reputation.",Hook

That's where Spielberg is excellent : he has worked on the story as a tale, and successfully adapted it to the screen... Imagine how hard it is to adapt such a tale ! Look at the colors, the movements, the dialogs, the characters... Yep, definitely, this movie is really well done and has even something magic. I gave it 8.

270,tobers29,One of the worst pictures I've ever seen,2,9 June 2006,"The idea for the film is wonderful, but the reincarnation of Peter Pan as an adult just didn't fly with me. I disliked the acting of Robin Williams in this film and kept imagining that someone, such as Kevin Kline, would have been far superior. Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, as Captain Hook was ingenious. I realize that this film is primarily for children, but the one-liners, dreadful sets, the ""food"" fight, and those three kissing mermaids didn't even seem appropriate for children. The talent that made up the film was entirely wasted and I can't imagine why any major name, such as Meryl Streep, would waste their time doing cameo performances. My feeling is that if you are a fan of the original ""Peter Pan"", you are much better off sticking with that rather than viewing this bit of nonsense. Why writers and directors want to ""update"" films/books/plays that were masterpieces is beyond me. I'm thinking of films such as ""Scarlett"", the story of Scarlett O'Hara AFTER ""Gone With the Wind"". Sequels and prequels are mostly not up to the caliber of the original film/book/play. I would not want my children to see ""Hook""; I'd much prefer they read the original. As for adults, they should stay clear of the picture entirely unless they don't mind wasting one and three-quarter hours of their lives.",Hook

From there the movie takes you on a great mystical adventure in Neverland of Peter Pan re-finding himself and his youthful spirit, remembering his past, and rescuing his kids from the sinister Captain Hook. It is a wonderful story.The casting of Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman was great. Bob Hoskins is perfect for the role of Hook's right hand man Smee. John Williams of course conducts a masterful score. The child actors play their part very well. Steven Spielberg made this movie people, I don't see why you need to compare this movie's success to say 'Jaws' or 'ET'. Because Spielberg makes many great movies I understand that he has set a standard for himself, but just because this movie wasn't groundbreaking doesn't make it bad. It is a great movie in my opinion.This is my favorite movie of all time. I give it 10/10 without any reservations.",Hook

It possesses the classic ingredients good family films are made of: good triumphs over evil, a little romance, parents are good role models, some action, some humor, and some imagination.

I had watched the Disney version of the first Peter Pan when I was younger, and I was absolutely enchanted by Hook.  This continues to be one of my favorite kids movies.  The acting is fantastic, and this movie is the reason one of my favorite actors is Dustin Hoffman.I do understand that it strayed quite a little bit from the actual peter pan story (e.g. the lost boys) but it make sense since Peter Pan had gone away, maybe other lost boys had gone away too or even decided to join the adult side of neverland (pirates!) to grow up also.  It would explain all the new kids and also the differences because of the leadership under Rufio.overall, if you havent seen this movie, GO SEE IT.  If you or your kids like Peter Pan, especially.  You will not be disappointed.",Hook

How could you not love a movie with so much imagination and emotion. To me, this is the best pirate movie I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman has been the best Captain Hook by far making you hate and love the character at the same time. The sword fights were put together wonderfully, and no matter how much you see this film, there is still a little kid that comes from inside of you each time you see Neverland. If you haven't seen the movie, I would recommend for those who have a taste for imagination, if you still don't like the film, then at least you gave it a try.",Hook
277,gbean2397,An Underrated Peter Pan Film from Spielberg,9,26 March 2018,"I have seen interviews where Spielberg looks back on this film not so enthusiastically, feeling the Neverland sequences weren't his best. Yea, not exactly perfect, but I'd have to say ""Bullsh*t"" if he, or anybody else, says this movie sucks. It doesn't. The positives outweigh the negatives: The fantastical music score by John Williams will pull at your heartstrings, the premise of Peter Pan leaving Neverland and growing up is an interesting one, and I'd say Dustin Hoffman (who is totally unrecognizable) and Robin Williams are outstanding as Captain Hook and Peter Pan.This was a childhood favorite of mine, I grew up with it, and even when I'm about to turn 25 in the next couple months, I STILL LOVE this movie. And it has appeared that I am not alone in this, as I've seen people come up and say how much they love it. Right now I'm watching it after so long and I had shed tears during the ""There you are Peter"" scene, man does time fly.But still, I say this is one of Spielberg's most underrated films, and if you need a big reason to watch it, watch it for John Williams' music score, it will take you into the film on an emotional level. I need to watch this with my nephew in the future.",Hook
278,kerybock,For young and old alike,8,11 March 2018,"Speilberg may have been disappointed with this one, but I am not. A charming take off of the original Peter Pan. I saw the original with Mary Martin when I was 7 or 8 and found it intellectually challenging. That is what this story is supposed to do; start kids thinking about growing up and accepting responsibility. Here, Robin Williams plays Peter all grown up but still struggling with responsibility. He finds it by becoming young again.
Terrific star-studded cast, with a script so witty most of the jokes will ""fly"" over the heads of children, and some adults too if you don't listen carefully.",Hook

283,georgie-bradley,Brings Back Childhood Memories!,9,20 March 2009,"Right, I can understand that Spielberg's previous achievements had set the bar really high, but by no means does this make 'Hook' a flop. The story is what is so appealing to a young audience and a mature audience for that matter. The sensitive undertones of such a celebrated story spark much joy and heartfelt moments. The 'what if' factor of the whole story is really adventurous, and the fact that this story stems from the original is brilliant. Its a story of love,family and identity. All three elements resonate with a lot of audiences. From a visual standpoint Spielberg triumphs again! And i don't understand why people beg to differ! For the purpose of entertaining young audiences, it fulfills the intention and more. I must say however, the film owes 50% of its credit to John Williams. His absolutely stunning score supports the story's tenderness. The flying sequence is so thrilling that it literally makes me get up and want to levitate! The performances are equally stunning and convincing, Robin Williams encompasses both his comedic and dramatic skills towards a full blooded performance. Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins are superb....really really astonishing. This film has to be one of Spielberg's most overlooked and underrated films of all time. It holds so much promise and warmth that every time I sit back and soak up the high-flying adventure it sends shivers down my spine. I recently watched it after so many years of it lost in my memory that I felt like I had visited a historical landmark..its placed within a treasured set of memories on my part. I cant express how moving this film is, its just enthralling in every sense of the word..the construction of the story is very clever and realistic - from a child's point of view.

It is the movie of the 90's and for all the kids born in the mid 80s it came at the right time for us we were just old enough to sit through movies so like little mermaid Hook became one of our favorites. Robin Williams Is a god to me. Hook is protrayed so well in this movie you Love to hate him and you still feel sorry for him just a little bit. that makes a good villain the ones you enjoy seeing on screen. and who doesn't love rufio i mean gawd.

285,jason-michael-rowe,Captures the imagination.,10,13 July 2008,"Quite how Hook has achieved a mark of 6.2 out of 10 is beyond me. I've read a number of reviews on IMDb for Hook, which do not do this film justice. All the reviewers that gave this film less than 7 have not provided a worthwhile review, just because you don't like the way Spielberg has chosen to tell the story, doesn't make it a bad film.The film puts a slightly different twist on the whole Peter Pan story. Peter is much older now and has to re-find his abilities that were lost when he left Neverland many years previously to the setting of the film. All the innocence of youth has been left far behind, I feel that the film teaches us all that we can learn to a live life a little differently....enjoy it more. To my mind there are many hidden messages in this film, if you can choose to expand your mind. It taught me to, as Peter puts it, find my happy thought. The film shows us a great deal about imagination, and how ours can be used effectively.Robin Williams is brilliantly cast, as no other in my opinion could play the role of a child...then adult....then child...etc etc.The casting is fantastic and spot on for this type of film. I felt I could relate to all the characters that were the 'lost boys'. By the end of the film I felt a warmth towards every last one of them, which I would think is possibly the whole point...and I even felt sadness at Rufios death. Julia Roberts was fantastic as Tink, as with all the cast I really believed they were born to those roles.Basically, I'm not a movie expert but I loved this film as a kid and still love this film. Definitely one of the best films of my youth, and I'd not hesitate in showing it to my kids.",Hook
286,The_Ultimate_Hippo,Not bad but could have been better,7,30 September 2017,"From what I remember I really liked this movie when I was a kid however now after viewing it as an adult while I still really like it I have started to notice that some aspects either don't make a whole lot of sense or are just too over the top corny. Let me start by saying what I did and like the casting is pretty spot on, I love Robin Williams as Pan, Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Hook, Maggie Smith was a perfect choice for Wendy (and wow that makeup job was great), and Bob Hoskins was also great as Smee. The buildup for the first appearance of Hook was suspenseful and when we finally see Hook it is a pretty epic moment (Spielberg really loves to build up the first appearance of something in his films). Also when the movie tries to be funny it's pretty funny, the secondary pirates (""save me daddy"", ""he's stealing second"", ""woops""), when Peter first meets Tinkerbell, and the food fight were all pretty hilarious. As well when the movie tries to be dramatic it does work for the most part (Ruffio's death, Moria crying with joy when the kids make it back, the final scene, etc.). Finally John Williams score as always is amazing. The child acting is hit and miss, I thought the two actors who played Peter's kids were good as was Rufio but some of the other Lost Boys bordered on annoyance. However towards the end of the movie it goes a little overboard with it's whimsical tone, a perfect example is Hook and Peter's final sword fight, on several occasions it is interrupted for either some non-needed comic relief or some incredibly cheesy dialogue (""I believe in you Peter""). Peter has 3 chances to kill Hook and never does it and I felt that really interrupted the pacing. The sword fight could have been great but instead was meh. I also never really understood Pan's origin subplot, how is a baby afraid of growing up? Why does Peter continue to grow up when he goes to Neverland to not grow up? How does Peter just forget that he was in Neverland and battled Pirates? A lot of this could have been explained, especially when you have a 2.5 hour runtime but the movie just never went into it. And finally I did not like Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. So overall it is a good family film, it does for the most part respect the source material but there are some parts where it goes too over the top campy. I feel that if they cut maybe 20 minutes out it probably would have fixed many of the films problems. I would definitely recommend Hook however it does have some problems.",Hook

Using two extremely versatile talents, Robin Williams & Dustin Hoffman, Spielberg is successfully able to recreate the feel of Peter Pan in an enchanting contemporary setting.

It's funny because as I got older, I still watched it, but I started to get a lot of the jokes made which made certain scenes even funnier. Hook has adventure, magic, and heart and I still love it to this day. It makes me want to believe in magic again, but it's hard to do that as an adult with responsibilities.

It was darker and stranger and made little sense to me, I guess I just thought I was missing something.12 years on and I still don't understand this simply because there is nothing to understand about it. It is a hideously self-indulgent mess of a film. Incoherently structured, one-dimensionally and superficially characterised, implausible (even in the considerably less demanding realms of the the fantasy genre, incomprehensible and ugly.But what really got me about this film is that I have never seen such a large collection of talent so utterly wasted. Everyone of them should be ashamed for being involved in the conception of this cinematic atrocity. What was the point of this film? The importance of an innocent imagination.

290,potter_luvver,Why does everyone hate this film?,10,27 March 2005,"I, personally, cannot understand why so many people have left negative comments about this film. When it was released, many of us were young children and we all enjoyed it, but now that we are older, too many people are pointing out the bad jokes and mistakes and clichés that they have found. The point is, this is a children's film, and we didn't see those mistakes when we were children because it's designed that way. Even so, people fail to see deeper into certain aspects of the film. Peter Pan was meant to be 'the boy who never grew up', so to have a tale of his adult life and to show how he forgot Neverland is a special and unique take on the story, one that won't be forgotten.There have also been many complaints about the scene where Tink becomes human-size and expresses some kind of love for Peter. Although she is not a human per se, she can have human feelings, so why would she not love him? As the original story tells, she is often jealous of other womens' affections towards him, and this film just extrapolates on that theme a little.There have been comments about the 'father-who-is-so-busy-and-can't-go-to-the-game' cliché. Well, here's news for you. It's cliché because it happens all the time, and it's a truth! Some parents are just too busy to care. Lastly, too many people are moaning that Hook was too comical to be the bad guy. Well, this is a kids film and if he wasn't a little bit cheery-in-a-maniac sort of way, you'd have parents complaining that their kids were scared.The main thing about this film is that it is really good, but it IS designed for children, and adults who go back and watch it years later, then suddenly spot loads of mistakes are just ruining it for themselves and others.",Hook

Robin Williams is fantastic as always bringing a rather wooden portrayal of Peter Pan (but soon cheers up!), however Dustin Hoffman delivers the performance of the production as Hook, the villainous, but very camp Captain Hook. The Peter Pan in this feature works better than in any Peter Pan film I have seen to date, in the aspect that audience has to warm to him. Whereas in pretty much every other 'Pan' film I have seen the boy in rags has been a bit of an annoyance.In this case, I believe IMDb are wrong in rating this film so low.

In our adult life, we tend to leave (and sometimes scoff) our childhood behind as if it never existed at all. In the movie, Peter has grown up and forgotten his past.  This change makes him a crass, terrible person, focusing only on work instead of his family. During the movie, he finds himself and his childhood memories and becomes a better, more caring person.In real life, most adults of today are work driven individuals with very little time for joy or relaxation.  This movie teaches that all it takes is a little taste of a person's childhood mixed into their adult life to make them and their environment around them better.",Hook

A lot of the time he goes too heavy on the special effects and doesn't focus enough on the rest of the film for my taste (Jaws, Jurassic Park, et cetera) but this time he really nailed it. Robin Williams is great as a grown up Peter Pan who's forgotten who he is as well as Peter after he remembers, and Dustin Hoffman plays Hook like he was made for the part. Captain Hook is sinister in this, and it's perfect. In the beginning, he has a man put into a box filled with scorpians. Most bad reviews I've read of this film are by whiney Disney fanatics who don't think the movie was cute and/or happy enough. This story isn't any of those things. Right from the beginning it's dark. The once whimsical and playful Peter Pan has grown up to be a workaholic lawyer who doesn't believe in fairies and thinks of his children in a way best put in words by a question he asks his son Jack on the plane ride to England. He asks him, ""Why do you have to act like such a child?"" Wendy, now a venerable woman of at least 90, observes when being told of Peter's profession says, ""Peter, you've become a pirate."" Some might say the lost boys should have been less like little kids and a little more ""bad-ass"" but that would defeat their purpose.

I was personally intrigued with the plot, the whole Peter Pan growing up idea and Hook kidnapping his kids to get him to come back for a war. I thought that both Williams and Hoffman were brilliantly cast in their respective roles as Peter Pan and Captain Hook. I also thought the music was excellent and did a superb job in showing the character's emotions and to accent what was going on in the plot. If you see this movie for the first time as an adult, chances are you would think it was godawful.

With awesome Cast and a movie filled with love, magic,and what it truly means to be a kid again, Hook is one of the best Family films of all time. The lost boys are a beautiful array of different colors, personalities and backgrounds, bringing warmth and fun to the film. Also, Dustin Hoffman as hook.. EXCELLENT, he really brings the cartoon character to life and as hate-able as he was, you had to love him. I've seen this film a million times and every time I see it, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry, it makes me smile, and It truly has something wonderful about it, I wish there were more films out there like this, that give you that good of a feeling inside.",Hook
307,pedrorilho15,Touching,10,6 December 2001,"Most people disliked this film and I can't see why. Spielberg portraits things as if they were seen through the eyes of a child, full of magic stars and dreams and this is film is so touching that my brother cries when he hears the little singing. That's how touching this film is. Everything is very good in this film, from the performances to the direction to the art work. I recommend it.P.S. I've seen Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone recently and I wasn't touched at all, I was bored. It didn't touch in any of the ways that this movie did. So stop raving Harry and revisit Hook.",Hook

309,Horatiosanns69,A dream of a movie,10,15 March 2004,"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie very much.  I was six when it came out and I remember leaving the theater hoping that my true identity was Peter Pan.  I think that is the greatest thing about this movie.  It creates the possiblity that Peter Pan is real, and that you could be him.  Captain Hook is a wonderfully frightening villain, and the chilly night when Peter's kids are kidnapped leaves one feeling breathless.  This is countered magnificently with the glory of never-never land and the lost boys.  The lost boys live in amazing tree houses, eat a variety of colorful and seemingly delicious foods, ,and practice sword fighting on the side. Overall, I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. Stephen Spielberg does it again.",Hook
310,romartin,"A great sequel to Peter Pan, and a warning to parents",7,4 December 2006,"A great kids movie, and little more. This is a sequel, not a re-imagining, to Peter Pan. I loved Robin Williams as a grown up Pan as a kid, however, this movie definitely wore a lot on me when I saw it at 18. Fair warning for parents, this is a kids movie, but there are some scary scenes. At one point Hook punishes one of his pirates by sentencing him to ""the Boo-Box."" This is a small chest that the pirate is stuffed into before having scorpions dropped in after him, and as a kid I found it really scary. However the small war at the end is quite fun, seeing the lost boys suit up by jumping through bamboo mats before being painted and armed with swords was a hoot, even at 18, although you gotta wonder where the bamboo came from.",Hook

312,skittbitts,Excellent for any audience,10,2 January 2002,This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The story line is great for any audience: kids just learning the story or adults who never wanted to grow up. Spielberg's imagination and his way of sticking close by the original story makes this film a delight to see if you ever wanted to be a lost boy in never land. Every time I watch this film I notice another superb detail and use of irony. The story ties together beautifully and is easily one of my very favorites. It makes you want a never never land of your own.,Hook

314,jamidodd333,One of my favorites,10,24 December 2006,"This is actually one of my favorite movies, especially at Christmas time, so it's disappointing to me to see some of the negative reviews. I was 11 when this movie came out, loved it then, and still love it even though I have seen it at least 15 times. It's definitely not some sort of deeply intellectual independent film -but it's about Peter Pan growing up for God's sake. I personally don't think the storyline of a workaholic parent discovering his inner child will ever get old and cliché - being a lawyer, I see how often that happens (not to me of course b/c I still like movies like Hook). And again, many people have said even children won't like this move but that's totally not true as I was a child when I first saw this movie and loved it. I think Robin Williams gave a great performance in this movie as did Dustin Hoffman. However, I can see where some of the other comments are coming from with respect to the cheesiness of Julia Roberts and some of the Lost Boys but again, it's a kids movie so whatever. This movie is a classic Christmas time favorite - my mom and I have watched it together every year for 15 years and soon we will watch it with my children!",Hook
315,evangellex,An Adventure of Whimsy,8,25 March 2007,"Unlike the predecessors whose biased and one-sided thoughts have crowded this page, I am going to attempt to give a well-rounded, impartial review to aid those with interest in this title with their decision: watch, or not.The movie follows the adult version of James Barrie's Peter Pan, portrayed as the neglectful father Peter Banning, whose fanciful past catches up with him as his two children are mysteriously abducted by the infamous Captain Hook and taken to Neverland. Peter must rediscover himself, his past, and what it means to be a father in the rediscovery of his inner child in this magical adventure.In what the movie attempted to be, it succeeded. As far as fairy-tale spin-offs are concerned, this film correctly captures the wondrous enchantment associated with the original story, and carries it forward. For lovers of the original tale and it's adaptations, I would suggest giving this movie a try. The cinematography is decent, as is the script and acting. By the end of the movie, you feel like much has happened, you know the characters well, and feel the story strongly, unlike many of today's current films.Critics have called this movie 'overly sugary', and 'boring'. This movie isn't an action-packed blockbuster, and doesn't try to be. A vast achievement was made in continuing the critical themes of the original work of Peter Pan, on which is was based, and carrying them over into a new storyline while retaining their clarity, value, and flavors. Consider the main themes of the original Peter Pan: imagination, and childhood wonder. This is not strictly a children's movie, however. To those who remember Peter Pan from their childhood fondly; this adventure will still well.Staying true to the canon, Hook produces a adventurous journey of vibrant whimsicality, and feels like a true extension of the original work.",Hook
316,aqeustransmsion,All Around Brilliance,10,5 August 2007,"People are Dumb. This movie is GOOD. All of the little things in it are amazing,and is my FAVORITE movie of all time. To say that this movie is dreadful is completely foolish. The movie is remarkably funny and is wonderful in almost all aspects. Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins and amazing together. Smee is maybe my favorite character, next to Tootles and the little fat Lost Boy who rolls into a ball. As I said before all the little things in it are hilarious, such as every time Robin Williams turns around while still being Peter Danning, he turns with chest inflated and hands on hips( acting as Peter Pan). AMAZING. Also Glen Close is a pirate and that alone is reason enough for the movie to be rated a 10. Not to mention Rufio. Also amazing. the dialog between Robin Williams and Rufio while at the dinner table is wonderfully scripted and deserves to be watched over and over and over again. Robin Williams as Peter Pan was a wonderful choice because of his childlike acting ability. The Music. The Music is another reason the movie is so wonderful. John Williams is able to compose a score that can make you feel all of your emotions at once. All-together ""Hook"" is a wonderful piece of cinema that can be enjoyed by both parents and children.",Hook
317,m_edwards_89,lighten up!,9,11 May 2007,"honestly. i strongly disagree with the negative feedback to this film. It is so amazing when you watch this as a child. who cares if there's clichés and you think hook is too comical or friendly. I think Spielberg perfected this role, as he was enjoyable to watch but the audience is always aware of his dark side. Hook is a gentleman and a villain, i think this take is perfectly fitting.Nobody has seemed to mention how amazing Robin Williams is in this film. I could not think of any other actor who could play this role so well. Everybody knows he has something about him, possibly a child at heart, best shown in 'Mrs Doubtfire'.Undoubtedly the film has its flaws, but it is so enjoyable to watch. even simple mise en scene with colours, and the set. Brilliant in my eyes. Notably in the dinner table scene, the colours bring the film to life. I believe it would bring the children's imagination to life as well. People are far to cynical, i enjoyed this film as a child and i will continue to do so as an adult.",Hook
318,norznorz,Definitely underrated,9,19 July 2003,"To describe my relation to Hook in just a few words: A fantastic movie, even though I've never been fascinated by the Peter Pan stories. I'm 19 years old and I saw this movie eleven years ago (1992) and I still love it after over a dozen viewings. The story, the way it looks, the characters (especially how they've developed since the ""main"" Pan story), the feeling. In my opinion, ""Hook"" is a competent fairytale, not to mention VERY well done! In my top ten.",Hook
319,davereich,This movie is pure joy,9,3 August 2008,"The comments from some out there who like to think they should rate movies on snobbish ""artistry"" lose the entire point of movies. Wondering if John Williams enjoyed writing the score, how Spielberg could have directed this and commenting on how could they after other work they've done is just pure boorishness.This movie is a pure joy to watch. The point of movies is to tell a story and immerse the viewer in that story. And this movie does that extraordinarily well. It is very nice spin on the basic Peter Pan original by Barrie, and uses the talents of some very prolific current actors well. Robin Williams is indeed the adult who is a still a child. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful character actor and was pure perfection as Hook. Others (such as David Crosby) I'm sure had fun playing their roles, and the story actually had a message as well.The music was NOT overdone, and augmented to story well. Rather than continue to answer johnmichael-2's mightier-than-thou tirade, viewers read this: This movie is a wonderful adventure and a pleasure to watch. It was very well cast, the script was nicely done, the movie has no dull points, it moves the story along well, everything contributes to the goal of the story, and it is well acted. Is it going down in the annals of movie-dom as the most artistic and best movie ever made? Of course not. But, it is a fantasy story, and a whole heck of a lot of fun to watch. And THAT is the point.",Hook
320,ijwt,Poignant fun movie about family issues.,9,19 May 2002,The movie Hook creates helpful insight about the importance of family.It suggests that parents can become better parents by getting back in touch with their own inner child and by giving their children the attention and love they need to thrive. It also points out some important issues about the negative influence of Hook who tried to alienate Peter's son Jack against his own Dad. This is an issue that comes to the fore when divorced parents try to alienate their children against the other parent. An enjoyable and sensible movie for the whole family regardless of age.,Hook

Then the slow, sluggish plot makes it feel like a full 8h workday.The special effects do not hold up; could have just a filmed stage play. Looks like a decorated set in every scene.It's strictly a kids movie, but I can't imagine current kids enjoying it. Perhaps some toxic nostalgia for it if you were 4-7 when you first saw it.

So did my 35-year old father. 15 years later I still love this movie. I think it is the most memorable movies of the Peter Pan story, and I believe it is because it's uniqueness and ability to tap into everyone's love of childhood, laughter, and albeit cheesy fight scenes. And although this movie may be one of Spielberg's more simple films, I think he does an excellent job of capturing this story and continuing it. This movie remains a classic to this day.And despite how evil Captain Hook is, I still love Dustin Hoffman's character in this film. I laugh every time.",Hook

324,coypsyche,Still the best!,10,12 June 2004,"The story line and cast is brilliant. I first saw this movie many years after is was released, in 1997, when I bought it for my 3 yr old twin sons. After we watched Hook the bar had been raised and no other Peter Pan book or movie could compare- still to this day (2004). Hook is filled with the magic and honesty that no other story can match. I admit, I am as true a fan as my sons who are now 9 yrs old.Because of the movie Hook my kids believe in magic. When they were 5 years old we went to Disneyland and after dark we saw the after dark show on the lake that started with a Magical Mickey in a wizard hat slaying a dragon in the lake and ended with the most magical moment in my sons and my life:While every light in the park was out a ship came into view on the Disney Lake, sailing our way... As soon as our eyes could make out it was Capt. Hook's ship my sons were filled with anxiety. As the ship came closer you could see Pirates fighting with Peter Pan. Peter Pan on the sails of the ship, sword in hand, fighting and then swinging about from a rope to another sail, to another fight. To save Wendy Darling.. My sons, sitting on my shoulders, witnessing this ... screamed with all their might ""Go Peter!!! Go Peter!!!"" Over and over again. It was so touching that the people within earshot all turned to smile, the people in front of us smiled and actually began to cry. My kids believed it was Peter Pan there that night, they believed them yelling made a difference. Because of that my kids believe (still) in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. It all started with this movie. And, there isn't an adult who wouldn't like it. Except maybe, those who can't find a happy thought anymore.",Hook

Robin Williams did a incredible job in this movie. I saw people dressed up as Rufio at every year at college parties. this movie was made 17 years ago and its considered a classic. I've never meet anyone that doesn't like it. So if you haven't seen it then go watch it! It has everyone one from the cartoon, like Wendy, peter pan, hook, the lost boys, tinker bell.

I am not going to sit here and nitpick and bash all the tiny mistakes in the movie or point out all the small flaws because those were not by far the worst part of this movie. I'll start with the ""good"" points of this movie...The acting wasn't bad and the characters played their designed rolls well. The costumes and settings were well designed and used. That was about all I found good about this movie.... The whole idea of Peter Pan is that he NEVER GROWS UP. This movie goes against EVERYTHING Peter Pan stands for! He is the boy who never grows up so to have him grow up and forget Neverland his HOME for his entire childhood. I do not believe that should ever be done. This movie takes all of the splendor and happiness out of who Peter Pan is and what he stands for. He loved Neverland and his lost boys and tinkerbell way too much to ever leave them to be a grown up...yes he loved Wendy and I can see why she could have been the only reason for him to grow up...but still he doesn't he chooses to stay in Neverland and be a boy. I was just disappointed in the concept of this movie. If you loved it that is your own opinion and you are entitled to it. But this just wasn't the movie for me.",Hook

328,delaneycat22,Don't' Believe the Hate,9,18 August 2010,"There may be a little bit of bias in my review, since this was my favorite movie as a child, but I don't see this film as being bad in any way. When I found out later in life that this film was largely panned (pun not intended, but now noticed) by critics and viewed by Spielburg as a disappointment, I was pretty shocked. So I decided that maybe it would be a good idea to revisit this film and see if it (or perhaps I) had aged to the point where Hook would no longer be enjoyable to me.I will admit, the movie has its fair share of flaws: the writing can be sketchy, the acting of the lost boys and Julia Roberts is poor in places, some of the effects look corny now, etc. However, there is so much more here to love that overshadows all of that. The performances of Robin Williams (who isn't as goofy here as one would expect), Bob Hoskins, and especially Dustin Hoffman as Hook are truly believable. The way certain scenes are shot are brilliant in the way the blend with the amazing music provided by John Williams. Standouts are the kidnapping scene near the beginning and the scene in the snowy park near the statue after Peter has returned from Neverland. And the story is consistently entertaining and touching while throwing in themes such as the inevitability of growing up and the importance of loved ones.Now I realize that the ones who hate this movie are just like Peter before his transformation. They're cynical old pirates who drink too much and can't enjoy a film that makes them rethink the lives they've chosen.",Hook
329,JoejoeSalamone,I love this movie.,10,23 March 2010,"I try to make it a point to watch this movie at least once a year, or when I feel myself getting too cynical. This is because if you are looking for fun movie that really does pull at the kid inside you, then this is definitely it.Robin Williams is just the right kind of goofy for my tastes, and makes an excellent Pan. Captain Hook was perfectly fit by Dustin Hoffman. I could have done without Julia Roberts as Tink. Actually, I can do without Julia Roberts all together. But Bob Hoskins made a great Smee. (I like to watch this and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, back-to-back) Anyways, I watch this movie once a year because the message of the movie, and the reason people watch it, warrants that. A movie where the message is to never lose sight of your inner child. Imagination. Belief in magical creatures. Sword fighting with pirates. All of these things that I'm sure you did as a child, as I did.As far as I'm concerned, all of the people who have written bad reviews for this movie, saying things like ""The characters weren't believable"", and ""Spielberg tried to answer a question that didn't need an answer"" have lost sight of the kid in themselves, have become pirates, and should have their hands fed to crocodiles. It's a movie. A family movie. One that needs to appeal to both children and adults, which is a difficult task, to be successful. And I believe that this movie succeeds at that very well.",Hook
330,ifatfirst03,"Ah, good form exactly, Spielberg!",10,26 January 2011,"Ever since I was a little kid, Hook has held the #1 spot as my favorite film of all time. I figured then, that I'd take this moment to finally flesh out the reasons why Spielberg's critically, well... criticized film has held my interest for so long.First off, going in, one has to understand that this is foremost a children's movie. That said, the adult themes introduced (ie. parental neglect, childhood rebellion, suicide, murder, revenge, forbidden love, etc.) all add a mature quality that takes this film a step above, say, Disney's hokey rendition of the Peter Pan story. Painting Peter as an adult, unaware of his origins, lost in a world of politics and material things (he's a lawyer, in essence a pirate by society's standards), ultimately makes him the polar opposite of his childhood self, thus necessitating the greatest change possible of the character by the end of the narrative. And giving him kids with whom he's all but estranged, but must travel to Neverland and face his past in order to rescue? Brilliant.Secondly, the setting. Some might call it corny, others might call it fake and contrived... I think that the feeling you get when you enter the world of Neverland for the first time isn't far from the feeling you get walking into a large theater. With set pieces hanging, and props laid out, and lights casting shadows onto decorated walls. You know it's artificial, but there's a certain magic about it because of that. Peter Pan was originally written as a play, and having Neverland mirror a stage set brings the enchanting story of Peter Pan back to its foundation. Everything from the Lost Boys' tree to Captain Hook's ship gives that same synthetic impression of a dreamlike world imitating reality. Which, in principle, is what Neverland was from the beginning.Also, how can I not talk about the casting? Robin Williams stars as Peter Pan, and he's not only at the top of his comedic game here, but he's nearly at the top of his career. In the early nineties, his name was synonymous with laughter, and children knew his face like they know Ben Stiller's now. He was ultimately a boy who wouldn't grow up. The perfect man to play Pan's adult self. And Captain Hook? Dustin Hoffman personifies Peter's nemesis perfectly. No other portrayal of the villainous Neverlander has been so spot on. The dark humor inherent in his performance is captivating and real, and leaves me shivering now the way it left me shivering when I was six. 'Pretty Woman' Julia Roberts even steals the show and adds a romantic tension that we feel just beneath the surface... giving Neverland a taboo sexiness that we've never really experienced before.Finally... and I'm sure I missed dozens of minor elements that make this film what it is, but it would be nothing without the incredible score by John Williams. He captures every possible tone of this film with brilliant complexity. From the title screen to the epic Hook versus Pan battle at the movie's climax, the entire musical composition is like a living organism. Breathing along with the action of the film in perfect rhythm.So yeah. That's why this movie is so awesome. And yes, I've seen all other versions of Peter Pan, and I've read the original script ""Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up"" by author J.M. Barrie, and I have to say that Hook does the original source material the most justice in every way.",Hook
331,MatthewJamesEdge,"Imagination is everything... To this day, this film moves me like no other!",10,23 February 2015,"My first review to complete my profile and launch IMDBPRO...An never ending story... Growing up with this film and watching it from the age of 3 I was inspired, not only is the story magical I still use lesson's learnt from it in everyday life.Although I cannot ""fly"" The power of dreams and 'happy thought's' despite some negative situations in life, are so important.RIP... Robin Williams, thank you for the timeless performance I hope I will never 'grow old' as you said it's important to keep the 'magic' it never ends. Your honesty on screen and genius in comedy throughout this role and many more, Popeye, Aladdin, Jumanji, flubba, Mrs Doubhtfire and Bicentennial Man to name a few most defiantly brought happiness to the world and my life. Reflecting back now I can see why I am pursuing Acting/Directing, I was always method acting and practicing voices from a young age stemming from your influence.Although I thought acting/performing through school wasn't for me as I was all for the banter and the lad's, I wish I didn't want to be different or the only lad.But you only realise when you find yourself and your purpose, that if you enjoy what you do in life it's not like work.You can give back or move people, I volunteered in India immersing myself in an unknown culture with new and exciting people. I met friends, shared incredible moments but most of all we used the power of performance in a drama about 'women empowerment' bridging the gap between two classes of society through art.This is what Steven Spielberg clearly does throughout this film, he captivates you and makes you want to believe even when there is doubt.After my life changing experience I started acting, I landed a lead role in a music video for a company based in Manchester called Video Ink. Whilst not in shot or on screen I was actively aiding people's performances, little did I know I was naturally Directing I clicked with the super lad's Adam and Oliver. They offered me an internship as 1st A.d directing music videos for TV Broadcast.I can now appreciate the finer details and work that go into a production, into directing and bringing to life the best performance.Ultimately 'Spielberg' I am following in your footsteps, that I thankyou for. I have an eye for film and story telling in front and behind the camera, from your influential pieces I am climbing my own ladder to greatness.I know direct, and I am often D.O.P for promotional videos and I am making a documentary called 'FIGHTING DEMONS' about conquering adversity in life despite your situation. This is a twisted tale about my brother Jon who has a different mother and his anger issues through having an difficult upbringing.I also act and had the honor to work with the very talented 'Bob Hoskins' RIP... On a British film called Outside Bet, he took the time after filming to grab a picture and have a brief chat in his dressing room. Although his character is of 'Smee' he also helped mold me as a creative person through the power of emotion. Thank you to Dustin Hoffman as 'Hook', and Julia Roberts as 'Tinkerbell' both amazing professionals.To conclude, this film still has so much importance to me to this day and will always be my favourite movie until I die...I thank all the cast and crew for helping me realise a journey, see you on the red carpet sometime soon...

There is this great misunderstanding in our country about films, everyone seems to think they all have to be deep, philosophical, independent type pictures... what's wrong with a little fluff every now and again. I have been studying theater for the last 4 years and have found that the fluff is just as important as the deep, philosophical.This movie is fun, and imaginative. It great for kids, they can relate to the lost boys and Pan's kids. And it's great for adults to remember what it is like to be a kid and how to relate to their own children. The acting may not be Oscar worthy but they all do a very good job. Yeah it's a little corny but let your self get caught up in it, there's no shame in that.

Robin Williams was cast superbly in his role as Peter Pan.Only downside was, the two children, who were poor actors to say the least.It's a film that always goes down well at Christmas, and it is assured to 'hook' all children (i apologise for the pun).The best part of the film is 'Rufeo', anyone who does not respect the genius of this character should be shot. The actor plays the role well, mixing aggression with a peaceful and sentimental side towards the end of the film.Steven Spielberg did this well, verges on greatness, unlike AI!",Hook

339,slhurtt,An amazing movie with few caveats,10,16 May 2013,"I've seen this movie many times. And I am never ceased to be amazed at the complex but enjoyable version that this movie portrays. It is quite different from the classical version of Peter Pan. This movie starts and ends in quasi-modern times. I always enjoy the quick and quippy narratives. With a taste of old English, but not so much that you lose the meaning of the characters. I do think that the children did a great job of playing their parts from Jack and Maggie to all of the Lost Boys. Bob Hoskins was great. As was Robin Williams and last but not least Dustin Hoffman. The pirates has some notable figures. I particularly liked the ""Boo Box"" scene. Another memorable scene was when Maggie realized who her dad was. If you haven't seen this movie you will miss both an exciting and well versed version of this old classic. Well worth the time to see.",Hook
340,CelticMoonfire,Brilliant Spin-off!,9,29 December 2004,"A comment was posted suggesting that fans of the book stay away from this movie. I couldn't disagree more!! I absolutely love the book, and I adore this movie. It is not meant to be a recreation of Barrie's brilliant and timeless story... it is, well, sort of a sequel in a way. It's a ""what if"" scenario, just one option of many. It's very cleverly tied closely to the original story, with many references woven throughout the entire storyline, if not as much in the plot itself. The creativity in every aspect of the film is very impressive, and a better cast could not have been chosen. Any fan of NeverNeverland and the story of Peter Pan is sure to immensely enjoy this movie. It even enforces family values and has a great moral to the story (especially for those who have suddenly surprisingly found themselves grown up!)",Hook
341,CPStephenson,I Believe! I DO believe! I do believe in Fairies!,10,26 December 2004,"Just watched this movie for the fifth or sixth time. I'm currently 55 and watched it with my wife and our 34 year old daughter. We all laughed, got misty eyed in parts and truly loved it, again. During the commercials (yes, we actually watched it on TV) I ventured to IMDb and read some of the member comments. Those 'reviews' made me feel the need to leave some comments of my own. The image one person left which struck me the most was: ""people with no imagination will probably not like this movie much."" So many of the comments were apparently about analyzing it to death rather than letting the movie tickle their too oft unused imagination. 'Hook' is not about Spielberg, or the too many 'Lost Boys' it is about children, dreams, hope, joy, and the passion for life that we often lose as we grow older. More than anything else though - Hook is about not wanting to grow up, even when we are 35 or 45, 55 or beyond. Hook is full of vibrant joyfuller images and examples of the wonder that fills our children's minds about what might just be possible. It is a sadness to see how so many people have lost and forgotten that sense of wonder. Just as Peter had lost his sense of who he was and then regained it - so can we allow happy movies such as this to remind us of that which we may have lost and yet need so much to give us joy and hope in our lives. If we keep the sense of wonder so obvious in Hook, growing older is not the same as growing old.",Hook

With the help of Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys, Peter must find the Pan in himself if he is ever going to be able to rescue his children and defeat the Hook once and for all.The wonderful Land of Never is fantastically created, including friendly mermaids to an outrageous imaginary food fight. The Pirate ships are decked out with the expected patch eye-ed pirates down to the stuffed trophy croc towering over all.

344,hunterevanj,The boy who finally grew up,8,1 October 2015,"Hook has been one of my favorite movies ever since I first saw it 10 years ago. I love the magical aspect of the movie and of course Robin Williams. Hook (1991) acts as a sequel to Peter Pan. The movie answers many questions we may have. What would have happened if Peter grew up? What type of job would he get? Would he have a family? Director Steven Spielberg puts a clever twist on the old classic Disney cartoon, Peter Pan, and makes it new again for so many. Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is a grumpy lawyer who lives his life too seriously to remember he used to be the famous Peter Pan. Peter, his wife Moira, and their children Jack and Maggie, take a trip to London to visit Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith). While in London, Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps Jack and Maggie and takes them to Neverland. With the help of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) Peter goes to Neverland. The problem is Peter doesn't remember anything about Neverland. He is lead to the lost boys who try to help him remember who he really is, Peter Pan. With the help of the lost boys and Tinkerbell, Peter is able to defeat Captain Hook and save his kids. The new character, Rufio, took over for Pan after he left Neverland and has been leading the lost boys ever since. Hook also references another classic fairy tale. Peter's children were named Jack and Maggie for a reason. Jack and Maggie are the English translations of the German names Hansel and Gretel. Just like Hansel and Gretel, Jack and Maggie are taken away from their family. The movie teaches us to really appreciate everything as if we are kids again. The film is a reminder that we should keep in touch of our inner child and never let go. The acting by Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman is incredible as always as well as most of the cast. Robin plays a great contrast between playing a serious character and the playful childlike character we have come to expect of him. Dustin Hoffman really got into his character Hook. He was on set for two months before he started shooting just so he could get into character. My only complaint is maybe Julia Roberts wasn't the best choice for the part, though she and Robin do have a few good moments together. Not only were the actors outstanding, so was the music by John Williams. It really draws you into the story. Spielberg did in this movie as he does in all his movies. His use of imagination and creativity makes you want to walk into the screen and become a part of the world he has created. The dinner scene where Peter starts to remember who he is, the lost boys use their imagination and pretend they are eating real food when there is actually nothing there. Once Peter starts to use his imagination, a banquet of food appears on the table. This is one particular scene that makes you want to be a part of the movie. Like all movies this one too has its flaws. It is a little slow paced at some points and has a few plot holes. There are numerous continuity issues. Also in a few shots you can see a crew member or camera reflection or even lights hanging down on the sound stage. Spielberg even said he was not happy with the final turn out of the movie. He said that if the movie was made today, the design of Neverland may be more to his liking. Though it is not a Disney film, it does capture the magic of Disney and the magic of the original Disney cartoon. It is full of action and adventure and a whole lot of fantasy. It is just an overall fun movie. If you are a fan of Robin Williams, Steven Spielberg, or Peter Pan, I really recommend this movie. Even if the before doesn't apply to you, despite its flaws, it is still a very enjoyable movie for everyone. Bangerang.",Hook

When somebody tell me that you should grow up I always answer them, that sorry I can't because there aren't girl pirates.

Its a classic tale brought to life to show what would have happened if Peter Pan left NeverLand.In response to the post by user OliverGbyrne, yes, the classic novel is set in England and the Lost Boys in the movie have American Accents. But who says Neverland was ever restricted to the boys of London? It's a marvelous fictional place that I imagine is home to any child who falls out of their pram. So I don't think they'd all have British Accents even if they were all from London, because they're not around people to learn the accents from.But I do agree in that Steven Spielberg is a great director who may have missed a few points in making the movie.

I fear that the critics scratched their heads a lot trying to deconstruct the film and squeeze it through their many paradigms. Forget logic. Simply Forget. Use this film as a vessel to escape- leave the world behind. Or stay planted and simply connect with yourself- your inner child perhaps. There are several moments in this film where you will be called to question where you are currently in your life. It's an emotional roller coaster that offers so many levels of thought, reflections and imaginative freedom. The more you are willing to lend yourself to the film the more you'll get out of it. Think of the critic's reviews like multiple choice questions rather than an essay. And I'll say it again, this film was a gift to us kids of the 90s- just for us, not to win any awards or stars for that matter. You simply can not measure magic, nor translate it into tiny pixels that are the rating stars.",Hook

While still encompassing the naiveté and adolescence of the lost boys which was very present in J.M. Barrie's novel, ""Hook"" allows adults to remember the fear and anxiety a child may encounter when faced with the idea of growing up through the eyes of a child and the reflections of an adult.

Many people didn't like it, but it was a big success, if I well remember. so it's a new evidence that public is more intelligent than critics and journalists.

358,bilditup1,"Underrated, to say the least",8,16 December 2005,"Some people have said that this was the low point of Spielberg's directorial career. It remains one of my most favorite films to date, and not just because of John Williams excellent score, also underrated. (I've been trying to hunt down the 3CD set for years, in vain.) The casting, especially Robin Williams - I don't see how so many people have a problem with him - was great. Ditto for Maggie Smith, Dustin Hoffman and all the kids. (It amazes me how she looks older in this film than she does in Harry Potter, despite the ten year difference between the two films.) People criticize this film for not being realistic enough, one person claiming that Dustin Hoffman's costume was a travesty. I say Hook is imaginary, and as this isn't his story, but Pan's, the costume design being a bit cartoony and 'inaccurate', whatever that means in this context, is irrelevant.The fact is, this is a classic story of redemption married to a classic children's story. The backstory of Peter Pan is made much more complicated; Pan is made human, in a way - without detracting from the myth.Hook is one of the few films that, if I didn't stop myself, would reduce me to tears. (The other two, off the top of my head, are Return of the King and Schindler's List, and ROTK I've become somewhat desensitized to, truth be told.) I guess it doesn't affect all people the same way; but it's tragic that some people think this to be a stain on Spielberg's career, when it's so clear to me that this is a lost gem, grossly misinterpreted by the populace.I don't why the film affects me this way, but I'm not alone here - I know many people who count this among their favorite movies, even though the critics at large and most people at this site would disagree. Maybe Spielberg wasn't true to the characters in the original book, which I've never read. If that's the case, I understand completely why people have problems with it - Mike Newell messed up Harry Potter 4 that way, for example.It is by no means perfect - Hook runs a little long, I have some issues with Banning's daughter, contrivances in the plot, etc. But these flaws never seriously detract from the overall experience. The only real sore thumb was Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, which was almost a complete disaster, though it definitely didn't ruin the film altogether.I'll admit, though - if I read the description of the movie at the video store, I'd probably discount it out of hand. No short description like that could do the movie justice; anyone with brains would automatically dismiss it as a cheesy and not worth their time. For G-d's sake, give this movie a chance! ------------------ On an altogether different note, does anyone find it nothing short of amazing that Bob Hoskins was both the detective in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" and Smee in this film? He looks and sounds completely different in both of them; amazing what makeup coupled with a good actor is capable of.",Hook

It's not a perfect piece of work, but I was eight years old when it premiered and the impression it made on me at that young age has stayed with me. It is, after all, a children's movie. Sure, there are parts specifically designed to keep adults interested, but anything remotely related to Peter Pan will always be first and foremost for children. I personally love this movie. It's always been one of those films I can't help watching any time it's on TV. This is an imaginative, brilliantly cast movie with colorful sets, vibrant characters, and beautiful music. It's almost like a live-action cartoon. Robin Williams is nothing short of wonderful as a grown-up Peter Pan, but I have always felt that Dustin Hoffman carried this film. His turn as the flamboyant, oddly sophisticated Captain James Hook leaves audiences wondering how this could be the same actor who blew our minds in ""Rainman."" ""Hook"" is a fun movie. I believe that Spielberg set out to make it a fun movie. Don't buy or rent ""Hook"" hoping to be educated or enlightened.

Curious if Michael Jackson ever publicly offered his opinion on the movie. Dustin Hoffman killed it. Not sure why Hook was so fancy compared to the other pirates. Maybe he was an aristocrat? He seemed to be well educated. Felt like Robin Williams put his hands on his hips too much once his character became fully Peter Pan. Julia Roberts was aight as tinkerbell. Tbh they should have gotten someone less overtly sexually attractive but maybe I'm out of line here. Weird when Robin Williams said she had ""nice legs."" Weird when Robin Williams said a lot of things. Like in the scene where the lost boys are pretending to eat dinner and there's no food there and he says ""Gandhi ate more than this!"" Not sure if that was supposed to be a line for the adults in the audience or what but it was a dud and I hated it. Carrie Fisher ghostwrote part of this script, apparently. I wonder if that was her contribution.The scene where tinkerbell becomes full sized and tries to get with Peter Pan was strange to me because she didn't have a pixie cut and wasn't acting impishly. She also wasn't wearing a burlap sack anymore. Disconcerting. Anyway. Oh yes, and the part where they put the pirate who doubted that Hook could steal Peter Pan's kids in the ""boo box"" and drop the scorpions in. That was Glenn Close for some reason? Pretty cool. Wonder if Carrie Fisher had anything to do with that. All in all, a pretty dope film, especially if you enjoy big sets. There's no computer animation in this movie. Spielberg didn't figure out how to do that until Jurassic Park, I guess. Rufio was a baller though. I imagine Michael Jackson related strongly to his character. I wonder what happened to that actor? (Not interested enough to actually google it.) He had a lot of potential, too bad he died. Justified killing off Hook, since he murdered a cool kid, but the way they got rid of him didn't make any sense by the way. The giant crocodile falls on Hook and he disappears into it's mouth? I thought the crocodile was dead? Whatever. The whole point is for Peter Pan to save his son and he just keeps talking about his son all the time BUT HE'S GOT A DAUGHTER TOO and she's like a toddler. At the end he's gone through all the trouble to fight for his boy and then his daughter runs up all happy screaming ""daddy!"" and it's like, well, pretty cool that she was able to take care of herself lol.Anyway, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless your roommate's girlfriend hasn't seen it.

He truly has the mindset down, and it shows. In addition, though many may hate him, Robin Williams is perfect for this role, and he acts as Peter quite well.

367,bbq_woa,One of the greatest Movies of all time.,10,29 November 2005,"This movie was one of the most magical things I ever saw when I knew it first as a child. It brought the mystic of the story of Peter Pan to a realistic, plausible place. (I was a very rational kid, and needed that for this kind of story)One of the greatest elements of the movie is the score, by the wonderfully talented John Williams. Some of the most exhilarating and magical cues I know of are here.Stephen Spielberg opens the movie and sets up the characters in his usually great, realistic way. He takes you along with them through a dramatic sub-story, gradually and artistically revealing their characters. This method is in stark contrast to many mundane, terribly predictable movies, where they attempt to develop characters by basically telling you what they're all about with such lines as ""You know I hate the dark, Sheryl, ever since I got locked under the stairs as a child""You know the type..The movie, after allowing you to become comfortable with the characters and their situations, suddenly plunges you into the magical world of never-land, merging the real world and never-land in a more down to earth method of travel than other peter pan movies (see: peter pan, the modern screw up) Peter, instead of GOING there, awakens there. Is it just a dream? Is it real?Wonderful actors, from Robin Williams in the starring role, to Dustin Hoffman in a surprising change of the usual (hook, himself) and the hilarious Bob Hoskins in a subdued, and outrageous role, where appropriate, to the soft-spoken performance of Caroline Goodall, and the wonderful and gentle Maggie Smith.This movie, unlike many recent ones, also involves good, and in places, great acting by the two children, Charlie Korsmo and Amber Scott, who play Peter's children, with their own very important sub-stories (the son, specifically.)",Hook

Being one who acted in a stage performance of the original play (as Curly), this film is seen as a travesty. There are too many instances that important details are overlooked. For example, there were originally 6 lost boys; Curly, Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, First Twin, and Second Twin. Then Peter. There are seven doors for seven boys, but in this film there's one big-ass door and a hollowed out tree, not the house under-the-ground. Also, where are the red skins? They are a vital part of the story! And another thing, since Peter is pretty much the only boy left on the Neverland (the lost boys decide to live with the darlings) where did this plethora of 20 to 30 lost boys appear from? And how the hell did Ruffio get there, if Peter was the only one who could bring people to and from? And how did that fat black kid know Tootles if Tootles left before all of other lost boys came? There's too many holes and deviations. It is a bad representation of Peter Pan.",Hook
369,rpmoitozo,i'm dumbfounded,3,18 February 2006,"Someone tell me why this movie is titled ""Hook?"" Having just watched this movie, it's clear that Captain Hook is merely a side character, just your typical movie villain. I don't get it. That's like if ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" was titled ""Cameron Fry's Day Off."" I just don't get it.I think this entire movie is as confused as its title. First, the story wants Peter Pan to morph back into his old self, then once that's happened, the story makes him an adult again. Cue the happy ending. How baffling.What a flawed, bad movie. You'd be better off watching ""Regarding Henry"" if you want to see a corporate man rediscover his family. Also, ""The Family Man"" is serviceable.Finally, why did TMC just show this movie? Is this really a classic?",Hook

Peter Pan became my hero, like Robin Williams. I loved this story and I became to write thanks to it. I knew the Peter Pan's fable but not this new version. This ipotetica sequel.
Genious.",Hook
371,astaire10,WHY do we have to forget it all??,10,1 May 2006,"In this one, Peter is a grown man.. It's a novel idea, and the film contains the grown Peter's 2 children at the center of the whole plot, needing their ""Dear Ol'Dad"" to revisit the site of his own legend to rescue them from that Old ""Codfish"",HOOK himself ! The film contains a beautiful score, and an eternally youthful Robin Williams is ideally cast as the legendary PETER! Also of note is Dustin Hoffman, ""dastardly and evil, and smirking as the Captain, and the LOST BOYS are beguiling, esp the eldest boy, Dante Basco, who plays RUFIO, and Isiah Robinson, as POCKETS. ANYONE who claims the film is ""awful beyond words"" HAS ""forgotten everything"" for sure! Take a few hours and escape into that wonderful NEVERLAND, where childhood STILL LIVES! NO ""Old Fogeys"" are allowed! What's SO TERRIBLE about THAT?",Hook
372,theladyofshalott18,Give It A Chance,9,5 July 2008,"Personally, I do not understand why there are so many negative comments about this movie. I may be a little bit biased, but I grew up with this movie and even from a young age the plot fascinated me. Yes, some of the characters may be cliché, but the truth is, this is a continuation of the story of Peter Pan and a very unique and well-made one, if I may say so myself. There are bound to be plot carry-overs, some alterations to make the story more interesting, and some toning down of the villain. This is a children's movie after all. I guess what I'm trying to say is cut Steven Spielberg some slack. The movie was made in 1991, it's now 2008, and I still love it. I am sure there are many others who do too. So, let yourself be a kid again. Just watch the movie. I'm sure you'll be glad you did.",Hook

374,jwestfal-1,See this Movie,9,4 February 2006,"This movie is fantastic! It lets you escape to a fantasy world and lets you forget about your worries. This movie gives hope to those that have none. Many might say this film is ""BS"" or F&^%ing awful"" but they are only commenting on their own lives. It's a brilliant magical film that lets you forget the thoughts of everyday life. Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman portrays their characters in unbelievable fashion. I believe that this is one of Spielberg's finest films. When I saw this in theaters I felt that it was a phenomenal approach to the untold story of Peter Pan and Captain Hook. This movie will forever be on my top 10 list, and anyone that speaks otherwise is insecure within their own body. Go Hook! RUFI-OOOOOOO!!!",Hook
375,aloycius,A wonderful film that is victimized by spoiled critics and intense Spielberg cynics.,9,6 September 2006,"This film, as I first saw it when I was twelve (maybe thirteen), had an undeniable effect on me. Spielberg largely has influenced my interest in film and stories with Jaws, E.T., Third Encounters, Jurassic Park, etcetera, etcetera. He is a master of conventional entertainment by cleverly implementing life and wonder, awe and visual splendor into his pictures. He does not write these fables, he tells them with a voice and sensibility no other filmmaker has; like a unique, very beautiful, handwriting that actually reads better than the rest. His films have a heart, a soul, and a quiet sort of depth.I watched this movie again and not only was it great nostalgia, it was, as if for the first time, a wonderful experience. The sense of wonderment, the, at first, reluctant adventure, the central theme (as is with many Spielberg films) of family, self-discovery, the playful humor, and the heart it has that never skips a beat. No amount of criticism, observation, or trivia can take this film away from my list of favorite childhood films. I recommend this to every family that has children, every child that has dreams, and every adult that has an open-mind.Consider the scene when Tinkerbell flies through the window, and a startled Peter Banning swats at it as he would a fly: Beautiful. Consider the scene where a groggy Peter Banning awakes on a Harbor full of Pirates, and breathlessly approaches one aberrant entity after another, surely belonging to a dream: Imaginative. Consider the scene where a newly discovered Peter attempts to fly from a elevated rock, fails, then looks to a youthful reflection in the water and is struck on the head by his son's home-run ball: Comforting. Consider the short-lived duel permitted by an arrogant, yet deeply tormented, Rufio where he is incapacitated by Hook then, in a touching last few moments, is disarmed by a father-esquire Peter Pan: Touching.There are countless scenes I could revisit over and over again.Despite the constant criticism towards it over it's change in direction and the take on the story, it has no importance when it comes to deciding the enjoyment of this film. The themes it deals with is refreshing in it's form as a classic tale; the emotions ring true, if at times strangely, which is affectuous even when the tone feels uneven. The action, however highly dependant upon it's enormous sets and seemingly limitless props, is exciting, charming, and (unbelievable for popcorn entertainment) uncompromising to central events.There's no arguing that this is great entertainment for all ages (some, however, might have trouble stomaching the movies more tender moments). It is true that Spielberg was rushing for a deadlinea deadline that had been late presenting itselfand that many scenes could not be reshot as they were meant to be, and that the editing was not allowed an adequate time-frame. Spielberg acknowledges the penalty it took on the finished product, but never said he did not like the film (which is largely misconstrued). When you know you could've perfected something, in the eye of it's creator, it's easier to be disappointed by a finished work.My issues with the film are as follows: The script, let me say that it feels as if it was written, reworked, still felt hokey, then was reworked again. However, Spielberg did a good job casting a spell with each and every scene, despite their inherent flaws. He reminds us, time and time again, that we care about these characters before it's too late. We are rescued, once again, I think to myself, from absorbing into an action orgy instead of a wonderfully bright, fun, and touching life lesson.For my last remarks, I will say that I am extremely appalled with a majority of viewers that have decided it ""Speilberg's Worst Film"". Those that fall victim to a false loyalty to J.M. Barrie's masterpiece will probably never take their fervent emotions off their mind while watching ""Hook"", and why should they? This is but one of Spielberg's many money-makers, and he needs a couple bad movies on his resume. Come on, the guy's rich; maybe even a little overrated! Screw this movie, Spielberg's job is to make high(est)-end entertainment. We, as a whole, will accept nothing more.This eloquently written, very insightful review has been brought to you by, Sean Stack. (aloycius@gmail.com)",Hook
376,chazz6422,excellent movie,10,21 March 2006,"Hook is a marvelous story about Peter Pan after he has grown-up, married a beautiful woman, and had two children. After many years of living a regular life outside of Neverlad, Captain Hook kidnaps Peter's children and challenges him to fight for the lives of his children. So Peter goes back to fight for his children; but the problem is, Peter has forgotten everything about Neverland. So it's up to Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys of Neverland to help Peter remember to fly and fight again.I was about seven years old when I first saw Hook. my whole family gathered around to watch it and we all laughed and enjoyed it. This is a wonderful movie for the whole family. The gorgeous colors and marvelous soundtrack keep children entertained and interested in the movie. Hook is a very humorous movie that keeps the whole family laughing all day long. Hook provides good clean entertainment and laughs for all ages.",Hook
