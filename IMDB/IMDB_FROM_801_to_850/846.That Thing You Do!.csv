0,MartinHafer,Charming homage to the early 1960s,7,15 July 2006,"This film is a very slight film that probably won't change your life or have you announcing that it's the greatest thing you have ever saw. But, it is still worth seeing--particularly if you'd like to see a little slice of life film about the early 1960s and the burgeoning rock and roll industry. The movie is about a fictional singing group that called itself the ""Oneders""--a poor choice in names as although they pronounce it ""wonders"", many of the confused fans call them the ""O-needers""! Anyway, despite the poor choice of names, this young local boys perform a song called ""THAT THING YOU DO"" and it becomes a smash sensation--catapulting them to instant, and very brief, stardom. How this journey occurs and how they all ultimately deal with this is what makes the film worth seeing. The characters actually seemed pretty realistic and likable--not just caricatures like you see in some films. A good, fun film for the whole family with enough going for it to held your interest.",That Thing You Do!
1,SnoopyStyle,personification of Tom Hanks,7,8 June 2016,"It's 1964 Erie, Pennsylvania. Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) chases flirtatious Tina Powers (Charlize Theron) and unhappily works at the family appliance store. Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) is the girlfriend of Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) who leads a band with Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), T. B. Player (Ethan Embry), and Chad (Giovanni Ribisi). They get Guy to join after Chad breaks his arm and come up with the name ""Oneders"" (supposedly pronounced Wonders). Guy's fast beats force the band to change their song ""That Thing You Do"" during a competition. The guys sign with manager Phil Horace living out of his camper. They go to Pittsburgh. Mr. White (Tom Hanks) signs them to Play-Tone Records and promptly changes the spelling of their name to The Wonders.This is very much the personification of the Tom Hanks and his sunshine personality. It is fun, mostly happy, deliberately light even when the movie touches on darker issues, and has a catchy tune. It's good that the song is catchy because the movie plays it a lot. The visual is immaculately perky 60s. This is a happy Disney version of an one-hit-wonder rock group. The actors are beautiful. This is not to say this is a blindly perky film. It doesn't dig too deeply in the darker corners.",That Thing You Do!
2,Hitchcoc,Those Things They Did,8,2 January 2017,"What a nice movie. There was a time when a garage band could put together a hit, find someone to listen to it, and get on the charts. Here, a group called the Oneders (pronounced Wonders) writes and performs a song and manages to get noticed by a record producer, played by Tom Hanks. Soon, they find themselves on a band competition where the emcee announces them as the o-need-era. When the achieve a reasonable success, they face the challenges that many bands did, artistic direction. One of the undermines things be not taking the whole thing seriously, and the women in their lives cause other issues. Their lack of experience in the big, bad world is also an issue. How far can they go with what they have. This is a quiet, charming story that focuses in on the lives of these everyday guys.",That Thing You Do!
3,mark.waltz,"You've heard of the ""Jersey Boys"", Well, here come the ""Erie Boys!""",6,2 November 2012,"Yay! Somebody made a movie set in my home town! Historically made famous by early American battles in the infancy of our country, Erie PA is also famous for where a certain overweight US President got stuck in a bathtub, and where a comic named Bob Hope wed his lovely bride, Delores. But for Tom Hanks (here the filmmaker in addition to actor), he uses Erie as the setting for a boy's band which suddenly rises to fame and go through all of the stereotypical star-making egos where many lessons are learned.Fans of 60's rock music will love this for its accurate description of the times, through the music, fashions, beehive hairdo's and those crazy home decors usually found in the old Green Stamps catalogs. Erie residents may not recognize State Street in the few street scenes (with the exception of the still standing facade of the old Boston Store), but mentions of Mercyhurst College and radio/TV station WJET (their ABC affiliate-Channel 24 during my youth), plus constant reminders as the boys go on the road that they are Erie natives, the film becomes a hallmark card to a beautiful city that sometimes takes a ribbing but in truth is actually one of the top tourist attractions in Pennsylvania.Hanks gives an enthusiastic performance as the manager of the band who is determined to rise them to fame. If Detroit can have their Dreamgirls, then Erie is more than allowed to have their Laker Boys! While the real 1960's produced a lot of schlocky rock & roll movies (mainly through some Sam Katzman produced musicals made at Columbia studios or those silly American International Frankie/Annette ""Beach Party"" movies), this is a loving salute to all the glitz from the movies and television shows of this era, with a bit of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and ""Hairspray"" thrown in. As for the energetic title song, I really was shocked to learn that it was written for the movie, not an actual hit from that era.",That Thing You Do!
4,classicsoncall,"""I led you here Sir, for I am Spartacus!""",7,23 July 2018,"One very weird thing about the movie before I go on to anything else. What's the deal with the bass player who replaced Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) with the broken arm? He doesn't have a name! It never came up in the picture and he's listed in the movie's end credits as T.B. Player, translated here on IMDb as 'The Bass Player"". I wonder what went into that script writing decision. There was even a scene when the band was getting ready to go into the recording studio and Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) was asking for Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) and Lenny (Steve Zahn), but not Mr. X. That just baffled me. By the way, it was Ethan Embry in the role with that dubious honor. Well this looks like a nifty tribute to all those one hit wonder bands throughout the decades who made it with one big Top 40 hit and were virtually never heard from again. So much so that the band's name in the picture is a spin off of the one-hit wonder concept; they called themselves 'the One-Ders', the gimmick being that everyone else read their name as the 'O-neders'. It would have been simple enough to place a hyphen in their name to eliminate the confusion but apparently they needed to keep a running gag in the flick. That got a little overworked in the story until Tom Hanks came on board to change the spelling and make things right.I'd have to second another reviewer's remarks by stating that it was pretty fresh to see a picture without a lot of swearing and gratuitous sex to appeal to a youthful audience. The actors were a clean cut lot modeled to some extent on The Beatles, which back in 1964 seemed to be the way a lot of the British Invasion bands presented themselves. It was interesting to note that when ""That Thing You Do' made it to Number #71 on the Billboard Top 100, the song immediately above it was 'Tell Me' by the Rolling Stones. So the guys were in pretty good company for a fictitious band. My favorite characters in the picture oddly enough weren't any of the 'One-Ders'. I liked Liv Tyler in her role as the put upon girlfriend of Jimmy Mattingly; her blistering breakup with Jimmy really changed the tone of the story there for a minute. The guy I really liked was hotel owner and doorman Lamarr, effectively portrayed by Obba Babatundé. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think I've ever seen him before and thought he played a wonderful character. I'll have to keep my eyes open for another appearance of his.Over all, not a bad little story that charts the meteoric rise and fall of one of the era's fictional bands. But don't fret, there were plenty of real ones you can pay tribute to - how about The Surfaris (Wipe Out), The Standells (Dirty Water), and The Capitols (Cool Jerk) to name a few. Any one of those is enough to perk your ears up when they come on the radio.",That Thing You Do!
5,gavin6942,Catchy Tune Propels The Film,7,2 June 2015,"A Pennsylvania band scores a hit in 1964 and rides the star-making machinery as long as it can, with lots of help from its manager (Tom Hanks).There is nothing really new here. A cast of fresh-faced kids (and a young Liv Tyler), rising up in stardom, and stumbling along the way. We all know what happens if we let fame get to our heads and we leave our friends behind.What makes this film stand out is the catchy tune. Even though they play it a dozen times throughout the film, it never really gets old. Had the song been not as good, the film would drag and certainly would not having the staying power it does. (Not unlike ""Eddie and the Cruisers"", which is very much anchored by its ""Dark Side"" song.)",That Thing You Do!
6,lee_eisenberg,Perfectly done,10,5 March 2006,"It seems that most actors and actresses eventually want to direct movies, but when they do, there's always suspicion that it might be little more than a publicity stunt. Well, I can say that Tom Hanks's directorial debut was very good. Portraying a 1960's rock 'n' roll group's rise to fame, ""That Thing Do You!"" makes one truly nostalgic, even if you didn't live through that era (I was born long after the '60's had ended). Obviously, the band portrayed is loosely based on the Beatles, but that's no crime. It's a very cool movie. Even more interesting is that I now know that it was one of Charlize Theron's early movies: she plays the Guy Patterson's (Tom Everett Scott) first hubby. Within a decade of course, she became the first person from Africa to win an Oscar. Liv Tyler also showed the same flair that she would bring to later movies. All in all, really neat.",That Thing You Do!
7,jboothmillard,That Thing You Do!,6,22 September 2005,"I always thought that the twice Academy Award winning actor was good on screen, and then I saw this and I saw that he could be good behind the camera as well. Tom Hanks wrote, starred in and directed this film, I never knew he had it in him. It basically tells the story of a band trying to rise in fame and popularity, especially to be number one. This unknown college band have created their own song called ""That Thing You Do!"" and one day they meet Mr. White (Hanks) who works in the music industry, he believes that the band have talent and he wants them to make this song a record and make it number one. Obviously there are moments of despair when the band members complain about stuff to Mr. White, but it ends pretty well. Starring Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson, The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy Mattingly, Steve Zahn as Lenny Haise, Ethan Embry as T. B. Player, Monster's Charlize Theron as Tina, Obba Babatundé as Lamarr, Lost in Translation's Giovanni Ribisi as Chad and Chris Ellis as Phil Horace.

8,ccthemovieman-1,A Refreshing Throwback,9,25 August 2006,"I remember when I first saw this in the '90s and thinking, ""Wow, what a shock: a modern-day movie with no no villains, no nasty people and nary a cuss word."" I kept waiting for that stuff, and it never appeared. It also has a nice sentimental ending. The story is a simple one about a group of average guys who form a band and become one-hit wonders.Tom Everett Scott, a young Tom Hanks-lookalike, is an appealing lead and Liv Tyler looks very, very pretty in the female lead role. The band in this almost-old-fashioned musical, is good to hear, too. They are a throwback to the old movie musical days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Yes, you hear the same song (the movie title) over and over but's a great song which is very catchy. The rest of the music is decent, too.Speaking of Hanks, he plays the promoter of the group. It's not a huge part but Hanks, as always, is entertaining. The whole film is, and, is refreshing to see.",That Thing You Do!
9,moonspinner55,"Familiar tale told freshly, honestly, with appealing cast",8,18 March 2001,"We've sorta been down this road before: 1960s pop band makes it out of their dead-end hometown for Hollywood, but fame and fortune unravel the fun. Still, this picture has remarkable focus, careful period detail, and a lovely cast that rarely (if ever) strikes a false note. If some of the young actors sometimes seem like they're doing Tom Hanks impersonations, that's okay because director Hanks (himself a co-star) seems to know these characters inside and out--and he likes them. We in the audience are quick to respond, and even the conventional parts of the movie work because Hanks rides over clichés with verve and enthusiasm and wit. Not a raucous comedy a la ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" (which is what it looked like to me in the ads), this has its share of subtle moments. There is a mean-spirited dig at the Frankie & Annette ""Beach Party"" flicks, and the ready-made romance at the end is sugar-coated, but ""That Thing You Do!"" is immensely likable. It has a huge heart. ***1/2 from ****",That Thing You Do!
10,studioAT,Tom Hanks' debut as a film director,5,12 February 2020,"Tom Hanks steps into the directors chair for this film about a small band who go big, before ultimately ending up as one hit wonders.It's a fun film, in which the young cast (Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Liv Tyler etc) give good performances.I don't know if it was intentional or not (if it was it's very clever), but the song the band have is played an awful lot in the film, to the point where I was sick of hearing it.A fun film.",That Thing You Do!
11,view_and_review,Good Job Tom,7,25 September 2020,"This is a music band movie so invariably I was looking for discovery, ascendancy, peak, drama (drugs, egos, creative differences, a girl), collapse, introspection. That is the formula right? Fortunately, ""That Thing You Do"" didn't quite follow that formula.Tom Hanks writing debut and feature length film directorial debut wasn't bad at all. TTYD is a movie about an early 60's garage band from Eerie, Pennsylvania that made it big. We did get the discovery, ascendancy, peak, drama and collapse, but it didn't have the gravity that so many other music band movies have. The entire movie, even at its most somber moments, was delightfully light. This is a movie you can watch and enjoy without waiting for that real down moment that sucks its viewers into a dark hole. Good job Tom.",That Thing You Do!
12,AlsExGal,Breezy period piece wrapped around a catchy song,7,19 October 2010,"When I saw this movie advertised in the theaters back in 1996, I rolled my eyes in great disdain. For one thing the advertising banner - ""In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do"" hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards.When I finally got around to seeing the film I really loved it. The first half is very upbeat as the band gets started out. They truly are the ""One-ders"", just like many other bands of the Beatles' transitional era. They wrote and performed one song that got them national attention, and then couldn't follow up with anything else. That's too bad, because the band does get one lucky break after another at the start. The guy in the camper that shoves a bowl of stew and a contract in front of them and tells them to ""trust me"" could have had them signing anything. They got lucky that he was legitimate and really did intend to get the record on the air and not steal it from them. That's what makes the disintegration of the band at the end so sad. One by one, they just walk away from their dream. To me, if the movie had any flaw, it was this - the band members just acted like the whole thing was one big amusement park ride rather than a once-in-a-lifetime life changing opportunity.Finally, I also loved all of the authentic looking stage designs. The home appliance store really brought back memories. These type of family owned appliance stores were all over the place back in the 1960's before the big box stores gradually made them extinct. Plus, the appliances being sold looked just like what was available in 1964 right down to the brand names and the styles.",That Thing You Do!
13,anaconda-40658,That Thing It Did Was Succeed.,8,5 November 2015,"That Thing You Do (1996): Dir: Tom Hanks / Cast: Tom Hanks, Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry: Reflecting on the music and talent of yesteryear with fresh talent hoping to gain the same recognition as their famous peers. Set in 1964 where a group of young adults form a band and write an overplayed song called ""That Thing You Do."" Tom Hanks becomes their manager and the group becomes the One-ders. Trouble strikes when the band slowly falls apart and they go separate ways. Structure is repetitious but the conclusion bares fact. Directing debut for Hanks who successfully captures the 1960's as well as the struggles of the music industry. He also provides a moral centre in a small but pivotal role as the band's manager. Supporting roles are effective but subdued by predictable writing. Tom Everett Scott seems to be the most durable as he seems to have his heart into it fully. Liv Tyler plays a girlfriend abandoned by another band mate. It is obvious that she will end up with Scott but her closing speech to her ex bares truth. Steve Zahn provides some humour as someone who quits the band to join the military. Superb production gives convincing view of 1960's and the music industry during the period. The film regards making it in an industry without promise and those who cannot see the road ahead due to lust for fame. Score: 8 / 10",That Thing You Do!
14,Mr-Fusion,Affable in just about every way. Hanks nails it.,8,6 October 2015,"The title song for ""That Thing You Do!"" is so infectious that, even if the movie had nothing else to do, it still boasts a teflon song. For as often as its played through the course of the movie (and in your head after the credits roll), it's one weapons-grade toe-tapper. But that's not all the movie has to offer; far from it. There's a can-do optimism permeating this thing from start to finish, not to mention a sense of playfulness. And you can't help but be swept right along with the band on their meteoric rise to the big time (not even their implosion is enough to sour things). Talk about hitting it out of the park for a first-time directing gig, this is about as well-engineered a feel-good movie gets. The cast is great, the pacing's snappy and it all adds up to one very entertaining movie.8/10",That Thing You Do!
15,JamesHitchcock,Joyous Optimism,7,10 June 2010,"That Thing You Do!"" was Tom Hanks' first, and to date only, film as writer and director. It is set in the summer of 1964 and tells the story of the rise and fall of a rock band. (Hanks is known for his love of classic rock). The four young men involved bear certain similarities to The Beatles, although they are not from Liverpool but from Erie, Pennsylvania. The title is also that of the group's first hit single, although for some reason the film title is spelt with and the record title without an exclamation mark.The four are Jimmy Mattingly, Lenny Haise, Guy Patterson and ""T. B. Player""- we never learn his real name; those initials simply stand for The Bass Player. (The surnames ""Haise"" and ""Mattingly"" are references to the film ""Apollo XIII"" in which Hanks also starred; Fred Haise was one of the astronauts on Apollo XIII, and Ken Mattingly should have flown on the mission but had to withdraw through illness). Guy, the drummer, is a late replacement for the original drummer who is injured in a road accident. The four together form a group called ""The Oneders"", pronounced ""The Wonders"" but frequently mispronounced as the ""oh-NEE-ders"". The choice of name was based on the theory that all successful groups, like The Beatles, should have a deliberate misspelling in their name. (To judge from The Byrds, The Monkees and Led Zeppelin, there might be something in this theory).The Oneders achieve quick success. They win a local talent show, release a single of ""That Thing You Do"", start getting paying gigs and are eventually signed up by a major record company named Play-Tone Records. The Wonders (by now the spelling of their name has been simplified) tour state fairs across the Midwest and their record enters the Billboard Top 100. When the song enters the Top 10, Play-Tone arrange for the group to appear on a prime-time variety show on national television.Then it all goes wrong. It generally does. It is something of a cliché in films about fictitious showbiz acts that early success has to be paid for in later failure or disillusionment. A good example is the 1970s British film ""Stardust"" about a rock idol who ends up an unhappy, drug-addicted recluse. The Wonders do not fall from grace in quite such a spectacular fashion but a series of disagreements lead to their splitting up soon after their television debut; their choice of name proves to have been sadly prophetic as they end up as no more than one-hit wonders. A written epilogue tells us what became of the four members in later years. (This device was possibly borrowed from ""American Graffiti"", another film about young men of this period).The film's great strength is the way in which it conjures up the spirit of the sixties and the joyous optimism of the popular music of the period. Films about pop music do not always achieve this- The Stray Cats, the fictitious band in ""Stardust"", might be based upon The Beatles but certainly don't sound like them and the music provided for them to play is generally dull and lacklustre. The music in this film, however, is a much more convincing imitation of sixties pop, and ""That Thing You Do"" itself is a cheerfully catchy number that would not disgrace Lennon and McCartney themselves. The film's most memorably joyful scene is the one where Guy and his friends start singing and dancing while listening to the song on the radio in his father's electrical appliance store where he works.The film's main weakness is that it neglects character development, so we do not really understand the tensions which lead to the group's splitting up. It is never really explained why Jimmy, who has hitherto seemed the most serious of the four about the band and his music, should suddenly behave like such a jerk towards both the record company and his girlfriend Faye. (Or, for that matter, why the record company- as we learn in the epilogue- should have given him a second chance with a new band). It is never explained why Faye should have got together with Guy so soon after splitting up with Jimmy or why Guy 's earlier girlfriend Tina should have become the only woman in recorded history to dump a rock musician for a dentist. It is never explained why Lenny should have walked out on the group to elope with a former Bunny girl. (Wouldn't his obviously mercenary new wife have been happier with a successful rock star than with an unsuccessful ex-rock star?) And why was the character of the bass player left so underdeveloped? None of this, however, is the fault of the four young actors who play the members of the group. Although none of them has gone on to become a real household name- perhaps ironically in view of the fact that the film is about a band who fail to find lasting success- they all play their parts here very well. The two actors who have gone on to become famous are the two female leads, Liv Tyler as Faye and Charlize Theron as Tina, neither of whom make much impact in the film itself.Strangely enough, the lack of credible characters may not be the fault of Tom Hanks either. I understand that in 2007 he released an extended director's cut of the movie; although I have never seen this I understand that it is more than half an hour longer than the theatrically released version and that it does concentrate more on character development. The weaknesses of the version I recently saw on British television, therefore, might be due to over-enthusiastic pruning for theatrical release. I therefore award the film a provisional 7/10, with the option of revising that once I have seen Hanks' version.",That Thing You Do!
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,A nice little movie,6,26 September 2005,"This is an honest piece of work. I'm not sure why I really chose to watch this when I borrowed it from a friend, but it looked cute. And it was. It didn't really catch my 100% attention, but most of the time I enjoyed it. It had a great cast and a cool story. To be honest, I didn't even realize that this was a true story, but I wondered because it sounded familular. It is a bit clique, but has little twists here and there. It brought me back to back to a more peaceful time that I wish was still here to this day. When music wasn't about hate or teenage things, but peace and fun and dancing. I would recommend this movie for a rainy weekend inside. It's a fun and cute movie to watch.6/10",That Thing You Do!
17,MovieAddict2016,Easy to watch but definitely heavy on the sentimentality,6,29 April 2005,"Tom Hanks directed this film and that was probably the only reason I felt any urge to see it when it was released in 1996. To this day I don't believe Tom Hanks is the next Martin Scorsese, but to be fair he does an apt job here and his cheesy, breezy vibe that he lends to the film suits it very well.Essentially a story about a small-town Pennsylvanian band in 1964 who hit it big after one of the members is replaced, and their manager turns out to be Tom Hanks (gasp!).""Almost Famous"" is a far superior examination of a rock band's ups and downs but this is alright as far as Friday night entertainment goes.This movie is not the best but it is easy to watch and will deliver exactly what the people who watch it expect: a few laughs, a few smiles, some likable characters and a happy ending.",That Thing You Do!

But, amazingly enough, it works just well enough to be worth watching.  Most of the performances are at least good and some are very good.  Liv Tyler does the best of the principal cast, but three of the supporting roles give it life and one of them all but steals the movie.  Bill Cobb as a jazz musician and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' wife in real life) as a waitress have very good parts and shine in their scenes.  But Obba Babatunde as Lamarr, the hotel doorman is great and all but walks off with the movie.  The music is very good all through the movie, with the title track getting an Oscar nomination.  It's played throughout the movie and is infectious.  It's got a beat and you can dance to it.  I give it a 77.",That Thing You Do!
19,sol-,Different Sort of Fab Four,6,5 August 2017,"Inspired by the success of The Beatles, a group of friends try to make it big on the music scene in the mid-1960s in this film written and directed by Tom Hanks. The Academy Award nominated title song is very catchy (and probably should have won the Oscar over 'Evita') and some of the band's other tunes are decent, yet the biggest sell-point here is all the parallels to The Beatles, including a similar involvement in the motion picture industry; the film is very cleverly done in this regard. There are less hurdles than one might expect though as the band rise upwards. Their first manager (who meets them in a rundown van) seems a little fishy, but turns out to have a heart of gold, and same goes twice over for their second manager, played by Hanks himself, who lectures them about treating their girlfriends right and so forth. In short, everyone is a little too pure at heart for the film to have any real edge; there is no producer trying to sell them short as in 'The Harder They Come' and all the messages about not letting fame get to their heads are fairly simplistic. Still, there is much to enjoy in the music and genuine 1960s ambiance that Hanks manages to recreate as writer-director, plus a running gag involving their misspelled band name is funny each time. This is an undeniably pleasant look at the music industry of yesteryear even if it lack a bit as a drama.",That Thing You Do!
20,Dr_Coulardeau,Funny seize the day and forget about the rest,8,18 November 2010,"It's a comedy about real young people from the Rock 'n Roll planet in the early 1960s. It's funny but also typically American. There are so many sharks going around looking for young teenage would-be rock stars that it is impossible not to be noticed by one, one day, not to become some one overnight and not to dissolved as soon as the top is reached. To stay at the top is really difficult. A band in those days, and in the USA, was the normal way for anyone who wanted to do some music on the stage to go around but bands did not last long. Everyone is not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, you know. This is the story of the short-lived Wonders and yet the four boys and the one girl who were there at the first public appearance in the boonies, all eventually did something with their skin and their brains, if they had any, both skin and brains. Today that adventure still exists in the USA but it has also taken names like Myspace music, Youtube, Daily Motion and some others. Permanence of course is nothing in that business in 99% of the cases, but chance is also essential for those who have something in their veins. A career is often 50% talent and 50% chance, some would say opportunity. But the film is funny, though so banal that it should be a warning to anyone who wants to imitate these young teenagers. As the old Paxton would say: look after your money, women and a few other things of that type. Yesterday is a sure thing that existed but tomorrow is as brittle as an egg shell in front of a bulldozer. And the world is full of bulldozers crushing many eggshells down into the ground and powder.

22,GOWBTW,One hit wonders are always memorable!,9,31 October 2007,"One hit wonders are always common in music. The cause of that, not enough ideas, next song doesn't click, strife in the business, stress of traveling, etc. You name it, it's there. ""That Thing That You Do!"" is a marvel of a movie about a fictional boy band in the 1960's who get their big break with the help of a determined manager named Mr. White(Tom Hanks). They are know to the U.S. as The Wonders(Oneders) The band get their show on the road when Guy Patterson(Tom Everett Scott) becomes the new drummer after the original breaks his arm. They go places to perform, and Guy meets jazz drummer Del Paxton(Bill Cobbs) who warns him about bands and success. He did take heed. After the performance of a variety show, the band starts to suffer. Egos clash, and head-butting with other members split the band. Some of the members form a new band, Guy and Del start to make music of a different tone, choosing Jazz over Rock-n Roll. What started with a band, ended with a new opportunity. Hanks did a great job making this movie, Liv Tyler did a spectacular performance playing Faye Dolan. She was important to Guy, and Lamarr(Obba Babatunde) was a very resourceful and wise bellhop.

23,dfranzen70,A simple fable from simpler times,6,23 February 2000,"Oh sure, we've all seen what this movie's about - the rise of a All-American musical group in the early sixties. And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.
Overall, there's not a whole lot that's out of the ordinary for this movie. There have been countless movies about music groups or solo artists who achieved success (some against horrible odds), only to crash and burn after a short stay at the top. Some are based on fact, some are fabricated by the always-creative (!) minds of Hollywood. And this movie's not all that different. It's fairly predictable from start to finish, but what might set this apart from all the others is its undying charm. There's not an unappealing performance to be seen, including Hanks himself (and he directed, too, so if you don't like it, you know who to blame). Each of the young actors involved is very engaging, especially Tom Everett Scott as Guy, and Liv Tyler as Faye. There's not a false note in the entire movie, and these kids really light up the screen both with their musical performance and their unerring acting. It's a solid directorial debut for Hanks (if you don't include an episode of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" for HBO).",That Thing You Do!

25,drqshadow-reviews,How to Build a Pop Sensation in Sixty Days or Less,7,15 September 2014,"A ride through the music-making machine with a wholesome, mid-sixties one-hit-wonder. For years I thought I'd hate it, based on trailers and tone alone, but was pleasantly surprised. The film's got some issues, no doubt - especially the horribly tacked-on, telegraphed romantic ending - but it's got a lot of soul and I actually started to like the little tribe of stereotypes as we spent more time together. The theme song is appropriately catchy, too, without being grating like a lot of the era's pop records. Which is important, because it plays no less than once every ten minutes. There's good stuff here, with a nice leading performance from (who?) Tom Everett Scott as the band's hip, friendly drummer, but it's also clearly a learning project for writer / director / supporting actor Tom Hanks. Could've been much better with a bit of a trim and a wilder fire burning behind the lens.",That Thing You Do!

28,triple8,Wholesome,7,24 April 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:That Thing You Do is a sweet and fun movie that's enjoyable to watch, particularly when one just wants to relax. While it doesn't have the edge of some other films I've seen dealing with bands and music, what it does have is rare to find and that's wholesomeness. There is a sweet wholesome quality through the whole movie and it's mood is contagious. Definitely a fun movie to watch.I will say that the most interesting characters for me, were not the guys in the band, they were Tom Hanks himself and Liv Tyler who's darling here as Fay. I liked the fact that these characters were not over the top and were very believable. I wouldn't really refer to this as that much of a comedy, it doesn't have a lot of fall down in your seat funny lines. What it does have though is sweetness. You may not laugh constantly but you sure will smile a lot.The main thing I was surprised about was the ending which was kind of abrupt and I really did feel should have been longer. I wasn't to into the updates at the end, the ""where they are nows"", to me things were just wrapped up awfully quickly and I didn't expect the movie to end that abruptly. Maybe it should have been longer.This movie has a great reputation and I can see why, it makes a nice view and almost seems like it's from another time period. My vote on this one is 7 of 10 and a recommended viewing, particularly to any music lover.",That Thing You Do!
29,denis888,"Sweet, Down To The Point It Got Saccharine",7,3 May 2017,"Tom Hanks is a real steamroller who goes well and mighty. He did many great movies and he seems to do no wrong. Yet, here he seemed to be all correct again, with this funny little film of a young band getting famous and then falling apart due to several factors all gotten together at one place. Here, the story seems to be OK, yes, as a drummer I do support all those technical difficulties the band encountered and all those conflicts they had. Yes, the studio / TV / gig routines are shown pretty well. Yes, the band seems to be very real, they play as if the actors play all their parts themselves. Yes, Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are gorgeous sexy ladies. Yes, the band is a very funny gang often. And then, many NO's follow. No, the characters do not endear or grab you by their struggles or triumphs. No, the love line does not seem to be deep or decent. No, the final conflict does not smack of being real and mundane. It seems that Hanks tried very hard to slide along the surface without diving any deeper. There is no deep slant drilling of main heroes, there's only some sweet light slight tiny touches upon their psyche. This is a light little teen comedy with a very large chunk of certain shallowness and naivety, seemingly all coming from blurred recollections of Mr. Hanks himself. Oh, and I am sorry but does Mr. Zahn not irritate with his character all through. This obvious shallowness of all four main heroes seems extremely annoying, and this fluffy-puffy sweetness of Liv's Faye leaves nothing but a cloy of too sweet candy. Where Hanks succeeded is in biting certain sides of TV / cinema routine. Where he fails is depicting band's true evolution. And oh, all those jazz sentiments, they are so out of place that one can only rub their eyes in utter shock. Yeah, the overall feeling of very lightweight teen pop comedy never left me. It was nice, it was sweet. Decent or deep it was not. My rating - 7 Nice try, but not more",That Thing You Do!
30,LeonardKniffel,Fable of the Wannabes,7,2 May 2020,"This fable about The Wonders, a rock band formed just after the Beatles invaded America in 1964, is symbolic of the may wannabes and one-hit wonders that followed the Fab Four. Tom Hanks stars, with lots of great supporting cast, including Rita Wilson (Hanks's wife) and Chris Isaak.

31,Sergeant_Tibbs,Still humming that title track.,6,28 February 2014,"In the mid-1990s, Tom Hanks was on the top of the world. He had just won two Oscars in a row and starred in the innovative phenomenon Toy Story. Frankly, he could do just about anything he wanted. So he went ahead and made his directorial feature film debut, a love letter to an adored era, the explosion of pop music in the 1960s. That Thing You Do is a pretty routine but charming flick like an alternate Beatles fame tale. However, the story takes a pretty straight trajectory. It rises, rises, rises, keeps rises without much interruption, then there's the fall, then soft landing then credits. It suffers from lack of meaningful conflict, instead just showing the cracks til the inevitable explosion within the band. It's okay for mild entertainment, just a little bland. Wish he chose a better lead than someone who just looks like him. Steve Zahn is the only zany highlight who livens the picture up. But it all hinges onto its title song, which is very catchy, if quite 90s. The disappointing thing about the film is it doesn't explore the joy of discovery in this early pop music. Instead, kids just nod when things feel right. It needed much more energy and confidence, but it's a generally inoffensive film.6/10",That Thing You Do!
32,dunmore_ego,That Thing Done Well is a Thing of Beauty Indeed.,8,30 September 2003,"A snappy, exhilarating movie, with a slightly 'down' ending, but which nonetheless entertains, without educating (a staple of American cinema). That's not to say this isn't an excellent film - full credit goes to Hanks (as writer-director) for crafting a vehicle in which he stars, that he is not the star of, focusing on the rise and fall of a rock group ensconced in British Invasion-era America.'Not educating' because this film deals very little in the reality of the business management behind The Wonders' success. Sure, no audience will sit through protagonists sludging through reams of contracts, but an audience can stomach details on the industry process of promoting an artist, because we see The Wonders single rising the Billboard charts, but no one ever mentions how it does this. Hanks puts in clues, but the dots are never joined - which might be construed as treating an audience as ""intelligent"" - whoa!, let's not go overboard...The Wonders are drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott, oozing pleasant-ville like a born-again on crank), bandleader Jimmy (an intensely-focused Johnathon Schaech), guitarist Lenny (Steve Zahn, also pleasant - but unbalanced in that non-threatening way we term ""kooky""), and a nameless bassist (Ethan Embry, a wisp of effete lower end). Rounding out the troupe is Jimmy's unappreciated girlfriend, Fay (the gorgeous Liv Tyler).After a few appearances and an indie single, The Wonders ""make it"" (see how EASY it is, starving musicians?). In turning them over to a major record label, The Wonders' first Garage Days manager, Phil, portrays a simplistic, ""noble"" approach (""My bird-doggin' is done - Play-Tone's gonna take care of ya""), failing to mention that for a major to express that much interest in a band, the label's rep, Mr. White (a high-foreheaded Hanks), must have bought The Wonders' contract from Phil with a monetary offer he couldn't refuse. When Guy expresses how easy it all seems, White smoothly purrs, ""Well, papers will have to be signed and you'll have to get me the master tapes..."" Suddenly Reality is served - you could almost see the horns growing out of White's forehead.Hanks doesn't serve up too much of this meat, and by concentrating on the end-result of all the bureaucracy and hard work - the gigs - we are given a skewed view of this ""job."" Seems like it's all just ""fun,"" but there are as many rockers who attest that they ""hate their job,"" as there are desk-jockeys nine-to-fiving. When it's your primary income, it's your Job - simple. And any job done well will elicit fun. Any job where you cannot cope, becomes not fun.The band guys are perceived as financially secure by movie's end, but a debut artist selling one single - even to Number One - cannot possibly recoup any of the money that the record label advanced to duplicate, promote and distribute the single nationally. As most veteran artists will attest, they had to wait for their fourth or fifth album (not single) to put them in the black fiscally. And The Wonders ultimately reneged on their contract, which meant that any advances assigned as living expenses on tour would suddenly dry up. It's an intimidating, debilitating legal situation that ensues - but the film sidestepped this issue. Rightly so.The crowning glory of this movie is undoubtedly its synchronized soundtrack. Very few movies (including monumental, award-winning productions like Amadeus or Immortal Beloved) pay this much attention to ensuring that musician's manipulations on screen match the audio soundtrack, except maybe ""This Is Spinal Tap."" (Of course, movies about real musical artists don't enter this assessment: ""Woodstock,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""The Song Remains The Same,"" etc. - although the Zep movie has its mighty share of non-sync passages.) When the Eddie & The Cruisers movies surged into cinemas in the 80s, I was humiliated at the lack of savvy the filmmakers exhibited in their portrayal of the rock and roll milieu. A major musical flaw was the set-and-forget production value for all the songs, making them sound exactly the same, as if they were all recorded in one place at one time, with one overall mix - which is what was actually done, of course - but to bring some credibility to the movie, the producers should have assessed the circumstances for each scene and mixed the music accordingly  which is what Hanks and his audio personnel intuitively did for this movie.Every single time The Wonders perform their hit, the eponymous ""That Thing You Do,"" the sound is mixed to reflect the type of stadium, bar or studio they are in; every single on screen frame of the actors-playing-musicians is synched  Hanks specifically made his principals take instrument lessons before filming began  down to every single beat of drum-fill on screen being accounted for, down to the guitarists changing to correct chords in correct positions in sync with the audio! If Hanks was brave enough to cast Liv Tyler (a daughter of Rock Royalty), he must have had heady confidence in his team of editors and sound engineers, for to fail at putting across the ""musicality"" of this movie (with Steven's progeny willing to be involved in it) would not allow Hanks to show his face in public ever again.Of course there are minute flaws, but none worth mentioning here. There are too many trinkets to keep one sated: Guy's fastidious father, Jimmy's fascination with punning the band's name (spelled initially as ""One-Ders"" and subsequently mispronounced ""Oh-NEE-ders"" continuously), the well-drawn band personalities (the ""talented one,"" ""smart one,"" ""quiet one,"" ""zany one""), cameos from Peter Scolari (Hanks' old Bosom Buddy), Rita Wilson, Alex Rocco (Moe Green in The Godfather), Kevin Pollak; the subtle romance between Guy and Fay, who are not actually an item until the last few frames of film......and you'll never be able to get that damn song out of your head!",That Thing You Do!
33,KUAlum26,"A Nice story of the dreams of a ""one-hit wonder"" group,in Beatles-era America",8,5 November 2007,"The humble beginnings,meteoric rise and equally quick descent of a band of average,perceivably clean-cut kids from semi-rural Pennsylvania is the entire premise behind this movie,which boasts the movie directorial debut of Tom HAnks(his only film directorial job to date). While I cannot claim this a wonderful,masterful film,it was certainly good enough for me to give it multiple viewings.The central hero is Guy Paterson(Tom Everett Scott,congenial and average and thus perfect for the role),a JAzz-loving drummer who works in his dad's appliance store. HE is the central architect of the band ""THe ONe-ders""(And there's plenty of pronunciation goofs awaiting that!),which latch onto the burgeoning rock scene with a few popular tracks that get local airplay. When the band,consisting of guitarists Lenny(Steve ZAhn,never out of a job),T.B.(Ethan Embry)and lead singer Jimmy(JOnathan Schaech) get spotted by an enigmatic-yet-paternal music representative named White(HAnks,at full ease),their star progressively rises to the point where their demand goes national and their egos grow in separate ways. IN the mix are the lead singer's sensitive and naive girlfriend(Liv Tyler)and the spoiled Barbie-doll hanger-on(CHarlize Theron,who almost slips through the cracks of this film).Of course,the lead singer being an egotistical ass and Guy being a sensitive,recessive fellow,the budding romance is as predictable as the weather. HAnks' sympathy for the era as screenwriter and director,goes a long way to making this easy to watch. Ditto the casting of then mostly unknown younger actors to fill out the major roles. There is the perfect balance of bright,wide-eyed optimism of youngster wanting to be the next big thing in rock 'n roll and the reality of the business that makes this film neither sugary or cynical. I could nitpick as to elements that made this movie imperfect,but I'd just as soon not,since this movie has such a friendly,unique quality that I'd feel remiss in picking on it. While you need not be either an aficionado of 1960s rock and/or be from that era,it certainly wouldn't hurt in order to enjoy this movie. Or at the very least,this should appeal to the sentimentalist in anyone.",That Thing You Do!

36,jhclues,Meet The Oh-NEED-ers!,9,22 April 2001,"Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.	It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.	For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.	With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.	The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",That Thing You Do!
37,rzajac,"A Hoot; comes very, very close to being a great movie",9,24 July 2004,"I didn't see That Thing You Do (TTYD) when it came out, and it's too bad. This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with ""Stop Making Sense"" as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actually--almost enlightening--Hanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct, effective, ""connecting"" film writing. The casting, directing, and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets, costumes, general ""look"" is a delight. The music is very, very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail, that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine ""rock 'n' roll experience"" because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The pre-credits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device; but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload (the moral) which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishy-washy sense. What is love? According to this movie, it's that multi-dimensional experience which includes not just finding ""that special someone,"" but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write ""that big hit tune"" and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith, which put him off entirely. ""This guy won't ever get anywhere,"" he said. But I patiently explained that he (my friend) and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy (Frith) gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson, and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits, not just music.I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass, I want to plug this film's attention to a time-honored aesthetic virtue: Hard work. This film is a labor of love, with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the ""muse"" of that band. Something I always marveled at was how ""the creative process"" people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet, simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this, you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act, and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.There were many, many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way. If you haven't seen it and you love ""concert films,"" check it out.(NOTE: I wrote a little ""trip guide"" to TTYD!, which can be found at: http://www.ronazajac.com/That_Thing_You_Do_Comments.pdf .

42,TheOtherFool,An OK movie I guess,6,12 May 2004,"Nice little flick by Tom Hanks, about a group of teenagers from Erie, Pensyllvania becoming the next big thing in the sixties with their band, the Oneders (that's Wonders). One would expect the movie follows the routines set in this genre, but somehow it stays clear from it. The hot-shot manager (Hanks himself) is even pretty nice and the band don't break up because one guy thinks he's more important than the other one (what you would expect after drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) is considered the heart of the band while he's just in it for a couple of months).Too bad though there is this one thing always at the background: Faye (Liv Tyler). She's involved with singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) but somehow Guy is interested in her too. Not that it's an issue throughout the movie, but you always feel it's going to end up like that. But, until that point, the friendship in the band is there and they're just having a good time while their single is climbing the charts...Small roles as well for (now) oscar-winner Charlize Theron as girlfriend of Guy, Giovanni Ribisi as original drummer of the Oneders (until he broke his arm), and Chris Isaak as Uncle Bob.

Hanks lovingly examines a phenomenon that was practically an epidemic in the music world in the 60's...the ""One-Hit Wonder."" This film is the story of a garage band in a small town who call themselves The Oneders who have perfected a nice little ballad called ""That thing you do."" The night they perform the song publicly for the first time, the drummer doubles the tempo and, as an up tune, the song is a smash. They record it and it even gets radio play. The group then meets a Mr. White (Hanks), who agrees to manage the group and get them national exposure. He changes their name to The Wonders because they keep getting introduced as ""The Oneeders"" and books them on tours of state fairs and even gets them on TV and in a beach party movie, all on the strength of this one song, but when the group pressures White to make another record, that's where the problems begin. This movie accurately portrays the way a musical act in the 60's was able to catapult to stardom on the strength of one record and then disappear forever. The film is beautifully mounted, with imaginative direction by Hanks and Oscar-worthy art and costume design. Tom Everett Scott lights up the screen as Guy, the drummer whose change of tempo changes the lives of the group forever. The film also features impressive turns by Jonathan Schaech as the arrogant lead singer, Steve Zahn as the fun-loving empty-headed guitarist and Liv Tyler as Schaech's girlfriend. Take note of my favorite scene in the film where the members of the group hear their song on the radio for the very first time...the joy depicted here is infectious as is this film, which proved to be an impressive directorial debut for Tom Hanks.",That Thing You Do!
44,PersianPlaya408,An entertaining film from hanks,9,9 January 2006,"Tom Hanks film about a fictional pop/rock doo wop type band in 1964 is entertaining and has some good messages about entertainment industry. I liked the direction from Hanks, simple yet always interesting, i think he can be a good director one day. The screenplay is good for this project as it fits the themes of the film perfectly. The acting is not the greatest with somewhat lackluster performances from Jonathan Shaech and Liv Tyler who wasn't her best here although was charming as usual. I was impressed with Tom Everett Scott in the lead role and also Ethan Embry was impressive as the bass player. I also loved Steve Zahn who was hilarious as usual in his role. Tom hanks also stepped in for a good supporting performance as the groups manager. The film is entertaining and very well done as a whole. 9/10",That Thing You Do!

47,thejcowboy22,"The Wonders on the verge of stardom, Failure Forthwith!",7,25 May 2017,"Ah the fabulous 60's. The days of AM radio and which musical group will produce the number one song in the country on the top 40 survey. Garage bands were commonplace as the Fab Four (The Beatles) set the standard for music in that colorful era beyond Camelot and the Kennedy's. Much like the movie Radio Days, Woody Allen's period piece from the War years, this film acts like a time capsule as we look into the past and get a taste of what it's like to be alive in the 1960's. Tom Hanks does an outstanding job re-creating an era of rock and roll groups aspiring to cut a record and go on to greatness. The music industry was at it's paramount in that period with endless artists taking a grab at the brass ring. Our story originates from Erie, Pennsylvania in 1964 as a jazz drummer/ appliance salesman in his father's store Guy Paterson (Tom Everett Scott) is asked by his friend Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) to join his group because his current drummer broke his arm.The other two members of the band The ONE- DERS are an obnoxious guitar player Lenny (Steve Zahn) and a soon to be Marine base player. The group enters a local talent show as Guy suggests to his bandmates to quicken the pace in their tune. The result; a hit song is born. They win first prize, a gig at a restaurant. At the venue the One-Ders sell their records as a local talent scout takes notice Phil Horace (Chris Ellis). Phil takes that song and puts it on the radio as the group hires him as their manager. Phil books the boys for a Rock & Roll show in Pittsburgh. Phil introduces the group to Mr. White (Tom Hanks) Playtone Records representative and takes over as their new manager. The boys join a cross country tour with the Playtone cavalcade of stars doing mostly State fairs. I was totally blown away with the endless creativity of the fictitious Artists and their music. Besides our main attraction the One-ders, you have this suave debonair Freddy Fredrickson (Robert Torti) singing Mr. Downtown and the lovely vocalist Diane Dane (Chaille Percival). Fifteen original songs were written for this rock and roll fairy tale. Four of the fifteen songs were written by our jack of all trades Tom Hanks who did it all among-st the ranks of Orson Wells, Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen as a five toll producers of films, .The Playtone troupe travels westward state by state. In Ohio the Boys now re-spelled the WONDERS are dressed in red jackets to match the Buckeye colors and in Indiana beige wheat colored blazers are the norm. Wisconsin the Yellow jackets are worn to resemble cheese as Mr. White give his repetitive complimentary remark, ""Did I tell you you guys look great in Green!"" As the tour progresses Their song rises on the top 40 which Mr. White suggests they get off the tour and head out to Hollywood to bigger things. A cameo in a Beach Movie and radio interview conducted by Clint Howard. Meanwhile there's trouble in paradise as the boys have first class accommodations at luxury hotel with know it all doorman attentive Lamarr (Obba Babatunde) giving advice when needed. Jimmy clashes with Mr. White about writing his own songs while the bass player wanders off to Disney never to return. Guy ends up at a jazz club to meet his Idle Jazz artist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs) who gives him advise telling Guy to save his money and look out for fast women.Del goes on about the industry and it's pitfalls. Silly Lenny plays cards with some locals and falls for a pretty receptionist. The first of many. Things unravel further as Faye (Liv Tyler) Jimmy's girlfriend who's relationship has been one sided on Faye's part realizes that her beau is self absorbed in his music and has no intentions of Marriage. So many cameo appearances by familiars in the industry. Charlize Theron as Tina, Kevin Pollock as the Pittsburgh MC , old friend from the TV show Bosom Buddies Peter Scolari as the Host of the Hollywood Showcase and Alex Rocco as Sol Siler the pastrami eating Playtone CEO. So ingenious. The movie shows how fragile holding on to success can be in the entertainment industry. Can't wait for the next one hit Wonder!",That Thing You Do!
48,departed07,Classic movie with classic songs,10,10 April 2008,"""That Thing You Do!"" represents any music band's dream of having a successful career along with a song to take them to fame and rising to downfalls at the same time. The film is about a drummer name Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) who works at his father's appliance store while his friends are out there having a good time in a rock band with no title to call themselves. Guy is needed for his gift after the band's drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) breaks his arm where they perform their song ""That Thing You Do!"" at a local high school gymnasium and become an instant hit. The band members include Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech), the lead vocals and lead guitarist, Lenny (the hilarious Steve Zahn), the second guitarists and vocals who happens to be the comic relief and smart-ass of the group, and T.B. Player (The Bass Player, played by Ethan Embry) where they have a groupie, Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (The lovely Liv Tyler). After being a success by singing their famous song through various places including a pizza parlor, the new band who call themselves The Wonders, find a manager where they go through a cheap gig before the big guns comes to the boys.Mr. White (played by Tom Hanks) replaces their formal manager and heads the band into a tour with other famous singers. From there the band gets to find out the ups and downs of being in a band where members decided to leave, girls get in the way along with some of them from home break up with them (ex. Guy's girlfriend leaves him for the dentist) and nobody wants to follow the rules.The film was directed by Tom Hanks where not only does he show what goes on in a band, but brings back the atmosphere of the 1960's where it feels like I'm watching a document about the American version of The Beatles. Plus, the soundtrack itself is hot! I'd still play the songs from the fictional band on my CD player, thinking to myself that they're only pretend and not real. Yet, the songs are a classic just like this movie. Now go put on some shades and watch this movie.",That Thing You Do!
49,SKG-2,Light but charming film,8,21 October 1999,"Overall, I have to say I enjoyed Hanks' feature directing debut(this is not, by the way, the first time he sat in the director's chair; he directed a segment of a Showtime film noir series; I think it was called CITY OF ANGELS).  He did a convincing job not only recreating the time, but also the music, which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead; Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet, but as this film shows, he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always, Hanks does well playing a company man, and Liv Tyler is quite luminous(though I could have done without the ""thousand kisses"" speech; that was melodramatic).  On the down side, I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech, but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still, this was overall an enjoyable movie.",That Thing You Do!

Having been born in '62, my implanted memories are antedoctal at best only having individual discoveries through the blue and red best of albums.We start off fast with a quick change of tempo from our drummer and ""The Oneders"" are off to the world of one-hit wonders! It's the expected arc of a band story, so not much there, but the little vignettes of each next stage launch reminds you of director Tom Hanks previous movie Apollo 13, launching into space, they great unknown.The higher end of teh music world was so closely tied to TV and film that, now, ""The Wonders"" made it to West Coast and all its fun in the sun Hollywood charade. All teh while our band mates solidify their stance in what they are after. Our talented songwriter/guitarist, Jimmy, is clamoring for artistic merit, Our other guitarist/clown, Lenny, is there for the party, our bassist is constantly sidetracked by his military ambitions, while our obvious hero from teh start, drummer/jazz enthusiast and older member Guy, is trying to make the most of it all while remaining positive while it slowly begins to fall apart. Once we understand the importance of Jimmys' tag along girlfriend Faye, its obvious that the movie has as much to do about the love of their music and what they all bring as a five person unit, as it does about the story line in itself.Tom Everett Scotts' Guy exudes the young directors charm and resemblance and the serious Johnothan Schaech brings to Jimmy are equally important. It may have been Fountain Of Waynes' Adam Schellengers' song (title track) but you wouldn't think twice about that until reading the trivia section of IMBD. Liv Tylers' Faye is more band glue that girlfriend/fan and their last band manager Mr White (Hanks) knows it. At least enough to put the whisper in the ear to set up our ending.",That Thing You Do!

I gave it an 8 out of 10 because I felt there were scenes that were forced. (I won't say since I don't want to include any spoilers. But I can say that I saw three scenes that seemed forced.)Tom Hanks shows up in a non-major role and does a splendid job of staying out of the way. I was really into the movie until he showed up. He played it level and remained there. It was cool. So I was able to sit back and forget he was TOM HANKS! - American FILM LEGEND!... *sigh*.

Tom Hanks made the movie work with taking us through a U.S. for of the Beatles (minus the break up of The Wonders). the movie was a good watch and makes you laugh at some scenes and almost cry at others (actually not really but you feel pretty bad). The movie even holds some aspects of what the Beatles went through: their first single 'Please Please Me"" was originally a ballet but sped up by Ringo Starr=Guy speeding up That Thing You Do!).

53,Scars_Remain,Hilarious and Perfect for All Ages,9,12 October 2008,"My family and I used to watch this movie all the time while I was growing up so I may be a little biased here. Even so, I think it's one of the best comedies ever and I quote the lines very often. It really is great to revisit this film and remember when I was a little kid sitting on the couch watching it with my family. I was able to revisit it this weekend.I really feel that all of the characters are very well thought out, essential parts of any band and very well portrayed by all of the actors. Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn and Ethan Embry are all great. The story itself is the best part of this film and really says a lot about being in a band. ""Ain't no way to keep a band together, bands come and go. You gotta keep on playin', no matter with who."" This movie is great. I recommend it for the whole family and definitely if you are or have been in a band. You'll love it!",That Thing You Do!
54,dimplet,"Bravo, Tom Hanks!",7,20 April 2011,"This movie doesn't so much have a plot as a trajectory. Nevertheless, it is better to see it yourself than to know where it is going. Suffice it to say that it is about a rock band, and how its members, friends and family respond to its success. As such, it is in the slice-of-life genre. Given its nearly 2 and a half hour length on the directors cut that I saw, and recommend, it works remarkably well. After awhile, I wondered if something would happen, some disaster or twist of fate, some bad guy to thicken the plot, and noticed the movie was rather long. But I wasn't bored at all, and was enjoying seeing the story unfold. In the end, the length was just right. Also, I am not a rock fan, so I was a bit skeptical. It didn't matter. In the wrong hands, this could have turned into Partridge Family cornball. But it is solid. To all this, Tom Hanks deserves the credit as writer, director, and low- key star, who appears late in the movie. It's a first class job. Not an earth shaking masterpiece, but a well-crafted, thoroughly enjoyable movie. I am a stickler for anachronisms in movies like this. This is a period piece set in Erie, Pennsylvania, circa 1964. The Sixties was a fluid time, where the culture changed every two years; 1964 was different from 1960, 1962, 1966 and 1968. The fact that one of the band members enlists in the Marines, without any mention of Vietnam, is a good measure of the mood and innocence of 1964, versus 1966, when the war had become politicized. America was at its best around this time, and it was all downhill from there. The movie captured the spirit of this window of time. Tom Hanks was 8 at the time, so he could not rely solely on memory, and must have done some historical research to fully understand the period. Whoever was in charge of props did a fantastic job of assembling lots of appliances, radios, recording gear and lots of cars. This is a movie that got it right. I loved when Skitch handed out pocket transistor radios to everyone in the band - back then an AM radio would have cost about $10 to $15, very expensive at the time, about $50 or more in today's dollars. The only anachronism I found was when Skitch tells a customer the appliance is available in avocado. Avocado was a notoriously common kitchen appliance color in the 1970s; I see it was introduced by GE in 1966, but became a tidal wave around 1968-1970. It was one of those fashion things, a late Dating Game chic, when all of a sudden everything was avocado green (or harvest gold), color coordinated so people could have an entire kitchen of avocado, lucky you!. And then avocado, predictably, disappeared. I found a post, ""The Death of Avocado"" that observed it was a mistake to put a trendy color on a long-life appliance, which looked obnoxious after coordinating avocado room decor disappeared. No kidding. I was just a kid at the time, but I could see that coming. See how sensitive the cultural timeline is for the Sixties? Actually, I would say what most people think of as the Sixties began around 1963-64, with the Beatles and the period of this film, and lasted till Nixon's resignation in 1974 (although some place the beginning of change at 1959). After that, the years unfolded in a homogeneous miasma, distinguished mainly by the gradual introduction of new technology, like the VCR, the Walkman and cordless phone sizes.That an appliance color was the only missed stitch in the movie indicates just how good it was!The acting all round was excellent. There were no caricatures, even with the doorman at the LA hotel, who had some real depth to his role. And, although I read here there were pro musicians actually dubbing the music, the actors were totally convincing that they were the ones making the music. ""That Thing You Do"" fits most closely the mold of ""Breaking Away,"" which also featured a cast of talented young actors, and a skeptical, practical father representing the secure, dull path. Both are about life, dreams and fallibility. They both offer a lesson for young people. And in both, in the end, they turn a corner and life goes on. This is an enjoyable, memorable and thoughtful film.",That Thing You Do!
55,HelloTexas11,1964 once more,7,4 February 2008,"Tom Hanks' writing and directorial debut, 'That Thing You Do!', will probably not go down in history as a classic along the lines of 'Forrest Gump' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' but I find it one of those movies I love to revisit every six months or so. It has an easy-going charm about it, low-key and yet wonderfully evocative of the period it presents, that magical year of 1964, after the Beatles had arrived and changed music forever, and every teenage kid wanted to start his own rock band. 'That Thing You Do!' was a modest success at the box-office, and the critics were generally kind to Hanks' first try at directing. Just below the surface, though, one could tell people were surprised and in some cases disappointed that his initial effort wasn't somehow more substantial, or biting, or something. I take it these people were someplace else in 1964. In the film, Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech) is the one who starts the band, the one with big dreams and a fair amount of talent. The other three band members are pretty much along for the ride, wherever it leads them, and if it doesn't lead anywhere, that's okay... they weren't doing anything anyway. Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the goofy lead guitarist; there's the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) who's even goofier (listed in the credits as T.B. Player; clever how they go through the whole movie without calling him by name); and the drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott), who is a last-minute replacement for their regular drummer after he falls off a parking meter and breaks his arm. Guy is in his own way just as much a music buff as Jimmy, but his love is jazz. He doesn't much care for the pop/rock the group (newly dubbed the Oneders, hopefully pronounced Wonders) but he enjoys their taste of success and playing for the enthusiastic crowds that grow larger as the film progresses. Guy's not the leader or control freak that Jimmy is; he emerges though as the heart of the band and is, ironically, the last one left standing at the end of it all. Also along for the ride is Faye (Liv Tyler), Jimmy's girlfriend and the Oneders' number one fan. In an early role, Charlize Theron plays Tina, Guy's girlfriend (if only briefly). If only her part was as memorable as her looks. The band makes a record of Jimmy's song 'That Thing You Do!', and after it gets some radio play in their hometown, they are noticed by Mr. White (Tom Hanks), an exec at Playtone Records who becomes their manager. One of his first decisions is to change the name of the band to the Wonders. People kept calling them ""the Oh-need-ers"" and it was getting confusing. From there, the film takes us on a predictable but very enjoyable ride as the song climbs the charts and the Wonders grow in popularity, playing to larger and larger crowds, finally culminating in them appearing on a big network variety show. The song, by the way, is a great little tune, very Beatle-ish, and almost criminally catchy. I don't know how many times it's played in the film, in part or in whole (I would guess about a dozen) and it changes subtly over the course of the movie, bits added for extended versions... in any event, it will be buzzing around in your head for at least a week or so after seeing the film. In what has in reality been the case more times than most people realize, the Wonders break up just as 'That Thing You Do!' peaks at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jimmy quits in a fit of pique, his artistic vanity wounded when White tells him he only gets to write two songs per album. Lenny marries a blonde secretary in Las Vegas. The bass player joins the Marines. That leaves Guy to face Mr. White alone, who tells him the Wonders are in breach of contract, but it's no big deal. Happens all the time, White says... to one-hit wonders.",That Thing You Do!

This is the first time I've seen this film and I wished I would have seen it earlier. I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me, but I sat down earlier this morning and watched it. Following the band was easy throughout the film and the heartache everyone faces in their respective careers tugged a little bit at my heartstrings.Hands down, one of the better movies in 1996, a time when I was trying to pick myself up and dust myself off, and a time when I should have taken the time to sit down and actually watch this film, instead of waiting almost thirteen years.Oh, and about my opening summary, the one thing that could have made this movie a little better for people just as old as me or a little older would have been a scene where the ""Bosom Buddies"" co-stars, writer Hanks and Peter Scolari, could have appeared together.

I also think the set production team nailed every detail of the era, it made the movie feel very authentic. and that's what this is- its a story that may not be true per say, but it is soo real and authentic to rock and roll/music industry in the early 60s.

I kinda don't think this movie works on all levels. The rising action is literally an hour and a half. For an hour and a half i kept wondering what was going to happen...

He certainly seems like it when he's interviewed, and since he wrote and directed this movie, and it's really nice, too, that seems to be more evidence.This is a very small movie. It has no pretensions, but just tells a simple story about a small-town band that makes good. It paints a nostalgic picture of the 60's -- I grew up in a small town during that time, and life wasn't so idyllic in my town -- but it isn't trying for gritty realism. The cast is attractive and more than adequate (some are quite good, including Hanks as the band's manager), and the story is observant enough to be an enjoyable confection.

As he pushes her away, she drifts more towards the band's drummer, who seems to be the most caring of the group.The movie has an amazing scene where the drummer goes to a ""jazz"" club and meets his all time idol, who turns out to be a regular guy and not the prima donna that the Wonders' lead singer is.Though the groups and the songs were made for the movie, they all sound like they could have been made in the 60's and would have been definite hits!

62,Criticalstaff,A pre-biopic that lacks oomph!,5,22 December 2020,"Before it became the internet's favourite slur, Baby-Boomer used to describe that generation born after the Second World War. This movie is not that generation's movie, that would be American Graffiti, but it is nonetheless a love-letter to the Boomer culture. This movie did not really do it for me, but if you were alive in the 1950s then you will totally get it.It make sense that Tom Hanks wrote and directed it. He is the most emblematic actor of his generation, especially after Forrest Gump, which was also a celebration of events that Baby-Boomers lived through. This movie is characteristically Hanksian, that is to say it is not offensive in any way. It is rather wholesome in the sense that nothing bad happens. It is the story of kids making music, they are successful for a while and then they are not anymore. Which in itself is somewhat Boomer: the band is at the pinnacle, they have everything they could ever want, and then they just throw it all away. Which is a nonissue! A generation that lived in times of unrivalled prosperity and does not even know how good they had it.Of course, the movie does this unintentionally. There is an absence of tension in this film. There is an attempt at drama, but the characters are not likeable enough. Except for Tom Hanks' avatar Guy, none of these kids are cool or charming. For me they felt spoilt and whiny. Guy on the other hand is too detached to have conflicts with anyone. It leads to the band having issues that you don't really care about either because they're ludicrous or because there are no real consequences. When Tom Hanks' character is introduced, you hope that the movie will finally take off, but it stays relatively low to the ground. The movie needed more of the annoyed manager that cannot keep up with the antics of his stars, but even the issues Mr.White encounters, like Guy going on a (mild) bender, are easily resolved.The movie compensates by being accurate on the sets and wardrobe, on the whole look and feel of the 60s. The music itself is cute and a lovely homage to that 60s naive pop-rock. Yet, while being completely aware of the shallowness of it, there is also a deference to jazz and in the soothing power of music in general. It is also on point when it goes on the description of the music industry, and it interesting to see behind the scenes of that hit-churning machine. In other words, it works better as a period piece of 60s America than as a tale of rise and fall.Yet, there is something remarkable with this movie given how much biopics have changed since Walk the Line and Ray. Nowadays these films follow a very repetitive formula, which while enthralling is also less and less effective. This at least is unique and sincere enough that it does not feel cliché and predictable.",That Thing You Do!
63,Rumples,I don't want to gush but...,8,10 January 1999,"This is really a great movie, no question. I rarely watch a film that is so skilfully crafted and yet is completely inoffensive to any segment of society. The movie combines comedy (and some parts are definitely funny) with romance in a tender-hearted tale of friendship and growing up. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough except to say that this is a film I could watch multiple times. Brilliantly acted by a still maturing cast ensemble, witty dialogue, it's got it all. If you want to see something that with touch you and give you a buzz but you don't want to be assailed by profanity, violence, or sexuality - That Thing You Do! is the movie for you. Another Hanks triumph, not just for his role in the movie but for putting it all together.  8/10",That Thing You Do!
64,crowrobot,This is a pretty good movie,10,17 June 2004,"Tom Hanks makes an impressive writing-and-directorial debut with 'That Thing You Do!', a musical comedy/drama set in the 60's about a one-hit wonder band called, appropriately, The Wonders. Tom Hanks is also in the movie, as Mr. White, the manager of the band. Overall, this is light-hearted, peppy, upbeat, and humorous. Hanks does here what he does best: comedy/drama. Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson, makes a small cameo in the film. The acting is solid, the title song is great, and the script is good. Tom Everett Scott plays the main character, Guy Patterson, the drummer of the band. Liv Tyler, pre-Lord of the Rings, is also good here. And Steve Zahn is very good at being a dummy. Overall, this is a good movie.",That Thing You Do!
65,Genkinchan,Liv Tyler is wonderful,7,30 September 2021,I watched the extended cut just recently.. and I fairly enjoyed the movie as the movie played out I had already knew the plot and how it will eventually end with the band breaking up and Guy getting Faye at the endThe song that thing you do played almost 90 percent of the movie making it from good slowly became annoyingThe only thing that is redeemable is Watching Liv Tyler which is the heart and soul of the movie.,That Thing You Do!

67,SwingBatta,"""That Thing"" is wonderfully done with irresistible style and substance",9,5 February 2002,"That Thing You Do! (1996): There are so many great things about this film that it's impossible to single out just one. The script, the acting, the characters...to paraphrase that old car commercial, who could ask for anything more? Oh, and throw in some pretty darn addictive music to boot. Add everything together, stir well and the result is a terrific directorial debut for Tom Hanks. ""That Thing You Do!"" tells the tale of a (fictitious) band, The Wonders, who literally become an overnight sensation after winning a talent competition and soon find themselves experiencing the highs  not to mention the lows  of becoming rock stars. The band members  Guy (Tom Everett Scott), Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech), Lenny (Steve Zahn), and the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) are perfectly cast, as are supporting characters such as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler), Guy's brusque father (Holmes Osborne), mattress tycoon Boss Vic Koss (Kevin Pollak), down-on-his-luck drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi), jazz great Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), with the best being Lamarr the hotel doorman (Obba Babatunde). Despite Hanks' considerably large amount of screen time as the band's manager, his role is restrained enough so as not to overshadow the film's young players. The acting is superbly enhanced by the terrific script; the dialogue is razor-sharp and at times very humorous, with the funniest moments involving the conception of the band's name (spelled ""The One-ders"" early on as a gag on the Beatles, it's constantly mispronounced as ""The O-neders"" before finally being changed to the literal spelling). Nothing ever resorts to condescension, explicit language or sensuality, or forced comedy. You can't help but share in the Wonders' ecstasy when they hear their single on the radio for the first time. The title song never gets boring even though it's played a grand total of 11 times (yet only twice in its entirety). The production design is outstanding, especially Guy's father's appliance store (where did they find all those gadgets?). TTYD is recommended viewing for any budding rock band, or simply for those who want to travel back to a time when music wasn't polluted with countless no-talent, assembly-line boy bands, misogynist rappers, and the like. Finally, we have a feel-good movie that actually lives up to that otherwise overused title. 9/10",That Thing You Do!
68,simplysoda_19f,We need the O-needers,10,2 August 2006,"The O-Needers rock my world. LOL, OK so it's the One-ders, I get it now. OK, this movie takes place in the 1960s, when a lot of young guys started to create rock bands, i.e. Jim Morrison and John Fogerty. Unfortuneatly unlike Morrison and Fogerty the One-ders only had a one-hit song. That doesn't really matter though does it, because the song is really great, it was actually written by Tom Hanks, and it's played by the 4 gentlemen in the band. The song is called, ""That Thing You Do"", hence the movies title, and it's a really great song, nicely recorded and it's a catchy tune.OK, so 4 guys get together in there garage and write this song, and they at a talent show and decide to start a record, which turns out to be a mega-hit, so they get a manager who gets them a couple gigs, and eventually Tom Hanks comes along and discovers that he can do more for the band than there previous manager, which he eventually does. However like all great bands from the 60s they have their rise and unfortunate fall. This movie explores that, and it does so in a great story.I gave this movie 10 out of a possible 10, because it's a great movie, filled with great characters, a terrific story and a catchy soundtrack. It's got tons of lines mostly that come from Zahn. If your like me and you love rock and roll bands, this is a great story, I love it, it's one of my favourites!",That Thing You Do!
69,goleafs84,Enjoyable Movie,8,9 September 2003,"This was a very enjoyable movie that I can watch over and over again.Tom Hanks did a wonderful job writing and directing this movie.  I liked how he cast a bunch of unknown and semi-star actors at the time, with the exception of Liv Tyler and Chris Isaak.  Obviously, he made some good choices as most have moved on to bigger and better things.This was a wonderful story of a local ""garage band"" go from being unknown and rise to the top.  I liked how you heard ""That Thing You Do"" evolve from a slow ballad, to a raw song with lots of potential, to the smash hit rock song that it became.  Another thing I liked was, there wasn't a lot of ""name dropping"" in the movie, in terms of other bands, artists, etc, with the exception of Virgil ""Gus"" Grissolm and Gina Lollobrigda.  It would've been easy to do so, but it wasn't done and the writing was good in the sense that they seemed believable.A few bits of trivia from this movie:  Some things you already know and some maybe you don't.-The bass player (Ethan Embry) was never given a name.  In the movie, he's referred as ""the bass player"" and in the end credits his name is T.B. Player.-Tom Hanks' wife and 2 of his kids appear in this movie.  Rita Wilson played Marguerite, the cocktail waitress in the jazz club, his son Colin was the page who escorted Liv Tyler when the Wonders appeared on the Hollywood Showcase and his daughter Elizabeth was the bored girl in the dress shop. 
-Is it a coincedence that 2 of the main characters in this movie, Lenny Haise and Jimmy Mattingly, had the same last names as Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly from Tom Hanks' previous movie ""Apollo 13""?-The record label in this movie, ""Play Tone"" records and the logo is the name of Tom Hanks' production company.",That Thing You Do!
70,shrine-2,Hanks pulls out all the stops!,10,18 January 2000,"Tom Hanks pulled out all the creative stops to put his picture ""That Thing You Do"" together, and it shows--magnificently.  Audiences could confuse a movie with lightness of tone as unsubstantial, but serious subjects and heavyhandedness are not prerequisites for greatness. It's quite possible for a movie to be light and airy, or frivolous and charming, and still make a grand impression.  I won't stretch my point by saying ""That Thing You Do"" is a great movie, but it's the kind of work that pools all the pleasures of moviegoing:  laughs, music, dreams of material success, passion, romance--and serves them up in generous measure. And finally, a role that allows Hanks to reveal the sharper, more creative, less lovable side of himself, that is to say, an adult--with ambition and focus and drive, a distant cousin of Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco.  Hanks takes on twin roles: publicity agent grooming a talented fledgling rock'n'roll band for stardom; and writer/director behind the camera orchestrating all the myriad ingredients that make this movie a rousing success.  He shows a sophisticated way with a wisecrack, and an equally mature facility for storytelling.And hats off to Hanks for the cast he assembles! As Lenny Haise, the lead guitarist of the band, Steve Zahn could not have not have made me laugh any harder.  Mr. White may think him a fool, but Zahn's Lenny takes his place among the best of fools; Shakespeare's Falstaff or Mozart's Papageno have nothing on him.  He's the restless mover of the narrative.  Without Lenny's impulsiveness, the band would not have made the leaps and bounds it did in so short a time, and every quick step of the way Zahn makes of it heady fun.The tomfoolery doesn't stop with Lenny.  Tom Everett Scott in the lead is forced into a kind of princely strait-jacket, but the actors on the sidelines like Holmes Osborne and Claudia Stedelin as Scott's parents; Kevin Pollak as Boss Vic Kosslovich, a two-bit impresario from Pittsburgh; and Alex Rocco as the blissfully crass Sol Siler leave us smiling long after the story has left them behind.  (When Rocco spits out something like ""And will someone get Fabian away from me?,"" I almost fell off the couch, doubled over with laughter.)  Sort through this movie, and you'll find a gift at every turn.  It chimes in a variety of music styles, the best pop offerings coming from Adam Schlesinger (who wrote the title song), Scott Rogness, and Rick Elias with a good deal of the filler music being Hanks' collaborations.  It showcases some dazzling musical numbers--""Dance With Me Tonight"" is the centerpiece.  It sends us visions of Liv Tyler, Charlize Theron, Rita Wilson, and Kennya J. Ramsey to mull over.  And it conjures up a time when America was still at peace with itself.  Need we ask for anything more?",That Thing You Do!
71,Phillim212,thin,4,12 August 2021,"Exactly the kind of movie one would expect Tom Hanks to make: if Fonzie and Richie, Ralph and Potzie formed a garage band and got lucky. All set up pleasantly enough, but about 45 minutes in one begins to wonder, ""Is something gonna happen soon? Is this all this writer/director sees when he looks at life?"" Nope, nothing happens of substance, certainly not between any of the characters. Just a glibness that mirrors the actor/director/writer's trademark glibness. And blandness. Mr. Hanks has little time for detail -- except he did make the choice to cast as the lead a guy looking very much like a young Tom Hanks. This is all not to say there are not good performances from some of the good actors assembled -- Liv Tyler's personal work is a revelation, for example. It is the writing and directing at fault: this movie covers familiar ground, already done effectively in THE IDOLMAKER etc., but without any apparent deep personal connection. Hanks has cast himself in the Ray Sharkey manipulative manager role, and just has not got the depth -- but the shallow, derivative, woefully underwritten script doesn't help . . .",That Thing You Do!

Love the small visual nods to ""A Hard Day's Night"" with the boys running through the simulation of the states. Also the hint of the same thing that happened to Lennon with the 'he's engaged' posting on the monitor. Of course, Lennon was actually engaged, if not already married!I truly don't get tired of this film. Just a feel-good movie. Also liked everything I read about how Hanks insisted that the actors learn to play their instruments well enough to look good in the film. Some of them practiced several hours a day.It's fun to see his wife pop in as a waitress where there's good jazz. Such a seemingly fun woman - but what else would you expect from Tom Hanks' wife?

And why not, the all-American story of a 60's garage band ""success""! As a '64 HS grad (please don't do the math!), I enjoyed the story, music and performances. And thank God they came up with a catchy title tune (you hear it in total or bits about 15 times) as it never seems to get old.Infectious performances by a budding cast of near miss and future stars, the setting, music, locations, Play-tunes tours, network TV shows and the inevitable band break-up all ring true. The amazing thing to me is that given Tom Hanks' success, his appearance in the film (as well as writer/director hats), its up and coming cast and reasonable studio push, the movie wasn't a big box office success. Oh well, I never missed it when I passed it on the cable dial, now have it DVR'd when I need a boost, and recommend it to fans of all involved. It will not disappoint!!",That Thing You Do!
76,Bowserb46,And now there's a 'director's cut'?,9,15 December 2008,"I've been seeing this movie on cable for several years...all the way through a couple times, but pieces many times. It seems like I can't pass it up when I'm flipping channels. And it happened again today, but to my surprise, it was a different, longer movie. I don't recall the original running time, but today's version must be 30 minutes or so longer than the one I've been seeing for years. At 2:35, it should have been too long, but it didn't seem like it.Lots of times the director's cut is just a reattachment of footage from the cutting room floor, and sometimes it is footage that should have been left there. I can think of a few exceptions: Jacob's Ladder is one. Aliens is another. And as it turns out, That Thing You Do is still another. The extra scenes, which were cleverly edited out of the short version, add a great deal to the story. They help to fill out the characters and explain attitudes.Some of the add-backs were no more than a few seconds, but those few seconds--like the cut to the ""cootie"" DJ playing the record after hearing it live--were like the end of a sentence. They made the first part make sense. Others, like the group nervous and suspicious about their new manager not coming through with with air play of their record, are doubtless part of the garage band routine. And more screen time for Liv Tyler can only be good.All in all, I have to say the re-edit made it a better movie, at least for me.",That Thing You Do!
77,fierypoeticgirl,Great Movie...BUT....,10,4 November 2007,"Everyone in the cast did an excellent job, but really, Tom, you could not have been more insensitive to Ethan Embrey. The poor actor was not even given a name. You wrote this, and you kept referring to him as ""the bass player."" If you want to know who really sparkled in this movie with fantastic facial expressions and personality, it was Ethan. Tom Hanks may be a genius, but thank God he's not a doctor; his bedside manners would be awful. :) Have more compassion next time, Mr. Hanks. Besides, his character was a fun-loving guy who had a passion for being in the Army. It is odd that they mentioned the bass player's name who replaced Ethan in the movie, so what was the point, Tom? Oh, and by the way, I know why you selected the actor you did to portray ""Guy."" He has mannerisms like you and facial expressions too. You trained him well. So, tell us, why mention all the band members' names in the movie, and once... instead of saying Ethan's character's name, you said Faye? I wish you read these comments. You just might learn a thing or two. Anyway, loved the movie. The tunes reminded me of what the Beatles would write. Plus, did you HAVE to have the camera man when the band was live on television focus on ""Wolfman,"" and then you have someone say...""too scary?"" What is that all about? He is no more scary than Mick Jaggar!! But, let's face another fact; Mr. Hanks has always been typecast, so maybe this showed a more ruthless side to one of his many characters. After all, only Tom Hanks is arrogant enough to think he can pull off a movie like ""Castaway.""",That Thing You Do!

The actor that played the drummer for The Wonders was awesome! He actually knew how to play. This movie was fun. Tom Hanks at his best, (Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, BIG.) Great fun. I loved the theme song so much, I got on Itunes and downloaded New Found Glory's version of the theme song, That Thing You Do! It's an awesome song, and movie. See this, if you just want to have fun. The acting was wonderful, the lead singer I thought, looked a bit like the lead singer for The All-American Rejects. The drummer kind of reminded me of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3 actor Tobey Maguire, physical resemblance.

If we keep accepting filth and garbage in everything we watch, then what does that say we have become. Why is it old fashioned to like a movie that is not just good-it is great. If your the cynical type-then don't watch it. You are too far gone to be of any use for yourself, much less humanity. I enjoyed this film about some guys and a girl getting together and recording a hit record in the 1960's. I enjoyed seeing such a story because, despite the fact that I like action flicks, risque comedies and the like.

It's a simple and quite light story, but it loses nothing for being that. The music is fun, the acting is pretty good ... and Liv is, as always, fabulous. The story-line could be typical of the experiences of bands back in the 60s and, although they turned out to be the one-shot-Wonders, the music is most evocative of the times. I was 15 in the year that this story is set and was listening to The Stones, The Beatles, Creedance, Cream, Dave Clark et al. If TTYD had been released back then, I'd have been listening to the Wonders too.22 August 2016 - Flash: Turns out that I am, after all, a total sucker for this movie. ""Feelgood"" is exactly what it is. I'm in the middle of watching it ... yet again. I'm still in love with Liv Tyler and, if I was so inclined, I'd be in love with Tom Everett Scott too.

""That thing you do!"" is a great movie that has feeling and doesn't drag on. The fact that there are not to many known actors in this movie actually makes it more enjoyable because the viewer can concentrate more in the actual plot and everything that's going on rather than a specific acting performance. The soundtrack is one of the best cinematic elements in the movie and it really is one of the most enjoyable soundtracks I have heard so far. The acting is by all actors is just great and the chemistry is just right. Also the audience experiences again how many feelings and emotions Tom Hanks can portray with his face alone.

Without hauling in a lot of deep meanings, it remembers with great warmth a time and a place.'
Well said, Roger. But I would add that Hanks has assembled a perfect cast. All the stars shine brightly, but it would be a travesty to not single out the supernova of a performance by Liv Tyler. Although she is low-key for much of the film, there are at least two of her scenes which are truly amazing. In one of them she displays more pure unbridled joy than I can ever recall seeing in a movie. The other scene is very subtle and moving. What would otherwise be a solid 7.0 rating for this movie, in my book gets bumped up to a strong 8.0 because of her performance.",That Thing You Do!

Or if you are just tired of depressing films with heavy messages, this light little story is a very welcome break.The film is well done, and considering it is Tom Hanks' first directing effort, he shows great promise.

It's not a blockbuster-kind of movie, it's not an action movie, not a commedy, not a drama. It has a lot of nice tunes, but it's not a musical comedy.Hanks is not trying to shock the audience, nothing in this movie is forced upon.

Steve Zahn is well used here as the off the wall, Lenny.  Hanks is understated as Mr. White, but I think this enhances his dark-ish, calculating character.  A fair representation of the recording industry.The movie is nearly ruined by Liv Tyler, over acting as usual.  She's a drain to watch as always, killing the pace of the movie, and not in sync with the rest of the cast.Bill Cobb as Del Paxton, is a delight, as is Tom Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson as waitress in Marguerite.

Trouble is, the character is about 60 (that's the age of the actor who played him at the time the movie was made, anyway).That means he would have been born around 1905. He would have been active during the ""Roaring 20s,"" and during the ""Swing"" era. I doubt that he would have made a transition to ""bebop"" by that time.

I wish it had all been left in. Even in the theatrical preview, there is a scene where Lenny and his gal pal are eating spaghetti together and that is nowhere to be found in the movie. Also, why doesn't T. B. Player have a name? The music is awesome, and Mr. Hanks couldn't have chosen better people to play the parts. WAY TO GO ON THIS ONE!!!",That Thing You Do!

This movie will probably never win any awards for acting or depth of subject, but it is a joy to watch. It is also a wonderfully clean movie to show teenagers. The story is simple, but looks realistically at relationships, show business and different types of people. I commend Tom Hanks for producing this movie and encourage him to do more!",That Thing You Do!
95,WinterbornTM,Fun Relaxing Movie,8,3 October 2015,"That Thing You Do! is the first motion picture directed by Tom Hanks (who also stars in the movie) and tells the story of the band The Wonders, who during the 60's had a one-hit wonder single, That Thing You Do!The story follows four friends from Erie, Pennsylvania who form a rock'n'roll band together called ""The Oneders"", who are later known as the ""The Wonders"". We follow along as they rise to success, promoting their new single all over the country and achieve national fame. As a director, Tom Hanks captures perfectly the style of the 60's and you're instantly transported back in that world. The clothes, the cars, the people, everything looks great to the last detail.The main character, Guy Patterson, is the drummer of the band and it's eerie (no pun intended) how much he channels a young Tom Hanks. In fact, at first, Hanks didn't even want him in the movie because he felt he looked too much like him, but his wife convinced him otherwise. The rest of the supporting cast includes Liv Tyler, as the girlfriend of the band's lead singer, Steve Zahn as the guitar player and Tom Hanks as the band's manager, Mr. White.This is a nice feel-good movie, perfect for a Sunday evening when you just feel like lying on the couch and enjoy a great movie. It doesn't stand out with too much, it's short and sweet. With this directorial debut, Hanks proves he's doing a great job as a director, shame he didn't more movies.",That Thing You Do!

It doesn't have a political slant and it doesn't make us angry or worried or self-righteous. It is simply a wonderful movie with a great soundtrack, and one of the few movies that is for everybody from 3 to 93.  I gained a lot of respect for Tom Hanks' diverse talents because of this movie.  All of the actors do well (watch for Charlize Theron in an early role as Spartacus's girlfriend) , and they have a cute script with which to work.

97,maxfabien,You had to live it to really appreciate it.,9,23 February 2001,"I find myself mesmerized by this film.  I identify with its characters because either I had friends who had similar situations (playing in a local rock band, trying to make good), or I myself went through some of the same ""growing pains"" of adolescence, such as parental upset, and the joy and sorrow of a first love.The songs (especially the title tune) are catchy, yet simple, and at times annoying (due to overplay), but, hey, that's the way rock 'n' roll was at the beginning of the ""British invasion"".  At least they have a good beat and are easy to dance to!!Baby-boomers will appreciate how Tom Hanks catches the true flavor and feel of the era.  The young actors showed their capabilities by getting the personalities of their characters down just right. You'd think they actually lived through the early 60's themselves.  It's sort of an ""American Graffiti"" with a different set of teens.Watch for a cameo by Peter Scolari, who, on TV, was Hank's co-star in ""Bosom Buddies"".",That Thing You Do!

I do have a large humanities background.Overview:I gave this movie a 8 out of 10. That is pretty high for me and considering I generally go for your action-adventure science-fiction flick it says even more.I think I like the characters the best. Every single person in the movie has such a strong personality to them that it is like sitting at a bench at the mall and just watching people and having it being fun and interesting.I was able to relate to all of the characters at a very personal level which I enjoyed. The whole story ends up being about the kiss at the very end which is a bit much. You almost fell like you are one of the band going through what they are going through.I still haven't figured out what Tom Hanks character is up to the whole way through this movie. Is he scheming and just so jaded that he doesn't care that he didn't get what he wanted in the end? Are all of the minor characters in his employ seeing to it that the kiss happens? Or is this one of those kisses of destiny movies? They are seem to have premeditated plans to achieve something. Take it as you will...In summary, it is a fun, interesting story of people and the good and bad that goes with ordinary and un-ordinary lives.Thanks.",That Thing You Do!
100,mikey_editor,The essential American movie,10,23 June 2005,"This movie has it all. Coming of age. A few plot swerves. Great American music. Young people in the fullness of life. I highly recommend it. There are so many positives here. The newness of some of the actors mix so well with established ones. There are almost too many cameos (including Rita Wilson) to catch. And Hanks works in so many old friends plus the record company he created for the movie now actually exists to carry all the soundtracks for his subsequent works. I like the music, all of it, from the featured tracks to the subtracks to the background noise of the other performers. The chronology is very believable as are the sets. The recreated hotel in LA matches everything you'd dream up. The bit with the beach movie (more cameos) is hilarious. You'll watch it to see what you missed the first time. Truly America in an innocent age.",That Thing You Do!
101,Epaminondas,"Nice moral tale, full of youthful energy",7,4 January 2005,"This film, while obviously not a major work of art, is more than a Beatles biopic or a time piece for the mid-60's. Its sheer energy, the ease with which we can relate with the characters (even for those of us who have ever played in a band), the beauty of Liv Tyler and the natural flow of music bring it to a highly enjoyable level.Most of all, what makes it interesting is the quite subtle way it handles the themes of hope and disillusion: Guy's hopes for a session in a studio, Lenny's hopes of stardom, Faye's hopes of everlasting love. But as characters shake away their illusions, they are not left bitter or empty: on the contrary, this film shows that to work through this (and it is clearly a piece of work) enables them to build stronger and truer desires.Despite its agreeable lightness, this film can thus be seen as a moral fable going somewhat deeper than the classic 'from success to failure' story. The acting and reproduction of 60's sets are flawless throughout. And two moments of the film strike me as unforgettable, which is more than you can say for many movies:When the Oneders's tune goes on the radio for the first time, Hanks films first of all the bass player trying to adjust to the right channel, then Faye losing it as she hears it in the street as well. They both meet and go berserk with joy, running and shouting in an exhilarating - thanks to the youthful grace of Liv Tyler - moment, ending up in Guy's store where everybody just dances madly with joy. Rarely has a moment of accomplishment and sheer happiness been captured with such apparent spontaneity on film.Finally, Hanks delivers one of the most devastating lines I've heard, when he answers the egoistic lead singer after his breakup with Faye.Jimmy: I should have dumped you in Pittsburgh! Which one of you butts said we were engaged? Hanks: Same one who said you had class, Jimmy.That's what you get, and deserve, from 'dumping' Liv Tyler - poor move if I ever saw one!",That Thing You Do!
102,retroman2k4,That Moment You...,5,14 June 2020,"Smile with gritted teeth at your kids art project and have to pretend it's great, because you love them very much and you encouraged them to paint in the first place ....That's what this film is like, when you realise the legend Tom Hanks wrote and directed it. This was something he had been formulating in his mind during the promotion of Forest Gump. It would be fair to assume after all the great films he had starred in, Tom would know what it takes to make a great movie.... remember he wrote this after starring in the epic Forest Gump.Unfortunately this film is bland as beige paint. Nothing is really wrong with the way it looks or the acting, but nothing is right about this picture. It lacks any kind of spark or magic star dust that Hanks experiences regularly on set.How on earth could he think this film would be fascinating, exciting or even interesting? The plot is perfectly straight and narrow, with no twists or turns. It takes no risks or explores any off shoots ... it simply goes straight ahead without even glancing around for a single memorable moment.Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor, who stars in legendary films and yet for some reason wrote a mundane, uninspiring flick, that is so easy going, you could go to sleep for 45minutes, wake up and immediately pick the story back up.A college film would likely have more imagination than this waste of reel.Pointless",That Thing You Do!
103,jai-38,an oddball picture that hooks me every time,8,24 January 2007,"Tom Hanks put a lot into this smart and funny off-beat picture (it's almost the cinematic equivalent of his persona when you see him interviewed on Letterman -- maybe it's that personally felt) which depicts the-rise-and-that's-all history of a one hit wonder band in the just post- British invasion '60s. It's hip and square at the same time and that damn song, played again and again in pleasing variations, is exactly right. The casting of the band mates, notably Jonathan Schaech (a wannabe Lennon or Dylan), Steve Zahn (a Ringo kind of goof) and Tom Everret Scott, a young Hanks lookalike, who has artistic jazz-minded desires, make for an ensemble that is heartfelt, real and friendly-- oh, and Ethan Embry plays the bass player. Hanks himself gives one of his best, and most understated, performances as the band's big-time producer/Svengali and Liv Tyler is the lead singer's perfect girlfriend, Faye -- ""Well, Faye's special"", says Hanks himself at one point and we know, any one who's been around a rock'n'roll band knows, he's right. Light, airy, kind of weird -- all the terrific (as well as the terrifically awful music -- ""Lovin' You Lots and Lots"" by the Norm Wooster Singers) is original to the film -- ""That Thing..."", even as it falters a little in its final third, makes you happy to watch a movie that its players and its makers are more than giddy to present.",That Thing You Do!
104,TrueTenorOne,Marvelously entertaining!,10,13 June 2007,"Tom Hanks got his early start in television, entertaining audiences in the ""classic"" sitcom ""Bosom Buddies"". He then moved to the big screen, nabbing an Oscar nod for his role in ""Big"" and becoming only the 2nd actor in history to win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars for his roles in ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"". There are very few people who can succeed in acting on television, acting in movies, and making movies.I am glad to say that Tom Hanks is one of them.In his first attempt at directing a movie, Hanks brings us a flat-out fun story of a small rock group who climb the charts of success, only to fall flat just as quick as they rose. The movie has everything: the comedic timing of lines delivered by Steve Zahn and Hanks himself make us laugh without entirely turning the movie into a silly comedy. There are dramatic moments with Johnathon Schaech's character without turning the movie into a drama, and there is music galore without turning the movie into a musical. Everything is wonderfully balanced, not one element overpowers the other, and it comes across as an entertaining film.With a movie like this, certain elements need to be executed perfectly in order for it to work. When you make a movie that follows the experiences of a group of teenagers, you need to be able to like the characters. I don't know if you'll find a much more likable character than Guy Patterson, an easy-going jazz lover who stumbles into the band by accident, then drives their climb to success with a simple change of tempo. You need to make it fun without being cliché, so keeping the band from reaching #1 on the charts is a smart move. And with any movie with a song as the centerpiece, you need to like the song. ""That Thing You Do!"" could be one of the catchiest songs to come out of any movie in recent memory, and the other songs that you hear over the course of the movie are entertaining, as well. When you can combine the star power of Tom Hanks and Liv Tyler with the music, magic, and sheer entertainment of this movie, you can't possibly go wrong. 9/10",That Thing You Do!
105,brianlaughran,A very good movie to say the least.,10,5 September 2009,"First things first, i have to hand it to Tom Hanks. The man can direct and act. ""That Thing You Do"" is a movie with no antagonist, no good guys and yet it's a great movie. It follows the story of the Wonders, a band Eerie, Pennsylvania who make it big with their hit single, ""That Thing You Do!"" They are then picked up by a major record company and are headed off on tour. The rest of the film follows the relationships that blossom and wilt within the band as they climb the ladder of success.This is a sweet and innocent movie with no other intentions than to tell a story.

This movie brought back memories that I wish I could relive.  Before the world went to hell in the late sixties, the world and life seemed as sweet as it was portrayed in this movie.  Roger Ebert, in his review of this movie, said, that, if this movie does anything, it makes you smile.  He was right.  I found myself sitting through this movie with a smile on my face and with a feeling of contentment.  I sometimes wondered whether I had ""glorified"" my memories of those years, but this movie confirmed that I was right.

108,mtac877824,Tom Hanks is also a great songwriter. Great movie!,10,24 February 2003,"I love this movie!  When I have a bad day or have the ""blues"" I slap this movie in and enjoy not just the great music but the great interaction between the leading cast members which include Hanks' look-a-like Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Schaech and as notated in the credits: ""The Bass Player"" Ethan Embry, collectively known as ""The Oneders"", oops! make that ""The Wonders"".   Hanks show us just how multi-talented he is by writing and directing this movie PLUS he re-created the innocence and joy of music from the 60's in minute detail. Hanks is the writer of the title song and of the offbeat instrumental ""Spartacus"" and it knocks me out that he has these incredible talents for so many artistic creations: Actor, Director, song writer, et.al. He also directs this movie as well as playing Play-Tone Manager, ""Mr White"" who leads the ""The Wonders"" to success through the ""Play-Tone"" label. Tom Everett Scott looks a lot like Tom Hanks during his ""Bosom Buddy"" days on TV, and I suspect that Hanks created this movie to showcase the talent that is Tom Everett Scott.  Scott steals the movie with his humor, his sincere caring of others and if he is really a drummer, his talent! Zahn was great as the comic relief and Schaech was not only very handsome but very believable in portraying the moody Jimmy, lead singer, who has the true artistic temperament but is lacking in certain sensitivities. The songs are ""snappy"" and ""catchy"", capturing the true zenith of rock and roll in 1960's America.  The catchy ""Play-Tone"" label, also created by Hanks, the reproductions of TV shows of the 60's, and the ambience of a time when rock and roll was growing up and showing off are all in this great movie.  The title song, ""That Thing You Do"" is actually a great tune and I find myself wanting to hear it now and then, and sing along with it.    Liv Tyler as ""Faye"" was very sweet as the wronged girlfriend but I don't get how  having a really bad cold during the West coast California ""showcasing"" had any revelance to the movie except to show that ""Guy"" noticed she was sick and was always ""there"" for her and ""thinking"" of her when Jimmy wasn't. Look for performances by Charlize Theron and Giovanni Ribisi as well. This is a light-hearted movie that you can just sit back, enjoy, sing a long with, and laugh.  The biggest plus is that in watching the credits it is incredible to see that Hanks wrote many of the songs, the music, created the 60's TV shows so realistically and is not only a member of the Screen Actors Guild but also the Song Writers Guild - so many feathers in his already much-plummed hat. Does Tom Hanks' talents have no end? I hope not. Check out ""Road to Perdition"" for further proof. Rita Wilson, Hanks' wife, makes an appearance at the ""Blue Spot"" where Jazz greats meet to jam and have ""cock and bull"" sessions and where Guy meets his idol, Dale Paxton. Their own jam session results in ""Spartacus"", a great jazz instrumental, also written by Tom Hanks. Before you rewind the movie, wait for the end of the credits to see two of ""The Wonders"" music videos, including ""That Thing You Do""!   In summary, I love that thing that Tom Hanks does with this well-made and entertaining comedy!",That Thing You Do!

It's just one of those movies that has so many moments that truly charm you. I often consider myself a ""movie snob"", but this is one of those smaller, just-to-be-entertained-by films that rises above the rest.Tom Hanks obviously thought out every detail of this period and it shows. Goes straight to the original music he selected; I even have the CD. As a side note, I love that he always uses actors he's worked with way past when, including Peter Scolari.

It is the kind of movie you can watch more than once just to enjoy the music. (I wore out two soundtrack tapes playing it in my car!) Okay, so it's a frothy little movie. Frothy can be good -- dessert has it's place on the menu! And for those of us who played in some version of a garage band in our teens, it's a chance to see how our wildest dreams might have come true.And it's always a kick in Tom Hanks' movies to see familiar faces pop up. Steve Zahn, who plays Lenny in this movie, also shows up in ""You've Got Mail"" and ""From The Earth To The Moon."" Peter Scolari, of course, was Mr. Hanks' costar on ""Bosom Buddies.""Mr. Hanks is a keen observer of people. I've known more than one musician who put all his emotions into his music, leaving little or none for the people in his life -- in this movie, it's Jimmy. I've known guys who are so self-absorbed that they don't realize that women are drawn to them and then brushed away -- Guy ignores his girlfriend's chatter in his own excitement, and later, as a waitress tells him her life story, he's obviously just waiting for her to stop talking.And I've been the girl ready to follow her musician anywhere, singing along with every note he sings. Poor Fay -- she really thought Jimmy loved her.It's interesting that Guy and Fay end up together -- for the first time in the movie, he's actually listening to what a woman is saying to him. And from the ""follow-up"" at the end of the movie, they apparently have a good life together, so maybe he just needed to have the right woman talking to him.But all these observations are so neatly written that you don't feel like you're taking a course in character analysis -- they just make the movie that much more interesting to watch.",That Thing You Do!

The creative leader of the band suddenly becomes a selfish twit near the end of the film. He inexplicably dumps the girl (Liv Tyler) he had always adored. She quickly falls for another band member and they live happily ever after. Of course, the band members have already parted permanently, not just as collaborators, but also as friends.  The idea is they were never friends at all, but just fell together for the purpose of forming a band.  Very sad.  The movie is totally unwatchable when Hanks or Tyler are not on screen.   The other characters are not fleshed out, perhaps deliberately, and are just boring.  The title song, very ingratiating at first, gradually becomes annoying after many playings.  This is intentional because the musicians themselves tire of playing it constantly and want to move onto something else. This film could have used some comedy. The dramatic moments felt heavy-handed and, despite the considerable charisma of Hanks and Tyler, the light comedy potential was never exploited.",That Thing You Do!

116,hisown,LOVE this movie!,9,5 September 2005,"As a child of the 60s and a musician, I loved this movie from the first few minutes of it. The sets, the clothes, the music, and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like, minus the politics and Vietnam. Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were ""garage-bands"" galore and many of the little-remembered names of the genre started out as such. The Wonders in ""That Thing You Do!"" could easily be a number of bands that were a one-hit-wonder (or two or three) and then just disappeared from the scene. Nevertheless, they all helped shape some of the best music of that era, and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie. If you remember the early 60's fondly, you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories. The depiction of Erie, PA during this time-frame is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by. The music rocks, the dialog is hip, and the love story rounds it out perfectly. Buy this movie and then buy the CD soundtrack; you won't be sorry! (**TRIVIA: another Tom Hanks produced movie, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", has a ""That Thing You Do!"" song played during the wedding reception - do you know which one?**)",That Thing You Do!

However, I liked it then and appreciate its subtleties as it passes by all these years later on cable. It has quite a few elements I missed the first time around because the song and the attention to '60s detail had me reliving my childhood. There is something irrepressibly elating about the affect the meteoric rise of the song has on young people from a somewhat remote town in PA. I wonder how many people my age daydreamed about something like that happening to them? And the scene when they first hear their song over the radio evokes memories of soaring joy on those rare occasions when something came out so right.

119,TonyAtTheMovies,Those Things You Have to Do (as a Band),9,8 March 2019,"The fun and convincing story of four young guys in a local pop band in early 60s America who make a record, and what happens next...
As they progress in the US pop business, the film paints a picture of the business at that time, including characters ranging from a very doubtful would-be 'manager', whose office is his truck, to Tom Hanks' slick, go-getting record company executive. The soundtrack features very accurate pastiches of 60s pop songs styles, including Motown and pre-Beatles pop ballads. And of course the title song, which we get to hear a number of times as the band promote it on TV and on tour, giving the feel of what it's like to 'live with' a song as you take it on the road and end up playing it for the fiftieth time while that night's audience are hearing it live for the first.
The life of the band as four guys is convincingly portrayed - love lives, struggles with management, artistic compromise, artistic influences and differences between themselves - giving the film a reality, depth and colour.
I won't spoil the ending, but this enjoyable film portrays four young guys (and their best friend girl) having the time of their lives while also facing the struggles that their dreams and choices, and life itself, bring. Well worth seeing.",That Thing You Do!

They both inspired my then 2 year old son to take up the drums. He's still playing. I loved the music because although it was all original, it sounded like those songs had somehow been part of my life, growing up in the 60's. I like Tom Everett Scott as Guy. Steve Zahn is very funny, and Jonathon Schaech is appropriately moody. There are also some great supporting roles - I love Freddie Frederickson (""Mr. Downtown""), the hotel doorman, the LA DJ and Barry Sobel as Goofball.

That doesn't keep it from being good.",9,18 May 2003,"Previous reviews explain the movie and characters pretty well; I want to add one writer's point of view.This story was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks. Had he not had the Hollywood pull that he enjoys at this point in his career, the project would never have seen the light of day. Most films emerging from this process are, quite frankly, crap. But this is Tom Hanks we're talking about; the man is incapable of doing anything at less than outstanding levels of quality, and he often achieves greatness.""That Thing You Do"" is merely outstanding, but it allows Hanks to be outstanding while wearing five different hats. The more cynical point out that it covers little new ground. I would disagree -- I found it refreshingly daring that in an era where the public insists that some barrier be broken before a piece is considered to be worthwhile, Hanks had the fortitude (and power) to see this through and get it made.Furthermore it set the stage, five years before 9/11, for less-in-your-face fare to be embraced by those seeking more in the way of feel-good entertainment.The world is a teaspoonful of better because this film is available to us. The world of movies could probably claim a gallon. But you're in no danger of getting a cavity from seeing it. For that, I recommend ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"".",That Thing You Do!
125,rob-544,Nice portrayal of my hometown,8,24 January 2001,"How my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania got to be the setting of this movie is beyond me. But if you're going to have a movie set in Erie, PA, this was a good choice!Hanks & company did quite an accurate portrayal of Erie in 1964. I wasn't around in '64, but older Erieites are extremely impressed with the mention of many local hangouts back then. It was especially nice to see a mention of a local college, Gannon (my alma mater).The movie itself was very well-done. It was a nice story of an overnight success and how people take advantage of their youthful ignorance. Tom Hanks does a nice job as the manager. I like how he doesn't play the same old characters in every movie.",That Thing You Do!
126,ajbg,A great pick me up!,10,12 November 2002,"This movie caught my attention because of the music video for the title track playing on VH-1 while it was playing in the theatres.  I didn't get a chance to see it until it was on video.  Even though I was only seeing it on the small screen, I really enjoyed it.  The music is great (the liner notes of the soundtrack are written like these bands really existed--great touch!), the actors are perfectly cast, and there's just enough truth to make you wish the Oneders were a real band.  WARNING--once you see this, you won't be able to get the songs out of your head!",That Thing You Do!
127,celebs100,Sack the director,4,29 February 2008,"A very familiar story of getting together and forming a band and then it all goes wrong movie. Nicely acted. Looks nice. Music nice. But it was oh so slow. There was practically no script and every time a scene was flagging it was time to play the same song yet again. All the music played was very good and in keeping with the era, but it was so often used as a filler so that the movie wasn't 30 minutes long. This was a case of the studio bosses thinking Tom Hanks could do no wrong and they dare not annoy him by criticising. It happens so often. Superstar want's to make a picture and the studios allow total freedom, even though they really know it's not working, but it's worth it to keep Tom Hanks happy. The idea was nice, it just needed re-writing. But the main flaw was Tom Hanks as Director. It needed someone with sparkle. Hanks has no sparkle as a Director. It plodded on so slowly I almost fell asleep.",That Thing You Do!
128,MGDicker,That Thing You Do!: A Review by Matt Dicker,8,3 August 1998,"That Thing You Do!, Tom Hanks' first directorial effort, is an entertaining movie.  The cast is pretty good, and introduces many young stars, including Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler.  The weakest part of the film was, surprisingly, Tom Hanks' acting.  The music is very good, as is Liv Tyler. That Thing You Do! is a charming film, but is by no means a cinematic triumph.  I did enjoy it though, and I recommend it.",That Thing You Do!
129,leetallahassee,A great film in all departments,10,13 January 2008,"1. Tom Hanks so expertly captured the time period--not one false noteor image. (I know--I grew up during that time.) This film shouldhave gotten some sort of award (or at least nominated) for best set design. 2. Perfectly cast, down to the small, one line roles. Bryan Cranstonwas perfect as Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom. One of those great ""hey there""films. (Hey, there's Alex Rocco, Peter Scolari, Charlize Theron,Warren Berlinger, Robert Torti, Rita Wilson, etc. 3. Love those costumes!4. This film perfectly captured the last innocence of America (especially it's youth) in 1964 before the harsh realities of the late1960's set in (war casualties, assassinations, coarse pornographyamong other things).And now, we have the director's cut released for us to enjoy even more scenes from this wonderful film.",That Thing You Do!

131,Drumski89,"Very clever, an original idea",10,3 December 2006,"Every actor in this movie does a spectacular job. You're immersed in their world immediately, and at no time do you want to leave. All of the songs are good, and the soundtrack was worth buying too. Tom Hanks does a good performance, and I thought it was pretty cool that the actors actually learned how to play their instruments in this movie, and you can tell during theperformance scenes. The humorous parts were actually funny, and thesomber parts were realistic. The characters were original and memorable, especially Mr. White, played by Tom Hanks. The song ""That Thing You Do!"" is a great song, it has a very Beatles feel to it, as does the entire movie; it conjures up images of the Beatles' movie ""Help"". It's a shame it isn't recognized by the general public, but overall, a great movie.",That Thing You Do!

133,johenshaw,That Thing You Do - A Review By Jo Henshaw,10,15 June 2000,"That Thing You Do! In every life there becomes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do.That Thing You Do begins with a group of friends practising for their college talent show. Their band - the amusingly named One-ders win the contest with their catchy song - That Thing You Do. But this is only the beginning of their success story. In a blur, the newly renamed Wonders become a hit - playing at their local clubs, and then moving on to a national tour with Playtone records under the guidance of Mr White (Tom Hanks) The beauty of the film is there is no conflict, just the excitement and exhilaration that the band feels as they become celebrities and this is can't be shown better than in the scene where they first hear their song on the radio and they are literally dancing in the street, you can't help but feel happy for them too. Tom Everett Scott plays the charming Guy Patterson - the electrical store assistant who becomes the  band's drummer and a national sex symbol with his trademark sunglasses.  Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the carefree guitarist who sees the bands success as a huge lark and just throws himself into enjoying every day. Jimmy (James) Mattingly II is the band's creativity - writing the songs - and also its serious side. He sees the commercialisation of the wonders as stifling his creativity and is reluctant to sign anything to do with his music. Liv Tyler is also a delight as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye and the band's biggest supporter. The success of That Thing You do lies in the little things that are so easy to miss yet are the glue that brings the whole film together. Watch out for how well Guy's family react to his success and how the bands first drummer with the broken arm keeps turning up. Also notice how it is Guy that keeps looking out for Faye. It is these little things that will bring you to the film and that find you leaving with a smile and a desire to see it again.",That Thing You Do!
134,kejola1969,"Fun,Fun,Fun!",8,27 January 2001,"This movie has some of the best music you are ever gonna hear. I'm talking ""MUSIC"",not rap,hip-hop,metal,just fun,actually dancable music.

135,LongshotJB,"Great, ""Feel-good"" movie!",10,4 May 2002,"Saw the movie in the theater and on video, as well as downloading the soundtrack; looks and sounds better every time I see it!

Charming tale of fame, love, and of course music.",That Thing You Do!
137,midipro,Excellent film that lifts you up and makes you want more!,10,19 August 2005,"That Thing You Do was a total enjoyment. I think that it should be a template to what all movies should be about. Positive entertainment is what I'm talking about. Not something that leaves you with a dead & burned out feeling but with a positive uplifting experience. With the exception of a couple of choice words, this movie would have been near perfect. Once you see it you will want to see it again and again. It's extremely entertaining with a magical quality that makes you hunger for more. Mr. Hanks should quite proud of all of his work in this film. He has accomplished many times over what many fail to do. Speaking from real world experience as a musician that almost made it, I can say that this movie is right on the mark of realism. All of the cast did an excellent job of making this film very believable. That thing you do could have have truly been right out of the annals of our history. If you want good clean entertainment and an evening of captivating fun then by all means watch this movie. You'll be very glad you did.William Gilmore Pensacola FL",That Thing You Do!
138,JakeBlue,Feed good movie with very accurate and convincing acting,8,27 July 1999,"This movie is the one I keep by my VCR to watch whenever I just want to watch something fun and light that makes me feel good.  The exuberance of a bunch of teenagers who strike it big in a few weeks shines through this movie.  As a person who played in a high school band myself, I can say that the scene where they first hear their song on the radio is probably the most exciting in the movie.  The actors/director captured the raw excitement of a rising band and really transmit it well across the screen.",That Thing You Do!
139,romanagiulia,Rare Gem,10,8 January 2003,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with Tom Hanks.  It is simple, with endearing characters, and a vision of  a time gone by.  Sometimes, good stories are told and every once in a while we get to hear them.",That Thing You Do!

It is colorful, funny, and has a great sound track. Tom Everett Scott had a great breakout preformance as Guy Patterson (the drummer) I also loved Liv Tyler's portrayal of Fae.

I stumbled across this movie and decided to watch it for the 15th time or so.Just so much fun, a warm hearted comedy/drama/romance.Steve Zahn is perfect.If Tom Hanks is in your movie and he's not the scene stealer or even a big character and that movie still rules, you're watching a hit.The story is weak but I'm pretty sure it's meant to be that way.

142,billkexel,Takes you back to the simple days of rock & roll,9,25 May 2006,"The scenes I found most interesting displayed the reality of the rise & fall of entertainers. How the new rising stars were ""it"" & the ones that had songs starting down the charts were considered the ""has-beens"". All within a matter of a couple months. It's over that quick.I have read several comments on here where reviewers compared this band to the Beatles, The Byrds or the Turtles. These are bad comparisons. These were MAJOR bands with many hits. The Beatles were considered Gods.""The Wonders"" were a ONE hit, flash-in-the-pan group. I compare them to other mid 60s bands like ""The McCoys"" (Hang on Sloopy) The Beau Brummels"" (Laugh Laugh) ""The Easybeats"" (Friday on my mind) ""The Standells"" (Dirty Water) and other American garage bands that had one huge hit & then quickly faded away.It follows them from the beginning, thru their rise & fast pace of fame & the fall & back to their normal life again.This film captures the feel of being young & in a band during the early-mid 60s when there were thousands of bands like ""The Wonders"" in America that hoped for that big break & to get their 15 minutes of fame.",That Thing You Do!
143,moooman,"A familiar tale, but oh so fun...!",9,27 January 2003,"Sure the story of a one-hit wonder rock'n'roll band has been told before, but so what? This movie is fun, fun, fun!One reviewer commented, upon first release of this movie, that ""if you're going to feature a single song several times in a movie, it better be a damn good one"" (or something along those lines...). 'That Thing You Do' certainly is a catchy song.Kudos to Tom the director for making his actors learn their instruments and actually BECOME a real band for the movie. That way, the titular song doesn't become repetitive because we get to hear the 'evolution' of the song's arrangement over the course of the story. Starting of course with the simplified garage version all the way to the slick and assured rendition on the television showcase appearance.Lest we forget, they had other songs in their repertoire as well. Many of them were co-written by Mr. Hanks. Is there no end to this man's talents?This movie was obviously a labour of love for Tom Hanks, and it shows. I don't think he had any illusions about it becoming a blockbuster or having it significantly add to his income in any way. I think he just wanted to give us a glimpse into what could have been had he taken a slightly different career path in his life. And for that, I for one am grateful.",That Thing You Do!
144,alexanderdumas123,I really only have one problem with this movie.,8,7 May 2021,"When I saw this movie in the theaters, overall I liked it. There was only one thing that bugged me about the movie, when I first saw. Up until the point when Fay breaks up with Jimmy, I thought that she had done that offscreen and had hooked up with Guy, after he and Charlize Theron's character spilt, due to how often you see her with Guy and how little time she spends with Jimmy during the movie.",That Thing You Do!
145,da6133011378,Captures feel and experience of early rock industry with great story,9,20 December 2014,"I don't know why the critics were so harsh on this movie. I thought it was great. Without being specific to any one band, it tells the story of so many bands from the 1950's-1960's. This is the only movie I can recall that tells the story of how a local garage band becomes a one-hit-wonder, and how they move from local radio to #1 in the country, to oblivion - in a matter of (what seems like) weeks.I appreciated that the movie didn't portray anyone as the villain. There was no evil record company, no diabolical agent. It was the music business, and a band with a catchy song - each one made each other some money. How they captured the feel of the late 50's so well without seeming cliché - I have no idea,A fun, memorable movie.",That Thing You Do!
146,Dustweek,"Captures the moment, the place, the dream",8,4 May 2006,"""That Thing You Do"" revives the dream we all had, back when we were in our late teens, of being the next John Lennon - or maybe Ringo. This is a masterfully crafted movie. Watch how the jaded, fading ""Diane Dane"" adjusts to her post-stardom decline at the Wisconsin State Fair. Or how the slicked-back star Freddie Fredrickson remembers to call out ""Hello Wisconsin!"" Or the sense and feel of working at dad's appliance store back in the mid '60s.The movie has a genuine warmth and reality. If you love 60's rock, or are nostalgic for your youth, check out this Tom Hanks directed/written film. Tom Hanks is a huge hit because he exudes a charm, a genuineness, that cannot be faked. All that charm comes full force in this film.",That Thing You Do!

Tom Hanks did a fabulous job directing and writing, and starring in the movie.  It was funny, smart, brilliant and all that those entail.  The acting was wonderful (Tom Everett Scott, Liv Tyler, and STEVE ZAHN) and the cameos were even better (CHRIS ISAAK, Rita Wilson, Peter Scollari, and more).

148,ssweeps,Really A Good Movie,9,15 April 2006,"This movie was filmed in the city of Orange, CA where I used to live. There is still an Army-Navy store on Glassell St. and it was in the movie. I really liked the music, and heard that the band members practiced 8 hours a day for 6 weeks to learn how to play their instruments. The man who played Lamar the concierge really did an excellent job, and made things more believable. I have seen this movie at least 15 times and enjoy it every time it is on TV. The music is top-notch, the story is very good and the plot keeps me watching the whole movie without getting bored. Any struggling musician can appreciate this movie for what band members go through trying to make it in the music business. Tom Hanks is pure genius, and his wife is in the movie too as a club waitress. Highly recommended! There are some major Hollywood stars in it, even though their parts are rather small. 2 thumbs up for me, way up!",That Thing You Do!
149,gordodj2000,Now that's rock and roll,8,18 February 2005,"What a joy to watch...over and over!! Though some of the events which occur once the band reaches the pinnacle of success (two members leaving so quickly, one for the army, one at a casino) seem highly unlikely and unbelievable, the development of the band, from talent competition winners to top of the chart hit makers, is one which anyone who loves music (and especially the effect the 60's had on rock and roll) can really appreciate. The title track is catchy and infectious, and Tom Everett Scott's reluctant acceptance of the leader's role is engaging and genuine. Even the subplots are interesting and not too intricate to follow. I highly recommend this film.",That Thing You Do!
150,max-tareq,as repetitive as the song,5,19 July 2019,"The movie stayed in the shallow side of the Premise without trying to go deeper to explore what's mean to be one hit band
nor how the characters feel to repeat the same song over and over and what will happen if it come to an end,
even if you overlooked the lack of depth in the story the characters hits you with dull dialog with no cmehistry between them,
at the end of movie mr hanks might achieved

He said I reminded him so much of Guy from That Thing You Do! I had never seen it before, so I checked it out. I absolutely fell in love with this movie. Became an instant favorite of mine. I'm sure one could find many flaws with it, but it's just a really great comedy that captures, in an intimate way, the flash-in-a-pan success of a fictional band that fits the archetype of many 1960's rock groups. I also really enjoyed the world-building that went into this film, with the film and its soundtrack being filled with other fictional artists and groups, like Del Paxton and The Chantrellines, all having influence and association with each other. And, as a fan of The Beatles since childhood, I love all of the references to the Fab Four in this film. Overall, this is a movie that I recommend to anyone.",That Thing You Do!
152,Dav-A-Jax,Welcome to the 60s!,9,6 May 2006,"This movie has the feel, the sound and the look of the 60s! Though there are a few anachronisms in the movie (none that I would have picked out!), I don't know if I've ever seen a movie with such complete attention to period detail from the original soundtrack that had me wondering if I had heard those songs in the 60s, to the Formica on the counter-top, and the Ed Sullivan show. The song ""That Thing You Do"" should have been a hit in 1964! I could have sworn I remembered the night the Wonders were on and the screen said John, oops, uh, Guy was taken! The entire movie brought me back to my childhood, and has retained that magic each time I've watched it.",That Thing You Do!
153,Dud-5,"Great movie, warm and fuzzie",8,8 October 1998,That Thing You Do is just a pleasure to watch. While it may not be a Oscar winner it leaves you with just a nice feeling as the movie ends. Tom Hanks did a great job of capturing the time period. A big thumbs up.,That Thing You Do!
154,JOHNCHC,A Feel Good Movie,9,20 September 1998,I think it was a very good movie. it shows how the spirit of one person can bring average people to extraordinary. Tom Hanks did a good job both acting and directing.,That Thing You Do!
155,Kyle-18,This movie had some fantastic touches,9,27 September 1998,"There have been a lot of ""rags-to-riches"" garage band movies; I appreciated Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" more than any of them.  The title song plays throughout the movie, nearly a dozen times (though the whole song plays only once or twice), and it is a catchy tune indeed.  The scene at the talent show where a performer's nervousness accidently creates a hit song is pure magic.  The scene where the band hears the song on the radio for the first time is both funny and touching.  The scene that made a major impact on me, reflecting what the movie is all about, is when the audience is singing along with the band in their final appearance in the movie.  Inspirational. Tom Everett Scott, who more than once has been compared to a young Tom Hanks, makes his character likeable and funny/confused at the same time. The dual-track communication between Scott's character and his girlfriend is subtly humorous, more so in subsequent viewings. This movie is one to watch over and over, just to capture the magic of the scenes.",That Thing You Do!
156,LSeals,Entertaining and mostly musically accurate for the period,9,13 December 1998,"I just finished watching this again tonight and am still impressed by the little details that Hanks gets right such as the period guitars and amps (loved seeing those blond Fender Bassman amps), awful PA systems and other musical trappings of the period.  The music is infectious (I liked the song they played in Wisconsin that Lenny sang - can't think of the title) and there's a lot in there that I still remember about having a garage band back in that era.  There's just so much right about this movie that I'd recommend it to anyone.  Another impressive score for do-it-all Hanks.",That Thing You Do!
157,Bobby-36,Catchy Tune Hooks You,10,27 January 1999,"Tom Hanks really shows off his talents in this movie.  Writer, director, actor, and music writer.  I never knew he had all these talents.  I am a senior in years and this movie sort of takes you back in time.  The song by the same name as the movie is one of my favorites now.",That Thing You Do!
158,bnelson,Nailed it,10,30 May 1999,"Perhaps the showing on VH-1 over the Memorial Day 1999 weekend will expose this vastly underrated (and under appreciated) film to an audience that missed its theatrical release. Not only does it showcase Hanks' directorial skills (and his unquestioned acting ability), but the sheer joy of his involvement is evident. Without giving in to the entertainment quotient, ``TTYD'' is a dead-on accurate portrayal of the music/radio/promotion business. And oh yes, the soundtrack is infectious (and quite snappy).This very well may be the 1996 version of ``A Face in the Crowd''.",That Thing You Do!
159,StrayDog-2,A Must Rent,8,26 March 1999,"Tom Hanks scores an impressive win with this touching tale of five would-be band members accidently hitting it big in the early 60's.The film stars Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson, a employee at his father's appliance store who just happens to spend his free time playing the drums.  His skills are called upon when a small band in his hometown of Erie, PA loses their drummer (Giovanni Ribisi) to a broken arm. There's Jimmy (Jonathon Schaech), the narcissistic lead singer, Lenny (Steve Zahn), the goofy lead guitarist, and T.B. (Ethan Embry), the naive bass player. Accompanied by Fay (Liv Tyler) and their manager Mr. White (Hanks), the five members tour all across the country promoting their hit song ""That Thing You Do"".The film is a cute and light look at the early 60's music scene, which saw the rise and fall of many young, one-hit wonder, bands.  If you want to spend two enjoyable hours of fun, you can't go wrong with ""That Thing You Do"".  And if you grew up in that era, the feeling of nostalgia adds an extra level of enjoyment.All in all, with its excellent cast, script, music, and production design, ""That Thing You Do"" should be high on your list of rentals.",That Thing You Do!

However, this was Tom Hanks' first shot at directing so I had to go see it, because my girlfriend obsesses over him.

I love Steve Zahn, he's the best actor all over the world!!!! I know many people who don't know the film or don't like it and heard that the runtime in Germany was just 1 week. I haven't seen him in the cinema, and that was my mistake. I tried to get the soundtrack in Germany, but, you wouldn't believe it, you can't get it here.

163,kandor8,Hanks has a true grasp of early 60's America,9,9 February 2002,"From the opening sequence introducing Guy Patterson's mundane life working in the family appliance business I knew that writer/director Tom Hanks knew this era like a pair of comfortable old shoes and slipped them on and took us on a too brief walk through small town America in the early sixties. The opening song ""Loving You Lots and Lots"" playing over the opening credits and establishing sequences really set the tone when ""Safe"" music could still be popular alongside ""evil"" rock-and-roll. I felt like I stepped into a time machine and what was really impressive to me was the fact that ALL the songs used in the movie were all originals! Not a single archive song was used to set the time frame. This little movie deserves more respect and I would love to have the Powers That Be issue a special DVD version sometime in the near future with a Tom Hanks commentary. So why a 9 and not a 10? Liv Tyler's role wasn't as solid a character as it could have been. No, not liberated as such but maybe a bit less whiny during the break up scene. I didn't really like her character untill right at the end when she and Guy get together. A very comfortable movie.",That Thing You Do!
164,roland-132,Excellent Movie !,10,13 June 2006,"There is no doubt that Hanks gets to grips with the subject matter of the film. I found there were no ""flat spots"", the editing and pacing were almost perfect.The characters are clearly defined and the film develops like a thunderstorm, with the inevitable dissipation at the end. Most of the reviews i've read reflect what I think, although I'm curious as to the origin of the saying ""One Hit Wonders"".Having been involved for many years with Music and playing in bands, it's easy to relate to the dream of making it. I like the scene where the Bass player goes missing and a replacement is found. The boys aren't sure about his ability to play and begin to question the fact, only to be bowled over by a succession of riffs that blow your socks off.",That Thing You Do!
165,ibdm-2,That Thing You Do,10,6 July 2006,"I love this movie. It is one of those movies I watch if I have a bad day. It cheers me up and is so entertaining. It is meticulessly filled with nostalgic details, and silly, fun music. The characters are flawlessly played, so many good actors participated in this film. It is a fun and wholesome movie, my teenage daughter loved it too. It is even more fun if you have ever known anyone in a garage band, and who hasn't? It mirrors many events from the Ed Sullivan era when the Beatles became big. A great tale of the ""one hit wonder"". Fiction in a very historical early '60's setting. This movie represents the light, fun side of early Rock n Roll, which is often over shadowed by the cruel, senseless events of war and the fight for civil rights that was happening during this time. Tom Hanks wrote, directed, acted in it, and even was involved in writing much of the music. His wife has a small part in it as well. I remember seeing Charlize Theron for the first time in this movie and thinking what a great actress she is. Same for TB player, who never has a real name in the movie, and Tom Everett Scott. The song was actually nominated for a Grammy award, it's real catchy! I bought the movie, and the sound track and wore them out. It will be one of those movie that people will appreciated more and more as time goes on, mostly because the main cast was virtually unknown and have gone on to do greater parts. Tom Hanks said when they made the movie, it was like watching a new generation of great actors get started. If you like the movie, get the sound track and read the jacket, it was just like we used to do when a new album came out by our favorite band, we'd read the jacket and learn all the extras about them! It gives you more detail about the fictional characters in the movie and in typical Tom Hanks style, just good, old fashioned fun!",That Thing You Do!
166,kaliea,Work of art!,10,26 July 2006,"I love this movie! I unfortunately did not get to see this when it was in theaters as I live in a small town that apparently did not think it was worthy of the spot on the marque. I have been renting this movie for as long as it has been available it has become a classic in ""musicals"". I have raised my daughter to love musicals and I have to say this is at the top of her favorites list too, that's impressive for a thirteen year old that has also grown up with today typical music, i.e. rap crap. I am impressed by Tom Hanks hidden talents as writer and producer and was amazed to see he wrote so many of the songs! It took me a while to hunt down a copy of this on DVD but it is finally a piece in my collection. Great Movie!",That Thing You Do!
167,makmlh,Wonderful,10,7 August 2006,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. If I had the time I would watch it every day. Tom Hanks is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tom Everet Scott at his best work yet!!!! Liv Tyler is absolutely amazing, even though the film is about the band she just steals every scene that she is in, especially the dramatic ones. It is a great family movie, I watch it with my family all of the time. Wonderful writing, beautifully done. All I can say that it is one of my favorite movies of all times. Absolutely brilliant. Very surprising ending, but at the same time it was something I should have been expecting. Two of the main characters end up (for different reasons) being without their significant others and slowly fall in love. Even though the band breaks up, you are not so disappointed by the end because of the love story. The soundtrack is probably the best part of the entire movie. All of the music is absolutely excellent, I am not very old, so I don't know if any of the bands and groups are real, but the music is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",That Thing You Do!
168,jw70,"Good, fun escapist fare",7,28 July 2006,"I'll have to admit some bias going in, as I was growing up in Erie, PA during the '60s. Having said this, my first impression is that the movie completely nails it - not only from the overall perspective of what the music & media scene was like back then, but also from the fact that it very accurately captures the total spirit of Erie during the period. This is no Oscar contender, but is a very enjoyable take of young dreams, good friends & what can happen when unexpected success comes into play. A good choice for a weekend afternoon escape.The story on how the movie came to be is from Tom Hanks & his family taking a cross-country roadtrip in the early 90s. They happened to get off the interstate at Erie one day around lunchtime & Tom fell in love with the city (which is for the most part still the same as it was back then)",That Thing You Do!

I don't get attached to films!! AT ALL! I loved this film so much, I've gonna and got the soundtrack, just so I can hear That Thing You Do all the time. Tom Hanks - as usual a superb performance, and seeing as he did everything else as well, fantastic!! I can honestly say I have never actually watched a film that I really do want to watch again and again, and I intend to as well. The script is perfect for the time, the acting is no where near as wooden as it would have been if filmed then and the actors are that good, you can actually believe that they are a band, and would buy their records. At least, I would if I could!!",That Thing You Do!
170,damntheman23,One-derful!(the soundtrack rocks too!),10,18 July 2001,"An excellent story about a better time with better music. A small band from Erie, PA in 1964 are about to perform their ballad ""That Thing You Do"" at a local talent show. With less than a day to come up with a name, (they decide on the One-ders) their drummer breaks his arm. The replacement: ""Erie's lone beatnik"" lovable Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott). Starting the song at the talent show, Guy gets a catchy beat in his head and starts playing it. The more upbeat, ""snappier"" version of the song becomes an instant hit and the newly-named Wonders are signed to Play-Tone Records and led to huge success by their manager, Mr. White (Tom Hanks). Jimmy (Johnathon Shaech), the band's serious lead singer and songwriter insists for quite some time that it's still ""too fast"". Also in the band are Lenny (Steve Zahn), the hilarious guitarist who takes nothing seriously and is probably just in the band to meet girls. Then there's the cute bass player (Ethan Embry) who doesn't really say much and enlisted in the Marines before the band's success (he sadly has to report to South Carolina at the end of August but ends up in Disneyland). One of the running jokes of the film is that the bass player was never given a name. Liv Tyler gives a wonderful performance as Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend and the band's hugest fan (She's allowed on the tour as their ""costume mistress""). With this sudden success and a record literally climbing the charts, not to mention a part in a major motion picture, how long will the band stay together to continue doing that thing they do?",That Thing You Do!
171,sandan,Loved This Movie,9,26 November 2001,I gotta say I loved this movie. It was just plain enjoyable. Of course it helped a lot that when I saw it the first time my daughter was 2.

Now it's one of the few remaining memories I have of her.See it hopefully it will give you lasting memories.,That Thing You Do!
172,moosenmoo35244,Unless you were there.,8,21 January 2008,"THAT THING YOU DOUnless you were there. Unless you were of that age, that time and particularly if you were a male and trying to force your grimy little fingers into a ""C"" chord on a Harmony acoustic guitar that was semi in tunewell, you will not understand the depth that this movie has. This movie and ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" capture something that was so real, so tangible but has slipped so completely away from any succeeding generations grasp that to try and film it's time and moment seems impossible. And yet, Tom Hanks did it. I don't know how he managed to grasp the era and the people so well as I thought he was a little too young for that time period. He nails this every boy's fantasy with wit, wisdom and just a touch of sadness. The cast turns in, a spot on encapsulation of people that will be very familiar to any struggling band member from the period. Tom Hanks himself turns in a solid performance as a man apart of, yet removed from the music itself. Men of his age at that time all actually read the Playboy philosophy espoused by Hugh Hefner and secretly wanted to be as cool as one of the Rat Pack. He did a super job of directing this effort and keeping the frenetic pace. All of this brings us to the music, which for the most part is expertly crafted (and I was surprised to see Hanks wrote some of the music also) to remind us of the era. I enjoyed all the songs for what they are. It is ""homage"" which is not exactly copying but using the elements to pay tribute to the influences that shaped the music of that era. People who grew up in the 80's or 90's have no conception of what the music was like then. They can hear it, and yes even appreciate it, but they don't understand that it was rarely on TV, it was not the background music for every commercial you heard or saw and radio stations that played it were decidedly looked down upon. It was not woven into the fabric of life like it is now. It was new, it was dangerous and you had to search it out. You had to want it. That's why I so enjoyed this movie. Even with some of it's false steps and it's occasional heavy handedness that would over power the subtleties of real life I found this movie a guilty pleasure that is completely satisfying and an absolute joy to watch.",That Thing You Do!
173,angelapicknell,A very well-made film but lacking in substance.,7,11 November 2007,"The film is undoubtedly well made, with all the advantages of a decent budget and a talented, and often experienced personnel; it looks good and the portrayal of the early 60's media circus is interesting, but the story and characters are pretty formulaic and predictable, with conventions such as the cheeky, funny one who chases after women (original role model Harpo Marx?), the happy, wisecracking black doorman and the really cool veteran musician... I wont say what's predictable about their respective contributions to the narrative, because I suppose that would count as a spoiler, but if you've seen a few biopics, romantic comedies or Disney takes on how nice the world is, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves! After all, I don't want to be a politically correct kill-joy, and I understand that not all films have to make reference to interesting historical/social ironies, but to show two happy black stereotypes without a nod to the inequality of the values of the record company majors of the time seems glossy to a fault. There were elements of American Graffiti peeping through the characterisations, I suppose, but this film, whilst having comparable style, lacks substance, like a meringue.",That Thing You Do!
174,chris-5429,"Does anyone else hate the word ""film""....",5,16 May 2008,"... as a replacement for the word, ""movie""? I mean, do they even USE film anymore? I just think it's pretentious. If film was still around they could almost get away with it, but in the age of video it's DOUBLY pretentious.I really liked the movie itself, but I was 1 when the Beatles broke up, and not into history very much, so I didn't get a lot of the parallels. Even so, and even though all of the bands were fake, the music itself was pretty good. I was surprised at what you could do without genuine bands to do it; if I remember correctly, Tom Hanks wrote or co-wrote all the songs. Kudos to him, and maybe that's a good idea for a second career for him, not that he needs it. I like the movie a lot. It takes you back not only to when music was more innocent, but when America was, I think.",That Thing You Do!

All version seemed the same, the other night I saw the extended version on cable TV and was surprised about what scenes were cut out. The extended version definitely moved slower but provided additional content explaining moments in the film that I used to brush over...most importantly the hinting at the fact that Mr. White, played by Tom Hanks was gay. In the extended version he meets Guy Patterson at the hotel after he got drunk meeting Del Paxton at the Jazz Club.He then leaves the hotel and gets into a car with a man who appears to be pouting and angry that Mr. White is taking so long. They have this caddy exchange about being late to a party. This is the only scene in the entire movie that makes any insinuation that Mr. White is gay.I don't think that fact adds or detracts anything from the movie, just curious to know why it was left out.",That Thing You Do!

It was obvious that substantial research took place for this film, as great care was taken in the selection of the musical instruments, musical styles and equipment for this film.

The story line was cute, four nice, respectful young men and their band. Even though you know they are fictitious, the updates at the end of this movie made you love and care about the characters even more each time you watch the movie.You can't help but tap your feet to the great be-bop sounds of the 60's. It sounds so real for the era you can't stop thinking, ""How come I don't remember those songs?""I could really relate to Faye, as a female being associated with the band. What memories and emotions were brought back to me.  First as a child with my girlfriend's older brother and his band.  Then as a groupie for the neighborhood band in the early '70s.  I can still vividly remember sitting on the neighbor's basement steps watching and listening as the band practiced.  I loved being one of their groupies.

Still the characters represent the different types you'll come across,the egos, the clowns and the luck of being at the right place at the right time.At this point in time,it is also interesting to see how the cast members have gone on to other projects,the most recent being Liv Tyler in LOTR,Giovanni Ribisi in COLD MOUNTAIN,Thom Everett Scot in ER and I think that Hanks fellow has been around doing this and that.",That Thing You Do!

I'm not surprised of its ability to make me coming back for more and more as it exhibits the lighter side of tom hanks and his personality and his creativity in this project . yes the drummer is similar to young hangs in bossum buddies or the movie splash or big . but its his ability to feel for others and make them feel special or important that makes the character scitch work . it shows real innocence and the power of the money hungry record companies during a time where artists were exploited and taken advantage of . but more important it gave a great basis for a love story and plenty of catchy tunes besides the title song. i only wish to see tom hanks talents in a movie like this again,That Thing You Do!

You will find your self repeating some of the choice lines, especially from actor Steve Zahn. Even more surprising is that this movie can be watched without embarrassment with younger kids!!

Not only does it have a great soundtrack, showcase some incredible vintage music instruments but also has an early appearance by the now famous Liv Tyler.Having spent over 20 years in the music business combined with being a musicians daughter, this film tells it like it is. It's a very truthful behind the scenes look at what it's really like in the music business. Producers, stage shows, traveling, the television stuff. It's all a very accurate picture of how it was at the time. One of the most truthful scenes, is where the character ""Jimmy"" approaches the mighty Sol Syler (record company Pres/Owner) to get an appointment and is strongly rebuffed when Syler tells his assistant ""Will someone get Fabian out of my face!"" This film is a delightful look behind the scenes at what it's like to be on the road performing in the 60's. It's a very entertaining film and in my opinion well worth the time if you don't over analyze and just enjoy it for what it is.",That Thing You Do!
184,sjgrange,saccharine and tedious,1,4 July 2005,"Where does one begin when presented with such a dire film? A bunch of squeaky clean middle class white all American wannabe rock and rollers with one very repetitive tune scream whenever it makes the radio station. I was screaming by the end as well. Apart from the bad acting and embarrassing dialogue ('i am Spartacus')the most offensive aspect of this drivel was the representation of the black members of Tom Hanks world. Dial a cliché because here comes the bell hop who's incredibly helpful but not with the bags but distilling wisdom and sorting out their personal probs. Sure, and in this Hanks fifties dream world the white kids really dig him and not a whiff of racism can be smelt above the perfumed presentation. Then the drummer really digs the good ole blues boys and they dig him. I know i am from UK but wasn't there some race riots or something in the US around this time. Maybe i am mistaken because according to Hanks everyone got on just fine, it was more like the Truman show than any attempt to portray truth. But this is a Hanks vehicle so one must expect the picket fence sentiment rather than the harsh reality of racial strife and racial oppression.",That Thing You Do!
185,mrichmond,"A fast-paced look @ the life of a 1960's rock band. A great depiction of the look & feel of the times. In a league with movies like ""A Hard Day's Night""!",9,27 July 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. ""That Thing You Do"" is a fast-paced look @ rock 'n roll music in 1960's America. Set in Erie, Pennsylvania, the movie did a great job of re-creating the look and feel of the times. It does for 1960's teenagers what ""American Graffiti"" did for the '50's. At the same time it is not at all unlike the Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"" - 60 days in the life of a rock 'n roll band. The ensemble cast was excellent. They did a great job of depicting what '60's teenagers in America were like - a much more innocent & naive world view than that possessed by kids today. Tom Hanks also did a nice job in a limited, for him, role. He adds a little real world experience in contrast to the idealistic Wonders. The movie is worth watching for the soundtrack alone! Unlike George Lucas's ""American Graffitti"", the soundtrack here consisted entirely of works written specifically for the ""That Thing You Do"". This serves to give you the feeling that you are discovering the music of the Wonders along with the rest of the country. It's not just another re-hashing of golden oldies. The new old hits played in this movie help to create a world very similar to what really happened, yet different. The Wonders become a real group, playing their songs, rather than the millionth rendition of ""Johnnie B. Good"". If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn that the songs played by the Wonders and the other acts in the movie were actual hit songs from the '60's. The music really fit the times. It's a fun, enjoyable movie. I would recommend it for anyone!",That Thing You Do!

None of the songs were real 60's hits but they seem like they should have been. Tom Hanks spins an alternate reality that cleverly recreates a charming slice of 1964 Americana. Only a very sharp eye could notice a single detail out of place in this perfectly cast and acted movie. There doesn't seem to be an end to Tom Hanks' talent.

187,across_th_street,An absolute must for any fans of American nostalgia cinema,9,28 November 2006,"An absolute must for any fans of American nostalgia cinema. Tom Hanks evokes a fantastic impression of the sixties with his Beatlesque band. Their catchy title tune (the highlight of a delightfully cheesy yet cheery soundtrack) launches them to super stardom for 15 minutes of fame. A clever and insightful look at the music industry, cynical even in the sixties!A wonderful film, light and humorous yet with enough depth to give the film feeling. Some great casting livens up the film, Tom Everett Scott really was a young Tom Hanks, and Johnathan Shaech is capable as the prima donna 'artiste.' Steve Zahn provides his usual comedic relief and Liv Tyler is pretty good as the girl behind the new found stars. Tom Hanks himself is good as the wise old man of the music industry.Barely anything to dislike, there are the odd scenes where Liv is given some overly sentimental lines and the dialogue is a bit loose in places but overall it is a superb piece of light cinema with a great sense of nostalgia.",That Thing You Do!

189,ltramont,Go Tom Hanks!,9,25 February 2006,"""That Thing You Do"" is an excellent film on its own and Tom Hanks does yet another marvelous job as an actor in the role of a record-label rep, however, even more marvelous was the discovery that it was also a Tom Hanks production project (the first, I think). Furthermore, Hanks' production label--""Play Tone""--is also the name of the would-be record label in the movie. Discovering these parallels gave me a whole new appreciation for this movie. The film centers on a group of 5 teens (4 male musicians and the lead singer's girlfriend, Fay, who hangs with the band and helps out at gigs) who form a band in the late 50's and head to the top with their first major hit, ""That Thing You Do"". The band ecstatically leaves behind small-town Erie, Pennsylvania after offers come in and Fay accompanies them on tour under the guise of being their costume mistress. Their wide-eyed experiences outside of Erie, their naive view of the music industry and their approach to fame makes this journey funny and interesting. At the center of the story is ""Skitch"" Patterson, the band's drummer, who is substituted in at the last minute for a gig when the band's regular drummer is injured. His nervousness changes the pace of the band's music, and ultimately, their lives. The film follows Patterson's perspective of the band's experiences and it's interpersonal relationships--like that of Jimmy and Fay. Jimmy is the talented lead-singer whose songwriting gives the band it's boost to success, and Fay is his sweet and soft-spoken girlfriend who is incredibly devoted to his talent and instrumental to the band. The two have been inseparable, but as fame grows, so does Jimmy's ego, much to Fay's dismay. Skitch has his own heartbreaks and successes, which he sees behind his trademark sunglasses, earning him the nickname ""Shades"". Similar in storyline to ""The Committments"", this movie uses good humor, music, and acting to carry you through a solid, fun and, at times, tragic, script. With Tom Hanks acting AND directing, you can't go wrong with this film. It's clean enough for kids, romantic enough for dates, objective enough for diverse groups, interesting enough to own (watch over and over), and easy to follow. I enjoy it immensely.",That Thing You Do!
