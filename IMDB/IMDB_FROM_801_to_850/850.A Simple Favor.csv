0,TheLittleSongbird,Secrets worth uncovering,8,28 September 2018,"Heard a lot of good things about 'A Simple Favour', love mystery/crime films, love a lot of comedy, there are examples of great films that mix both very well and really loved the idea. It was interesting to see Paul Feig do something different to his comedy films and adopt a change of pace (something that has been very variable in film) and the cast intrigued. It looked good too. Luckily, 'A Simple Favour' lived up to high expectations. It is far from a simple film and that is to its credit, without being confused. Everything that 'A Simple Favour' was seen for don't disappoint and it is an example of a film that didn't waste its potential at all thankfully, having seen so many potential wastes recently that was refreshing, and even exceeds it. Not perfect by all means, but definitely a film well worth watching with secrets that intrigue and are worth uncovering.'A Simple Favour's' final act/third is sadly a let down. It does start to drag at this point and then feels over-stuffed and muddled.Further unravelled by a very far-fetched and less-than-probable ending, with the credibility strained to breaking point.However, it is very stylishly shot with very elegant production design that matches the subtle comedy and dark tension in the thriller elements very well. Feig does very well directing a type of film atypical for him, while the script balances the comedy and thriller/mystery elements with smart aplomb. There are funny moments and others that bite the nails. The story is compelling throughout with some very surprising twists that don't confuse or lack credulity, it is not a simple story while not being convoluted on the most part. There is plenty of tension and a surprisingly dark tone to the thriller/mystery elements that blends with the sometimes subtly perky sometimes deliciously farcical comedy deftly instead of jarring. The pace is not dull for much of the film. The characters are fun and the chemistry natural. Particularly well done in this regard is that between the two leads, which is the very meaning of killer whether in the witty sparring or adorably bonding, an unlikely one that works wonders. All the cast are spot on, Andrew Rannells and Rupert Friend are standouts in support but it's all about the leads and they can't be faulted. Anna Kendrick is adorable and charming even when not the brightest bulb on the block or smartest person in the world, while Blake Lively is deliciously vamp-ish.Overall, very enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox",A Simple Favor
1,SnoopyStyle,darkest ending needed,7,2 August 2019,"Widower Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) is a try-hard mom at her young son Miles' school. She goes on her vlog to tell her viewers about her best friend who disappeared five days ago. She had first met Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) some weeks earlier. Emily is also a school mom but completely different. She's a fashionista as the head of PR for a fashion house. Her husband Sean Townsend (Henry Golding) had written an impressive book a decade ago but nothing else since.Directed by Paul Feig, this is a black comedy crime thriller. I really like Kendrick's sly comedic timing and she works well with the statuesque Blake Lively. I almost wish that Kendrick turns out to be a psycho killer. It would be an interesting character for her to play. As a mystery, it's quickly solve by the performances. Kendrick refuses to suggest that she's a killer and Golding is incapable of the acting range. At the moment the body is found, I assumed it to be someone else. The police really needs to say the words, ""The DNA confirms her identity."" There is also an interesting fact that I know about identical twins which breaks this premise. Twins have different fingerprints. I have never heard of identical fingerprints. There is simply no way that the body could be misidentified unless some malpractice occurred. Sometimes, movie logic has to win out and one must accept that. I really like the sly dark comedic tone and I wanted more. My main complaint is the third act. It's trying too hard to finesse a twisty happy ending when the movie doesn't want it. It would be better to have a darker simpler ending. I would cut out Stephanie putting something in Sean's computer and the police arrest and the final attempt at a confession. I would replace that whole third act with the simple fake murder suicide as Emily wants. Emily getting her $4 million and her son. The movie deserves the darkest of endings.",A Simple Favor
2,boblipton,If Only The Hallmark Channel Did As Well,7,13 October 2018,"Is there anyone here willing to admit, as I do, that he watches the Hallmark Channel's original movies? For as long as I can recall, TCM has been sandwiched between the Hallmark Channel and Bravo, with Lifetime just above Hallmark. When I use the Guide button to figure out what TCM movies to record for later watching, there they are.I got tired of Lifetime pretty quickly, since it was all cozy mysteries about random women who are so much better than the cops, except they always wound up trapped by the maniac with low back lighting. That's how you knew they were about to be trapped: they went to low back lighting; I looked at my watch to see there is between 18 and 11 minutes left. I waited for them to be rescued by the handsome guy.So that grew old quickly, and I gave up Lifetime. Hallmark was a different matter. They had a few women's detective series, usually starring a good actress in her thirties. She has a job that doesn't look like a job (which are the most time-consuming in reality). She lives in a bright, prosperous town that looks like it's the 1950s, except the heroine has a Black friend. I invariably suspect it will turn out that they were kidnapped by flying saucers and are living, brains wiped, in a zoo, where scientists test their theories by killing off clones and seeing how the colony reacts.I won't mention the romcoms because, a few directed by Ron Oliver aside -- pause to check if Mr. Oliver has bettered himself... post-production on his first big-screen release in ten years, GRAND-DADDY DAY CARE. Guess not. Pity -- they were identical in plot, settings (when you're looking at a movie set in Alaska in December and the maples have green leaves the and sun wakes the hero at 6:15 in the morning, you know they didn't waste money on research), leads and tweedly scores that told you how you were supposed to react to this scene. Max Steiner and Carl Stalling could take lessons on mickey-mousing from Hallmark's composers. They did have some old actors in support, making bricks without straw, but... well, when Hallmark moved the mysteries to another channel, hundreds of spaces away in the listing, I stopped watching.I mention this because -- do you know my brother told me a couple of weeks ago that I ramble? I don't know what he's talking about, since it's a poor theory that has a solitary confirming experiment, and writers who fail to amuse their audiences will soon have none. Well, maybe it was the lawyer we were paying to listen he had in mind -- A SIMPLE FAVOR is the sort of mystery the Hallmark Channel would produce if they could afford to. Or gave a d**n.Anna Kendrick is a single school mother who terrorizes all the others. She volunteers for everything, bakes delicious vegan GMO- and gluten-free whatnots at the drop of a hat. She is also a vlogger, with a channel on how to make all the other members of the PTA drop dead (although she's much too nice to even think about that). Her son makes friends with another boy. His mother is Blake Lively, a beautiful and sophisticated woman who lives in a magnificent post-Frank Lloyd Wright house in the ritziest neighborhood in this ritzy town in Connecticut. She's the anti-muse of a man who wrote one great book and hasn't been able to put a word on paper in ten years. He teaches at a college, but she pulls down the big money managing publicity for a clothing magnate in Manhattan. She teaches Anna how to make the perfect martini, winkles out her dirtiest secrets. One day she phones from Manhattan, asking Anna to pick up her son. Then she disappears off the face of the earth. Then her corpse turns up in a lake in Michigan. Then she rearranges Anna's shoe closet.It' s a heck of a performance by Miss Lively, and this being a Paul Feig movie, there are some very funny bits in it, including a hilarious turn by Rupert Friend as Miss Lively's employer. But it's really a Hallmark Movie done right. Except for the cinematography. It's the same easy camerawork. Well, maybe that's meant as a snide comment of Hallmark.",A Simple Favor
3,Prismark10,A Simple Favour,6,15 November 2020,"A Simple Favour is a strange hybrid of a comedy that becomes a dark thriller. It is almost a parody version of Gone Girl.Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) is a vlogger who has experienced tragedy. A car accident killed her husband and half brother and she is raising her young son alone.The perky Stephanie meets acerbic Emily (Blake Lively) one day who is also picking up her son from school. She is a hard as nails fashion PR executive.Both become unlikely friends and one day Emily asks Stephanie to pick up her son and then Emily disappears.A worried Stephanie uses her vlog to for Emily's whereabouts and in time she gets close to Emily's husband Sean (Henry Golding.)Later a body is found that matches Emily but later her young son mentions that he has seen her mommy.Paul Feig who is more used to making comedies struggles to get the balance right with this movie. The beginning of the movie is preposterous as it takes a mean and malicious type comedy path. Stephanie admits to have had an affair with her half brother as she gets drunk with Emily.It only moves up gears in the climax when Sean is in the frame for his wife's disappearance, there is also the matter of extra life insurance that was taken out. Some dark secrets about Emily also emerges.It suddenly becomes a lot like the movie Sleuth but with more plot holes. Stephanie needs to get smarter and less trusting if she wants to play mind games.I did think Kendrick was miscast, she reminded me too much of the kind of characters she has played previously. Lively did some of her best work.",A Simple Favor

Her son attends Warfield Elementary where she meets Emily (Blake Lively) a well to do woman whose son also goes there. The women get together and share secrets and martinis the way I like them. Her husband Sean (Henry Golding) is an author. They hit it off well. One day Emily disappears and Stephanie becomes a super mom sleuth. The film is more of a dark comedy than drama, but only smile funny. Anne Kendrick and Blake Lively nailed their roles. Guide: F-word. Nude painting. Anne Kendrick sex scene. Incest.

5,Sleepin_Dragon,Really enjoyed it.,8,30 September 2018,"It doesn't surprise me to learn that a Simple Favour has done rather well during its early release. It's a super stylish film, very unusual, hard to categorise, but its original, thrilling, packed with intrigue, and surprisingly very funny.I had no idea the film contained so many laughs, but they all felt in keeping with the tone of the film. Blake Lively looked incredible, and packed in huge presence when on screen, Anna Kendrick was funny and charming, I thought the pair combined very well.The story was engaging, it was fun, clever, I look forward to the Blu ray. 8/10",A Simple Favor
6,lee_eisenberg,Paul Feig continues his good work,9,2 January 2019,"So far, Paul Feig has directed ""Bridesmaids"", ""The Heat"" and the criminally underrated ""Ghostbusters"". I liked all these, and I liked his latest work, ""A Simple Favor"". It's a reminder that no one truly knows anyone. The particularly impressive part was how they let the plot unfold, so that Anna Kendrick's character could discover what was going on. I recommend it.The rest of the cast includes Blake Lively, Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians) and Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain).",A Simple Favor
7,tavm,A Simple Favor is quite a funny comedic take on the thriller,8,20 September 2018,"After a week of hoping to watch this movie, me and my movie theatre-working friend finally got to just now. With Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively the leading ladies and Henry Golding the leading man, this was quite a thrillingly funny adventure, that's for sure! Director Paul Feig moves things along at a swift pace that one almost has to catch a breath to keep up with all the twists coming! Kudos also for supporting turns like Jean Smart for her role as an elderly parent of one of the leading ladies and former star of Feig's TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"", Linda Cardellini, as a painter who tells Anna about a secret of Blake's that seems to really unravel things real quick! So me and my friend highly recommend A Simple Favor.",A Simple Favor
8,BandSAboutMovies,A movie as unsure of itself as its main character,5,8 October 2018,"Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick from Twilight and Pitch Perfect) is a craft vlogger and single mom who constantly outdoes every other parent through sheer energy. But under her mania lies some pretty dark secrets and little to no real friends, not to mention a man. Emily (Blake Lively) is also a working mom, but is more known as a PR director for a major fashion company. These women couldn't be more different - Stephanie prefers to hide in the background and apologize while Emily isn't afraid to stand out and offend everybody.The friendship between their children brings them together and the playdates their kids have to build the foundation for their fast friendship. They are soon trading confessions: Emily is frustrated with her husband's lack of success. And Stephanie slept with her half-brother and may have had a child with him, which led to the death of both him and her husband.Emily then asks for that simple favor: can Stephanie babysit Nicky while Sean is in London and she has to tend to a work emergency? That favor extends for days as Emily goes missing. And once her body is found in a Michigan lake, all hell breaks loose.That's when this movie descends into the twists and turns of a whodunit (but not a giallo, as much as I was wanting some black gloved killings and Ivan Rassimov to show up), with Stephanie caught in the midst of Emily's psychotic ways, Sean's devotion to her and her suddenly growing popularity amongst the local moms and her internet audience.The film goes way over the deep end, bringing in the giallo staples of the unknown twin (actually triplet) and a family history of violence and insanity. Jean Smart shows up for all of a minute as Emily's mother here. A Simple Favor is the first movie that Paul Feig has directed since his divisive Ghostbusters reboot. I enjoyed the style in the film and the soundtrack, particularly the usage of Brigitte Bardot and Serge Gainsbourg's Bonnie and Clyde (actually, the film has multiple Bardot songs).This is a movie unsure of what movie it really wants to be. Is it a mystery? Is it a comedy? Is it both? It never truly becomes anything, wildly shifting in tone to the point of absurdity - and not in a good way. That said, Lively and Kendrick are quite good in this, much better than anyone else in the film.I always ask Becca if she has anything she wants to add to our review. She said that she'd give this movie a D or an F, because she wanted it to be closer to the thriller the trailer promised. And she wonders if Anna Kendrick only plays the parts of ditzy nice girls who apologize too much and get into shenanigans all the time, to which I answered, ""Yes, I think that's pretty much who she is in real life.""",A Simple Favor
9,CinemaSerf,Lively and enjoyable.,7,18 November 2020,"Anna Kendrick is ""Stephanie"", a widowed mumsy type of character who runs a twee vlog about how to make artichoke smoothies. When she picks up her young son from school one day, she encounters the glamorous mother of a friend of her son's - ""Emily"" (Blake Lively) and a friendship ensues over the odd Martini or two. When one day ""Emily"" asks her to look after her young son after school and then goes AWOL, ""Stephanie"" utilises her online presence - and eye-candy Henry Golding (""Sean"") who had a seemingly happy marriage to our missing dypso - to track her down. What follows is a rather fun sleuthing escapade as she discovers that ""Emily"" has/had quite a complicated, even incendiary, past and for much of the film the three of them work well together with a decent, if sometimes quite ""ripe"" script. The ending, however, is convoluted and just plain stupid - it really lets the whole thing down. Lively and Kendrick are both on good form and are clearly enjoying themselves, though - and I don't suppose you'd kick Golding out of bed for eating Oreos, so it's still quite a decent late night watch - you just have to overlook the silly season last fifteen minutes.",A Simple Favor
10,view_and_review,Ugh,2,3 January 2019,"Years ago a world record holding Olympic sprinter by the name of Carl Lewis sang the national anthem. It was painful, it was irritating, and it was awkward. Kind of like this movie. But wait there's more! It was also vulgar, depraved, and low brow. Am I being to critical? I don't want people to believe I loathed the movie when I simply hated it.For starters there wasn't a single endearing character. There were three main characters, all three were deplorable in their own unique way. Let's see... there was Sean (Henry Golding), the romantic English husband of the ""best friend."" He was a spineless walking erection that had no moral fiber.There was the ""best friend"", Emily (Blake Lively), who was a lying conniving witch. She was probably the most likeable character because she offset the main character, Stephanie (Anna Kendrick).Stephanie was by far the most annoying of the triumvirate. She was a naïve, do-gooder, mommy vlogger, with a permanent clueless smile, and the nervous habits of an Elaine Benes of Seinfeld without the likeability of Elaine Benes.So those were the characters, which were bad enough. The story was just as bad if not worse. The characters all did very inexplicable sexually strange things and they made Stephanie such an inconsistent character that she went from naïve Pollyanna that made a best friend in one week to a savvy crime solving Nancy Drew. It did not fit.All of that could have been forgiven if the movie was funny. Had they gone the all-out comedy route then all of these cinema sins could have been forgiven. I got the sense that they were going for comedy but it failed so fabulously at that as well that I couldn't credit them for that even. This movie just ended up being a horrible reason for me to miss sorely needed sleep so that I could be fresh for work the next day.",A Simple Favor
11,neil-476,Enoyable mystery which isn't the comedy you might think,8,6 October 2018,"Widowed single Mom Stephanie is one of those annoying people who is incredibly organised, and always manages to do everything (including her household tips and cookery vlog) incredibly efficiently. This turns out to mask some fairly serious issues of self-doubt, as becomes clear when she strikes up a friendship with Emily: their sons are in the same class. Then Emily asks Stephanie to collects her son from school and goes missing...Anna Kendrick is Stephanie and Blake Lively is Emily. Paul Feig directs. Kendrick and Feig have strong histories of comedy, but the trailer sells this as a mystery. When you start watching it, there are plenty of material which is clearly oriented towards comedy - Kendrick's over-compensating insecure super-mom is straight out of sitcom-land, with a bunch of one-liners - yet the film is played straight, and the funny material amuses on one level, but doesn't actually provoke laughs. Then Emily goes missing and Stephanie starts vlogging her concerns, and the whole thing suddenly shifts into a darker gear.I rather liked this. At one point I found myself thinking that the story was silly, but the script has been thought through and all these points were covered. The ending, which was very satisfying from the climax onwards was satisfying and contained one outright laugh, which actually asn't very funny at all! But the uneasy combination of straightforward mystery coated with comedy trappings worked well in creating a film which, happily, didn't conform to any genre expectations.",A Simple Favor
12,ferguson-6,an odd mixture of mystery and folly,6,13 September 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. In the vein of Gillian Flynn/David Fincher's GONE GIRL and Paula Hawkins/Tate Taylor's THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN comes yet another vanishing woman mystery. This latest is based on Darcey Bell's novel (screenplay by Jessica Sharzer), only this time the biggest twist comes with the selection of Paul Feig as director. That's right, the director best known for BRIDESMAIDS and other comedies, tackles a 'whodunit and what did they do'. Neurotic Mommy Vlogger Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) is a widowed mother to a young son, and she's the overly perky and perfect mom that causes other parents to sneer and snark behind her back. She's also so desperate for human connection that she's willing to befriend Emily (Blake Lively), the martini-guzzling fashion industry executive who is a hands-off mother to Stephanie's son's friend. We soon learn that martinis and playdates shouldn't be mixed.Stephanie and Emily share dark, personal secrets. Emily discusses the financial woes she and her husband Sean (Henry Golding, CRAZY RICH ASIANS) are experiencing, even though they live in an ultra-modern mansion. He had success with his first novel, but has been hit with writer's block since marrying Emily. Those secrets pale in comparison to what Stephanie unloads, leading Emily to anoint her with a crass (though quite accurate) label that no one would relish. Of course we later uncover Emily's truly dark (and deadly) secrets go far beyond possible late payments on the mortgage.As the two ladies bond, we get the feeling that Emily is playing some type of game with the always-cheerful Stephanie, though to what end we aren't sure. One day, Stephanie does Emily a ""favor"" and then Emily disappears without a trace or word. The days pass and a sexual energy develops between Stephanie and Sean, while Stephanie users her Vlog as a tool in her amateur sleuthing. It's tough enough to pull off a mystery, but a mystery-comedy is nearly the unicorn of cinema. Director Feig is at his best in the comedic moments - especially those featuring banter between Ms. Kendrick and Ms. Lively. Their scenes together are the highlights of the film ... well, those and the French pop soundtrack, including ""Ca S'est Arrange"" over an opening credit sequence that is itself, worthy of admission. The film is oddly structured, yet still entertaining. Act I is really a dark comedy and budding friendship between polar opposite personality types, while the rest is a messy mystery with some interesting elements.Strong support work comes courtesy of Andrew Rannells, Aparla Nancherla, Kelly McCormack, and Jean Smart, though two standouts are Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") as Emily's boss and a character seemingly straight out of ZOOLANDER, and Linda Cardellini (""Bloodlines"") as an unhinged artist tied to Emily's past. The downside is that most of these scenes add to the comedy-sketch feel, which clashes so harshly with the mystery element that the sharp edge needed in the script becomes quite dulled.Most every director dreams of being Hitchcockian, and that dream tends to push them towards this genre. Unfortunately, most end up disappointed, their films end up disappointing, and the genius and difficulty of what Hitchcock achieved is reinforced. It's clear Director Feig is a fan of the genre, as he includes nods to DIABOLIQE, GASLIGHT, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, and even Nancy Drew. However, acknowledging classic noir isn't enough to qualify for the label. The film has its moments, Ms. Kendrick is once again stellar in her role, and most viewers will find it entertaining despite the messiness.",A Simple Favor
13,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Are you Les Diaboliqueing me?""",7,27 March 2019,"With the schools breaking up this week for Easter,I looked for a film that I could view with a friend (when she is not being kept busy by her kids during the holiday!) Hearing about the title,I was happy to find it on DVD at a good price on eBay,which led to me favouring a viewing:View on the film:From the 60's inspired opening credits, the skill director Paul Feig displays here makes it a mystery as to why he had done the Ghostbusters remake instead of a more unique item, (not counting the Sony money,or free Cheeeesy Burger-the burgers so cheesy it has extra e's in cheesy.) His first somewhat serious title since 2003's I Am David, Feig & cinematographer John Schwartzman take Feig's brightly lit stylizing for Comedy,and delightfully twist it towards Thriller and the Neo-Noir genres by having the bright lighting and vibrant colours act as a façade to the murky dealings behind the white walls and bright windows. More measured than his comedies due to a lack of improvisation, Feig displays an unexpected eye for turning a corkscrew atmosphere of tension,in Emily's wearing of three piece suits (inspired by Feig's own suits!) giving her an icy masculine edge,and slithering tracking shots following Stephanie search for Emily.For the first 80 minutes in adapting Darcey Bell's novel, Jessica Sharzer keeps the black comedy in mystery Thriller velvet gloves, with Sharzer enticingly pouring out Emily and Stephanie's friendship from laid-back and kooky to venomous snakes snapping at each other. Taking care in laying out the main friendship and the mystery, Sharzer undermines what has been set up with an awkward surge into more advert comedy, which dent the twists from landing a full punch, and sits uneasily next to the revaluations made about Emily. Looking beautiful and deadly when sipping drinks,Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively give sparkling turns,with Lively giving Emily a silky viciousness under the surface, and Kendrick chipping away at Stephanie cheery smile,as Emily asks for a simple favour.",A Simple Favor
14,gradyharp,"'Oh, you don't want to be friends with me, trust me.'",9,6 January 2019,"A SIMPLE FAVOR began as a novel by Darcey Bell (who co wrote the screenplay with Jessica Sharzer) and the film is a mélange of mystery and comedy that is in need of story editing towards the end. What begins as an unlikely friendship with favors turns into a brutal mystery. Director Paul Feig tries to hold the story together but in the end the closing becomes tedious.Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) is a widowed single mother who runs a vblog (a visual blog) with crafts and recipes. Emily (Blake Lively) is a busy working mother, a PR director for a fashion company, whose son Nicky attends the same elementary school as Stephanie's son, Miles. Emily and Stephanie become fast friends, arranging play dates for the boys. They trade confessions, and Stephanie admits that as a teenager, she had sex with her half-brother, Chris (Dustin Milligan). Emily expresses her frustration at the lack of success of her husband, English professor Sean Townsend (Henry Golding), and their poor financial situation. Emily has a work crisis and asks Stephanie to babysit Nicky, as Sean is in London. After two days of Emily not responding to calls, Stephanie calls Emily's employer, Dennis Nylon (Rupert Friend), and he tells her she is in Miami. Stephanie calls Sean, who calls the police. Emily had told both Stephanie and Sean that she hates having her picture taken, leading Stephanie to sneak into Emily's work and find a photo, which she uses to create missing person posters. Though the disappearance of Emily is enacted that fact that Emily has a twin sister enters the knowledge of the e other characters much later and adds a twist to the resolution of the story.Both Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick are excellent in these challenging roles and the remainder of the cast is equally strong. Henry Golding ('Crazy Rich Asians' lead) is especially fine, as is the tiny character created by Rupert Friend. The language is definitely R rated. The two-hour running time could comfortably be reduced to 90 minutes without any loss of storyline and a LOT of reduction in extraneous detail.",A Simple Favor

And there is nothing wrong with my sense of humor so that can't be it. The beginning of the movie was not very promising, at least not for a fifty year old guy like me. It looked, without being a sexist, something women would enjoy more than me. But at one point there was some mystery and that made it worth continuing watching.

The story centers around Emily(Blake Lively) a socialite and trophy wife type who's caught up in the madness of her high life with her husband and son, as she has a past many don't know about. A lot changes upon meeting Stephanie(Anna Kendrick) a you tube type food blogger and when the two become friends this film takes a spin of twists as it's a deadly game of cat and mouse. And along the way all of the themes of lust, trust, anger, fear, and denial are felt. As when Emily goes missing the game gets complex as things are spiced up by sex, death, discovery, and many twist and turns are found as the plot is drama filled.

It was directed by Paul Feig, scripted by Jessica Sharzer, and based on the 2017 novel (of the same name) by Darcey Bell. It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it quite a bit, mostly.

19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Not simply a retread of its sub-genre; generally unpredictable, usually entertaining and always engaging.",6,24 September 2018,"'A Simple Favour (2018)' manages to avoid most of its genre's clichés and, as such, it's never especially predictable, at least as it all unfolds. It does unavoidably lean on a rather large trope in a pretty big way, one that becomes clearer towards the flick's slightly silly finale, but this still isn't entirely rote and comes more from character than anything else (that is to say, it doesn't feel forced to fit the plot). That emphasis on character is present throughout the story and you're never quite sure exactly where everyone sits, with dark secrets and hidden lies being themes that run throughout (though I feel the protagonist's backstory is almost 'edgy' for the sake of it), which creates this almost uneasy atmosphere and adds to the picture's general unpredictable nature. Though the pacing is quite lax during the first third and some of the dialogue, including some slightly out-of-place narration, isn't as sharp as it perhaps could've been, this is an enjoyable and engaging film that does a good job of getting you invested in its core players - to the point that some late-game set-ups are incredibly frustrating to watch - while keeping their true motives as secret as possible. It's an interesting experience throughout and, despite its few issues (including a couple of minor plot problems I haven't mentioned), it rarely fails to entertain. 6/10",A Simple Favor
20,ThomasDrufke,Pleasantly Surprising,8,23 September 2018,"It may not be Gone Girl, but A Simple Favor boasts something that is one of the single hardest things a film can do, a great mix between comedy and drama. Being witty isn't new to Paul Feig, considering he's done some of the funniest female-led comedies of the last decade, but A Simple Favor shows a different side to Feig. A Simple Favor is almost like a satirical mystery, with Blake Lively doing things that hover around a spoof of Rosamund Pike's turn in Gone Girl, without ever making fun of it. And that's where the brilliance lies, with Lively and Anna Kendrick's electric chemistry.

21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,13 December 2018,"A Simple FavorThe hardest part of being a mother is updating everyone on how hard it is being a mother.Luckily, the child bearer in this thriller has a blog to keep the world abreast.Single mom Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) becomes enamored with Emily (Blake Lively), her author husband (Henry Golding) and their lifestyle after their sons share a date. So, when Emily asks Stephanie to pick her son up after school, the mommy blogger is more than happy to comply. But when Emily never comes to collect her child, Stephanie finds herself drawn into a world of sex, lies and secrets.While the overall mystery has a twinge of intrigue at first, the final reveal reeks of movie-of-the-week cliché. Moreover, director Paul Feig adds so many comedic elements and misplaced jokes that it's hard to take anything serious.Incidentally, once your mommy blog starts making money you can hire a nanny.

It has very good script and solid directing, as well terrific performance by Anna Kendrick - she is a charmer. Others were OK. The story was intriguing and it was well told.

23,atlasmb,Do Yourself A Big Favor And See This Film,10,7 October 2018,"Films that don't know what they want to be are often criticized for lacking clarity of purpose. Here is a film that purports to be a crime thriller and a comedy, yet deserves credit for somehow making it work, probably due the efforts of Director Paul Feig. This is not your ordinary film. It is comedic. It is dark, but it is not a dark comedy. It manages to remain light-hearted throughout. This, combined with its excellent acting performances, earns it ten stars in my judgment. It also has a plot full of twists. ""A Simple Favor"" is a joy to watch.Anna Kendrick plays the main role of Stephanie Smothers. Blake Lively plays Emily Nelson, her counterweight. Anna is a combination of Martha Stewart and the Country Mouse. She hosts a daily vlog about homemaking and how to dedicate oneself to the joys of being a perfect mother. She is naïve and conservative and seemingly self-satisfied. Or is she? She meets Emily, a seemingly sophisticated City Mouse whose fashion sense is Dior-meets-Flashdance. She is always ready to reveal something shocking, always ready for the next vermouth-starved martini.Somehow these two become best friends. Or do they? The film keeps the viewer guessing as to character motivations and what one is actually seeing. And it is very confident in its tone and structure, which makes the viewing experience quite enjoyable.My favorite thing about this film is Anna Kendrick's ability to juggle competing personality aspects of her character, to show real growth of her character, and to make it look totally organic, not a conscious effort.",A Simple Favor
24,westsideschl,Not Sure,6,2 January 2019,"Flip flopping between comedy and tragedy, aka tragicomedy works if you're Shakespeare otherwise good luck. Kendrick as a mom crafts/cooking video blogger (e.g. YouTube) goes on a detecting crusade for a missing ""friend"". Unfortunately Kendrick was flat & easily tiresome after a bit of time. The tragic part also came across as a bit comedic and seemed shallow - no substance. A few plot twisties, some predictable, make the 90 min. tolerable. All the other roles came across as stereotypically shallow. Not quite sure if that was meant to be (i.e. to fit with the comedic part).",A Simple Favor

26,cruise01,A campy fun thriller.,8,20 December 2018,"A Simple Favor (4 out of 5 stars).A Simple Favor is a twisted, stylistic, and a fun mystery thriller film. It surpassed my expectations with its mystery plot, twist and turns with the story, and Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively performance was outstanding. The trailer did not show much besides Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) a single widowed mother who runs a vlog of cooking recipes. Who befriends with another mother Emily (Blake Lively) a busy director for a fashion company. There sons attend the same school. Stephanie high positive personality is trying to figure out Emily. She hates pictures being taken of her, she was amazed by the love affection her and her husband Sean (Henry Golding) share which makes them seem like the perfect couple. Until one day, Emily went missing. Were they all assume she went on a long business trip. When her work denies the trip. Stephanie becomes suspicious of her disappearance which she can not trust anyone. And trying to learn who Emily really is? Or figuring out Emily's past.The plot was surprisingly good. It is best to see without reading or hearing much more about the story without going into spoiler territory. There are twists and turns with the plot. It does have a campy fun direction from Paul Feig. Plus Anna Kendrick's down to earth and being super nice personality was a lot of fun to see. Then, Blake Lively's performance which was the opposite of her with a stuck up, rich personality. Seeing them both perform together was a lot of fun. Henry Golding was also good as well playing Lively's husband. A struggling writer with financial trouble.Overall, A Simple Favor is a good mystery thriller film. Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively were good with their characters. The plot had a twisted concept which does have a dark turn in tone and a fun campy direction. And Paul Feig managed to make those two different tones work well.",A Simple Favor

The leads of Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively were great casting as their portrayals felt genuine and lifelike.The film keeps you guessing and keeps you engaged during its course.

It was a good ending, although perhaps somewhat rushed.",A Simple Favor
28,eddie_baggins,A stylish but instantly forgettable thriller,5,20 September 2018,"An odd mix of thriller and social commentary, sprinkled with comedic samplings, A Simple Favor see's longstanding comedy heavyweight Paul Feig graduate from Bridesmaids, The Heat and The Spy to deliver his most curious film yet, that whilst possessing brief, fleeting moments of brilliance, is the type of experience that once watched, will never need to be watched again.A highly stylised and OTT production, Favour is like Gone Girl done by the Kardashian's, with the two film's featuring some eerily similar similarities (that would be entering spoiler territory should they be mentioned) with Feig and his willing cast led by sassy ladies Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, delivering an offering that never quite gels in any of its genres, with my personal take being that the film should be watched with a mind that it's a dark comedy at heart.Another important facet of the film to take to mind is the fact Favor features a highly implausible narrative, filled with a number of instances that will require a leap of faith around its happenings and for me it was a leap I often couldn't take, disallowing me to fully engage with the film's tale, whereas others may find that things happen in a perfectly natural and believable way, making Favor a highly entertaining and savvy piece of work.Telling the tale of Anna Kendrick's single mum vlogger with a heart of gold Stephanie Smothers and her friendship with Blake Liveley's cold-hearted corporate mother and unhappily married Emily Nelson, that turns into a missing person's case/messy romance, Favor is a jam-packed 2 hour feature filled with a number of twists and turns (most of which aren't all that surprising) that culminates in a fashion that will leave many wondering if it was all worth it in the end.One thing that can't be questioned about the film, outside of Lively's ability to pull off fashion many of us wouldn't dream of inhabiting, is the commitment of its two leading ladies (with Crazy Rich Asian's breakout star Henry Golding more or less just along for the ride) who give it their all playing characters that are equally annoying and unlikeable in nature.Whenever Kendrick and Lively share their limited screen time together, Favor reaches higher levels than when they're doing their own thing and one wishes that the two were given more to do as a shared presence to help Favor out of its frequent slumps in between.Final Say - A unique offering, that never the less remains mostly forgettable, A Simple Favor is an odd mix of ideas and tones that whilst featuring some committed central performances and a highly glossy sheen, is a film that offers very little outside of its shiny cosmetics and overblown narrative.2 half-brothers out of 5",A Simple Favor
29,TheMovieDiorama,"A Simple Favour has all the tasty ingredients for a thrilling martini: sex, deceit and savage comedy.",8,29 July 2019,"Feig, generally known for his high-calibre comedies and remake of a classic 80s ghoulish adventure (ending up being the most disliked film trailer of all time), endeavours into the world of thrillers. Little did he know, that he would be tampering with my favourite genre. So here we are, with a joyous domestic thriller that initially had me worried with its vapidly insubstantial approach. Would it be as menial and anaemic as Kendrick's effortlessly awkward demeanour? Well, with the ""Cardellinisance"" in full swing, there was no way this could've gone sour. Unless it turned out to be 'The Curse of My Sharona' (damn you...). An over-motherly single mother, who adores vlogging about making friendship bracelets, attempts to solve the disappearance of her new, mysterious yet rich and beautiful ""best friend"".First things first. Nullify those expectations. The sole reason why this film received unanimous praise, was how it caught many viewers off guard with its intricately written black comedy. Oh, and secondly, do not take it with the same seriousness of say something like 'Silence of the Lambs'. Not even the same calibre on the thriller scale. Now that we've got that out of the way, A Simple Favour was bloody brilliant! A mystery that will keep you theorising and questioning every character onscreen until you have manually exhausted every possible avenue. A thriller with enough plot twists to maintain that precarious perching on the edge of your seat. And a black comedy with ingeniously used subtle humour, that the hysterics equalled the stimulation.Remember a time when thrillers weren't necessarily soaked in blood, horror and psychological perplexity? Feig does. He recalled a time when mysteries were simply just fun. Immediately from the stylistic title sequence, I knew his directing style would fit the genre transition perfectly. And sure, aside from the odd sex scene that had pop music accompanied with it, as if it was some next level '50 Shades of Grey' pornography, his flamboyantly eccentric style was enough to keep the humour afloat. The slow motion flashbacks is just one example of his style put to excellent use.However, what really charges the underlying feministic power, is Sharzer's screenplay. Hands down, one of the best screenplays I've ever had the joy of acknowledging. To balance humour with twisted thrills is so incredibly difficult to get right. The balance could skew at any moment. But she nailed it. The tone was consistently light, even when dabbling into incrimination and murder, that I never once doubted the possible mismatch of flavours. Whether it be Lively repeatedly uttering ""brother *insert frickin' expletive*"" or such lines like ""I let you tear my labia as you exited my body"", the writing was always on point. Impressed to say the least.Then we come to the perfect casting of Kendrick and Lively, both exhuming their typical roles and effortlessly powering through. Kendrick as her usual awkward archetype ('The Accounant', 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates', 'Up In The Air'...I could go on...) and Lively realising her 'Age of Adaline' role once again. But the two bounce off each other so well, occasionally dabbling into psychological delusion, that is felt natural. Friend as a autocratic fashion designer. Cardellini. My God this woman! Just Velma trying to solve the mystery as well in her swaggy leather boots, is enough to make me fully recommend this feature. The gradual pace is nearly retained throughout, however dips towards the third act when certain reveals happen. Fortunately, it prevents itself from being convoluted and gets back on track for the last remaining minutes.Simply put, A Simple Favour is one heck of a fun thriller, and reminds us all that we can have fun whilst being a pathological liar. Stylish, twisted and perfectly acted. It shall be rewatched, I'm sure of that. Can we just appreciate how gorgeous Lively is? Never mind her being lucky, Reynolds should be the lucky one!",A Simple Favor

31,matthewssilverhammer,So Much for Making Up for the Ghostbusters Reboot...,3,21 September 2018,"If you're looking for a great mystery in theaters, see ""Searching."" However, if you want that mystery to be completely ludicrous and tonally chaotic, then see ""A Simple Favor,"" a movie so stupid I could barely hear it over my own groans, or see it past my own eye-rolls. Where the best crime stories only get more compelling with each turn (again... ""Searching""), each in this soap-opera-esque drivel just made me want it all to end.Anna Kendrick plays a single mother whose ""best friend"" (Blake Lively) asks her to watch her child, then suddenly goes missing. Playing like a much lighter ""Gone Girl,"" it's an unabashedly pulpy, Saturday-morning-on-USA-network mystery with splashes of director Paul Feig's signature brand of humor, a balance that never even comes close to working. Even with two truly strong and entertainingly seedy female lead performances, the material is just much too confused and immature. Lame motifs (internet live-streaming), astonishingly bad and convoluted exposition, and intellectually offensive ""twists"" rule the day.It's really a shame; Feig is such a talented comedic director (""Bridesmaids,"" ""Spy""), for him to so miss the mark here. When the movie is purely reaching for laughs, which to be fair it does pretty often, it succeeds. Even toward the end, when the darkness and humor start to coalesce at the climax, you can see the seeds of something good. Unfortunately, the awkward tonal shifts and completely uninteresting drama make me think Feig should stick to strict comedy. But who knows? Based on the all-women crowd I saw this with, who seemed into every moment, this could be a case of something just not being ""for me."" At minimum, that is an undeniable truth.",A Simple Favor

35,paul-allaer,Mystery (with a light touch) simply falls short,4,23 September 2018,"""A Simple Favor"" (2018 release; 117 min.) brings the story of Stephanie. As the movie opens, we see Stephanie doing her ""Hi, Moms!"" vlog, where she informs us that her best friend Emily now has been missing for five days. We then go back in time to start from the very beginning, how Stephanie meets Emily as their boys are in the same class. Emily, married to Sean, seemingly couldn't be more different from Stephanie, but the two hit it off and soon they are exchanging confessional (sex) secrets. Then one day, Emily asks Stephanie for a favor, namely to pick up her son from school, which Stephanie is happy to do. Only problem is that Emily doesn't show up and seemingly has disappeared... What became of Emily? At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more pf the plot would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy). Here he goes more the mystery way, as we all wonder what happened to Emily. It isn't long before it becomes impossible to figure out who is fooling whom, and that is a problem. If the intent was to establish a tense movie along the lines of ""Gone Girl"" or ""The Girl On the Train"", then this movie falls short significantly. Instead, the movie is highly stylish and of course benefits from its leading ladies' performances by Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) and Blake Lively (as Emily), both quite charming and let's be honest, very easy on the eyes. But that doesn't make up for the underlying weakness of the film, unfortunately. In the movie's end credits, we are told what becomes of the main characters in the years thereafter, making it look as if these events really happened, but that is not the case at all. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a ton of great songs, mostly French pop songs from the 1960s (think: Serge Gainsbourg, Francoise Hardy, Brigitte Bardot, Jacques Dutronc, France Gall, etc.), just delightful.""A Simple Favor"" was released wide last weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at this weekend (2nd week of release) here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (about 20 people), although nowhere close to a sell-out. If you are in the mood for a mystery with a light touch where it's impossible to ascertain ""who did it"" until the very last scene of the movie, I'd suggest you check out ""A Simple Favor"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",A Simple Favor
36,jtindahouse,Not sure what it wants to be,6,18 September 2018,"It's one thing to not know whether a film is a comedy or a serious drama going in, it's another not to know by the halfway point in the film. I kept waiting for 'A Simple Favor' to pick a route to go down, but it never really commits one way or the other, and this I think is the thing that hurts this film the most. It's a tricky one though because the story itself isn't strong enough to carry the film alone, however when you saturate it with comedy you find the audience laughing in scenes that they're not supposed to be laughing in. The tone of this film was quite baffling at times.What carries the film is the two leads Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively. This was the best performance I've seen from Lively. She was captivating to watch. Her screen presence and charisma were incredible and she alone was the strongest thing this film had going for it. Anna Kendrick stuck to her more traditional type performance, but she does it well so why break up a good thing? There were some good cameos thrown into the mix too. Overall it was a very strongly acted film.Something you'll notice about this film is that all the characters are very uneven. They go on incredibly sharp arcs over the course of the movie. A character arc is a great thing, but a little subtilty goes a long way. It was also about 20 minutes too long for my liking. The audience were getting a little restless in the third act and there were certainly scenes that could easily have been cut out. The ending was also a little bit cliche.

This is a witty and twisty mystery that is directed by Paul Feig, who is normally known for comedy-the new all female Ghostbusters, Spy, The Heat & Bridesmaids. Anna plays a widowed mother-her husband died in a car accident-that has a blog that she uses to dispense helpful hints to other moms. One day at her son's school, she meets and befriends Blake when their sons want to have a play date. Henry plays Blake's husband, an aspiring writer that hasn't written anything lately-he had one book that was a minor hit but nothing lately. Jean plays Blake's mother. After a couple of weeks, Blake disappears and questions abound; Did she run off? Did something bad happen to her? Who is responsible? Everything is answered by the end of the movie, but there are lots of twists getting there. I mean, you think you have it figured out and the movie is almost over and then, Bam! A big twist pops up and the story continues a little further. All the actors are great in their roles and it's probably best if you don't know too much about the plot before you see this one.

42,kluseba,Girl got a gun,8,20 September 2018,"A Simple Favor is a psycho thriller that is very similar to films like Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train. It's a little bit too similar and therefore slightly predictable. However, this movie is still greatly executed and very entertaining. The second and especially the last third are particularly intense.The opening third slightly overstays its welcome. It has the purpose to introduce the numerous characters but since the very first scene already spoils one of the main characters' disappearance, the audience only waits for this to happen. However, the exposition appropriately introduces the three main characters. We follow the slightly nervous single mother and widow Stephanie who has a passion for activities in her community and especially cooking. She meets the mysterious Emily who is very strict, straightforward and even rude at times but who lives life to the fullest. Her husband Sean is an author with writer's block who madly loves his wife. The first third feels like a slice of life, using humorous and dramatic elements but being somewhat shallow beneath the surface.The rising action finally starts when Emily disappears from one day to the other. She asked her best friend Stephanie to take her son from school and said she would come pick him up. However, she vanishes without leaving a trace. Emily starts to wonder what might have happened and starts investigating her suspicious employer. She also uses her internet show to ask viewers from around the country for help. The movie that started in a rather light-hearted tone gets a more serious touch here that soon turns sinister.The climax, falling action and resolution all occur in the film's final third that comes around with several twists, lots of tension and a healthy dose of drama. The last forty minutes or so will keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The final conclusion is slightly disappointing but the build-up is so outstanding that it actually barely matters.Aside the progressive change from light-hearted comedy drama to sinister psycho thriller, the movie convinces with its clever plot and outstanding acting performances by the three main characters. If you like the aforementioned Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, you can consider A Simple Favor movie of the year material. If you just enjoy twisted psycho thrillers, you will like this gripping film that however lacks some creativity compared to quite similar movies that have been released all too recently.",A Simple Favor

Great soundtrack (mostly in French) from POisson Rouge to Crier Tout Bas to Comment Te Dire Adieu to Bonnie & Clyde; all appropriately synched to scenes. Standout performances by Kendrick and Lively but Golding just doesn't shine. Bashir Salahuddin is under-utilised as a perceptive detective.The script by Jessica Sharzer certainly provides laughs and incisive satire; Paul Feig as director delivers an effective Comedy/Thriller with leanings towards Noir but the film has perhaps one or two twists too many to be a classic. 8/10.",A Simple Favor

51,jadepietro,"Simply Stated, A Mystery Too Convoluted but Fun",7,1 October 2018,"GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An enjoyable murder mystery that entertains but makes little sense.JIM'S REVIEW: A Simple Favor is not that simple. It wants to effortlessly blend mystery and comedy genres into one entertaining movie. And it almost succeeds. Its charms may compensate for its over-convoluted plotting and some serious lapses in logic. Simply put,, this is a murder mystery and if the ending does not satisfy...and it certainly does not...than the whole set-up disappoints...and it does.The story involves the sudden friendship of Stephanie (Anna Kendrick), a nerdy school mom, and Emily (Blake Lively), a sophisticated and calculating career woman.(Are there any other kind?) In less than a week, Stephanie's new best friend goes all gone girl and it becomes Stephanie's crusade to find her. Initially, the mystery premise is a lot of fun, unraveling the clues and watching these two mismatched pals interact. But as the mystery unfolds and the puzzle becomes more complexed for moviegoers' sleuthing, the plot becomes strained. Certain scenes begin to make no sense except to confound our heroine and the audience.Matters are left unexplained. (For two small examples, the lack of police investigation over some obvious leads, that replenishing walk-in closet!). This all leads to a rather far-fetched ending with much talk and triple twists that left this reviewer less than impressed. Minor characters make their appearances and then are disappear like Emily. Ms. Kendick plays her character as if she is in a Hallmark television mystery movie, all cuteness and quirky personality. She remains likable throughout, but the role, as written by screenwriter Jessica Sharzer, is unbelievable. Ms. Lively supplies the glamour and haughtiness necessary for her role most effectively. Henry Golding is also well cast as her handsome but mysterious husband. The screenplay is earnest in its attempt to create a modern day whodunnit. However, its comedy elements, which do start off well with some wit, descend into a silly sit-com confessional climactic scene that undercuts all of the intrigue before it. The pay-off just isn't there.Despite its French pop score (that too is never explained), A Simple Favor does not resemble great foreign mysteries like Diabolique or Tell No One. Nor does it come near to any minor Hitchcock thriller or Agatha Christie's well plotted mysteries. The film aspires to have the intrigue of Otto Preminger's Laura in its plotting and style and sophistication of Stanley Donan's Charade which deftly mixed humor and suspense. All good intentions. More akin to a long episode of Murder She Wrote or a good Columbo mystery, A Simple Favor remains enjoyable fun.",A Simple Favor
52,Amyth47,Anna Kendrick is 💖 Blake Lively is 🤤,6,28 December 2018,My Rating : 6/10I only watched it for Anna Kendrick's quirky acting. I think she's terrific.'A Simple Favor' is a comedy that ends up as a thriller. It's all a bit over-the-top and I liked it immensely. What else were you expecting from the director of 'Bridesmaids' ?! Fun to watch!,A Simple Favor
53,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of A Simple Favor,7,22 December 2018,"Stephanie Smothers as a widowed mom living in Connecticut, befriends a married mom named Emily Nelson. Emily has a nice house, a smarmy attitude, a love of alcohol, and a checkered past (as does Stephanie). When Stephanie decides to watch Emily's kid as a favor, Emily goes missing. Stephanie then becomes mousy and flamboyant detective. That's the beginning blueprint of A Simple Favor and it's my latest review. In all honesty, I thought ""Favor"" was strictly gonna be a spellbinding thriller (trailers do that sometimes). I didn't know there would be some out of place humor, some snobbery, some tongue-in-cheek, and some violent slapstick thrown in.Released at just under two hours with guessing game remnants and mounds of twists in tote, A Simple Favor is satiric, blackly comedic, and single white female-d. With the novel-based ""Favor"", funnyman director Paul Feig shows us a dark side we thought he never had. He just does a better job of hiding it that's all (hence one of the lines in the movie). Paul's direction here isn't any more flashy or conspicuous. He just goes rogue and bends his curiosity for genres sake (viewers of Bridesmaids, Spy, and the rebooted Ghostbusters are gonna be thrown for a loop).In A Simple Favor, Feig disregards regulars Melissa McCarthy, Ben Falcone, and Rose Byrne this time around. He instead goes with Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) and Blake Lively (Emily) as mano-a-mano, female leads. It almost feels like perfect casting. Feig also saddles ""Favor"" with a sort of Mexican standoff ending and a sense of upsetting malaise. The dialogue is F-bombed (and spit-fired) and the whodunit factor keeps you afloat at least until the 90-minute mark.Bottom line: A Simple Favor is a weird spin, a manipulative noir in broad daylight, and a voyeuristic look at mommy-and-me ilk (you can even add cutesy vlogging as well). I liked it just enough. Rating: 3 stars.",A Simple Favor
54,Easygoer10,I Loved it!,7,15 October 2019,This is a hilarious (but deadly!) comedy. Several films come to mind. I love the French pop songs used on the soundtrack; they really put the icing on the cake! A must see.,A Simple Favor
55,Kingslaay,Anything but simple,6,16 September 2018,"A simple favour started off decent, mysterious plot and a good dose of humour. It seemed well paced for the first half. Then it completely unfolded into a mess. This film ended being exactly like Gone Girl, great to start with and then it all fell apart. What followed in the second half was an illogical and ridiculous mess. The pieces just didn't fit and the film tried too hard to be many things at once. Trying too hard to deliver a great twist or complex plot that collapsed. It just didn't make good sense and did not flow well. The acting was great and probably pushes up its rating. If this film receives high reviews from some its quite obvious they didn't have a clue what was going on but decided to give a high rating. 6/10",A Simple Favor
56,nancyldraper,No surprises here,6,14 September 2018,"This movie devolves from mystery to farce to just plain silly. No great surprises here - the plot follows expected paths, Blake Lively is sexy, Anna Kendrick is gullible (or is she?) and awkward, Henry Golding is great eye candy. Filmed in Canada (despite the misspelling of Favour) with lots of Canadians in supporting roles. Mindless fare for a Friday afternoon or cheap day. Although folks who watched this with me are giving it a thumbs up, I am going to give this a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Mystery? Thriller?}",A Simple Favor

In recent times, its rare to watch two genres getting mushed into one and still work. A simple favour took the thriller genre and added comedy in a very subtle way.

61,vithiet,Maybe it helps going in with low expectations?,8,4 April 2020,"I've seen a few other reviewers who, like me, didn't think they would enjoy it that much and were pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure because of the mixed reviews but it was on a list of murder-mystery flicks to watch if you liked Knives Out (I did) so I gave it a go. It's a LOT funnier than I thought it would be, in part thanks to Anna Kendrick (which I also did not expect from her). It may not be award-winning material but considering what's getting awards these days, is it even a standard anymore?",A Simple Favor
62,saptesh786,Anna Kendrick's show !,6,17 November 2018,"I watched this movie for the name of Anna Kendrick. She is beautiful and completely fit into such role of clumsy and naive woman. Her messy situation is laughable and one must attracts with her stunning body language and innocent face. Story is not so powerful but having a small secret. To convincing viewers story gets the twin formula, which is a nonsense turn in mysterious story. Totally seem like intentionally written plot. However movie is only for Anna. She stole the show. In other word movie is only watchable for Anna. So my suggestion is that if you are a fan of Anna Kendrick then you must say yes for this movie otherwise leave it aside. You will be disappointed.",A Simple Favor
63,thekarmicnomad,Some intrigue with a splash of humour,7,5 February 2019,"Two very different women make friends whilst collecting their children; then a Nancy Drew type mystery happens.As other reviews mention this has a whiff of ""Gone Girl"" about it.
Anna Kendrick is very competent in her role as amiable, domestic mum pitted against the hard-nosed career woman of Blake Lively (both are excellent).There are some funny moments to be had but I wouldn't say this is a comedy as such.
It is more a light-hearted thriller.At times it feels like the director had a voice whispering into their ear as the film does weave gently about the road.For instance some social messages try to seep in (like the presumed animosity between stay-at-home-mums and career-mothers) and sometimes it tries hard to be funny when it doesn't need to.The most glaring case is the token stay-at-home-dad. Nice to seem him there and everything but the slapstick nature of his character jars with the rest of the film.Good fun with a little bit of mystery, I did get the required fist pump moment.Don't take this too seriously and you won't be let down",A Simple Favor
64,Aktham_Tashtush,The movie is just pitch-perfect satisfaction ;),8,12 December 2018,"An absolute excitement guaranteed ,, the plot is so genuine the script is tight well connected and so followable ,, the story itself is fun comedic in a way , thrilling and keeps on the mystery up until the last minutes .. has so many flips and cover ups it just gives you full satisfaction when it all wraps up at the end.The directing was good,, had a bit of an issue, if i might call it that, in the beginning as the pace was a somewhat slow but i think it was eminent to give a sense of the backstory ,, The songs though !! already downloaded on my phone !! all these french songs gave the movie a little french fun-action.The cast ,, OH my ,, Love Anna Kendrick to pieces , she is just a sweet sole and an fine talent mixed with a natural beauty ,, her acting was one point and her engagement was untouchable ,, she made an amazing due with Blake Lively who was fearless and viciously classy ,, and Henry Golding ""the guy from crazy rich asians"" was good too.Final thought ,, the movie got so high reviews on literally all the sites and critics pages , but to be honest i don't think it got its fair share of the media buzz ,, i don't know ,, or maybe because i watched it late myself ... so go watch it now ,, highly Recommended.",A Simple Favor
65,rockman182,A Simple Favor (2018),7,15 September 2018,"I love all things Anna Kendrick. Big role or small, I've seen every single one of her films. So, pair her with Blake Lively and the excitement goes through the roof. I don't mind a bit of Paul Feig. I was certainly interested to see him dip into something a little more serious, despite it seeming a little off color for him. Having seen the film now, I'd say it super silly, campy, and mostly predictable but its an enjoyable time mostly through the work of Kendrick and Lively and the chemistry they possess.The film is about a single mom (with a vlog), who becomes friends with a mysterious, sexy, but ultimately unpredictable woman. As their friendship solidifies, Emily (the friend played by Blake Lively) mysteriously vanishes. Attempts at trying to figure out Emily's whereabouts become more mysterious when each event unfolds. Is it her husband who is responsible for her disappearance? What secrets are Emily hiding? All this and more answered in this film.The characters are a bit typecast. Anna Kendrick once again plays the goofy and awkward but ultimately good-natured girl. Blake Lively is the sexy seductress who has men wrapped around her fingers. This isn't so much of a bad thing as both characters play to their strengths and play off each other well. The back and forth is oft humorous. You can see Feig's comedic style oozing out of the film. Which was welcome because it keeps things light-hearted and silly. Its a silly film through and through, its campy all the way. The multiple twists don't always hit because they are fairly predictable. Its something I'm willing to get past because I didn't expect a masterpiece here but wanted to get a good dose of Kendrick and Lively.Overall the film is sexy, mysterious, stupid, and funny all at once. I'm not sure if it is Feig's best but I found it to be an improvement over Ghostbusters and Spy. Side note, but Blake Lively's on screen child was terrible. I get that he's a good but good grief that kid only knew how to yell lines at the top of his lungs. The film looks nice and Blake Lively is always looking fashionable. Kendrick is at the top of her game. Its a fun watch. Also, look out for under utilized Rupert Friend. The interactions between him and Kendrick were gold and we needed more of that. This film will get you craving a martini.7/10",A Simple Favor
66,MuviFan73,Epic tale of comedy for quarter & mystery for rest of it.,7,1 September 2021,"Story: A women parent who is a vlogger has newly befriended another female parent. They share some good chemistry. However another parent goes missing. It's now vloggers journey to tie the ends and expose the truth.Cinematography: Justified. The corporate house, the regular house, the corporate building, play school, the forest house, the lake, etc. All appears well pictured.Direction & Acting (& music): Justified. I liked the directors skills in putting such comedy (although little) in front of audience. Music (although little) was above average.Final Verdict: The take on comedy before the befriended women disappears is epic. The take on mystery after the befriended women disappears is subtle.When I started first watching the R rated movies ""mystery"" was my favorite subject. I am a different person now. I still liked the movie for old as well as new reasons. The old reason being psychology. The new reason being family (putting light on element such as vlogging along with the character playing it).The movie does justice to the genre mystery followed by comedy the most. You should give it a try if you like the two genres.",A Simple Favor
67,RforFilm,"Paul Feig has baked and posted an intriguing mystery A Simple Favor, with both Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively perfectly casted",8,23 September 2018,"As a thirty-something unmarried man, I can't say that I understand the pressures of motherhood or living up to my neighborhoods standards. In today's movie, we do have a suburban mother whose thrown into an mystery. That's nothing new, but stories like that have given way to steamy romances and chilling thrillers. In fact, stories about regular people thrown into extraordinary positions are the staple of filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock if you consider North by Northwest, Vertigo, and Rear Window. The advantage of these stories is that because the lead character isn't as knowledgeable as a hard-nose detective, that allows the audience to traverse along side the hero as they learn.The more normal the people, the more likely that an audience will sympathize, no matter how bad their character is (by bad, I mean rebellious). So for today's movie, it makes sense that it would be appealing for a lot of mothers or women in general. Some might see it as sexist to make the character in question a stay-at-home vlogger who embraces the ""suburban"" stereotype. I say if she's happy, then why change it. Perhaps her perception is changed after what's happened in A Simple Favor. Vlogger mother Stephanie Smothers (played by Anna Kendrick) is the kind of figure that other mothers hate; always volunteering at school events and making dishes that put the other deserts at the bake sale to shame. While picking up her son Miles, she sees that he's playing with another boy Nicky. His mother is Emily Nelson (played by Blake Lively), a very beautiful, stylish woman that the other parents don't know well. Though Emily tells Stephanie that she doesn't want to her friend, she does let her boy and Stephanie's son over for a playdate. Stephanie and Emily still bond and do become friends. And then a favor is asked.Stephanie agrees to pick up Miles for Emily while she deals with something. A whole night goes by and Emily doesn't return for her son. Stephanie calls up Emily's husband, professor/failed writer Sean (played by Henry Golding) for help. He admits that Emily's behavior has been odd through their marriage and knows little about her job. With Emily's son with his dad, Stephanie starts to investigate Emily's life to see what has happened to her. Was there something she got herself involved in? Was her husband involved in some way? Will Stephanie get herself into a mess?Director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Ghostbusters) is a creator whose always at best when studying the relationship between two people. In the case of A Simple Favor, he scores thanks to a carefully crafted script, talented actresses, and a style that does well of invoking the best methods of a Hitchcock film. A lot of the film is what you don't know, which is why I didn't go into greater detail of the overall story. I can say that it builds an almost beautiful mystery...as beautiful as both actresses in question. Anna Kendrick has the talent of being a beauty and funny. She's the kind of person who can pull off being a quirky, but successful blogger. In a way, I do fell sorry for her, given how the parents seems to dislike her ambition, but I can sympathize as well. Someone like her would probably not care enough what parents would say to the point she's kind of isolated herself without knowing. It would make sense that someone as different as Blake Lively would attract her. Speaking of which, She plays the Grace Kelly to Anna Kendrick's Jimmy Stewart. She is the kind of woman who would be the envy of the world; gorgeous, but also intimidating.The overall movie does make this journey fascinating to see these two try to figure out each other. A Simple Favor does feel like a classic Hitchcock movie. It's Paul Feig's writing that attempts interject his brand of comedy into the dialogue. Don't get me, wrong; this is not a comedy. This is more of a way to make comedy something of a defense mechanism. While it works in plenty scenes, it does feel a bit distracting when the side characters act more like people from Bridesmaids then an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. I think the film needed one more edit to tighten the dialogue to keep things character driven.I'll give this eight vlog posts out of ten. While it's more likely to cater to women, I think A Simple Favor should do fine attracting people looking for a good mystery/thriller. Give it a watch and see if this deserves a share.",A Simple Favor
68,bankofmarquis,Well worth it,7,8 April 2020,"I'll start this review by stating for the record - I LIKE BLAKE LIVELY. I think the former Gossip Girl star is extremely watchable and interesting - and in the right role, can take over a film.And...in A SIMPLE FAVOR...she is in the right role.Also starring Anne Kendrick (INTO THE WOODS), A SIMPLE FAVOR tells the tale of a suburban mother (Kendrick) who forms a friendship with a lively (no pun intended) working mom (Lively) - from ""The City"" no less - who asks her friend for ""A Simple Favor"" - watch her child while she tends to some urgent business. When the working Mom goes missing, the suburban Mom starts snooping into what happened.Directed by Paul Feig (BRIDESMAIDS), A SIMPLE FAVOR finds itself in a bit of a ""no man's land"" of style and genre. Is it a made for TV Movie like BIG LITTLE LIES (no...it's ambition and production style is more ambitious than that). Is it a ""Major Motion Picture"" a la GONE GIRL (no...it's not that ambitious). Is it a satire on the suburban Mom (partially), a whodunnit (partially), a mystery (partially) a black comedy (partially).And that's what is in this film's favor - and it's biggest issue. It's hard to define and pin down and the feel of the film floats all over the place, as do the performances of the leading ladies.Anna Kendrick is perfectly well suited to play the frumpy suburban Mom, Stephanie, who's underlying unhappiness is masked by the perma-grin and energy of that Mom who volunteers for EVERYTHING at school. She is more than balanced by Lively's scene-stealing performance as Emily the working Mom from NYC that doesn't take crap - or orders - from anybody. Their scenes together are uneven and unbalanced - and that is perfect for what Stephanie is going through. She encounters a force of nature in Emily and is just trying to hang on for dear life.And there, again, is where the issues of this film (and it's strengths) show up. Sometimes - it seems - that Stephanie is getting a foothold, only to slip and fall. But then she gets her foothold stronger and a whole new character emerges, only to have it slip again...and then she is SNARKY...and slips back to mousey...and then she is CLEVER...and slips back to mousey...and the she...You get the idea. It keeps the audience guessing and off-guard, but the change in tone hurts the overall flow of the film.It, ultimately, becomes a fairly clever whoddunit that had me guessing (for the most part) until the end, so I have to admit - I ended up enjoying it - mostly because of Lively's energy.Letter Grade: B+ (well worth your time to check out)7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",A Simple Favor
69,spookyrat1,Hi Moms!,7,22 May 2019,"I'm really surprised so many reviewers are comparing A Simple Favour to movies such as Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train. Apart from the fact that all films include a plot component involving a missing woman/women, A Simple Favor is vastly different in style and tone. It is a blackish comedy (the emphasis on comedy) with some intriguing mystery/thriller elements as Connecticut-based, widowed vlogger Stephanie, tries to solve the disappearance of her mysterious and rich best friend Emily. I very much enjoyed the other above mentioned titles, but neither could be described as a comedy, whilst Favour definitely doesn't try to take itself too seriously.Besides succeeding splendidly in genre-mixing, director Paul Feig has gifted his film with a distinctive, colourful stylishness that doesn't fail to impress. It is a brightly photographed entertainment with uber modern sets, lead characters wearing highly distinguishing and undeniably fashionable costumes, sustaining their existence on a diet of finely crafted martinis and restaurant quality food, with a chic overlaid retro soundtrack of French 60's rock/pop classics. It welds together seamlessly.The casting is special with the two female leads of Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively highlighting the old truism of opposites attracting one another. Kendricks's shortish, dark, vivaciously cute and resourceful Stephanie, working with and against Lively's tall, lean, blond, charismatic and perhaps dangerously enigmatic Emily. Henry Golding is a fine choice as Sean, Emily's writer husband and later love interest for Stephanie. But the whole support cast list is impressive, from the little boys, to the investigating police, to an almost unrecognisable Rupert Friend, playing Emily's intimidating fashionista boss, who requires special strategies from Emily to be kept in line.A Simple Favour is a smoothly-paced movie chock full of interesting characters, lively (no pun intended) dialogue and some surprising twists during the second half. Paul Feig again shows us that he's an expert at creating appealing movies for everyone, but featuring strong, engaging female protagonists. Do yourself the proverbial.",A Simple Favor

71,MihaiSorinToma,A suspenseful and entertaining movie,9,27 September 2018,"A single mom vlogger befriends a very classy and trendy woman who's envied by everybody. They seem to get closer and closer, but one day, the latter suddenly disappears, leaving almost no trace behind. Wanting to help her new friend, the young vlogger starts to search every possible lead she can imagine but she's in for a couple of surprises along the way.It's a quite surprising movie which starts a bit slow and even becomes sometimes awkward but it soon ups its pace, bringing plenty of drama, suspense, thrill and interest into the equation, thanks to its very good plot. It presents a couple of distinct and complex characters which contribute, each in its own unique way, to the outcome which simply doesn't let you get bored. While the intrigue is the one which starts the action, after the short introduction from the beginning, the final half of the movie is where it all begins to shine. Not to mention the finale which represents the part in which all is revealed, again in a unique way, making the viewer staring at least confused at the screen. It's not linear, let alone predictable, fact which makes the whole experience worthwhile.The actors but especially actresses involved do a really good job portraying their characters. They provide plenty of emotion but also drama and when you least expect it, some great laughs. Besides these, the film also uses some French music which the characters seem to enjoy at its fullest. It's not an action movie, but the pace it sets is good. It's not boring or anything like that, but not something alert; just plain in the middle where it is supposed to be.Overall, they've managed to create something quite impressive with this movie. They've taken an apparently simple idea, thrown in a simple intrigue and build upon them a complex plot which keeps the viewer interested until the end. It manages to be dramatic, suspenseful and entertaining at the same time. It's a good movie which deserves to be seen, being almost sure to surprise the viewer, one way or another. For me at least, it surely was a pleasant surprise.",A Simple Favor
72,jrarichards,"Fresh, delicious ... and refreshingly ""wrong""",9,14 May 2019,"Paul Feig's 2018 effort ""A Simple Favor"" passes itself off as a black comedy, but for my money it's better than that. I would say it is a dark thriller that happens to be funny at times. But, while it skips in a quite agile way between genres (rather than fusing them), the ""thin red line"" running through this quite-engrossing film is barely-concealed, glossy eroticism mixed in with immorality of most kinds.This is one for ""consenting adults"", as it were; and offhand it's hard to think of a wrong-er mainstream film appearing at any point since ""Cruel Intentions"" of 1999. Somewhat ironic actually, since Anna Kendrick bears more than a passing resemblance to Sarah Michelle Gellar, and - like her - is ready, willing and able to act her heart out to exceptionally convincing (and actually rather on-turning) effect. Her character is just great, very authentic-looking indeed, but also larger-than-life; and at no point in the film do we really quite know which twist and turn it's going to follow next.Frankly then, this reasonably intelligent work resembles ""Cafe Society"" in ""starring"" a Blake Lively who actually comes in second to another (similarly-aged) female player. This is beginning to look like a strategy, and actually it does Lively no harm at all, as she is really great here, rather naughty actually (a degree of wish fulfilment there for those waiting for that), but also really ""acting"" in a quite satisfying manner. I think she gets better and better in her well-chosen roles.The line with bad taste is occasionally crossed, but even then it's intriguing how the worldly-wise Emily (the Blake Lively role) is momentarily wrong-footed when her own truth-or-dare ""truth"" turns out to be far, far less wrong than the one put forward - without much soul-searching at all - by her apparently tame and nerdy and restrained new best friend. Distinctly dubious morally, this bit (even rather offensive, actually) - but perhaps necessary to set up what Stephanie Smothers (what a great name for the Kendrick part!) is able to come up with given half a chance - which she now is. Kendrick just smoulders as a person of two (or even three) distinct characters; and most of the time it is clear that there is no ""real her"", as all three aspects are entirely her - all at the same time. It's a remarkable and convincing performance.Slick, witty, elegant, erotic and very, very dark, this film retains its cohesion right through to the faux ""where are they now?"" subtitles at the end, and it's by then been through various twists and turns. For once the British guy is not the bad guy (also refreshing in an American film), though the price Henry Golding plays for that is a somewhat more forgettable character as Emily's husband Sean. However, he certainly does enough to make the triangle an intriguing one. The cops are also fun to watch, as is Andrew Rannells in his minor role.Given that this is not quite a crime film, not quite a sex comedy or romantic comedy, not quite anything, ""A Simple Favor"" is likely to be the film ""not chosen"" at any moment when there is more than one movie available. And that would be a pity, given its status as a bit of a work of art, if certainly rather ""dark"" art.",A Simple Favor
73,kjproulx,A Fun Mystery Flick,8,16 September 2018,"I always enjoy films that surprise me. Since the beginning of the film industry, the awe and wonder of going to the movies has always been the joy of seeing the movie itself. Whether a mystery film gives you a great plot twist or a comedy makes you laugh harder than you have ever laughed before, getting more than what you expect is always a plus. A Simple Favor is one of the latest films to receive a book-to-film adaption, and while many of those movies are ripped apart by fans of the novels, I have always been someone who watches the movie for the movie, regardless if I have read the book or not. In this particular case, this entire premise was new to me upon viewing the first trailer, so I went into this film completely cold, which is why I think I enjoyed it so much. If you're a fan of mystery in any form of the word, then I believe you'll share in the experience of having a great time at the movies with this one.A Simple Favor follows Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) and Emily (Blake Lively) as their kids want to hang out with each other after school, which allows them to form a friendship of their very own. After Emily asks Stephanie to watch her son for a while, she completely vanishes, not answering phone calls, texts, emails, etc. Stephanie, along with Emily's husband, Sean (Henry Golding), do their very best to uncover the mystery of her absence, while possibly even forming a bond of their own. This film is filled with plot twists that I never saw coming and a conclusion that not only flips this genre on its head but also has a dark comedy element as well, which is probably due to the fact that Paul Feig was at the helm.Although not written by him, director Paul Feig has been known for his comedies in Bridesmaids, The Heat, and Spy, all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed. It was a surprise to see him tackling a dramatic mystery, but when you really sit back and experience this film for all that it is, it's quite comical under the surface. Aside from maybe Bridesmaids, this may actually be my favourite film of his. Written by Jessica Sharzer (Nerve, American Horror Story) and newcomer Darcey Bell, it was very clear that they were the ones who kept this film on track in terms of the dramatic tone and clever plot twists, but it's very apparent that Paul Feig had some fun with it when piecing it all together when filming began. This film is a true mix of both.Even though I'd almost say that I loved this movie, I do have to admit that I fear some audiences may be turned off by the comedic undertone. If you're not the type of viewer who can accept a comedic beat that immediately follows a tragic incident, then A Simple Favor may be a little too uneven for you. It worked for me, personally, but I can see where the criticism may come into play. To myself, this is a very well-written and well-directed film from beginning to end, with a lot of attention to detail.Overall, A Simple Favor kind of came out of nowhere for me. I wasn't aware this film was coming out and I'm glad it got a wide release for everyone to see. If you're looking for a film to surprise you, this may end up being one of your most memorable film experiences of 2018. While I can't see it receiving any big nominations, it deserves far more attention than what it's currently getting. Through all its plot twists and comedic elements, I found myself completely engaged with this story. A Simple Favor is a pleasant surprise of a movie that I highly recommend.",A Simple Favor

75,msbreviews,Rating: B+,7,20 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Paul Feig is known by his comedic vein, same goes for Anna Kendrick. Blake Lively has performed in several genres, so this mix of people is at least odd considering this is supposed to be a mystery-suspense flick. Nevertheless, Feig and his writers are able to come up with a truly intriguing and captivating story, accompanied by a fantastic cast who deliver some great performances.Anna Kendrick is brilliant as Stephanie. As the movie goes by, she changes from a character-type performance into something outside her comfort zone. She perfectly handles it and delivers an amazing display, being very expressive and charming. Her character, like any other one in this film, gets an excellent script with extensive development. Despite some traits of her personality unjustifiedly changing towards the end of the movie, Stephanie is still a quite well-written character and with a very mysterious past.Not less enigmatic is Emily, Blake Lively's character. She also has a dark past, and she always seems to be hiding something. Extremely secretive and protective of her whereabouts, she lends the most perplexing breadcrumbs of the film. However, I have the same minor issue with her script that I have with Stephanie's. Some personality characteristics and some plot points regarding her past are either left unjustified, partly explained or described in a bit of a farfetched way.Lively's performance, however, is outstanding. I always liked her more than most people, and I think she is an underrated actress. Some people think she only has opportunities because she is married to Ryan Reynolds but she is exceptionally talented, and she deserves some significant roles soon. Henry Golding plays Lively's husband, Sean, and he also delivers a compelling performance. His character also comes into play and produces a triangle of suspicions of who's guilty in all of this.Story-wise, the synopsis given by Lionsgate doesn't lie. It has a ton of twists and turns, big or small, they are all over the place. Some are predictable, some are a surprise, but I never received that mind-blowing twist that I was kind of expecting. If a movie promises you a lot of misleading details and puzzling clues, I want to experience a big moment of ""wow, I didn't think of that""! Unfortunately, it ends in a slightly disappointing and even silly way.Paul Feig nails the direction aspect. He demonstrates to know precisely what he wanted the film to be, how the story would unveil itself and which moment of the runtime was the most appropriate to deliver a particular twist. With excellent control of suspenseful dialogues and seamless editing, he only fails in balancing the mix of tones. Some lines of comedy are thrown in there, and none of them worked for me. When the mystery starts unraveling, that's when the movie gets entertaining and genuinely captivating.Feig flawlessly controls the story's pacing. A purposefully slow first act that serves to set up the main characters, followed by a constantly entertaining rhythm which builds up the tension and suspense throughout the rest of the runtime. I never felt bored, and my brain kept thinking of possible endings, which is something I have to congratulate the film on. Nowadays, everyone expects the audience to just sit and experience the brainless spectacle. This one needs you to think to understand every minor decision that the characters do.In the end, A Simple Favor is one of this year's surprises. With an odd combination of director and cast, Paul Feig is able to deliver a remarkable direction, with remarkable control of the movie's pacing and mysteriousness. Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively brilliantly lead a very intriguing story, filled with well-written yet disappointingly predictable twists. Unfortunately, some plot points and character developments are unjustified or unlikely to occur, which also unbalances some of the film's tone.",A Simple Favor

77,Andres-Camara,No consigo meterme. I can not get myself,4,17 February 2019,"El problema de hacer películas en las que se juntan varios géneros es que unos no pegan con otros. Estas viendo una película comedia romántica y luego la haces thriller y tienes todos los ingredientes de la comedia y claro el resto de ingredientes, ya no sirven.Las actrices están estupendas. Hacen sus registros muy bien. Tienen varios cada una y los bordan, sí, pero solo ellas, los ingredientes faltan.No puedes contar un thriller con esa iluminación. Hay un momento en el que te recuerda a películas muy recientes, va tomando ese camino, pero vez escenas de miedo con una iluminación de comedia y no pega, todo parece de mentira.Si a ello le sumas que al final, los efectos han sido malos, pues se rompió todo.El director parece que no logra entender el problema de los géneros y eso lastra la película. No te aburre, pero tampoco te atrapa y al final te suelta. Solo cuenta como otro espectador. No usa bien la cámara.Es una pena, pero seguro que si hubiese hecho un thriller habría salido bien.The problem of making films in which several genres come together is that some do not stick with others. You are watching a romantic comedy movie and then you make it a thriller and you have all the ingredients of comedy and of course the rest of the ingredients, they are no longer useful.The actresses are great. They make their records very well. They have several each and embroider them, yes, but only them, the ingredients are missing.You can not count a thriller with that lighting. There is a moment in which he reminds you of very recent films, he is taking that path, but sometimes scenes of fear with a comedy lighting and it does not hit, everything seems to be a lie.If you add to that, in the end, the effects have been bad, because everything was broken.The director seems to be unable to understand the problem of the genres and that hampers the film. It does not bore you, but it does not catch you either and in the end it releases you. It only counts as another spectator. It does not use the camera well.It's a shame, but surely if I had done a thriller it would have gone well",A Simple Favor

79,TheTruthofItIs,"Mostly good, but the end...",6,1 January 2019,"A lot of regulars here have included many of the observations I'd make, so I'll add this: the film's beginning writes a check that the end bounces. It's a decent setup but falls apart in its execution, especially at the end where the twist-after-twist leaves you shaking your head and mumbling, ""so so stupid, ..."" It had real potential and in the hands of a director who knows what they're doing, would've been an awesome insurance-fraud-gone-wrong tale. Instead, it's a disappointing JV production.

80,cardsrock,Interesting dark comedy,7,4 October 2018,"The first two-thirds of this film are solid, but as the mystery unravels, it becomes a lot less interesting. Blake Lively is fantastic as the mysterious, alluring missing woman and Anna Kendrick delivers a good performance as well. The tone is odd, but it works for the most part, excluding the end when there seemed to be too much comedy. The payoff just wasn't super satisfying. It's a fairly well-made, stylish film though.",A Simple Favor
81,CANpatbuck3664,My Favourite Kind of Theatre Going Experience,9,23 September 2018,"Its always better to be pleasantly surprised than bitterly disappointed. I walked into A Simple Favor with a friend knowing little to nothing about the plot and trusted it was going to be good. The trailers pitch you on the movie while refusing to give away even the hint of a spoiler (a wise decision in retrospect). The other promotional material is eye-catching but non-descriptive. Its a different experience going into a movie expecting it to be good and having those expectations met. But taking that chance and getting the goods is much more rewarding and A Simple Favor delivered that result.Depending on which trailer you saw for this, you could think this movie is anywhere from a rom/com to a dark thriller. A Simple Favor can't be neatly put into either category because its more a unique mix of a few different genres. One of the parts that makes this movie a different kind of success is that it can get dark and heavy in a specific scene yet have you giggling just a minute later. Some movies start out light and fluffy and then they hit that crucial point where the comedy just stops dead. Even past the 3/4 point of this thriller, there are still funny moments and even though part of it must be credited to the charm of Kendrick and Lively, it was such a rarity that the movie succeeded so completely on both fronts. You have to be ready for a wide range of outcomes with A Simple Favour and if you can be adaptable to all the different directions the movie decides to explore, you'll be rewarded for that patience.Paul Feig is famous for his work in comedy with big hits like Bridesmaids and Spy. While he certainly still has that sensibility, this movie is a different kind of animal and he rises to the occasion. A Simple Favor has a sense of style that you would expect from an indie filmmaker with the bright colours, the flashy outfits and the tight cinematography but its a credit to Feig for working outside of his wheelhouse and showing what he can do. I did think the soundtrack was a little funny, but it fit the sensibility of the movie and might just have been a case of personal preference.
 
I could go on and on about how strong the material is for the cast to work with, but I was completely blown away by both Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively in this. This movie is a nice showcase for how much range Anna Kendrick has. She's so inherently sweet (at least the majority of the characters she plays are) and easy to like and the creative team capitalizes on that, so they can play with your expectations. But she can perform the whole gauntlet of emotions and she not only pulls it off but excels. Lively is just as much the powerhouse in this. She helps mold Emily as this complete enigma yet she's a force of nature. She's a jerk and completely aloof but you can't help but be as entranced by her as Stephanie is. She has wonderful chemistry with Kendrick and sells the darker and more dramatic side of her character. This was a step forward for Henry Golding as Emily's husband Sean, he's more expressive in this than he was in Crazy Rich Asians and he gets the job done. Linda Cardellini is fun in a different type of role than we're used to seeing her in. That covers the main cast, but I also wanted to credit Bashir Salahuddin as Detective Summervile and Rupert Friend as Dennis Nylon. Both deliver something fresh and unexpected in their supporting roles.Parts of A Simple Favor are very reminiscent of a Gone Girl type of thriller. It can be very dramatic, and the stakes continually rise making things more and more tense. The best similarity that A Simple Favor shares with that type of film is the twisty nature of the story. Character motivations are complex and the wrap up is neither ""simple"" or easy to guess. This is a mark of any good thriller but the closest thing I have to a complaint about this movie is that so many things explode (metaphorically) at the climax, the resolution still doesn't explain everything. I left the theatre still confused about why this character did that and while it didn't affect my overall enjoyment, I still had some questions.I don't have much else to say about this movie. While being primarily marketed towards women, I do think that the mystery that this movie is built around is intriguing enough for A Simple Favor to be appealing across the board. The mystery is enveloping, the acting is top notch from 2 charismatic lead actresses and the fact it was a surprise made it even better for me. I wholeheartedly recommend checking this out in the theatre. I can't call it a perfect movie, but it was easy to grade this out at a 9/10.",A Simple Favor
82,apryla-58795,Aw Blake really tries doesn't she?,6,28 August 2019,"Ok this movie had me hooked from the beginning. The movie is based on a book which I haven't read. It seems the movie is different from the book in some ways so I guess it doesn't matter. The story is interesting-stay at home mommy vlogger meets a working mom with a twisted past and ends up getting dragged into her drama. Turns out working mommy offed her dad and twin sister and now wants to offload stay at home mommy, husband and son as well. This was very good until the end. I think it could've been so much better. They could have had their little confrontation with Emily holding Sean and Stephanie at gunpoint but walking away thinking she got away with all of it. They could've then shown Emily getting arrested at the airport as she tries to go on the run while also showing Sean teaching his class and Stephanie doing her vlog while music is dubbed over what you're seeing. It could then cut to Emily in jail with Sean bringing their son to see her but he would hold back so as not to let the audience think Emily and Sean are reconciling in any way. A look would pass between the two that would show how Emily is grateful to Sean for allowing their son to be part of her life even though she doesn't deserve it. The film would also show Sean with his son at their house alone so audiences won't think Sean and Stephanie are together either. It could show Stephanie going on various dates in order for the audience to see she is trying to move on and hasn't given up on love. It would end with showing Emily doing a vlog about how to make those cookies that are black and white with a twist by having gray frosting too as a ""wink wink nod nod"" to the fact that things aren't always one way or the other and that there are gray areas to life. The vlog would end with her saying that the recipe for next week's vlog would be a layer cake that you can't see until you cut into because it's covered in pretty icing. Which would allude to the fact that you don't always know what's below the surface with people until you peel back their layers. Stephanie would be smiling in a knowing way and then the screen would click shut.I hate that the ending got all cringey. It just left me irritated.Blake does try but here's the irony-I think if she had not gotten a nose job perhaps we could be taking her acting a little more seriously but since she's now pretty through surgery she has to fight against her beauty in order for us to get into her acting. She just doesn't quite hit the mark. She seems like a lovely person whom I'm sure I would like if I met her IRL but I just have not liked her in anything she's done so far. It's like all you see is her trying really hard to be convincing but she can't quite sell it or pull it off. She kind of detracted from the film IMHO.Anna Kendrick was really good in Up in the Air but since then she's just become one-note. She plays the same character in every movie now-quirky goofy loveable secondary characters. She wasn't terrible in this but I think she has more range she isn't portraying anymore as she's gotten typecast and seems to be stuck playing the same person in every role.Henry Golding is nice to look at and has a nice voice and isn't a terrible actor but I don't see range with him either. He always looks like he's smiling even in serious scenes. He is still new to acting so hopefully he can acquire more skills and be able to showcase that he is more than just a pretty face. He was reduced to window dressing in this.Andrew Rannells was hilarious but not utilized enough. They could've teamed him up with Stephanie and showed them trying to figure out Emily's background together and shown funny banter between the two for more comedic effect.Rupert Friend was very good in his role as Dennis Nylon (love that name) but his part was very short.Two actors stood out to me-Bashir Salahuddin and Ian Ho. Bashir was very funny and had some good lines. He should do well in his career. I look forward to seeing him in something where he is the main character. Little Ian Ho was so funny! Very Alex P. Keaton with a side of sass. He will pry get more acting work for sure based on his role in this movie.Overall I would describe this as schlocky, cringe-worthy and unrealistic which is unfortunate because right up until they showed what everyone was doing in print at the end I was really into this and ready to give it a much higher rating.",A Simple Favor
83,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,6 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...This comedy/thriller starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively as two unlikely friends gives you plenty of twists and turns to keep you entertained and laughing until the final scene.

However, when Emily disappears without a trace, Stephanie takes it upon herself to find out what happened to her - learning, along the way, that there is much more than meets the eye with her missing friend.I enjoyed this movie. It was fresh and funny from beginning to end. Anna Kendrick is really starting to come into her own now, and I expect we'll be seeing much more of her in the future. Blake Lively was spot on with her acting, keeping everything off-kilter and skewed. She is very subtle in her approach which makes everything about her character effectively mysterious.Though the movie is humorous, it is an adult film with adult themes.

 Things I liked:Blake Lively is gorgeous and talented. She seemed to tap into her real-life husband's edgy Deadpool vibe for this role.
If you liked Crazy Rich Asians , you'll love that Henry Golding plays the husband in this movie. Click here to see my movie review of Crazy Rich Asians.
Pitch Perfect fans will love watching Anna Kendrick in this movie. She even gets to rap a little bit.
The writing by Jessica Sharzer and Darcey Bell was very good. Darcey's novel was changed a bit for the story in the movie, but that's kind of what always happens, right?
Directed by Paul Feig, this movie blends genres and pokes fun at everything.
Great job with the movie trailer and poster. They were delightfully misleading. Normally, I get ticked off for something like that, but this time it was a pleasant surprise.
Some will like the fashion aspect of the film. Costume design is very good. Blake Lively is gorgeous. Have I mentioned that already?
The French movie Diabolique gets a shout-out in this movie. Have you seen it? Neither have I. Sounds intriguing though, right?
 Things I didn't like:I hate seeing gossipy, back-stabbing moms in movies. Even more in real life. I guess I just hate admitting that vicious people like that really exist.
The tone really changes from Act One to Act Three.
Some really cray cray decisions.

There's only three here that matter, and the man in the middle of these two sharp, savvy dames is much too young-looking, standard-handsome and, supposedly a once gifted writer, he doesn't seem experienced or timeworn enough to be a has-been at anything. So the girls have twice the work despite one being off screen for way too long...And with all the running around, whether A SIMPLE FAVOR needs a longer, more fleshed-out first act; a stronger, tighter second act; or a shorter, less meandering third act can be figured out after more than one viewing. And it's a fun, suspenseful, entertaining enough picture to catch again sometime. The main problem is these two very important characters, who are not only friends, but supposedly best friends, never had a chance to get to know each other deeply enough to make their eventual rivalry matter like it should.

It is a dark comedy, pure and simple. Moreover, it is intentionally over the top, which is why the twists become more and more farfetched. One of the clues is in the pre-credit postscript, which uses the word, well, ""farfetched"" to describe a certain something. But that clue isn't necessary because it is so obvious that A Simple Favor is a Cohen Brothers-like movie.In addition to being very funny and at times pretty clever.

95,sweidman-28016,Fun Experience,8,28 October 2018,"A Simple Favor Review:A Simple Favor is a new dark comedy by Paul Feig based on the novel by the same name. It follows Stephanie, Anna Kendrick, investigating the mysterious disappearance of her new best friend Emily, Blake Lively. Along the way Stephanie finds a dark side of Emily and it gets real spicy and this is one of the best movies of the year! The trailer makes it seem like a thriller but it's actually a dark comedy and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I had like one flaw with this movie it's that good. There's not much to hate. First we'll start with the characters. Anna Kendrick has her best role yet. She plays a quirky, awkward vlogger mom. She is such a great character and her awkwardness helps with the comedy. Now other stand out is obviously Blake Lively. She's the total opposite of Stephanie which makes their relationship even better. Emily is a free, nonchalant character with a dark past. She is the total opposite of a mom and I love it so much. This has also got to be her best role. I wouldn't be surprised if at the Golden Globes either one or both of these women will be nominated, maybe even an Oscar if the academy recognizes this movie. The story was full of twists and turns making it a great experience not knowing what is coming next. There's so many red herrings in a good way. The movie is good with being serious and switching quickly to a comedy. It makes it even more comedic. The ending was amazing. There is no way to predict it unless it's been spoiled for you or you've read the book. The costumes were beautiful! Loved all of them. So far it might be tough for nominations at the Oscars with this and Crazy Rich Asians. Same with some of the production design. The cinematography was beautiful with pastel colors and some vibrant colors. The film editing was great. The very beginning opening was like a 50s movie and it was something that I haven't seen in a while. The score sounded like a 50s French movie too. The soundtrack consisted of French music because early in the film Emily says she likes French music because it's relaxing. I don't know the significance of it but it was some of the best songs in a movie soundtrack this year. I've actually been constantly listening to some of the songs. Alright let's move on to directing. Paul Feig is a great director, one of my favorite movies of his being Spy. This is my favorite movie by him now. Now for the flaws. This one kid, Nicky, played by Ian Ho, was really annoying. He reminded me of the kid who played Charles Wallace in the recent not so good A Wrinkle in Time. But here's the thing: I don't know if he was supposed to be like that because he was raised by Emily who is not a good mom. Then this is just me being picky and it's not really a flaw but I just didn't think it was necessary. During the second act it would sometimes go back to a conversation that Stephanie and Emily were having and how Stephanie should be kind of like Emily and laid back. Then Stephanie would act like that. I thought it was a little unnecessary, but not really a flaw. This is such an amazing movie. It only made 16 million this weekend and definitely needs to be seen by more people. It was third for top box office behind The Nun, bad movie on its second week, and The Predator, which is also supposed to be bad. People need to spend their money on good movies rather than bad blockbusters. I would absolutely recommend this movie. I hope critics recognize it and nominate it for Oscars such as Adapted Screenplay, Costume Design, and possibly Best Actress (Anna Kendrick) and Supporting Actress (Blake Lively). Please go this amazing movie. It's Gone Girl but with comedy. There's no way to be disappointed in it!My Grade: A",A Simple Favor

98,HEFILM,"Sold as a thriller, but doesn't really work regardless",3,22 September 2018,"Paul Feig's career has been on a steady decline since his first two films, but studio's don't seem to understand his films and perhaps misunderstand this one more than ever.The trailers and promotions sell this as a sort of GONE GIRL thriller with incredible twists and drama--ok, none of that is true. Right from the retro title sequence with goofy French pop music you know this is, well, off beat I guess is the word.So if you go into this knowing it ain't what it's sold as, and if you are a fan of Feig or of that much maligned genre of the Black Comedy you could have a chance at enjoying this.Sadly for me, Kendrick is what I call aggressively perky, urged to be so by the director. I like her but here she is all twitchy shrugs and almost mugging--she's just trying to hard. No scene ever develops with any serious intent for long enough to engage you or with any real cleverness. Offbeat music constantly reminds you this isn't to be taken seriously but can't give it the balance.It'd like to be a lighter weight Hitchcock type comedy though it mixes in darker elements, though not successfully as Feig can do at his best.Ultimately it doesn't make any sense and the ending is outright goofy. It reminds me more of a failed Joe Dante type film--again Dante hit some home runs and struck out just as often. I'm just trying to give you some frame to possibly enjoy this film more than I did.Unlike Kendrick. Black Lively comes off well and in one part I won't spoil gets to do one of every actor's dream roles.It's all not funny enough nor serious enough to work, so the studio choose to sell it as a dark thriller, which it ain't.Supporting performers are all over the map in tone and quality of performance. It will be interesting to see how they sell the film for it's life outside of theatres, though they will probably just dump it. This may help fans of the director see it as unjustly ignored. I have to say it just doesn't work.",A Simple Favor

100,bbewnylorac,Schlocky B-grade fare,4,15 October 2018,"Why are people rating this film so highly? The plot is ridiculous. It's a cynical ploy by Hollywood to cash in on the feverish popularity of Gone Girl. So you set up a simple domestic scenario, add violence, sex, swearing and daytime soap-level dialogue, plus some nasty, sudden twists at the end and voila, you've got a movie, right? Well I didn't fall for it. OK, well maybe I did at first. Anna Kendrick is great as widowed single Mom Stephanie who has a cute blog about domestic matters. She befriends much more glamorous and worldly Mom Emily (Blake Lively). These scenes are quite fun. The idea that Emily is a sophisticated city person somehow dragged to the suburbs where she doesn't fit in, and having Stephanie as a conservative friend makes for some good scenes. But mayhem ensues when Emily goes missing and Stephanie investigates what happened to her. So far, so good, but then Stephanie beds Emily's husband Sean (Henry Golding) and it turns out that Stephanie has a bit of an incestuous past (say what?). Oh, and Emily has a twin (yawn) who Emily at some point murders. Oh, also Emily faked her own death to get the insurance money. Cue lots of over-wrought, profanity laced scenes worthy of Desperate Housewives. All the actors are great. They really commit to their roles. The cinematography is lovely. But those schlocky touches, including the silly ending, are really, really dumb. Others have commented that the movie can't decide whether it's a drama or a comedy, and I'd agree. At the end, it veers towards comedy, but it's actually not that funny.",A Simple Favor

102,ethanbresnett,A twisty thriller which is sure to keep you entertained,8,11 March 2020,"Really quite a unique film in terms of the script and the character dynamics. At times a black comedy, at times a full on thriller, A Simple Favour blended a solid and twisty plot with some interestingly constructed characters to make a gripping film.The plot was thoroughly intriguing, taking a few really unexpected twists and turns. Even once you think you have the film figured out it will throw a few more surprises at you, which I like from a mystery film. There were a few elements that were a bit too far fetched, but they flowed well and naturally with the rest of the story and didn't feel too out of place. Towards the end of the film as the mystery starts unravelling the film took a couple of turns which I didn't quite like, and the way some of these secrets were unveiled was a bit contrived. Saying that in any mystery thriller there's always an element of this so I can't complain too much.As I mentioned earlier this film had some great dark comedy moments with Kendrick and Lively bringing the sharp script to life with some fantastic performances, particularly Lively. She played the high functioning psychopath chillingly well, and I was captivated when she was on screen trying to figure out what was going on beneath the surface. At times the conversations between Lively and Kendrick were just so surreal and bizarre, but I was on board with it. The dynamic between them was unlike anything I've seen before but it worked so well and really gets the film going strongly.There wasn't too much of a wider cast other than these two (plus Golding, who puts in a solid performance). A Simple Favour is quite contained in its scope, with limited characters and sets, which goes in its favour. I always find it impressive when a film can cultivate a clever and intricate story like this with so few characters.A Simple Favour is definitely worth watching if you're into mystery thrillers, sure to keep you entertained for a couple of hours.",A Simple Favor

It's best going into it knowing hardly anything at all as I went in knowing nothing and that made for an interesting watch. It's a dark mystery story based on the novel by Darcey Bell with some fun comic moments; particularly with the chemistry between Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively. They make for a good pair; Anna Kendrick is incredibly likeable as always and is the beating heart of the film and Blake Lively is wonderful and having lots of fun playing an edgy character that has some bitterly funny pieces of dialogue conjured up by writer Jessica Sharzer. The costume designer Renee Ehrlich Kalfus also adds a lot of sparkle to the film through some seriously cool outfits for the cast to wear! Unfortunately though the story and film itself does start to sag a bit in the middle and an overly twisty and turny last half although interesting at the start becomes a bit too much and overlong.

When Emily goes missing, Stephanie helps Emily's husband Sean (Golding) though the tough time. This is when clues and odd things begin happening and the mystery starts to unfold.It's not really a traditional thriller/disappearance film, with the film following Stephanie, rather than detectives searching for Emily. The film's not overly somber and has a few laughs - it is Feig after all. There's a few twists, but nothing exceptionally original. It's certainly no 'Gone Girl'.The film succeeds almost purely on the back of the charismatic performances of Kendrick & Lively. Both are easy and fun to watch, alone and together.

Meanwhile, Lively is a hard-drinking, swearing, seemingly ill-suited mother who seeks to draw Kendrick out of her comfort zone in many different ways. But somehow, with the space of weeks, they call themselves best friends. pretty unbelievable right there.Lively then suddenly disappears, and the search is on. You are then taken in so many different directions that your head spins off. Is Lively's husband to blame? Is Lively's office to blame. Is she dead, is she alive? For me, you are just twisted around so much that the story just gets too confusing, and also just plain stupid.Kendrick's character morphs into so many different characters, with zero explanation why. She does so many stupid actions, and I felt little drama, despite the surprises thrown at you. At the climax scene, you are not quite sure who is on whose side, but by then, you really don't care - you just want to move to end because it's just plain silly.Kendrick and Lively both hold up their ends with strong acting. But the direction and story just fall flat. I think the Director wanted this to be like Girl on the Train, or Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, or even part Kill Bill, and that, imho, was the key problem - trying to throw in every possible combo into a whodunit just made me say - who cares??The movie ends up being slightly average because you get taken so far, you want to know the finish.

There are so many plots they could have used as to why the character Emily disappeared, but unfortunately they used one of the most common and cliched storylines. It got interesting in the middle while the character of Stephanie was digging into Emily's past, but it went downhill from there. I've never read the book so I don't know if the book is comical, but the movie borderlines on a dark comedy, and Anna Kendrick plays her quirky part really well, but it just wasn't enough to carry the film through.

Since neither are very good actresses to begin with, there's not enough left to make this work. Mind you, they are not terrible, but, it just doesn't click.Not to mention that the story/script is way too unrealistic and inconsistent, yet not very interesting or fun. I mean, Anna Kendrick is this not-very-bright under-achiever in her 30s who lives of her late husband's life insurance, yet she's actually an undiscovered detective genius? And that's far from the worst ""twist"".Also, the whole ""all men are idiots or bad criminals"" theme is _really_ getting old. Sure, when ladies gather up for coffee they like to tell such stories to each other, but, for a movie intended for a general release, this is unacceptable.There are a few fine jokes, mostly towards the build up of the first half of the movie.

Holding itself together through repeated major tonal shifts is even more impressive. And to succeed as both a labyrinthine mystery movie and an outrageous comedy, that's something truly special.That's the real genius of a Simple Favor. You never know what to expect next, and rarely expect what comes. You don't know who's up to what, or whether you're being set up for a shocking reveal or a surprise punchline. It all starts simply enough when suburban single mother Stephanie meets pampered, high maintenance executive Emily at their sons' school and forms an unlikely friendship based on afternoon martinis and oversharing. But when Emily suddenly disappears while on an out of town trip, everyone realizes they didn't know her nearly as well as they thought they did, and everything we think we know is repeatedly turned upside down.Kendrick is totally in her element. As Stephanie she's perky, cheerfully naive, oh so quick to volunteer for every school function, and even hosts her own mommy vlog with recipes, cleaning tips and decorating ideas. She is truly the epitome of the suburban supermom. It's fascinating to watch her gradually wizen up and embrace the role of hard nose sleuth, while remaining painfully awkward and somewhat out of her depths. She's even better when she goes full on unhinged.Blake Lively is Stephanie's exact opposite as Emily. She's a high strung, hard drinking, oversexed, high powered corporate fixer who makes no apologies and knows practically nothing about homemaking. She's as manipulative and free with the truth as Stephanie is naïve and helpful. Even before her disappearance we wonder how much of her friendship with Stephanie is born of a genuine need for bonding and how much is just her taking advantage. And that's before the rough edges really come out. I didn't know Lively had this in her to play such a catty B.A Simple Favor frequently walks a fine line between darkness and comedy. At first the humor is surprisingly light, like an episode of Parks & Rec or most of Kendrick's previous films. At other times it's deliciously dark, turning even the darkest family secrets into punchlines. Then for long stretches this movie drops all pretense of comedy and becomes a serious mystery film. And then when you least expect it, the movie veers back into screwball territory without missing a beat.This is a movie that knows how to maintain an oh so tense level of ambiguity for very long time. At times we wonder if certain people know more than they're letting on, or if everything is all in Stephanie's head. It's also the kind of movie that's smart enough and confident enough in itself to give the solution to its own ending, secure in the knowledge that the spoiler will go right over audiences' heads. And what an ending it is, topping reversals worthy of The Sting with the most outrageous laughs of all.",A Simple Favor
123,Aly200,"Enjoyable, but still a 'Gone Girl' wannabe",7,8 April 2019,"Okay are we done with making copycats of 'Gone Girl' yet? Not to hate on Paul Feig's mystery-thriller, but it's not hard to notice similarities between certain plot points. However the movie is still entertaining and a twist or two is not so bad and does have a career-best Blake Lively performance.Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick) is mourning the loss of her best friend, Emily Nelson (Blake Lively) who has vanished for the past week and is presumed dead. However Stephanie eventually discovers she didn't know her best friend as well as she thought.As our heroine, Stephanie, Anna Kendrick handles the naive and kinda ditsy girl well considering her role in the ""Pitch Perfect"" trilogy. She has a tacky wardrobe that helps accent her uncoolness among other parents outside of her vlog that she runs (the book has a blog by Stephanie, but the movie wisely chose a video format given the popularity of YouTube vloggers). When she meets Emily, Stephanie's wardrobe slowly transitions to a smarter looking style that heightens after Emily vanishes and even by the conclusion. However Kendrick struggles with being a stronger woman once she learns Emily's true nature. She shifts too much back to her put-upon act for the most of the opening when she should be standing up to Emily.Blake Lively is stellar as the cold, calculated Emily as she bounces between sarcastic bestie to ice-cold bitch. Lively starts as being blunt and smarmy when she interacts with Anna Kendrick and then manages to come across as loving with Henry Golding's Sean (her husband) but still controlling. As Emily's true personality begins to emerge as the film unfolds, she starts tapping into Rosamund Pike's Amy Elliot-Dunne as she blackmails and kills someone close to her. However the script takes away some of Emily's extra crimes that would've been even more beneficial to Lively, but this doesn't deter from her performance.",A Simple Favor

But the movie aims to be a cheekier Vertigo, and even with a running time of almost two hours, it speeds too choppily through Stephanie's detective work, relying instead on inelegant exposition. Stephanie does run into a couple of fun cutups along Emily's paper trail, including Rupert Friend as a viperish fashion designer and the great Jean Smart boozing it up in an attic like a rejected suspect on HBO's other recent gossipy thriller, Sharp Objects. It all makes for one of the more twisted, circuitous and silly capers in recent memory.But the biggest pleasure from A Simple Favor is watching Lively, who was so searing in the taut thriller The Shallows and elevated 2016's baffling All I See Is You. She's a slyly versatile performer, capable of landing a killer punch line. When Lively dead-eyes the ever apologetic Kendrick and threatens to ""slap the sorry out of you,"" you laugh, sigh and practically feel the handprint on your own face.

128,FelipeCarrillo,"It's not Fincher, nor Hitchcock, it's Feig playing at both filmmaking maestros in his newest, twisted psychological chick noir",7,28 November 2018,"Paul Feig, 56, officially commenced on the 1986 TV scene, via a small role as an actor in the sitcom ""The Facts of Life."" Thereafter, he began making a big name for himself both on television and film industry, a long-standing career that decisively reached the peak of praise seven years ago, when ""Bridesmaids"" became not only his highest-grossing production as a director- 288 million, - also one of the fundamental comedies of the 21st century; a cultural (and feminist) sensation that made those who underestimated her reach blush. This mainstream low comedy gem achieving more than 71 nominations - that's right, Golden Globes, BAFTA, and even The Academy - afforded the filmmaker to expand his horizons, always keeping true his roots. That wonderful time is behind and the screenwriter and producer has not experienced the sweet smell of success again, at least, not that kind. Feig's films tried to transcend 2000s big-studio comedy patterns, hence, he created his own model, a Judd Apatow's-inspired one: stories that join together perfectly side-splitting gags, geared by human female roles rich in funny edges. ""The Heat,"" with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, was a safe, small-scale comedy vehicle. ""Spy,"" starring frequent collaborator McCarthy, startled everyone in 2015, an action-comedy delirium, a spy hefty-penned flick with a powerful comical vein, a hilariously entertaining package that is now part of the annals of contemporary comedy. Sometime later, Feig wreaked havoc unveiling the very first female-led ""Ghostbusters"" trailer back in March 2016, leaving no one indifferent to the polemic, one of the most controversial Hollywood remakes in recent memory was born; a modern-day C.G.I mayhem that critics received warmly while original-movies defenders and haters- are they the same thing? - abhorred it even before its official release.Now Sony's flick is history and Feige's up to embrace new film genres. In a world where actors, screenwriters, producers, stunts and any member of crew decide to try their hand at directing with increasing frequency, there is no valid rebuttal if Feig does his impression of David Fincher. Back again with fiercely magnetic, satisfying female leads, the filmmaker directs his own ""Gone Girl"" version as infusing slyly his singular comedy style. It was fun to think about what kind of film the witty mind of the screenwriter could make up, working on a murder investigation crime thriller that needed to be taken seriously. There it is: a strangely composed roller coaster, a drink that will burn your throat.""A Simple Favor"" is, in sum, a stylish, tolerably hyper-twisted psychological crime thriller that places Feig in a gracefully attractive laboratory of genres and tones. Truly great horror-comedy feature films are one of the most hard-to-find cinematographic feats these days; however, narratively and structurally, fusing seriously funny comedy in the narrative tidiness of a whodunit is even more meritorious to praise, a surgically handled work that only an expert on the mechanisms of these genres can achieve; here's a proof.One of the strongest hooks for this domestic noir is the daring style on the divas' attire specifically. Undeniably, the sizzling fineries Lively models with panache during the first two acts and Kendrick, self-indulgent, inherits in the last act pop up on the screen as another à la mode main character. Each of these overwhelmingly fashioned moments comes from costume designer Renée Ehrlich Kalfus, who freezes the viewer up persistently with her original tuxedo designs and their corresponding model. The fashion designer wonderfully personalizes not only the pair of ladies, but the film itself through creations that defy gender standards, which the film runs from several fronts. You are not ready for that navy three-piece suit and six-inch heels, bad weather and umbrella included.Based on Darcey Bell's homonymous novel, the script is penned by Jessica Sharzer- 2016 summer surprise ""Nerve"" screenwriter -with additional Feig touches on it. Joining up the collection of film adaptations based on mystery books featuring women in morally ambiguous situations, with homicides, supposed suicides and dark places driving the plot forward, Sharzer does what she can to remain faithful to the source story, distilling the key points from Bell's novel. But in ""Gone Girl,"" ""The Girl On The Train"" times, her writing falls short delivering solid resolutions, the pyrotechnics and suspicious events of the first hour are drowned by an out-of-control whirlwind of conclusions layering one after the other with less and less credibility.
Emily Nelson is unhappy. We know it from the first moment because of her relationship with her only child, her creatively blocked husband, her job and her almost nonexistent social circle. Still, she's a confident, successful, classy, capable and ungovernable woman. But when her ""perfection"" is threatened by a forthcoming bankruptcy, her true self comes up. After the titular simple favor, she goes missing and the ""why-where-how"" kind of stuff unfolds. But when everything is about to come out the story finds its way to going mad with a myriad of every-minute hilarious twists. Skipping over the third act, this character is beyond intriguing, her persona is attractive, her bluntness and dislike give a different perspective from the pattern, widely different from Rosamund Pike's Amy Dunne. Unfortunately, as soon as there is no mystery, she crumbles and starts a harsh downfall into cartoonish terrain, veering from victim to victimizer with an electrifying and laughable pulse.Blake Lively, despite not being a high-grossing star, is one of the film's faces towards financial success. Known all over the world as Serena van der Woodsen from ""Gossip Girl,"" Lively came back to the silver screen being eternally young and pretty in the 2016 drama ""The Age of Adeline."" Then, following a small role in ""Café Society"" by Woody Allen, she reinvigorated killer shark movies with Jaume Collet-Serra-directed film ""The Shallows,"" which gave a shot to the actress to show what she's capable of. After the underestimated erotic thriller ""All I See Is You,"" Lively is in good hands portraying a sinister, enthralling femme fatale. Embodying Emily in an overwhelming natural way, her caustic, forceful performance achieves to blur the line between innocence and guilt, and that, in this film, means mission accomplished.Kendrick, a.k.a Beca in the ""Pitch Perfect"" trilogy, gives a career-best performance. Lively's already proved herself years ago, Kendrick, even with her Academy nomination, has been involved mostly in humor-related flicks, keeping her distance from powerful, serious character-driven plots. Heroine and villain, Stephanie's the real star here. Widow, helicopter parent, detective and vlogger at once, her evolutionary arc is, besides more plausible than Emily's, wildly enjoyable, veering from mistress to stepmother, from bosom friend to enemy with explosive sympathy. Kendrick's great, so does Lively, but together, they're a bomb of secrets, surprises and seduction; one of the most unique, brilliant female duos in a long time.""A Simple Favor"" by Paul Feig could be mistaken for a vicious, riotous noir experiment by the director and producer behind ""Bridesmaids,"" however, those who are willing to get a ticket for this fiery cocktail won't feel ripped off up until the third act. Feig gives a half-baked impression of a chic Hitchcock through missing girl genre-worthy storytelling ideas, with fortuitous and gratuitous twists that will delight those who chortled when they shouldn't minutes ago. The cast is unbeatable, its posture is stylish by means of eye-popping outfits, an exquisite and elegant French soundtrack, a production design that is colorfully synthetic and a deficient but focused cinematography. The story falls into an overhasty, depraved spiral of revelations halfway through that, in the end, is a ploy to deliver the best Kendrick's performance to date, showcase underestimated Lively's talents and Feig's skills to surprise in every way. Final oversaturation certainly makes the story an incohesive whole, but the new side of the director, its costume design and the electric chemistry between the stellar ladies are enough incentives to treat the final-act hangover.",A Simple Favor
129,bastos,An ok darker comedy from Paul Feig,7,4 October 2020,"I usually don't like Paul Feig's comedies. I have disliked every movie he made since Bridesmaids so I approached this one with caution and very low expectations. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. After Ghostbusters he had to try something different and he went with this darker comedy that works well, thanks to its cast. They manage to turn these horrible characters into something you can root for, especially Anna Kendrick with her usual smiling demeanor, disguising this ultra controlling and smart woman. The ending is not very good and it goes a bit over the top but I still had fun with the ride.",A Simple Favor
130,jackgdemoss,Blake Lively's acting limits are pushed a bit too far,7,20 December 2018,"Critics and friends both told me that this ""Gone Girl-Esque"" film is worth a watch. This intrigued me because Gone Girl is one of my all-time favorites My significant other had it as their number one watchlist item for weeks before we finally sat down to watch it. Needless to say, I may have been a little bit too hyped going into this film, and I was swiftly let down. Expecting something similar to Gone Girl is going to ruin the viewing experience because this is much more like a satire to that unique story arch that Gone Girl portrays. Blake Lively's witty character seems to parallel Rosemund Pike's Amy, but significantly less intimidating and horrifying. I wasn't sure how to take the film seriously because I had no idea whether or not it even wanted me to. A Simple Favor is still worth a watch, but it will subvert your expectations if you expect anything as enthralling as Gone Girl.",A Simple Favor
131,Gresh854,A Not So Simple Film,7,16 September 2018,"The biggest compliment I can give A Simple Favor is that it ALWAYS had me guessing. The movie is fundamentally if Gone Girl was a comedy. Or...if Gillian Flynn all of the sudden, decided to make her writing more jubilant one day. It's funny, cause only a couple weeks ago, Searching came out, which turned out to be an unexpectedly dexterous mystery thriller that I did not anticipate to be so cordon bleu, and now we have A Simple Mind, which turned out to also be an unexpecedtly dexterous mystery thriller that I did not anticipate to be so cordon bleu. Casting Run-Down: Not only is Anna Kendrick adorkably badass in this, but Blake Lively is freakin' eccentric in this. Her character has a certain manner that stands out like a sore thumb-despite that sounding negative it is most doubtlessly positive-which is a sign of some sturdy writing and acting. No chill indeed. I can see now why she and Ryan Reynolds blend as such a lucrative couple. They're both sarcastically savage edgelords. Ultimately, these two-I'm talking about Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively now-are simply put, ingenious wonders. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻There's a certain finesse and foxy, angsty tone inserted throughout layers of this flick that made its entirety terribly merry, but also admirably edgeful. The film had unforeseen moxy to it which I appreciated quite openly. The sole main issue I have with A Simple Favor however, is that the film comes off a tad too quick-cut. It was a bit hard to breathe throughout the movie's runtime since it's always constantly moving due to some eerie editing choices, but really, that's just a small knit-pick that didn't completely banish my enjoyment. As the film progresses you get used to the rush. Overall, I did not expect A Simple Favor to be so freakin' grand and so freakin' ""unsimplistic."" Damn titles. Anyways, I implore all you mystery fanatics out there who yearn little, stylistic twists to their devilish predilections, to seek this gem out immediately. (Verdict: B+)",A Simple Favor
132,Bertaut,"Stylised, self-aware, and hilarious - a (mostly) enjoyable parody",7,3 October 2018,"Examining the rotten core beneath the surface urbanity of suburbia is something that has attracted filmmakers as diverse as Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and Joe Dante. More recently, novels such as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl (and its subsequent filmic adaptation), have expanded and popularised the suburban noir genre; the very genre that A Simple Favour's satirical excesses primarily target. A semi-comedic look at the lives of two young mothers in an affluent American suburb, coupled with a mystery plot, the film has an undeniable identity crisis due to its genre mash-up characteristics. Although director Paul Feig proves adept at handling the parodic side of things, in the latter stages, he seems to be trying to ensure the film can exist (relatively) un-ironically within the very genre it's attempting to lampoon. Despite this schizophrenic quality, however, the interplay between the two leads, the heavy stylisation, the playfully self-aware nature of the aesthetic, and the success of the burlesque elements all serve to make the film undeniably entertaining.Adapted by Jessica Sharzer from Darcey Bell's 2017 novel, A Simple Favour tells the story of Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), a widowed single-mum who runs a life hacks vlog with minimal viewership. Enter Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), a public relations executive for a major fashion label. Soon after meeting, the two are bonding over increasingly strong martinis and girl chats, with Stephanie in awe of Emily, who seems to have it all; a good-looking novelist/lecturer husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a gorgeous house, a successful career, a great kid, and an acerbic attitude that Stephanie would kill for. Several weeks later, with Emily held up at work, she asks Stephanie to pick up her son, and she'll collect him later. Except she doesn't collect him. As a few days go by, and no one seems to know where Emily is, Stephanie and Sean report her missing. However, unsatisfied with the direction the investigation is taking, Stephanie is soon amateur sleuthing her way across the country in an effort to track down her friend.A Simple Favour is at its best when working as a parody/satire of ""mommy murder mysteries"", gently (and often not so gently) ribbing the genre, and exposing some of its more ill-conceived and unrealistic tropes to ridicule. For example, the three main characters are all standard generic templates to the point of cliché; the ingénue who feels honour-bound to do everything she can to find the truth; the sardonic, caustic, and utterly shady plot catalyst, who always seems to have an ace up her sleeve; and, the brilliant but frustrated spouse who may, or may not, be in on the crime at the narrative's centre. However, their archetypal characteristics are dialled up to such a degree that they can't help but seem caricatures. Similarly, everything is presented in such a nonchalant and laid back manner that the twists, which in a more self-serious film would occupy centre stage, are often rendered absurd. However, and this is the key point, A Simple Favour is very much in on the joke. Most of the time.Opening with a late 1960s Europop-influenced Saul Bass-esque title sequence complete with sliding split-screens and pastel colours, scored to Jean Paul Keller's 1967 ""Ca s'est arrange"", the film signals its playful tone right from the off. This emphasis on stylisation is perhaps seen most clearly upon Emily's introduction. As Stephanie shelters from the rain, Emily emerges from a car in slow motion, with the camera starting on her feet before slowly moving up to her head as she raises an umbrella. Cutting to a mid-shot, she then begins to walk across the carpark (still in slow motion), as a broken umbrella blows past her, replacing the tumbleweed of a classic western shootout. Apart from being a memorable introduction to the character, the visual design of the scene is predicated on cine-literacy, showing that the filmmakers are more than aware of standard genre tropes, and, more importantly, how to employ them for comedic effect.Indeed, the entire film revels in its own intertextual awareness, with later references to such defining noir texts as Gaslight (1944), Spellbound (1945), and Les diaboliques (1955). Another element of this awareness is the use of a fractured narrative structure, so beloved of classic noir mysteries. Large portions of the film feature narration within narration, as well as making use of another classic noir staple; the unreliable narrator. The film gets significant mileage out of scenes where the aural narration doesn't even come close to matching the visuals. An especially funny example of this is when Stephanie tells Emily about kissing her step-brother after their father's funeral, and Emily immediately knows she is lying that she only kissed him. Whilst the narrator (Stephanie) flat-out denies she slept with him, the audience sees them having sex, confirming the narratee's (Emily) suspicions. This technique is used several times in the film, and it's an extremely well-handled narrative device.The film's main target for satire, however, is not really a specific genre (suburban noir) or even the tropes that define that genre - it's the milieu that enables the existence of that genre in the first place. Together, Stephanie, Emily, and Sean represent everything that's rotten with the sterilised, emotionally deadening middle-class suburban sphere in which they're (seemingly) trapped. However, the film doesn't condemn them for being horrible people, rather it exults in their awfulness, deftly directing, redirecting, and misdirecting the audience's sympathies, to the point where it becomes difficult to say who is screwing over whom. Every time the film seems to settle on who the villains are, it disrupts the audience's perceptions, and oftentimes, so as to achieve maximum satirical impact, precisely when the character we are now being asked to empathise with is up to something somewhat less than moral. This is the very essence of black comedy - the film presents a hideous world populated by hideous people who do hideous things to one another, but it does so in such a cheerful and uplifting manner that you simply can't help but laugh at the shenanigans.In relation to this, the film works especially well when jauntily charting the friendship between Stephanie and Emily, two women who have no businesses co-existing. Kendrick essentially plays the same character she has in every performance in her career thus far, but it works here because, a) it's the perfect foil to the ""screw-you"" persona of Emily, and b) Kendrick and Lively have such effortless chemistry. Lively plays Emily as a mischievous, experienced charmer, the kind of person who acts like they know your secrets ten seconds after meeting you, whilst Kendrick's Stephanie is all self-deprecating intellectualism, trailed-off sentences, and statements phrased like questions.If there was one element of the film that didn't work, however, it was the mystery plot. Yes, I get that it's all a satire of the multi-twist-for-twist's-sake suburban murder mystery, with the preposterousness of such plots played for maximum farcicality. However, the satirical underpinning doesn't change the fact that the entire mystery at the film's centre is insipid, uninteresting, and predictable, with Feig unable to bridge the tone of the frothier comic moments and the darker ones which become increasingly prevalent towards the end. Granted, the film is not a spoof, à la something like Airplane! (1980), so we can't expect absurdist humour throughout, but nevertheless, rather than choosing to employ a relatively even tone, Feig seems to have made the decision to mix scenes of outright comedy with predominantly serious scenes devoid of laughter. And it doesn't work. For example, the film features a scene in which someone who has just been ploughed by a car and is trying to crawl away is nonchalantly told if they don't stop, they're going to hurt their knees. That's pretty dark, but it's also pretty funny. However, it comes only a short while after a scene in which a drug-addict is held under the water and drowned. Not a huge amount to laugh at there. If scenes of this nature are supposed to be satiric, and hence feed into the film's engagement with the suburban noir, I couldn't see any evidence of it.For all that, however, I found A Simple Favour enjoyable. The purely-satirical early scenes earn enough goodwill so that the less successful more plot-heavy later scenes don't completely tear the whole thing down. The film as a whole shines a not unwelcome light on the increasingly self-important suburban noir, and for the most part, the parody is very well judged. When the comedy is forced to retreat in the service of more serious material, the tonal balance is definitely knocked off, as the film comes dangerously close to valorising that which it has set out to mock. Despite this, however, A Simple Favour remains entertaining. Distractingly attractive people wear ridiculously stylish clothes in a stylised cine-literate parody - it won't change your life, but it's a very rewarding couple of hours.",A Simple Favor
133,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Simply Fun,8,1 October 2018,"When I first saw the trailer my reaction was that it looked like Gone Girl lite. And in a way, yeah thats what it was...but I also liked it more than I was expecting. Partly, because its funny and doesnt take itself too seriously all the time. I think Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively worked well off each other and had good chemistry. I also thought Rupert Friend was quite good. Its a much smaller role but I thought he disappeared (no pun intended) into the role. Physically, he doesnt look too different but you almost wouldnt recognize him.Story wise, I thought it was a good mix of drama and comedy. Again, if you're going in looking for the next Gone Girl I dont think you'll find it with this. But I personally thought it had a good mix of drama and comedy. I thought the mystery aspect was well done up until the end. I found it got a little muddled, a little rushed but overall I wasnt sure how it was going to end, who was really on whose side etc. Which is good. Trigger warning as well, there is an incest aspect to the film. It put me off. Kind of wish it wasnt in there.  I also loved the outfits. I would loved to play around in Emily's (Blake Lively) closet.If I had to rate I would say its probably somewhere a 7.5-8.",A Simple Favor
134,solojere,Anna Kendrick Shines in an Almost Perfect Dark Humor Thriller,9,11 February 2021,"A Simple Favor is by far one of Anna Kendrick's best performances, which is so close to being perfect it's painful. The film follows Stephanie Smothers (Anna Kendrick), who is a single vlogging mom of the year. Stephanie's life changes when she befriends Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), who is an unapologetic, narcissistic, and shady mom. Things get strange for Stephanie when Emily asks Stephanie to watch her son and then disappears. From here, the film then flows Stephanie as she attempts to unravel the truth behind Emily's disappearance.
While this film is pretty predictable, it is a fun watch. The star of the show is Anna Kendrick. She does an amazing job and looks amazing in every shot. Stephanie Smothers is a fascinating and complex character. However, what separates prevents this movie from being great is Emily Nelson is a week character. In my opinion, the one weakness of the film is Blake Lively and her character. She and Kendrick have don't have the chemistry they should, and it really shows. (I read an article that the two really butted head in shooting this film, which could explain why their friendship feels forced). Also, I feel that the film really wanted us to feel that there was a sexual attraction between Emily and Stephanie, but there wasn't enough there for me to ship them (unlike Bechloe :). You're supposed to have mixed feelings about Emily's character and her relationship with Stephanie, but I just ended up hating her (which is sad because Lively can be fantastic like in Age of Adaline). Some people on here have complained about the ending, but I quite like the way it ended. And overall I really enjoy this film and Anna Kendrick's performance.",A Simple Favor

But what I was hoping for was a bit more biting satire, sadly the movie doesn't deliver. Tonally, it was light, but it wasn't consistent, it went dark, fun, serious, comical, it just couldn't pull it all together. Towards the end, things started happening where you were like 'wait, when did they discuss doing this?' or 'how did he get into his car when his house was being raided by SWAT? Did he even have time to check the vlog to show what was happening?'

136,lyubitelfilmov,"The faded ""Gone Girl"" or Paul Fig: part two",6,4 August 2020,"Detective. A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by writer Darcy Bell, who also co-wrote the script here. I continue to watch the pictures of Paul Fig, the previous one (Bridesmaids) was just disgusting, so let's not remember this squalor (the wounds are still bleeding), and focus on this detective, whose release in the cinema I safely missed. And now I even regret it a little, all the same, the atmosphere and sound of the cinema will never be carried home, nothing can be done about it. I was skeptical about the picture, and here's my brief opinion - the faded ""Gone Girl"". As in any picture (well, almost) there are both pluses and minuses, and I intend now to go over them so that you understand my final assessment and emotions that this detective has caused.
So the pros:
1. Detective story - a lonely mother, who is blogging, receives a message from her best friend about a small favor, after which she disappears, and soon her body is found. And it would seem that we can end on this, but a nervous sensation follows our heroine, as if she is being watched, and she begins her own investigation. Somewhere I've already seen it, something familiar. Oh, right, David Fincher's 2014 ""Gone Girl"". The skeleton and mood are directly licked from there. And if at first I absolutely did not give a damn about what was happening, since I was not imbued with heroes, then closer to the middle it was simply impossible to tear me away from the screen, and not only because I read subtitles (I had not watched foreign films in the original for a long time, I decided to remember), but because I was drawn to the story. The investigation turned out to be really interesting and exciting. Several scenario twists made the story quite dynamic, and the ending will definitely not disappoint you, if you forget about the existence of the painting ""Gone Girl
"", of course. I got a certain pleasure from the story.
2. Humor - I won't say that it is great here and will make you laugh at the top of your voice, but a large number of absurdities and funny situations caused your humble servant a certain dose of good mood and the release of a small amount of endorphin.
3. Acting - yes, there are no actors of the ""highest"" echelon, and the modest budget (twenty million) clearly would not have pulled them, but those that are, act out well, not ideal, of course, but you believe their emotions, you worry about them ... This simply cannot be taken away from the picture.
4. French music - don't you think, the music is generally good, the composer Theodore Shapiro clearly knows his business, but it turned out that it was French that I remember most of all. I even recognized one singer who sings French chanson (not to be confused with Russian, this is completely different). And music lovers may like this picture.
So the cons:
1. The vulgarity - since there was plenty of it in the first half, I thought to finish watching, but refrained from this step. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude, but this is clearly overdone with vulgarity. Maybe it was in a book that I haven't read, but here you could replace just a couple of sentences in the script - and everything would be much more civilized.
2. Leisbianism - and again we are talking about it. What raccoon is this nonsense here? And I would understand if it was a joke, but no, they talk about it and show it. Thank God that only once and that and that, but I was disgusted to look at it. The world is going crazy. Hello Apocalypse!
3. ""Gone Girl"" 2.0 - I have already mentioned this, and if you start comparing both of these pictures, then this one clearly loses to Fincher's picture, since there is the atmosphere, the mood, the script, and the drama and the heroes are much more open and crushes all this many times more per viewer. There was just no humor. And if you look at Paul Fig's picture in isolation from Fincher's, then it is really good to look at it, but I cannot look at it like that. An obvious attempt to imitate, though not entirely successful.
A little about the main characters:
1. Stephanie Smothers, played by Anna Kendrick, is a single mom blogging. Shy, cheerful, cheerful, who got entangled in a real network of intrigues and terrible mysteries of the past. At first, the heroine did not hook me, but gradually won my trust, although I suspected her of bad things. Anna did a pretty good job of the role.
2. Emily Nelson played by Blake Lively - Stephanie's eccentric friend who has mysteriously disappeared. Behaves too abstruse and sometimes defiantly, but against the background of the heroine Rosamund Pike from ""Gone Girl"" to be overcame a pale shadow, and only, but Blake shines here, you can't argue with that.
3. Sean Townsend, played by Henry Golding - the husband of the missing Emily and almost the only man in the film who attracts attention with his charisma. Behaves like a disconsolate husband and loving father. I am already familiar with Henry (thanks to the painting "" Last Christmas ""), and here he did not disappoint me. An archetypal image, with a touch of Henry. Well done.
The picture became successful at the box office, grossing almost one hundred million dollars, and it deserves it. For all its drawbacks, the picture is fun as a detective, though not suitable for revision.
And one more thing, it would be better if I watched in Russian dubbing, otherwise Anna Kendrick's voice was very annoying, sorry, but this is a fact.
As a result, we have a good detective story with several scenario twists, good music and atmosphere, good humor, but with a clearly licked idea, vulgarity, but with good acting work.",A Simple Favor

The main mystery is intriguing and fairly unpredictable, and Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively are a delight to watch on screen.

This opening act presents a nerdy suburban single mom befriended by a condescending femme fatale, who promptly disappears in suspicious circumstances. The unraveling of the mystery becomes increasingly ludicrous and unbelievable, with director Feig relying more and more on his comedy background rather than attempting to create tension.

142,hunter-friesen,Simple Favor is Simply Average,6,27 September 2018,"Stephanie Smothers is a young woman who absolutely loves her job as a single mother to her son. Her life consists of caring for him, volunteering at school, and running a popular parenting vlog. At school, she meets Emily Nelson, the mother of her son's best friend. Emily works a high-end job in the city and is powerful, mysterious, and glamorous, all the things Stephanie isn't. The two of them quickly become best friends, or so Stephanie thinks. One day she gets a call from Emily, asking for ""a simple favor"". The favor quickly gets out of hand, flipping Stephanie's clean life upside down. A twisted game starts to take shape, one that threatens to uncover layers of hidden secrets and dark desires. ""A Simple Favor"" comes as the first drama for director Paul Feig, who's best known for comedies such as ""Spy"" and ""Ghostbusters"". Feig directs the first act impeccably. He sets up the plot with confidence by introducing us to the main characters. We are given their personalities and background, but not in their entirety. Some details are left out intentionally in order to build suspense, which works very well at keeping us on the edge of our seats. Unfortunately, the next two acts don't work as well. Feig starts to lose control over his film and things get messy. The pacing slows way down and important plot points are thrown at us left and right until we can't keep things straight. Feig also has minor problems with the overall tone. The film doesn't want to be taken too seriously as it mixes elements of both drama and comedy. The only problem is that the flipping between tones doesn't feel as natural as it should. The third act especially suffers from this as we don't know what to be feeling when the climax arrives. Adapted from the 2017 novel of the same name, the writing for ""A Simple Favor"" fares just as well as the directing. The first act introduces a strong premise with interesting characters. The conversations between Stephanie and Emily are whip-smart as each character tries to understand the other. The next two acts aren't able to sustain the same level of mystery as the first. Things start to get a little too preposterous too quickly. The characters lose their edge and become carbon copies of what we've seen before in previous films. There is also an overabundance of clichés in the latter half of the film that undermines all the good material that had been set up in the beginning. None of them will be listed for the sake of spoilers. It's just very underwhelming because each one has been done before and comes off as predictable and disappointing.Anna Kendrick does pretty solid work as Stephanie Smothers. She plays the young mom type quite well and provides a lot of great material for the comedic tone. The one struggle she has is when the film starts to get darker as she's just not entirely believable as a character with a bad side. Blake Lively, sharing the same fate as Kendrick, plays Emily Nelson. Lively excels early on as her confidence brings an aura of mystery to her character. By the end, however, she loses what made her so good and her performance becomes more one-note. Fresh off his breakout role as Nick Young in ""Crazy Rich Asians"", Henry Golding stars as Sean Townsend, Emily's husband. Golding brings the same charm from his previous role, but with more edge to it. He fairs alright, but constantly gets overshadowed by the two leading ladies. ""A Simple Favor"" can be loosely branded as a campier and lower quality version of ""Gone Girl"". It boasts one of the best opening acts of the year, but also some of the biggest mistakes that lead to a lot of missed potential. Overall, ""A Simple Favor"" is an average film that serves up enough mystery and thrills to warrant a viewing.",A Simple Favor

144,n-kefala,Enjoyable movie,7,30 September 2018,"""A simple favor"" is a very clever film, enhanced by two fine actresses, Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively. Most movies don't give female characters much respect, but this one is different because gives the two lead characters plenty of power and substance. Especially Blake Lively finally achieves the status of actress with a delicious role seemingly written for her. The film it keeps you on the edge of your seat and, even at the end, you still can't believe the twists and turns that play out. At the same time the movie refuses to take itself seriously, and is an entertaining film because of that. Paul Feig is one of the few men who know how to direct women and he does it perfectly. A very enjoyable movie. nikisreviews.gr",A Simple Favor
145,JurijFedorov,It's fun but silly,7,4 October 2021,"I was surprised by how funny the lead was. She basically brought 80% of the comedy to the movie. That made the beginning very bearable even thought it was a bit slow paced. It's always a fun watch, but the mystery itself only begins fairly late and really gets going right before the movie ends. Still, it all was fun. It's just that the main plot is rushed and you never know who wants what or why because there mystery elements begin at the end and we kinda just get only a bit of an overview. It's like the movie is missing another 30 minutes of runtime that would explain all the missing details. We jump from scene to scene and kinda have to figure out what is going on. As the comedy is a center element much of the plot is over the top silly too so it's even harder to figure out as it has no basis in reality.Actually, the mystery stuff is kinda dark. This is a comedy that goes from light to dark very fast and back again. It never really stays in one single genre so many viewers will HATE it. For me it works just fine. I just wanted a bit more time for the plot to develop and more logical scenes. It felt comedic and all parts kinda fit together perfectly even though you know cops in real life would not act this clueless about very easy clues. Everything here makes no sense, but still is kinda a story.It's just fun. If you start searching for plot holes you will find so many that nothing here makes sense. The whole plan is nonsensical and nothing here is logical or smart.My favorite scenes were the funny school scenes at the start before the mystery. There is a group with 2 moms and a dad that is amazingly fun to watch. We see them back talk the lead with various funny gossip and it all makes so much sense. She is acting weird and they are indeed just funny and cute as they sit together and tell stories. It's weird how a movie about a dark mystery is best when it is just a comedy. You shouldn't be afraid to watch this even though it's a mess plot wise, theme wise and genre wise. Much works very well here, but nothing gets the limelight and everything feels fake. Don't take any of this seriously and be prepared for the plot to make no sense at times.",A Simple Favor
146,snowfre,Entertaining and well-written but in need of balance between genres,6,11 March 2020,"""A Simple Favor"" is an exciting thriller in a ""Desperate Housewife""-esque packaging, a format which benefits the plot twists that - towards the end of the film - is delivered in a high pace. Anna Kendrick plays widow and stay at home mother Stephanie Smothers who is also a vlogger. Through her son, she gets to know Emily Nelson (Blake Livley), cool and outgoing, she is many ways Stephanie's opposite. Differences aside, they form a friendship, but as Emily suddenly disappears, shocking revelations are revealed as Stephanie researches her past. ""A Simple Favor"" is intriguing, and early on it catches your interest, and director Paul Feig's mix of comedy and thriller is working out fine. Now, the film is quite long and it doesn't take you long as an audience to realize that Emily has an identical twin. So the main twist is unfortunately quite easy to foresee, but the writers have filled the movie with smaller ones, of the type you did not expect. While acting and writing is mainly solid, my main issue is the film's tendencies to become anti-climatic; the writers choice to end the whole film with Emily being struck by a car driven by some other parents. Yes, it was funny, but the climatic drama could have been much more well-balanced than that. ""A Simple Favor"" is, to summarize, an easily digested mystery drama, that, while lacking some finishing touches (and a better ending) will entertain.",A Simple Favor
147,PotassiumMan,Splashy noir with a goofball sense of humor,7,24 September 2018,"Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively shine in this mystery about an upscale professional woman who disappears shortly after befriending a fellow mother whose son is a classmate of her son's. The two play off each other quite well, with Kendrick as a sheltered but inquisitive single mother who gets more than she bargained for and Lively in a scathing role of a woman you do not want to cross.At times, the film can be twisty to the point of dizziness, but it all pays off in the end. Henry Golding is a wild card in this puzzle as Lively's dashing academic husband. A film that will keep you guessing on who's the wrongdoer until the very end, this one will keep you on your toes. For all the dark subject matter, there is a refreshing sense of devil-may-care levity, something a lot of good films occasionally lack.Escapist fun and sardonic upscale humor give this film a chipper feel of vibrancy.

Directed by Paul Feig. Written by Jessica Sharzer
This movie was quite the trip. It really plays with your expectations and ideas on where the story is going. This is the movie Paul Feig made after the disaster Ghostbusters. I hated Ghostbusters for many, many different reasons. I don't think Paul Feig is a bad filmmaker and this movie proves that. He has an eye for unique comedic material at least in this case.There is not much of the plot that I can speak of because the movie runs on surprises and suspense. Anna Kendrick is a single mother who has been recently widowed making vlogs about being a mom and trying too hard to fit into the role of being an outgoing mother. She meets an alcoholic fashionable mother and they become unlikely friends. Then she disappears after asking Anna Kendrick to watch her son.This movie then takes a turn for the truly bizarre. It also has a tonal shift. The movie starts out full blown friendship comedy and then when Blake Lively's character goes missing, it becomes like Gone Girl. Anna Kendrick becomes a detective with a mommy vlog. This is all I can say of the plot. Just enjoy the surprises that come from following the story.You will want to yell at the screen to get people to change their actions. I honestly found myself drawn to the things happening. I was confused by some of the tonal changes but ultimately went along with it and I was all the better for it. The performances are all top notch. Anna Kendrick plays off of her image very well. Blake Lively goes above and beyond with her performance. She is so good in this film. Together they manage to take the film over the top.I had a blast watching this movie and really enjoyed it. I would recommend giving it a watch. You might find yourself in the same boat as me. I give this movie a B.",A Simple Favor

All story is bout cracking a missing person by her bestfriend, that elegantly played by Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick. Blake and Anna are head to head acting for the first time also in this movie. The main story is seen as simple thing, that there is a mom; a rich director of marketing, and a mysterious wife; has been going missing, then each scene by scene lead us to find the true secret of each actors role to give mark hands that can easily being judged. Perhaps the audience began to give up to guess who is the real villain and the hero, because moms and one dad are trying to prove the mistakes left behind the crime scene and how each other bloom up each dark side. There is only one weak of this movie in the middle is just going so clear, it's about the appearance of supporting actors, so I think audience can guess directly the motive. This movie is also giving parenting critiques about how American parents raise the children. As predicted, we are also having fun with Anna Kendrick's weirdo face and gesture as usual. She played as a good widow who loves details, as she loves doing cooking tutorial on the Internet, and that's why she also in details to rethink the secret that she just collected.

171,Benslie,A surprisingly good movie,9,4 November 2018,"Now I have to give props to Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, who did spectacular jobs in this film. They both could easily play off of one another like yin and yang. Both actresses gave it their all in these roles and you can easily see that. Anna probably had the most captivating one of them all . You see her struggle to try and find her friend and at the same time be a good mom to her kid, and she just did a great job of portraying that struggle . Another thing that this movie did great were the costumes. I don't usually talk about the clothes but they had to be mentioned for this film. All of the outfits were marvelous and deserve a nomination for the costumes. They also were like characters on their own. They also helped in showing character arcs and growth, mainly for Anna Kendricks clothes. I also really liked the musical scores. It helped you understand the tension in some scenes. Now some thing that could be fixed is how the film felt like two different movies to me, and not in a good way. The first half of the film just felt really slow to me, which is understandable due to it introducing the characters, but the other half was way more interesting. The second half was more intense and had me on the edge of my seat. There is a plot twist that is very obvious about what it was going to be. In the end, ""A Simple Favour"" was a surprisingly enjoyable film - one that I think a lot of people would like.",A Simple Favor
172,christophershobris,Electric performances,9,23 September 2018,"If nothing else, Lively and Kendrick make this movie absolutely fantastic. Lively plays a triple role playing Emily Nelson and her two sisters, she gives her best performance in her career, and as of right now she deserves an Oscar nod. Anna Kendrick does a great job keeping up, resulting in an electric acting duo. Also, the directing by Feig, and the writing by Sharzer keep the mystery alive, managing to keep the complexity, but understanding enough to where the audience doesn't get lost. It also doesn't spoon feed to us as well, leaving us thinking about the film well after the movie is over. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with superb performances from the main stars and a pretzel-twisted and engaging mystery, than look no further. However, on the other side, there are some unnecessary scenes I feel could have been cut altogether, one in particular serves as a little reference later.

Stephanie does what is described as a simple favour and then the mystery takes off. Adding the comedy to this movie was a stroke of genius. To imagine the plot without it makes one realise how important the humour is.

Anna Kendrick is cute as a squirrel's nut as the repressed, nerdy, compulsive vlogger/single mom with tragic dimensions. Her comedic timing and mannerisms are delightful. Blake Lively vivifies the scenes with her flash fire prurience and a mouth you wouldn't want your mother kissed with...depending on her politics, of course. A fine foil for Kendrick. The two have a strange but efficacious chemistry together. Runnells' flamboyant character was a gas, too. As was Salahuddin, who steals a few scenes, as the wisecracking, ogle-eyed detective. Fantastic soundtrack, too, especially the Serge Gainsbourg.Those were the pros, here are the cons...
The compact majority of the plot was predictable (no spoilers here). Golding was a laughable miscasting decision. His weak acting was dwarfed by the talents of Kendrick and Lively. He's more like an idea of a character than an actual character, if you know what I mean. His cardboard-cut-out-ness put a damper on otherwise fine scenes, not unlike a fart during foreplay.

My wife and me started discussing during the movie, how it could end. Were were really intrigued by all the possibilities.After half of the movie everything changes suddenly. The story takes a turn for the worse, there is humor in it and from all the possibilities what could have happened with Emily, the writers took the worst angle: She is a psycho and had a twin.

This change made ""A simple favor"" a very mediocre experience. A good ending can save a mediocre movie, but a bad ending can also wipe away the good experience in the first part of the movie.How this movie should have ended:
There were many signs that Stephanie is really the psychotic woman. Her husband died (we later find out that she killed him), she lives off the life ensurance money that is about to run out, she is intrigued by the wealth or Emily and her husband, so it would have been really naughty if she killed Emily to take the life that she had.

Some funny moments that made me think the story was a bit over the top (I didn't know it was a true story; you get that info at the end). Also it gave me an appreciation of Anna Kendrick.

The main character played by Anne Kendrick lost my sympathy when she did something friends don't do after losing her friend. I was actually a little relieved it devolved into broad, almost slapstick comedy toward the end, which excused the twistier than a corkscrew plot twists, in a way. ""Okay, we didn't really mean it, and don't expect you to, either. "".This page seems to have most of those songs, though a few of the Youtube videos don't play.

A Simple Favor turns out to be anything but. Anna and Blake (both are amazing) are the stars of this fantastic dark comedy, but what really makes this one shine are the supporting cast members also contribute some really solid performances. Like a fine-tuned sports car, the movie hums along at a frenetic pace and never lets the viewer go. The problem with some movies is they try too hard to be funny, only to let us down near the end when the plot falls apart, or the movie gets too mushy. Glad to say none of this happens to A Simple Favor, as there are a lot of laugh out loud moments that parallel a truly genuine drama!

Kendrick is funny, witty and portrays the role of single hyperactive mom convincingly. Blakely is hot and plays the protagonist well.

224,DJKwa,"A tonal mishmash. Imagine Gone Girl directed by Paul Feig, or better yet, don't.",3,12 September 2018,"First things first, A Simple Favour is not really a mystery film, well not a good one at least. As much as the marketing would have you believe, those looking for the next Gone Girl or The Girl on The Train will need to continue their search. The story here is far-fetched, overcooked and unravels in such a haste that it's hard to treat much of it seriously. Director Paul Feig (best known for his comedy works such as Bridesmaids and Spy), seemingly aware of the story's inherent ridiculousness, keeps the film light and easily digestible, but the result is a weird tonal hybrid of a comedy-mystery that fails at being either. Think Game Night, but more obnoxious than funny.Based on the novel by Darcey Bell, A Simple Favour follows Stephanie (Anna Kendrick), a widowed, single mum who runs a mommy blog. Her goody two-shoes personality makes her pariah amongst the other parents. One day, on a playdate for their children, she befriends Emily (Blake Lively), a chic, elegant woman whose everything she is not. Before long they become best friends, and when Emily disappears, Stephanie steps out of her shell to solve the mystery.Anna Kendrick stars in a role perfectly attuned to her goofy charms and Blake Lively convincingly embodies the enigmatic nature of her character in a crucial supporting role. Henry Golding, hot off Crazy Rich Asians, gets the rough end of the deal playing Emily's husband, a character who, while not entirely likeable, is cruelly used and manipulated by the two female protagonists throughout the film. It's disheartening to see that the film's message of female empowerment often comes as a result of emasculating its primary male character. In fact, the film's regressive approach to bolstering its two strong female leads does the film a great disservice.The only consistency between all the characters is that none of them are particularly likeable. They each make questionable decisions, are gratingly self-centered and become increasingly obnoxious as the film progresses with its dubious twists. By the end, you'll be hard pressed to care about any of them. This is no more evident than in the film's tacked on ""where are they now?' postscript that feels completely unnecessary and ill informed in assuming audiences care enough about the characters to know where they end up. On the upside, Feig, who is more proficient in making fun films rather than serious ones, keeps the film feeling light and easy-going. He knowingly teases the audience with a stylish soundtrack filled with classy French music, and there are some funny scenes that incite light chuckles rather than any laugh out loud bursts of humour. These meager positives don't improve the stillborn narrative but at least they make it a little less painful to digest.Ultimately, A Simple Favour is a strange blend of mystery and comedy that doesn't gel into a cohesive whole. As a piece of entertainment, it's entirely disposable. As a thriller, well, imagine Gone Girl as directed by Paul Feig. Or better yet, don't.",A Simple Favor

A Simple Favor takes the audience on a journey between the most improbable friendship between an upbeat, vlogging mother and an off-the-rails woman of mystery. 
The title may say simple, but this movie is nothing but. The plot and script were superbly put together placing breadcrumbs around to connect a ball of string. There were moments of shock and awe as well as genuine character development and acting between a star-studded cast. With three main characters they had the powerful trio of Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, and the new and immediately strong Henry Golding. Each play into the already strengths of the actors and didn't have to necessarily become someone new.

227,zeionara,An ordinary detective story,6,26 September 2018,"The movie may be good enough for those who doesn't require much from a movie, but generally, in my opinion, if we will compare to many others, the movie has not very good meaning for cinema.
First of all, it has very typical plot, which is common for all detectives - surely, there are unexpected twistes, but they are not differ from similar elements from another detectives, for example, ""A girl with a dragon tatoo"". And what's even worse, the movie, as it may be understood just after watching the trailer, doesn't offer some questions to think about. It hasn't got any moments, which could be interpreted differently (depending on viewer) - it is just an ordinary story, similar to many others, so, if you want just a new story, a little fun and a little sad, if you want just some new characters with their problems, you should like this movie.
Despite the described facts, the movie also supplies few unique director's techinques, which could be seen in a few another movies. The story also has it's own shape, so it is not just repeating everything that has been shown previously. The plot is completely not linear (although it might be a little shorther), the characters are not too typical and their interaction shown from unique angle which I haven't seen before. Actors play good enough and it is surely the big plus for the movie for picture. It was interesting to watch the movie, but I wouldn't watch it again later because of lack of original ideas or views related to something outside of the picture.
As a result, it is not possible to say that movie is just another copy of some other movie, but mostly it is. It is just ordinary, so if I would have missed the movie, I haven't lost much. On the other side, It wasn't boring to watch the picture. That's why, as far as I can see, the movie should get intermediate mark, maybe a litter higher than medium.",A Simple Favor

And what's more, some of the characters seem to shift personalities subtly halfway.Another matter with this movie is how exaggerated some scenes are, which seem to be over-dramatic yet there seems to be little explanation for how or why some things happened.The lead female actress was fantastic in her portrayal of all the emotions during the various scenes, which added points to the movie, while the rest of the cast was pretty monotone in a way.Great movie for those who like overblown dramas, otherwise you might want to stay away.",A Simple Favor

And you shall be hard pressed to recall it in future.A Simple Favour makes some interesting superficial choices - the costume design is pitch perfect, and the soundtrack oozes French charm - but much like the mansion-esque house half the movie takes part in, it looks nice, but is alienating and hollow.The film builds these characters and setups and payoff that you'll click with, but the film says it all in the first few conversations between Kendrick and Lively. Stilted, overpacked dialogue that goes nowhere.

253,canniballife-78396,It's Not Terrible,7,18 December 2019,"Right off the bat, I'll admit that I don't ""get"" Blake Lively - in the sense that I don't understand why she gets cast in movies. But then I can answer my own confusion by understanding that she only gets parts where she plays ""Blake Lively"". Like Rock Hudson, John Wayne, or even Walter Matthau, she basically plays herself - since that's all she's equipped to do. Anna Kendrick does her usual ""nerdling"" thing, and I wonder if she's dreaming of a movie where she gets to be the femme fatale.
The narrative arc hangs together more or less - through what you might call a triple-switch - and, speaking as a seasoned moviegoer, there were a couple of surprises, and some funny lines. You can see the end coming long before it arrives, but there are worse ways to spend two hours.",A Simple Favor

256,d-snake1,A fun popcorn flick that's worth at least one viewing.,7,24 September 2018,"First and foremost, this film feels like someone went to their local grocery store, grabbed a random three-dollar mystery novel off the checkout shelf, and decided to make it a movie with some extremely popular and attractive people. In other words, it's a silly mystery movie with crazy, zany twists and turns. Some of those twists and turns were easy enough to see coming, but some of them were straight out of left field. In addition to the entertaining twists, the film does a decent job of not taking itself seriously. The humor in the movie is peppered in during great moments. Some of it is cheesy, but if you're going to this film for a deep, thought-provoking film, don't. The characters themselves are all extremely exaggerated. Lively's Emily is over-the-top sophisticated, crass, and private to the point where she won't allow pictures or even paintings of her face. Kendrick's Stephanie is bubbly, eager, awkward, and overly friendly. The rest of the cast fills in the needs around them, and while the cast is filled with one-note characters, they fulfill the needs well. Golding's Sean was my least favorite, but mainly because he doesn't have a defined archetype in a film filled with single-aspect characters. The biggest issue with the film is the plot itself. Emily contradicts herself with the motive for her faking her own death. She tells Sean that she did it for him and for Nicky. Then she says she did it for her. On top of it all, she doesn't appear to have a plan to get the insurance money after it comes through. The film could have easily alleviated all of these issues with a quick scene or a line about fake passports for Emily and Nicky. All in all, A Simple Favor is a fun romp filled with crazy twists and turns, humor, and great acting. Don't think too much about the film itself, and just go have some fun. It's definitely worth a getaway matinee.",A Simple Favor

264,violinjoe,another housewife-turned-sociopath movie....,4,21 January 2019,"The four star rating comes the fact that I couldn't figure out how the movie would end. To its credit, it is an unknown until it actually happens.But here is the main problem with the film--even when the ""big reveal"" moment happens, I wasn't sure whether to laugh or be shocked. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and that is a very big problem in a market saturated with self-aware films.The basic premise of the story is that a widowed woman befriends a caustic married mom from her child's school, until this woman goes missing. The friend then takes on a sort of Nancy Drew-style investigation to find her friend, which is about as believable as watching a later scene involving gun fire and characters getting smashed with cars--then walking around as if nothing happened. This investigation is full of odd turns and twists, but none of them were believable, nor were any of them truly funny. Ultimately, the film concludes with every character getting his/her comeuppance, so viewers interested in karma-kosher endings will approve.Is the movie a dark comedy? Is it a thriller/mystery? I'm still not sure, and I don't think the film-makers are either. There is extremely disturbing subject matter, but the characters in the film brush it off as meaningless. A good dark comedy takes that material and makes it funny to the audience, not the characters.A thriller/mystery makes you want to root for at least one character. By the end of the film, I was rooting for none. Which would be how I might feel if watching a dark comedy. But not a thriller.As far as acting goes, Anna Kendrick does a nice job, but plays the same character she played in all the pitch perfect movies. It got old about 20 min into the movie. The husband--he was forgettable. And Blake Lively--I can't say there was much of a script or character to play off of, but outside the very chic costumes she wears throughout the film, she is nothing to remember.Please Hollywood, come up with some thriller/dark comedy/mystery that doesn't involve upper middle class white housewives turning into sociopaths.

The dark humor works wonderfully and the lead actresses are great, especially Kendrick who seemed made for the role. It seems most people who didn't enjoy the film found either the humor out of place or the twists a bit too much. The film is meant to be over-the-top. The plot is a bit much, but I assume that is also true of the novel. It is a dark comedy foremost (though not overly morbid). If you enjoy that type of humor I would recommend this film.

Some people might say it's too complicated, but all you have to do to understand it is pay attention. I found the set and costume design to be extraordinary and the acting was perfect. Both Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively gave it their all and you can truly tell. The plot is a whole different story... It may be the best plot I've ever seen. It has so many pieces to it but the talented writers didn't forget a single thing, including minor details. Props to the writers who made each character distinct and fun to watch, along with creating a full, complete mystery, which is very difficult to do.

The tone was all over the place and at times it was just plain awkward to watch. This movie ended up being a drama trying to be funny and a comedy trying to be dramatic. Blake Lively was the most interesting part of the film with a good performance but an even better character that was reduced to nothing more than a bland villain when she could've been more. Anna Kendrick plays Anna Kendrick as usual with her awkward crappy acting.

303,hughrcarson,Rather more emphasis on style than substance,5,24 September 2018,"Stylistically very much of its time, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour is an easily palatable glossy thriller which it could be argued would be far better suited to a Netflix serialisation, than any sort of major cinematic release.And considering the vast popularity of the aforementioned streaming platform, that's in no way as damning an indictment as once it might have been.Anna Kendrick in particular is perfect for these sort of televisual films and roles. Wholesome, cutesy and borderline irritating in this instance, she portrays Stephanie Smothers, a young single mother whose path happens to cross that of the glamorous and rather ruthless, Emily. Their sons go to the same school, and through this everyday tenuous connection - and in spite of the girls' very disparate personalities - they strike up an unlikely friendship based largely around play dates and strong Martinis, and plenty of them.But when things suddenly take a rather mysterious turn, Stephanie is left holding the baby (almost literally), desperately scrambling around to make sense of an increasingly disturbing scenario. More disturbing than anything this well-meaning lifestyle-blogging mother could possibly have imagined, in fact.All 'made-for-TV' jibes-aside, A Simple Favour is actually, in it's own way, a perfectly watchable film, though one which one can feel reasonably assured will never spring anything too ghastly or distasteful upon its unsuspecting viewers.Though based upon nefarious dark deeds and wrong-doings, Feig's film is far more concerned with its sassy style and slick delivery than developing any sort of deep-seated menace or suspenseful atmosphere. And the entire thing plays out with just the sort of slightly superficial style and vacuous air that you'd probably associate with Sex In The City and the like.That said, given the film's deliberate stylistic approach it's hard to fault any of the performances, but it's left to Blake Lively - portraying the mysterious Emily - to produce the one performance of any particular weight or substance. This alone, however, is not enough to transform A Simple Favour from admittedly well devised Hollywood schtick into something altogether more memorable and affecting.Not a bad offering, and as mentioned before, perfectly watchable. But if ever there was a film to keep one eye on in the background without ever needing to get too emotionally invested in its content, then this is probably it.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",A Simple Favor

People who read these crappy books and can see past the drivel and imagine a brilliant finished project - bless them.I only went because I saw a clip on Stephen Colbert when Anna Kendrick was a guest. That short clip revealed the satire that was absolutely missing from the book. Anna is a gem; Blake was gorgeous. The production was just so well done; it was a pure pleasure to watch.

321,beauty_model,Felt like one long liquor promotion,1,27 December 2018,"Spoilers....
Pros:
It ends.Cons:
One of my biggest pet peeves is nonsensical casting.
A blake lively type mixed with a pretty Asian man does not equal a half asian half costa rican (meztizo) child.
The kid got all his chubby little costa rican Mom's looks.
Might be a cute actor, but was not right in this instance.
Plus checking out things, turns out his dad is trying to push him and his twin sister and is a classic stage dad.
Eww.The movie started off promising, I didn't read the book because I'm a busy person.I think black comedies are my favorite genre, but they're rare and hard to get right.
When this movie ended, it made me pin for a movie as good as Gus Vant Sant's 1995 ""To Die For.""Perhaps it was a white person casting and anyone mixed looks the same.
I'm multi racial and it really annoys me when nuances are ignored.
Onto the pink elephant in the room""
Blake Lively's character in the film, Emily, only drinks martinis made with Aviation American Gin, the company Reynolds became an owner of in February (18). Feig reveals he was trying to get permission to feature another liquor company, but went with the Deadpool 2's company after Blake suggested it to him. However, he was not aware Ryan owned the company.""I knew this going in and it felt live every other scene, that damn gin bottle was positioned in clear view.Me thinks Blake is just a slick character as Emily.I think Ryan should have stuck with his Ex. I can not dream of Scarlett begging Avengers' director to spotlight her husband product and not tell them what was going on.Anna Kendrick was forgettable in the role. She used to be so cute but now her head looks shruken and weird.All in all, a huge let down.I suggest the wonderful A Simple Plan instead.",A Simple Favor

Going in blind, I found myself very impressed with what I saw.A Simple Favor is the blackest of black comedies and it had me rolling in my seat the entire time. It's part film noir, part lurid 90's thriller (think Single White Female or The Hand That Rocks the Cradle), part Lifetime movie, and more than a part of all the recent ""Girl"" novels (Gone Girl, The Girl On the Train, etc.). Helping the witty script immeasurably are its two leads - Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively. Kendrick has never been more perfectly cast than here as an awkward, try-hard prude who desperately needs to come out of her shell. Blake Lively channels her inner Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct as the icy, femme fatale who'll seems to be a pathological liar who'll stop at nothing to get what she wants.

I couln't stop myself to make some comparisons during the movie. I was not expecting something as deep as Good girl, but,at one point, it looks cheap comparing what we have seen before. At the moment they found the dead girl in the lake , we already see the end comming : she fakes her death by killing her twin sister nobody knew , even her husband, she had and all that for financial reason . I cannot be sure if the plan to kill her twin sister came at the moment she realises her secret past could be discover or if it was all plan knowing she was going to meet her and kill her. Maybe the book is more specific on that point. When you realise you already know the end after 40 minutes into the movie and that you wait impatiently to see since the first trailer, you lose interest during the movie. But with all that said , what really makes the movie it's not the main story but more all the ""meat"" around it : The vlog of the main character, the french music , the attachment we devellop for Anna Kendrick's character. It compensates for the lack of imagination in the story.",A Simple Favor

She portrays a completely different character to that of her Gossip Girl days, and she done a great job of it. Im not a big fan of Kendrick, however, her acting was on point and I liked her role in this. I wasnt quite prepared for the whole dark comedy thing, so it took me a while to adjust because I believed itd be a serious tone throughout. Dont go into this expecting a full on thriller, it plays with your emotions and gets very silly at times.

Having seen the trailer I thought the movie had two moods which couldn't quite go together when you first look at it. However, the movie is actually a rather reasonable mixture of a crime thriller (who's playing who kind of movie) and a contemporary comedy. One should definitely give it a try.

Because it starts off as a good premise, is well acted and has some really good dialogue. But then as it approached the halfway point it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a whodunnit. It then gave up on both aims and become totally stupid and preposterous - leaving me wondering why I wasted two hours of my life watching it. Don't they have read-throughs / test screenings etc ?

Sad really, because the cast and rest of the soundtrack was fun as was the story with its twists and turns. Precisely because of these reasons I suspect it as an oversight that the rapper closing the movie (after a number of mostly groovy tunes) starts spouting gay slurs and refers to women as female dogs (not as sassy in French) being ""lesbian for effeminate guys"".

355,Blogger66,"Hit entertainment, realism, religion, and self-improvement with a stone!",10,22 September 2018,"I have a habit of listing my watchlist every weekend and tend to add upcoming or movies that release on the same weekend. It's rare of me to re-list my watchlist the movies that released a week before, and A Simple Favor is one of them for three reasons:1) Positive reviews
2) I loved Gone Girl book and enjoyed the movie
3) AMC Stub Pass (Unfortunately, it's quite a wrong time to purchase the pass when movies are slow in September)Character development lagged in the beginning. It was troublesome enough to question myself if I need to take one more pill for my ADD or to double-check with Captiview closed-captioning device. But, I've already replaced the device twice due to a weaken stick and programming errors. It was still an issue with AMC's third device. It was too loose, and the closed captioning digital was in a circular motion and changed angles. It took me a while to get this set with a slat angle. Besides the character development, the power of weirdness, in the beginning, was instantly captivating to forget the disadvantage of my disability and prayed for the captions to follow the movie accordingly.Anna Kendrick's undoubtedly aced her role as Stephanie Smothers. She should deserve an honorable mention around the Hollywood world, despite her performances in the past. The chance of Simple Favor being flopped was high if it wasn't for her. This movie labeled as a dark comedy based solely on her. It's hard for me to find words explaining how she apparently tried to be a saint without being funny. Her performance in Simple Favor reminds me of Nick Foles who was a regular second-string quarterback in football but carried the Philadelphia Eagles and won the Super Bowl MVP.It's absolutely an entertained movie. The adventure of unexpected events and the weirdness of choices that characters made, such as Stephanie fu*ked her brother and her best friend (Emily)'s husband right after she thought that Emily died, and the lies and secrets, were beyond captivated.I got the feeling that the moral of the story was overlooked by the craziness and unrealistic of the movie. However, this was to break down the story by using a microscope through my lens. 1) ""Loneliness is worse than dying with cancer.""--I can't speak for them because I don't know what's like to have cancer, but I can look what it meant. It's hard to find a purpose in life when you're lonely. You don't know why you should be here. Mentally and emotionally are killing you slowly. It may lead you to make different choices for the sake of surviving. That led Stephanie to her decisions by having sex with her brother and best friend's husband. She's in her survival mode at these points. 2) Traumatized--Emily Nelson burned her family's house to save herself from the ugliness. Once you're traumatized, it's not easy to build a relationship and may lead to dysfunctional relationships. Addiction is also a side effect. 3) Three theological virtues (Faith, Hope, & Charity)-- It's a reference to a group of Christian martyred saints. Charity was the first triplet sisters who died. It referred to if one's love dies away. Then, you have two purposes left-hope and faith-to live on. You lose hope after you fail to seek happiness. Faith is the power of doing NOW to gain the sense perceptions of yourself as a person. 4) Hope vs. Faith (Twin sisters)-Both left in a different path after they burned down the house. Hope lived in expectations, whereas Faith lived in the present. (Also referred to the Bible) That's why Hope didn't show up to meet Faith after many years. Hope drugged herself. She spent her time dreaming about the future until it was too late. Faith was doing NOW and got a high salary job in a toxic environment. Without hope and love, the concept of faith is manipulative. 5) Stephanie wore her saint necklace, but she didn't wear it when she put on Emily's black dress. It represented that no one is actually a saint. 6) Money, sex, and social media-deprived the ideal of hope, faith, and charity. 7) Stephanie used social media to cover up her loneliness, but it disconnected her ability to live in realism. Then later, it became an addiction, and her presence in realism was on a downhill. 8) Lies and secrets lost loves. 9) Everyone has an intention of doing or returning a favor beyond the simple act of kindness for approval or support benefits. 10) Religion doesn't make you perfect. Overall, the moral of a story is that everyone has secrets and no one is perfect. The side effects are much more significant than to accept imperfection.",A Simple Favor

I just wish they hadn't added the R-rated sexual topics because they really didn't add to it and just made an otherwise interesting movie really awkward.,A Simple Favor

Anyway, I did not feel like I wasted my time watching it, and I actually found myself chuckling at quite a few parts. Good quirky acting, good direction. And I loved the French soundtrack too.",A Simple Favor
373,philgowers001,[sigh...],1,25 April 2020,"Before experiencing this messy waste of time, i never saw Blake Lively act in a film or tv show. After seeing this film, i can confirm i still haven't seen her act. Is this her range? Really? Because she is utterly useless and should stick to being the mother of RRs children. Her one-dimensional interpretation of her character(s) was laughable and worth the effort to demand my money back.But then we should also consider the inability of Paul Feig to make movies. Was this supposed to be a comedy? No. A black comedy? Absolutely not? A mediocre drama with tacked-on comic elements? Possibly, except the comic elements were dialed-in by cliched, bored actors looking for something do between their shift work at Starbucks and the next slice of Hollywood action. Feig obviously didn't know how to handle the script, which was slightly borrowed from Gone Girl (a far superior movie, expertly crafted by a Director who knows his stuff). Feig can't deliver a black comedy, but only a poorly directed predictable drama piece with the occasional fling of bad language by Lively (getting her acting lessons from her more successful husband), and from the children. Wow... kids swearing! Wow, lesbian undertones.... Wow, I'm bored.Anna Kendrick plays Anna Kendrick, and it's hard to blame her for that but it does prove her range is limited. Anna has found her niche in Hollywood, and while it means she will never win an acting award (so she's in good company with the cast/crew in this car crash of a film), it does mean she'll be able to keep doing her thing until Hollywood decides her cuteness no longer appeals. Give it 3 more years.Overall, this is an awful film. Feig is talentless, Lively is boring and Kendrick is Kendrick. Yawn... skip this, you won't regret it.",A Simple Favor

My fiance and I watched this film late at night and I woke up with the idea that we had watched ""an evil twin"" movie! I am NOT a movie sophisticate but even I recognize certain tropes. We discussed it and he felt the movie was a feature film length soap opera. I believe he nailed it. From Emily's disappearance on, the movie becomes a soap opera.It was not bad to watch at home, on iTunes, for a fairly cheap rate. I would have felt worse if we spent the money to see it in the theatres. Blake Lively's character (Emily) was super stylish and immaculately turned out. There were some entertaining scenes.

It's a crime drama but it's also a mom story with characters you can identify with. There's always something just under the surface that you just can't pin down, but what's hidden is pleasingly revealed by masterful story craft.
This framework allows, really requires, that the characters develop both through revealing their pasts and by changing as the story progresses. None of the major characters are simple. Even the secondary characters are a bit complicated. Kudos to Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively who brilliantly portray vulnerability, strength and cunning often and unexpectedly exactly when needed. The entire cast is a delight to watch. 
This movie demands your attention but rewards it in the detail that leads to complex twists. Despite the dark story arc there's a lot of sly and clever humor that comes from both nerdy awkwardness and wicked darkness. This is a movie well worth watching.",A Simple Favor

386,dwarol,A Simple Misfire,5,5 February 2021,"This movie never pulls off being both a comedy and a thriller at the same time. It starts with the casting of Anna Kendrick. I get that Ms. Kendrick doesn't want to be stuck playing nice girl parts but this movie does not help her. She never quite pulls off what the role requires of her (though probably it's because her character is just as psycho in her own way as Blake Lively's). Ms. Lively starts out awkwardly but during the movie becomes more comfortable with her role. She can really pull off crazy and vindictive.A lot of it has to do with the script. Murder in the suburbs does seem so incongruous that it could be the setting for a comedy, but what we get is two different movies that are mashed together. We can't develop sympathy for either Ms. Kendrick's Stephanie or Mr. Golding's Sean because the script requires them to switch rapidly between innocent and guilty to further the murder mystery plot along. The tone was so uneven that at one point I actually had sympathy for Ms. Lively's Emily. There are way too many attempts at clever plot twists, and after awhile you stop caring.Otherwise the movie is pretty pedestrian. There's nothing special about the direction or the production. The supporting cast does their jobs, especially Bashir Salahuddin as the detective.",A Simple Favor

It starts as a thriller-crime-drama with a hint of comedy relief, and it works splendid as such.But then at the climax, the movie loses its identity. It seems like Paul Feig lacks the courage to stay on track an go for the fail safe, and it turned into movies such as 'Spy', 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Heat' all good movies, but this movie had another premise.Anna Kendrick shows she's a master actress, she has all the skills, Blake Lively was good as well, loved how her 'language' as a contrast to her beautiful style/look.And then by the ending Paul Feig had to throw in some unnecessary twists, this could have been a 8/10 movie, gets a 6/10 verdict.",A Simple Favor

However then it was ruined so I gave it a boring 7. This is where it was ruined, when they brought in the twin, and here's why. In the end they had a plan she would confess and shoot her husband ok maybe they didn't foresee that but they sure should have. And as Harry said in Dumb and Dumber ""What if he shot me in the head?"" A risk Sean the husband was willing to take? I don't think so.They should have had Blake want to leave that life and make sure her husband and son had Kendrick to fall on, then go find a stray that looked like her, have her tattooed and then kill her and after that pay a visit to the coroner and have him sign off that its her and then she would have gone back and have her husband give her 1 million and then just gone away.

It was goofy, funny, slightly suspenseful mystery. It was pretty easy to figure out, and the plot twists were pretty obvious, that didn't make it any less entertaining. I would watch it again, as I'm sure I missed something, and the mostly dry humor, was just the right touch, without feeling overly forced. Many will be thrown by the several twists, I missed the final ending by a technicality, but was close enough for horseshoes.

At the same time, the characters are each unlikable in major ways. So by the end, I was very curious to see how it would turn out, yet I wasn't invested in the outcome for any particular character.

sean is total jeak. he is so fake to say those sweet things to emily. make emily to give more and provide free service to sean as nanny, house maid and sex.
sean haven't told police emily not dead, and unhappy about emily disclose to insurance company the truth. imply sean also want to share that US$4million.
that's y sean and emily are mean to be together.
stephanie is kind heart and truely care the kid. after stephanie know sean mainly use her for sex, still willing take care nicky.
but i have some question marks about stephanie,
1. seems at first time stephanie met emily, stephanie is attracted to emily. emily's style, trendy and higher social class, these make stephanie want to get close to her.
that's y stephanie is so nice to emily and just say yes to emily and after emily gone missing, stephanie is so eager to do so many things to search and even take risk to find out where is emily.
i a bit suspect stephanie is bi-sexual, the attraction toward emily is not only friendship, also imply some lesbian love emotion. the kiss scene between emily and stehanie seems kind of implication.
2. stephanie admire sean already, as she read the book he wrote and so appreciate. just a bit suspect, after they think emily already die, stephanie did so much things for sean and look like a bit over.

Now I like dramedy's however this was not one. The film started out being a drama with a few lighthearted lines but then near the end it turned itself into a comedy. I didn't understand the sudden switch. The acting was good and the storyline was good as well but the writers needed to decide which type of film it was going to be and then stick with it.

My wife and I picked it over all the other movies out right now bc we are fans of Anna Kendrick and I was curious to see her portray a mother. First off she was brilliant. Great acting and her comedic timing and ability to also do drama, exceeded my expectations. Blake Lively was great too. The chemistry between the leading women was great! The movie had a unique ability to have me laughing out loud one moment and then sitting on the edge of my seat the next! Storyline was incredible. Overall my favorite movie of the year.

442,donbear09,One of the suprises of 2018,7,14 December 2018,This movie was surprisingly better than it looked. I had my doubts from the trailer that it would like a lame lifetime movie but this movie had some surprising layers to it. What you think you know in the beginning is thrown out by the end. Blake Lively plays the villian well in her first real villainess role. Anna Kendricks character starts off a little annoying at first but by the end her character is not what she seems on the surface and has more layers. I won't tell you about all the twists but I'll say that this movie is very curvy like a roller coaster. The only negative thing I can think of is that the ending kinda fell apart at the end but not really detrimental to ruin the experience of the movie. It felt like they didn't have the ending planned all out so they went with what they did. It don't ruin the movie so you should still come out satisfied at the end. Go into this movie not expecting much but come out surprised at the end how much better it was than it looked on paper.,A Simple Favor

446,conn-57441,A stylish mystery that lacks stakes!,7,18 September 2018,"'A simple favor' is a complete 180 degree turn from director Paul Feig who usually turns his mind to comedy films, so this film had interested me as like it's trailer had said 'was made by the darker side of Mr. Feig', and it didn't disappoint entirely. The film stars Anna Kendrick in her usual ditzy role but in a different situation than a character like hers would of be involved in in previous movies which was a nice change of pace, and Blake Lively giving off a great performance that really gave me Rosmund Pike's 'Gone girl' vibes. However 'Gone girl' this is not. The main problem this film faced was that it lacked tension and suspense usually found in mystery films like this until perhaps the final act, and given the trailer seems to give off the impression this is a high stakes mystery thriller didn't particularly help this fact. I would of also liked this film to maybe be a tad darker in tone as well, as at times it seemed to be an odd mash of comedy at moments that didn't perhaps need it. Like I said in the title though this film is stylish, with a classic French score covering practically the whole film and the clever use of flashbacks did make this film stand out that little bit more. Overall I did enjoy this film but it wasn't quite the 180 that I had hoped from Mr. Feig.",A Simple Favor
447,rahulthomas-07708,Boring.,1,1 October 2018,Terrible movie. The pacing was off. No tension in the scenes that mattered. The twists have been done before and better. And the comedy fell flat. I feel the movie was trying to be unique and ended up being boring.,A Simple Favor

Some of the outcomes within this movie were predictable for me, but when they did happen, I wasn't irritated, I had a sense of being satisfied, like ha! I knew it. The acting from Anna and Blake was to a high standard and Blake Lively, was very alluring within this movie, and even as a gay man I was turned on.. I know, even me! (haha jks). Anna's character was smart within the movie, but couldn't resist Sean's charm.. after the ""loss"" of his wife. (I didn't want her to cave in, but tbh, A grieving husband, the picture perfect life and the smart/attractive husband who ticks all the boxes for most of society, is too hard to resist). Too bad (for her) that the fairy-tale ended way too soon.. I didn't know what to expect from the ending of this movie, but I found the ending was actually not what I expected it to be, everything happened so fast at the end, but tbh, I liked that!

Unfortunately, at a certain point the plot gets completely turned upside down and by the end of it, the movie that for the first hour was a different thing turns into a ""dark"" comedy.
In my opinion they completely ruined the vibe of the movie, making it seem like one thing throughout most of it, and then turning the last few minutes (the end, which is the most important part) into a big joke.
If it was going to be a comedy it should've started that way, or at least should have given some hints in that direction. The ending made no sense, and actually ruined the whole thing for me, the movie overall just wasn't cohesive.",A Simple Favor

It was much more than that, from the awesome upbeat, French music interspersed, to the sheek style and drama that makes a perfect suspense.The character and personalities were varied, bringing realism full tilt and all the acting superb, including the children. I was amazed in a few parts at the humor and creativity that contributed to the flow and plot in a big way. Clearly, the producing and directing did not cut out the best parts and was top notch.All I all, I don't want to give anything away in a suspense but it was well worth the price of a movie ticket even though the theatre had very few, found the several hours well spent and entertaining.

That being said, I saw the trailer and thought it might be interesting. Unfortunately it wasn't. Weak storyline, predictable ""plottwists"", and horrible acting. The lead actor was good for the house mother parts, but the ""surprisingly sexy, naughty and powerful""- change of character completely fell to the ground, and seemed like the actor simply couldn't pull of this side of her character. Too much cuteness in that annoying TV series way.Overall I think the movie was generally too generic and ""chick-flick""-cute, to make it interesting to watch, and I would have turned it of after an hour probably, if I hadn't paid to watch.",A Simple Favor
471,collmarsch,Gone Girl style plot with the right amount of comedy blended in!,9,16 September 2018,"I came into this movie not knowing what to expect. My Girlfriend picked it and I just knew going in the base concept. If you've seen thrillers such as Gone Girl you get the general gist of this movie. While the base plot is pretty simple to understand, the aspect that I was not ready for was the overall comedy that would happen in this movie. Between Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively there are more than enough laughs to go around. Anna Kendrick is her usually perk style self and that is always appealing. While not seeing Lively in many things prior, I really enjoyed her character. The thing I loved the most about the movie was when both of the lead actresses shared screen time together. The chemistry on screen was stunning. The movie from time to time felt a bit weird in the pacing department because it would go from funny to serious in a drop but it kept you on the edge of your seat. Overall the movie was great. The plot maintained it's twists and turns as you would expect a suspense/thriller to do and it delivered on many quips and laughs that didn't feel overused. The movie is now in my top three of movies seen in theaters this year bumping Hotel Transylvania 3 out of the top 3. I highly recommend seeing this movie any way you can. It is a great movie to see if you want a good story with more than your fair share of laughs. TL;DR - Gone Girl style story with the perfect amount of comedy blended in. Highly recommend seeing this movie any way you can. Kendrick and Lively are both stellar here and their characters mesh perfectly while they share the screen space.",A Simple Favor

480,oggybleacher,Mostly entertaining,6,21 August 2020,"Blake's insouciance was a perfect compliment to Kendrick's supermom role, but the children themselves limit this story not only by being bratty ""normal"" spoiled whiny brats that should annoy anyone, but because they would obviously be integral to the characters and they are basically accessories who dilute an otherwise sexy and scandalous story. The children are mouthy, misbehaved gimmicks and that doesn't work for me. Was the movie meant to be a diversion fantasy for domestic zombies or a domestic satire? I don't know. They had all the elements of a great movie but got off track in the plot department.Maybe I got an immediate Wild Things (1998) vibe that steered me in the wrong direction because everything I sensed about the plot and the characters was pointing toward an ultimate alliance between Stephanie and Emily in their domestic limbo, or at least a twisted reversal of roles as darker and more dark backstories are revealed. Basically, you can't have two covetous women become enemies without very good reason because it spoils the dynamic. Someone has to win and this movie has no winners.The Denoument is so convoluted that I'm not sure there were any losers either. Did Emily get what she deserved? Not really. Did Stephanie get what she deserved? Not really. Did Sean get what he deserved? I'm not sure. The fate of the characters is offset from their actions to the point that I don't actually know what were lies or the truth, so I don't know if anyone got their comeuppance. It's a sordid tale with lots of losing and some baffling choices for the sake of complication.So, the candid performance by Kendrick, and the vulgar 'modern' woman as personified by Lively is enough to give this film a watch, (their personalities sparkle), but in the realm of cathartic dramatic experiences, this is a failure.",A Simple Favor

I do have to say I am glad the movie didn't go in to so much detail of Stefanie and her brother's relationship. I had a hard time getting through those parts in the book.The books plot was so much better and Emily's plan was so much better in the book. The end of the movie was strange.

It's a good blend of mystery that kept me interested to see what would happen, with some funny lines thrown in there too. There was also a lot of ""fashion and female friendship"" elements to it which, as a guy, doesn't sound all that exciting to me on paper but it worked in the movie.Apparently some people didn't like the mix of comedy and crime/drama, but I thought the director and actors pulled it off fairly well. There were just a couple of times when I thought they tried too hard to make it funny when a particular scene probably should've been more serious, but for the most part the balance is right.There are some intense and dramatic scenes with no comedy or lightness at all to them, so it's not all fun and games.Blake Lively is very good in this. Some say she plays the same type of character in everything she does, but I wouldn't know. If you only saw her in this movie and knew nothing of her previous work, like me, then it's just a great performance.It does go off the rails a bit in the last 30 minutes or so.

505,Your-Mum-13579,The best thing about this movie is the trailer,2,21 September 2018,"Whoever cut the trailer for A Simple Favour deserves an Oscar as they have skilfully polished a steaming mess to an undeserved golden sheen.Almost as soon as the mystery gets underway you know exactly where this movie is headed. The story - and I suspect the novel on which it is based - lacks any originality whatsoever. You've seen this film done better several times before. In fact, if you've seen Gone Girl, you've seen A Simple Favour.This movie most closely resembles a mix of the childish humour of Porkies with an attempt at gripping mystery a la Gone Girl.The characters hide behind clunky vulgarity (particularly Lively's Emily Nelson) best exemplified by a gigantic nude painting which is used to push the plot along at one point. Occasionally we are introduced to a character who threatens to liven proceedings (Rupert Friend and Jean Smart stand out in their ""zany"" bit parts) but are quickly dispensed with, adding nothing to the overall story at all.Instead we're left to focus on the obnoxious - and genuinely unlikeable - leads who plod through the story as if it is a join-the-dots Columbo mystery. Which is exactly what it is - just with more swearing, drinking and ""shocking"" (needless in the case of Kendrick's character) backstories.The twists in this movie are heavily signposted - particularly as the trailer already told us about the major plot pivot in advance. The mystery takes too long to solve, the main characters are grating, and the ongoing vulgarity suggest Feig lacks the maturity to make a proper thriller - which is why the distributors are pushing the 'from the director of Bridesmaids' tagline so hard.By all means enjoy the trailer - it's an excellent piece of film making. Just skip the main attraction. The best thing about this movie is the trailer.",A Simple Favor

In the beginning Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) seams to just be your average stay at home mom with to much time on her hands but the more we get inte to the movie we get to see that she has a lot of layers (some disturbing) and that character has an interesting storyline. Anna Kendrick does a great job of portraying the complexity of Stephanie.
Emily (Blake Lively) is the kind of character that you instantaneously know is complex. From the start your are intrigued and want to find out more about her. Blake Lively as always is fabulous at portraying this kind of complex character.

It doesn't give you informations one after another to the very ending, but somehow manages to give you everything you need to know for the next scene or won't leave you hanging for too long after a mystery scene.
Has many surprises and twists that you won't be able to take it all in! Maybe cause facts are dark but it'll be shown to you as a simple doing.
Casting was fine. Anna Kendrick's roll was annoying and weird (that she's expert in) at the beginning, On the other hand you'll be perfectly able to witness her trying to improve and become a confident, cool mom who solve mysteries (that Anna couldn't really pull it off).

527,thats_just_like_your_opinion_man,Lots of Intrigue. Odd and Interesting Payoff...,6,29 September 2018,"It's so refreshing nowadays to watch a trailer for a film and have no idea what it's about, that was my experience with 'A Simple Favour'. I became quite excited to see this film after the trailer and didn't want to know anything going in. As I was walking out of the cinema, I didn't really know what to think.Paul Feig, who is directing outside of his comedy wheelhouse, does a decent job here with the direction. The performances are great. Blake Lively gives the best performance I've probably seen from her as the mysterious Emily, and Anna Kendrick is good as well as the cutesy, conservative Stephanie. The costume design is good and the French soundtrack gives the film a interesting aesthetic. However, the film falls slightly flat for me when it comes to the script. The film chooses to focus a fair amount of screen time on a certain subplot relating to the past of Anna Kendrick's character that doesn't really go anywhere or have an impact on the story. Without spoiling anything, I felt that Stephanie's character arc suffers as a result of this 'thing'.Towards the end of the film, you begin to realise that there aren't really any likeable characters and you don't especially know who to get behind. The plot meanders in a few places and as it unfolded it reminded me of a fair few movies I had seen before, such as 'Wild Things' and Hitchcock's 'Rebecca'.All that being the case, 'A Simple Favour' can be enjoyable and you will most likely be entertained for its runtime.

Some reviewers have said that this film is a parody of Gone Girl and the like but it's absolutely not. It's a light-hearted thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. Anna Kendrick is excellent as Stephanie Smothers, a bubbly and over enthusiastic recently widowed single mother, that spends her spare time running a cookery vlog. She has no actual friends until she befriends brash PR executive Emily played by Blake Lively, whose son attends the same school as her son.

I'll probably go back and watch it again, although now that I know what happens, the plot twists won't have the same effect, so we'll see how it holds up when that's no longer a factor. Yes, it kind of dragged a bit in the third quarter compared to the rest of the movie, but I thought both Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively did great jobs in their roles, and the fact it wasn't clearly in any one particular genre was, I thought, a plus.

573,drewpkerr,A Simple Mistake,1,16 September 2018,"A not-so-simple story was given quite the simple execution. What set out to be a promising thriller in the vain of Gone Girl, was decimated seconds after the rolling of the opening credits. You'd be forgiven for thinking that you were about to embark on an adventure down Wisteria lane, with an opening sequence a nod to a simpler time of the 70's in a contemporary setting; however scoot past that and there's no reference to this tone throughout the whole film (unless you count a cute Dior waisted frock Lively wears in the final scenes.) An added comic tone to the film does little to distract from the poor choice of casting with no notable performances. Kendrick's sweet nature does partially lend herself to the role of a widowed single mother, however I can't help but feel a more serious tone would have actually delivered a better comic relief. Lively's lunacy is melodramatic and doesn't pair back well with the rest of the cast - it would have been much more appropriate in Gossip Girl. Paul Feig's directorial choices seem odd given the genre. Inconsistent would best describe his choice of camera direction. Angular shots throughout, and rapid fire screen cuts in the penultimate scene were a distraction from the action occurring on screen. A use of long panning shots and slower cuts between shots would have given the film the suspense it deserves. The only redeeming feature of the film was an interesting plot, but it's a shame that ultimately we were left with a huge simple mistake making it to the screen.",A Simple Favor

Each character is well used with no loose ends left to their purpose like your favorite Dickinson novel. The comedy was delivered sharply with a savage one liner or witty quip accompanying almost every role.The conclusion isn't spoon fed mediocrity like many in the reviews are wanting but rather a triple turn around summersault nose dive crescendo. It's well worth the setting up the of the rest of the film even though it's not the strongest part, but that's credit to the expectation the rest of the movie sets.I may be hyping this movie up but it's a fantastic watch especially if you're into mysteries.

Both ladies give out solid performances, managing to be clever, funny, credible and sexy all at the same time. Without giving anything away, the story drags on a bit about midway through the feature, when the interaction between the ladies is no longer as sustained as it had been up till then, but the action picks up nicely not long after.The music and costumes have been picked carefully and contribute to the overall mood of the film.Overall, a very pleasant surprise.",A Simple Favor

The pacing was all off and was very rushed in some parts, the story not holding together well.
It's trying to be Gone Girl but failed miserably.
The plot was too convoluted and there was no real build up in the story or the characters, and the clues were sprinkled to give hints at the twists but they could be seen a mile away.It was just an awful hot mess.
I think it started off well but quickly derailed.None of the characters are likeable or relatable. You think Stephanie is and then boom, in a matter of days she suddenly becomes this whole other person just for the sake of the plot.
There was no real character growth and it didn't feel natural at all.This whole story might have worked well in a book (I haven't read it so can't attest to it), as the pacing is different, but for a movie, it was just horrible.",A Simple Favor

This is a movie that has the most impact the first time that you see it because after you find out what the plot twists are, you just can't see it the same way again.It's dark, satirically comedic, fun and dramatic all at once.
It's not for the easily offended or the faint-of-heart, and it's decidedly not a chic flick.There are some very obvious parallels between its plot and the plot of Gone Girl, but of the two flicks I felt much more satisfied with A Simple Favor.As for everyone who claims that it is too far fetched, they clearly either didn't see or didn't understand the last 5 minutes of the movie when a poke is made at that exact anticipated reaction from some viewers - and pulled off quite wittily.The writing/script also is applaudable especially when Stephanie (Anna Kendrick) and each of the two children are having dialogue.",A Simple Favor

I kept guessing this or that and didn't care if I was right or wrong bc I was having such a good time watching the movies. Then about half way through the movie there is a small reveal and ever since we see that scene the movie goes downhill fast.

And trust me, it's a really good story!To be honest, there was the odd moment where I did slightly cringe - or laugh out of total awkwardness - but those same moments do turn out to be quite humourous. And the humour (don't worry, there isn't too much!) adds a nice element, and yet the film still comes across as serious and thrilling.I adore Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick in this film, and I don't think I can imagine anyone else who could play their roles as well as they both did.I'm looking forward to watching this again in the future - and to anyone who reads this review, I would definitely recommend that you give this film a shot!",A Simple Favor

It genuinely feels as if Fieg wasnt sure if he was directing a comedy or a thriller. Anna kendricks character starts off as someone timid and sort of annoying and then becomes your typical strong central female character all in the blink of an eye. As hard as this is to swallow, the most difficult thing to understand is why? Why is she motivated to do anything? She goes to extreme lengths for no identifiable reason other then to force the story foward. There are other examples of story telling tools that feel forced, such as Kendricks vlog throughout the film. There is so much more that makes no sense, but id rather avoid spoilers. Lumbering. Awkward. Wierd. Irrational. Cringe worthy. At times boring. The only positive point is Blake livelys performance isnt bad. She does a decent job of being unlikeable.Just not worth your time really.

Anna Kendrick was in her element, something dramatic but edgy and almost too perfect to be taken seriously. She's got the nack for comedic/mystery.

644,castlequeenthrone,The longest subaru crosstrek commercial I've ever seen,6,15 September 2019,"This Subaru commercial had some potential and blew it. The pace is slow at first but then it builds and becomes entertaining and suspenseful in the first hour. Let's just get the obvious Henry Golding playing a role similar to crazy rich asians as the rich bachelor with a twist. This time he is not really a rich bachelor, it's more a façade because he and his wife are apparently struggling financially. Apart from an unlikely set of events when Stephanie's father kills himself and her new boyfriend in a rage, I guess it's possible but are they serious? The movie kept me interested and was almost original until the end where it completely fell apart. We have an improbable set of events leading to a scene where the main antagonist is miraculously hit by a car at the perfect time as she is about to shoot Stephanie Smothers ""Americas hybrids, silent but deadly"". To sum up the movie is full of a bunch of cursing and clichés. It misses the mark and it worth watching for a while before the writer's block ending ruined it. It gets a D+",A Simple Favor

665,ashley-nagy,A Mystery-Comedy Executed Almost Perfectly,7,14 September 2018,"Upon the release of this trailer, I must say I was very intrigued. Was this movie a mystery? Comedy? Thriller? Romance??? - I could not figure it out. Well whatever it was, I knew I wanted to see it. Of course, it helped that it had Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively in it as well. 
While both actresses play roles they are typically type-cast for, Anna Kendrick as the typical goofy charmer and Blake Lively as the mysterious beautiful best friend, the first thing I noticed in this movie is the amazing chemistry these two have on-screen. Kendrick & Lively, although not stepping outside of the box too much, were incredible onscreen together. The entire first half of the movie is filled with laughable banter back and forth between the two of them. 
Anna plays Stephanie, who is a mommy blogger and an over-enthusiastic PTA mom who tries to be perfect in all that she does. She comes complete with eye rolls from the other moms for being so put together and sweet. Blake on the other hand plays the martini-guzzling, f-bomb dropping mom. The two pair up for an unlikely friendship, when Stephanie starts to notice that things just aren't quite adding up in her new BFF's life. 
Henry Golding (""Crazy Rich Asians"") stars in his second big screen role, and does quite well with it in my opinion. He's well equipped to play the dashingly handsome charmer - and that's exactly his role here. Nothing stellar, but eye-candy on the screen is never a bad idea. This film simply would not work without the one-two punchlines that Kendrick and Lively play back and forth. They both really step into their roles, which really do play a lot on their real life personas. 
The director Paul Feig (best known for Bridesmaids) really executed the film well in my opinion. Throughout the entire movie, I got major Hitchcockian vibes. 
Most directors dream of this type of genre, but unfortunately most end up disappointing. It was clear what Feig was leaning towards, however he falls a little short in pulling it off. The film has its moments, but it gets a little messy towards the end. There are a lot of twist and turns in the movie, enough to keep you on your seat believe me. Some were very predicable, and some will throw you for a loop. Yet, I found that towards the end the plot-twists move rather hastily and it ends up unraveling quickly - almost too quick to take any of it seriously.
If you were hoping for another ""Gone Girl"" or ""The Girl on the Train"" then I am sorry to tell you - this is not it. This was more of a ""whodunit"" except you don't really care who is to blame, you just want to get to the bottom of it. Pulling off a mystery is hard, but mystery-comedy is almost unheard of. Feig is best known for his comedic films, and to no surprise those were the highlight of this film as well. 
""A Simple Favor"" keeps it light with a nod to parody mommy vloggers, and funny one-liners throughout. Overall, I got my dose of mystery, thriller, and comedy all in 1 hour & 57 minutes. So go ahead and head to the theatres, grab a martini and do yourself a favor in seeing this film.",A Simple Favor

675,escapeeshana,"Smooth Plot, Great Characters, Clumsy Ending",8,24 January 2019,"This bright, pastel-themed mystery/comedy movie features fantastic acting from all of the main cast, coupled with a solid script and, for the most part, a compelling plot.Wonderful, cheery visuals accompany a surprisingly saccharine main character, given the dark mystery that evolves as the movie continues. The script blends two juxtaposing genres with ease, and altogether it creates a gripping story.The lead actresses are really what give this movie its kick, bringing brilliant subtleties to their performances that tie the complicated plot lines together. If you enjoy films featuring strong, complex women (and how could you not?) then this is certainly one you'd like. The characters are original, multi-faceted and refreshingly visualised.The only disappointment was the ending which - without spoiling it - feels a little rushed. The script remains smooth and the acting is consistently fantastic but the final cut seems to be trying hard to fit the movie into a <2hr time slot. The story is wrapped up nicely, but it concedes some lazily-written plot devices and hashes together a montage of confusing shots.In the clumsy mess that the end sequence creates, the final scene tries to resolve the plot for good with a series of twists that are intended to keep the audience guessing. Whether or not it achieves its goal is an opinion that I'm sure differs between viewers, but it certainly felt a little hurried (at the very least).Altogether, I was impressed with this film and felt that it was a well-spent 2 hours of my life.",A Simple Favor

Didnt like the incest either, it served no purpose other than a poor excuse for her husband to commit suicide. Like really? ur wife fs her brother so u off urself and him. No character development and too many holes in the plot. Also for some reason i found myself rooting for emily (the villan). The main character stephanie was kind of annoying. At least emily had a goal and plan. Stephanie came off as weird, lonely over the top friend with nothing else to do. Whos the real sociopath here i mean shes calling someone she knew in a matter of weeks her bestfriend watches her kid fs her husband and moves in with him anddddd investigates her whole life. Plus she loved seans book so kind of a groupie. Their relationship had very few development. Shes just too weird to be that judgy i dont see her as any more mentally stable than Emily. And The about the woman from the college who was getting close with sean? What was the point of that?..it went no where. Also it was kind of chauvinistic.

However Emily is a much more relaxed and badass woman, she has a lot of money and lives in a big modern house in New York. Emily takes Stephanie back to her home and they quickly become friends, or at least thats what Stephanie thinks. throughout the film there are a lot of unexpected plot twists.

Not only does it lack a coherent plot, but the acting was almost insufferable. The only reason I finished the movie was that I kept hoping it would get better, only to continuously have my dream crushed before my eyes. Watch this movie if you enjoy: major inconsistencies/continuity errors, shallow writing and obvious plot point cop outs, and one of the worst endings I've ever had to suffer through. It's almost like the writers set out to make a completely unbelievable and irrelevant story, and they succeeded. It missed the mark on being a fun/silly movie, and didn't commit hard enough to be taken seriously. It falls somewhere between trash and feces, leaning towards an on-fire dumpster.",A Simple Favor

Kendrick and Lively make up two amazing lead actresses with great performances and good chemistry (or the intended lack of it). The story is a bit confusing at times and gets kinda dark, never really made me hold my breath, but okay. Overall masters the balance of comedy and thriller quite well though......until the ending! Just do yourself a simple favor and don't watch the full ending. I am amazed how you can mess up a movie that badly in the last 10 minutes. At first it was just a little far-fetched, but still kinda true to character and then suddenly I felt like I was watching Mean Girls - what the **** was that?!?!If you stop watching 1h:49m:30s the latest though, you get a well-acted, well-paced and interesting movie, which is a slightly odd, but enjoyable mix of thriller and comedy.",A Simple Favor

For a movie that I can solve in the first 45 min is not a great movie.

725,camp-14616,A romp of a noir,9,8 September 2020,"Weird reading the reviews for this movie. Many suspiciously low ratings. Many suspiciously short ratings (positive and negative). So, without giving anything important away, here's a review that's a bit longer (and, I trust, a bit more honest than some others):I loved this movie. Comedy noirs are few and far between, but when they hit the right notes, they are among my most favourite movies. A Simple Favour does that 90% of the time. Hence, my rating.I particularly enjoyed the clever and hilarious performances by Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie), a well-meaning everymom with a cheesy everymom YouTube channel (and a few secrets) and Blake Lively (as Emily) , a relentlessly sexy power-exec mom with a fabulous house and a fabulous husband, nevertheless living on the edge (also with secrets of her own).The plot is prototypical noir in that at the heart of the genre is one or another sort of (dastardly) betrayal. The twists and turns in A Simple Favour may reach across the border of absurdity, but by the time that happened, I was already so caught up in the dark comedy that I relinquished my disbelief happily.Noir at its best, even comedy noir, makes sly social commentary, and while that is not the point or purpose of this movie, it is there. Individually, we keep secrets and because secrets are kept FROM people, they become social, as well. If the web gets too tangled, tragedy ensues. But it's the job of comedy noir to turn that darkness into laughter and, given the Covid world were living in as I write this, it's nice to have a good laugh in the midst of darkness.",A Simple Favor
726,derpyduck-54324,A funny movie with a unexpected plots twists,9,24 October 2020,"I'm a person who would try to guess the plot and most of the time I would guess it right. I don't like predictable plots. I also often notice mistakes or 'unrealistic' scenes in a movie. However, I really liked this movie because it has several plot twists. Below are several reasons why I gave this movie 9 stars.1. The acting in this movie is great (of course it's because Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively and Henry Golding are in this movie).
2. The jokes in the movie were pretty funny. Small jokes keep reappearing in the movie.
3. The characters aren't perfect. Every main character has a flaw. One is a murderer, one is a cheater and the other one sleeps with her brother and a husband.
4. There is a twist after a twist after a twist. You can keep guessing what happens in the movie but in the end you still can't guess it right. People who say the movie should've ended half an hour earlier prefer a simple very predictable happy ending.",A Simple Favor

Did Blake Lively act? Was that acting?First off, the plot is out the window immediately. Almost none of the foreshadowing they placed pulled off in the end. The plot was horrendous and it seemed like they shot it after the first draft, which was probably written in crayon by the writers child. There aren't spoilers, but just so you know, the ending is one of the worst probably ever. Its a classic terrible stand off that wasn't deserved and felt like it was trying to be funny, but like was just cringey. I'm sorry that you, the reader, has to live through this 2 hours of just pain.The acting was some of the worst in probably the last 20 years and I've watched at least one of the Sharknado movies. I dont know why Anna Kendrick chose this movie, she has some good movies under her belt, but it just felt like a quick pay day. Blake Lively, better luck next time. The characters were so bad that I cant comprehend how any of these people are actually allowed to have children.Boo the producer, director, writer and cast.

738,Katieehalt,Could have been great,6,29 August 2021,"This film should have let us understand and get to know the characters better (by showing us, not telling us). Blake Lively was stunning to watch, and I wanted more -- I wanted to see what she did behind the scenes, if she ever had a true moment of doubt, or how she interacted with other people. Anna Kendrick's character was pretty dislikable for all the screen time given (seriously, why did she sleep with her half brother?) and seemed to change drastically and unrealistically over the course of the film. We didn't get to know Alex's character very well either; at times he seemed like a really good person and then other times not at all. Like I still have no idea whether he really loved Anna's character or not. And maybe they could have shown us why he was attracted to Blakes character to begin with and his side of the story as far as his career failure.Normally, you can get to know the characters and get invested in their path and choices, but we didn't know these characters well enough to even make predictions of where things may or may not go, which is normally what keeps you hooked, but this movie was all over the map both with characters and plot. If they had focused on the characters and simplied and tightened up the plot, it could have been truly great. I had hoped that Blake's character had another side/some goodness in her, so was a little disappointed in the later half and the ending with her becoming even more chaotic and a murderer. I had thought that Blake's character and her husband Alex were messing with Anna's character all along. But then you learn the Blake's character really doesn't care about her husband literally at all? That was also an unexpected character change. Final note is, if Blake's character didn't want the insurance plan messed up, maybe she shouldn't have reached out to Nicky so often and she shouldn't have left clues for Ana's character. I would've expected her to be more clever than that, but I guess not.",A Simple Favor
739,zombieskeagan,No clue what kind of movie this thought it was.,3,16 September 2018,Way too much comedy for me to take seriously as a thriller and way too convuluted of a plot for me appreciate as a drama. There was a time at the end when it keeps trying to pack twist on top of twist that I thought maybe it was trying to be a spoof of the recent suburb noir thrillers in the vein of Gone Girl but the movie didn't feel aware enough to me to play this angle. It just felt like they had a thriller they realized was boring so they spiced it up with a bunch of funny dialogue or they had a comedy they tried to make more serious for whatever reason. Neither played well. Although the cast is solid for the most part. I will watch Anna Kendrick stare at a wall for two hours and still wouldnt feel like I wasted my time.,A Simple Favor

The plot was ridiculous, it worked neither as a ""mystery suspense thriller"" (what I thought I was going to see) nor a comedy. The characters were over the top and it was evident the writers thought the dialogue was way more clever than it was.

I was excited for this film because I was excited to see what the trailer advertised as ""The Darker Side of Director Paul Feig"". A man well known for his comedy, I was excited to see his take on a mystery thriller. And over all he did an okay job. The mystery aspects were well done, keeping me on my toes. And there are even a few good comical moments throughout (which I was expecting). The Comedy side of this film is what bothers me in this film. I was okay with a few jokes sprinkled in here-and-there but the end of this movie seemed SO RUSHED AND POORLY WRITTEN. The ending was so forcefully comical that it seemed like Paul Fieg forgot how to end a movie without being funny.

Today, I was not really in the mood to look through options and when this came up as suggestion I was like oh what the heck, might as well. And man am I glad I did.Someone else wrote it wasn't quite a comedy but it wasn't quite a thriller either, and I guess I somewhat agree with it. That however does not make it a bad movie. From the very beginning I kept waiting for the twist to come. The ambience of the movie will make you assume that it is predictable but it sure as hell isn't. At first, it is the character of Lively which will make you question who is truly is and what she wants. A little over half way through, you start feeling the same about the character of Kendrick. The movie gives a perfectly gift wrapped ending which may seem exaggerated but the movie never promised to be gritty and sombre like usual suspense-thriller genre movies. its that very subtle balancing between weird, crazy, funny and suspenseful which makes the movie so good.All in all, if you enjoy offbeat movies, deifinitely give it a try and do not let the not-so-great reviews discourage you.",A Simple Favor

She would've read that too especially since Goody 2shoes, the fab Kendrick, was a blogger. Not that I'm for secretive prevailing all the time, but I'd prefer the more realistic, somehow she got away with it as it suits her xer. Sorry not sorry lol.

We both laughed throughout this movie and struggled to decide what was really going on even though both are really good at knowing pretty much everything before it happens.
We agree it was super different. That's what he kept saying after. But good. Definitely worth the watch. The ending was a little silly for how great the rest of the movie was, but really when you think about it completely works with it too. Everything was entertaining throughout.

However the way this plot moves is unexpected, engaging and perhaps most surprisingly darkly funny.

Sadly the movie itself was unable to deliver the goods. The story was just ridiculous, all the characters were unlikeable and uninteresting and the utterly dumb ending made for a pretty lame climax.
The filmmaking also fails to generate even the slightest air of mystery. Too bright and jerkily pieced together, there was absolutely no sense of tension.

I had a problem with it in the beginning because it was boring and storyline didn't really start until like 30 minutes in or so. So the first 30 minutes or hour were pretty boring. They made some pretty funny jokes here and there but it wasn't bad anyways the middle and the ending were great.

832,vbhunter,Geographically incorrect,6,24 September 2018,"Overall, it was a good movie. However, some of the scenes that took place in Michigan were geographically incorrect. Being from Michigan, this made me laugh and roll my eyes. The film is set in Standish, MI for several scenes and while at this location, cop cars in the background say Marquette County Sheriff. Standish is in Arenac County in the lower peninsula. Marquette is in the UP. Then later in the movie Stephanie is trying to get records from Wayne County, which is where Detroit is. No where near Arenac County/Standish. There was also a grammar mistake in the end text scenes. Just small things that made me laugh.

I read the book and it was AWFUL. I had to force myself through it. I finished only because I thought the film would really bring it up a level or two... How wrong was I?!
I feel like the director started creating this film to make fun of the novel and then decided to take it seriously in the middle and ended it in the most ridiculous manor.

Stephanie, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have an ending. It's just vague and incomplete.

851,aaseraser,"Blake Lively just stole the show, along with many others....",10,21 December 2018,"This movie is very unChristian so beware all you believers. And not for younger people at all. But.....
The writing is so clever and twisted, never a dull moment. The directing just elicits so much stupendous variety out of Blake Lively.....she is a force to be reckoned with. Reminds me of British actors that have devoted decades to honing their craft yet she is just in her 30's. Rarely will you see such chameleon like portrayals that just instantly sink into character with riveting realism. She is truly on another level entirely. She takes American acting to a higher plain altogether. So many unforgettable moments. I do wonder how much the director is responsible for this as Anna Kendrick played the daffy, nervous school mom outstandingly well, injecting little subtle tidbits that made her presence on screen the picture of believability. Also Anna's comedic timing is just blissful precision here. She is just a marvel. Some actors say the lines, some say them with conviction, some say them very convincingly, then there are the ones here that just breathe life itself into them, drawing on all imaginable depths of human understanding to wring out every conceivable aspect of the characters they are playing. Henry Golding is superb as well, a very accomplished actor but his part just didn't have the fireworks of the two leading ladies so his rendition was reserved as it should have been. A fine actor indeed.
This is a movie like few others. It will probably be largely ignored as most great ones are. A shame since many will miss it as it doesn't play into formula action movies of today that are made every few minutes and forgotten in the same amount of time.
Imagine throwing a 10,000 piece puzzle on the floor of a large empty room and out of that disarray rose the most fanciful colorful personalities that were a world unto themselves. Welcome to this movie.",A Simple Favor
