0,TheLittleSongbird,"Fast and funny, if rather hit and miss",7,15 April 2010,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Batman movies, and although Tim Burton didn't return and replaced by Joel Schummacher I decided to give Batman Forever a chance. The film isn't as good or as dark as the first two films, but it is a huge improvement over Batman and Robin, the less said about that film the better. Anyway, this film is quite possibly the fastest and the funniest of the series, but despite all this there are some hit and miss elements. Chris O'Donnell is annoying and lifeless as Robin, the script has its weak spots despite some terrific lines from Jim Carrey and while Nicole Kidman was bearable, her character could have been written better. However, it is stylishly filmed with Oscar-nominated photography and excellent special effects, the direction is surprisingly more efficient and the action hurls along at an exciting and breakneck pace. The acting is good on the most part with Val Kilmer brooding as Batman and Michael Gough perfect as Alfred. The villains steal the show though, while Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as usual as Two Face Jim Carrey is the one with the best lines and delivery as the Riddler. Overall, hit and miss but a decent entry in the Batman franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Batman Forever
1,Leofwine_draca,Too over the top,4,2 January 2020,"BATMAN FOREVER was for many years the only Batman movie that I'd never got around to watching, so it was time to rectify that. Seeing it now, I can understand my reluctance to see it; this is a pure live action cartoon, extremely over the top from the very beginning to very end, and far sillier than even the campness of the 1960s TV series. Now, I'm one of the few people who like the camp of the follow-up BATMAN & ROBIN, but this film takes it a step too far. Jim Carrey's crazed villain spoils the whole thing for me; he's hammily mad from the moment we see him until his last scene, and he gets way too much screen time. Val Kilmer has very little to do other than look good in a bat suit, and Tommy Lee Jones is the worst I've seen him; some of Carrey seems to have rubbed off on him. Elsewhere, Schumacher's hyperactive direction is sub-standard and the film looks just as dated as the rubbery Burton flicks. Thumbs down on this one.",Batman Forever
2,SnoopyStyle,Joel Schumacher takes over,5,17 January 2016,Batman (Val Kilmer) battles Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) who blames him for failing to protect him as DA Harvey Dent. Flirtatious Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) is an expert in abnormal psychology. Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) works for Bruce Wayne creating a machine to transmit directly into the brain. Bruce disapproves of brainwave manipulation. Nygma decides to test it on himself and discovers it sucks up the intelligence of his victims. Nygma turns into the Riddler. Two-Face attacks the circus leaving acrobat Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) an orphan. He wants revenge but gets talked into staying in Wayne Mansion. He discovers the bat-cave and becomes Batman's partner Robin.Joel Schumacher takes over and turns the Batman franchise into a neon colored cartoon. Jim Carrey is a perfect fit for the Riddler. He is great fun and I love the idiot box machine. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face like the Joker and feels too close to Carrey. It would have been better for him to play to his strength being tough and hard. Val Kilmer is solid as Batman/Bruce Wayne although Chris O'Donnell is a little annoying. The neon color overload really bothers me. I might like this if Schumacher could calm down the color palette.,Batman Forever
3,classicsoncall,"""Let's see what justice has in store for you.""",7,23 March 2014,"Among the four pre-Dark Knight films of Christopher Nolan, I'd say that this one was the most suitable for my tastes. Note I didn't say 'favorite', because in general, these films are on a seriously lower grade level than the Dark Knight pictures. I guess for me, this story at least had some character development missing in the prior two pictures, as in the exploration of Bruce Wayne/Batman's (Val Kilmer) duality and the story of Robin's (Chris O'Donnell) origin. Batman's conflict was given added weight with the presence of Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who found herself in a similar conflict over which one to choose as a romantic interest. There was an interesting scene where Wayne walked right into an unset trap by seeing a bat in a Rorschach drawing. That was a revelation for both Bruce and the shrink.As far as villains go, I think the franchise would have been better off by introducing one bad guy at a time instead of two or three as in ""Batman and Robin"", because the story seems to get watered down when the hero has to concentrate on multiple enemies. You generally didn't find that to be the case in the comics, but I understand that the film makers were probably trying to get the biggest bang for the buck with their casting choices.So with that in mind, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two hot names at the time, and were generally suitable picks for their respective alter-egos, Two-Face and The Riddler. Quite honestly, I didn't discern much difference between Jones's Two-Face and Nicholson's Joker, almost opposite sides of the same coin if you catch the irony. With the Riddler, you have Carrey doing himself most of the time, whether in character or not; that's one of the things I find annoying about him when appearing on a talk show. He feels he needs to be over the top most of the time, just like the Riddler when he posed the same question.Well fortunately I guess, this series of films is a couple of decades in the past now and I think of them now more as curiosity pieces than part of the Batman comics continuity. Somewhat, but on a different level than the Adam West TV series, which also produced it's share of groan inducing moments. At least these flicks didn't accentuate the action with Pow! Smash! Boom! word balloons.",Batman Forever
4,lee_eisenberg,Jim Carrey stole the show,5,23 July 2005,"Some people talk about ""the stick of straw that broke the camel's back"", meaning when something reached the tipping point. So when did the Batman franchise go bad? Well, ""Batman Forever"" was getting silly, but it still had Jim Carrey to steal the show as The Riddler (""Batman and Robin"" had about as many good qualities as a barrel of toxic waste). Personally, I don't know why they had to have Batman (Val Kilmer) going through therapy; remove that and he still would have been a cool superhero with neat gadgets. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't bad as Two-Face. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, as Dr. Chase Meridian and Robin, respectively, didn't really add anything.Overall, the point is that when Joel Schumacher took over directing, the franchise went downhill. Part of the problem was that while Tim Burton created an eerie Gotham City that looked like New York in the 1940s, Joel Schumacher created a Gotham City that looked like it was trying too hard to be ""Blade Runner"".So, the franchise starting getting stale with this one, but Jim Carrey kept the movie from being unwatchable. As Edward Nygma, one of Bruce Wayne's employees, he had some great lines. In the movie, Nygma proposes a device that rests atop TV sets and reads peoples' minds, but Wayne rejects it, considering it too dangerous. Thus, Nygma becomes The Riddler, and he's the best character in the movie.",Batman Forever
5,jboothmillard,Batman Forever,9,24 February 2005,"A totally new Batman and a totally new director, Joel Schumacher. Dropping Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer has now entered Batman's boots. The main difference of this Batman to Tim Burton's is he is not as dark as before. This time the caped crusader is up against the perfect villain duo of Tommy Lee Jones as the dangerous Harvey Two-Face, and with him is the hilarious but also nasty likes of Jim Carrey as the Riddler. There is also the appearance of Nicole Kidman, and later Chris O'Donnell becomes Batman's remembered sidekick the boy wonder Robin. Jim Carrey is more funny than the Jack Nicholson was, but this film is still not as great as the first one. Also starring Drew Barrymore as Sugar, Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred. A good array of action and adventure is in store. It was nominated the Oscars Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"", also featuring Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"". Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Jim Carrey was number 47, and Nicole Kidman number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Batman Forever
6,ccthemovieman-1,Jones & Carrey Made It The Worst Batman Movie Ever,3,23 February 2007,"This is the only Batman film of the five I've seen (the ones since 1989) that I felt was totally stupid and the villains were so loud, obnoxious and over-the-top that I never owned it. I've owned all the others and still have three of them.I had no trouble with Val Kilmer as Batman. He played the role about as well as all the other guys. I certainly had no trouble ogling Nicole Kidman, who looks sensational. However, Chris O'Donnell, who pushes himself into the role of ""Robin"" was annoying. Meanwhile, Tommy Lee Jones (""Harvey Two-Face"") and Jim Carrey (""The Riddler"") both overacted so badly in the role of the villains that it make the movie just look ludicrous. They gave me a headache listening to all their rants and raves, and ruined the film for me.I still enjoyed the special effects and some of the wild action scenes but overall the minuses in here were more than the pluses.",Batman Forever
7,Tweekums,Batman gets a sidekick,6,29 April 2017,"After a delightfully dark 'Batman Returns' things turn much more camp in this instalment. The villain Two-Face is menacing the city of Gotham and he is soon to be joined by the Riddler; AKA Edward Nygma, formerly an employee of Wayne Enterprises. Two-Face wants Batman dead because he blames him for his horrific injuries and The Riddler wants Bruce Wayne dead because he refused to fund his scheme to make a device that could project images into a person's brain or extract memories. While these two are scheming to kill Batman/Bruce Wayne psychiatrist Dr Chase Meridian is trying to seduce Batman while being courted by Bruce. While Bruce and Chase are attending a charity fundraiser at the Gotham Circus Two Face strikes and his actions kill all but one member of a family of acrobats; the survivor is Dick Grayson who Bruce invites to stay at Wayne Manor. It isn't too long before he learns that Bruce is Batman and wants to team up with him to kill Two-Face.I really enjoyed 'Batman Returns' due to its dark tone and interesting antagonists this was definitely disappointing in comparison. Tim Burton has been replaced by Joel Schumacher as director and the film feels altogether more camp. We also have a new Batman in the form of Val Kilmer; he does a solid enough job in the role and Chris O'Donnell works well with him in the role of Dick Grayson who nobody will be surprised when he becomes Robin. Nicole Kidman is okay as Chase, definitely improving as the film progresses. The problem is the two villains; Tommy Lee Jones hams it up outrageously as Two-Face and Jim Carrey is at his most annoying as the gurning Riddler a shame as both have shown they can be so much better. There is a decent amount of action but it doesn't feel that threatening even at the moments that it really should. Overall I'd say that this is a real step down from the previous two films the only real plus is that it is now more suitable for younger viewers.",Batman Forever
8,BA_Harrison,"Fetishistic foibles aside, it's actually very good.",8,22 July 2017,"There's a lot of hatred for Joel Schumacher's Batman movies, deservedly so in the case of the dreadful Batman and Robin, but for my money, Batman Forever is vastly under-rated: in my opinion, it's a hugely entertaining, brightly coloured comic-book romp with just the right level of camp. Yes, it might have introduced nipples to the Bat costume and given us a gratuitous shot of the hero's rubber clad butt (Schumacher just can't help himself), but the film's gaudy neon Gotham City and over-the-top characters make this a far more satisfying affair than Tim Burton's previous film, the joyless, dreary Gothic mess that was Batman Returns.As much as I enjoyed Burton's 1989 original, I was never 100% convinced by Michael Keaton as either Bruce Wayne or Batman. Here, Val Kilmer is far more suitable, looking every inch the millionaire playboy and much more believable as a tough superhero. Likewise, I prefer Nicole Kidman over Batman's previous love interests, but that's probably because she is way hotter. As far as the villains are concerned, the double team of Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler are hard to beat, both revelling in the ridiculousness of their roles (Carrey, in particular, hams it up a treat). And then there's Drew Barrymore, as Two Face's sexy moll Sugar, looking fabulous in white lacy underwear—can't really go wrong with that!The cookie-cutter plot isn't anything groundbreaking, but the simple story-line doesn't detract from the enjoyment, Schumacher keeping the film moving at a cracking pace, with plenty of spectacular, action packed, special effects filled set-pieces, and quite a few funny gags (best of all: Robin saying ""Holey rusted metal, Batman"", a joke which will probably be lost on many younger viewers). As a fun way to spend a couple of hours, Batman Forever succeeds very well indeed.8/10.",Batman Forever
9,moonspinner55,New-fangled Batman in a disco-ball Gotham City...,5,21 July 2006,"Third film in the late '80's-to-late '90's cycle of the ""Batman"" franchise has director Joel Schumacher following in the deeply-entrenched footprints of Tim Burton (who directed 1989's ""Batman"" and 1993's ""Batman Returns""). Val Kilmer is not a bad choice for the lead (his one and only turn as the superhero) and the supporting cast is full of colorful players, but who wants a day-glo Batman? Schumacher seems to delight in being a piffle-maker extraordinare--how else to explain the jokey exchanges and cartoony costumes which look like leftovers from an S&M sex shop. Plot has Batman challenged by Jim Carrey's nerd-turned-mad genius the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (whose modus operandi is never made quite clear). Chris O'Donnell adds some dry humor as would-be protégé Robin, but Nicole Kidman has a wan role as a psychologist/love-interest. The movie creaks and groans with empty camp, while whole sequences seem terribly under-directed and yet over-nourished (Carrey has an outdoor press-conference scene which probably took an entire day to set up and yet runs about 15 seconds and looks horribly tacky). Followed by Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin"" in 1997, which was even worse. ** from ****",Batman Forever
10,dbdumonteil,"Tim Burton, help!",4,26 December 2004,"After Tim Burton, it is Joel Schumacher's turn to take over to shot the third chapter of the adventures of Batman. This change of director deals a serious blow to the quality of the whole in the way it marks a sharp regression in comparison with the two previous Batman movies.We can say that to write this third opus, the authors have made a minimum of effort. The screenplay is largely inspired of Tim Burton's movies. In ""Batman Returns"" (1992), the Penguin and Catwoman joined forces to fight the hero of Gotham City. Here, the Mystery Man and Mr Heads or Tails dare to pit themselves against Batman. Then, Schumacher tried to find room in the script to focus on Bruce Wayne's personality and his psychology strongly echoes to the type of character developed by Burton in the first movie. We knew that Bruce Wayne was an ambiguous character, haunted by bad memories (his parents' death). Here, we learn that it is this tragic event that made him want to create a second identity for himself in order to fight evil and make justice triumph. But we could have guessed this intention from the first movie. As a matter of fact, Schumacher openly shows what we thought about the reasons that drive Wayne to become Batman. So the sequences during which we see Val Kilmer anguished by seeing certain objects only constitute a pointless digression in the long run. It is only of minor interest.""Batman Forever"" also contains a simplistic and thin plot which the director does his best to highlight it by opting for the spectacular. There are action sequences which run well but sometimes they nearly verge on the ludicrous.On another hand, the darkness that shrouded Gotham City has vanished. So, the threatening aspect of the city has virtually disappeared.About the cast, it alternates the best and the worst. Val Kilmer puts on quite easily the Batman outfit (Michael Keaton turned down the role in spite of an attractive price) but Chris O'Donnell beside him is rather colorless. About the wicked, well Jim Carrey was the most appropriate actor to act the Mystery Man and so he fulfilled well his part. But I found Tommy Lee Jones unbearable.A quite indigestible film where Schumacher unlike Tim Burton shows his inability in developing his own vision of Batman and contents himself with making a tailor-made movie for the top of the box-office.",Batman Forever
11,Quinoa1984,"Schumacher's Batman equivalent, not great but not bad",6,1 May 2000,"Tim Burton made on of the best films of the 80's with his first installment in the series. Like Burton, director Joel Schumacher made Forever and it was like the first Batman movie, only second banana- WAY second banana. Batman and Robin though is the worst film of 1997. Anyway, Batman Forever is a cool, dark but only so-so film that has plenty of action and drama to go around, and enough campiness to choke a horse. There is some drama and chemistry between Val Kilmer as the Bruce Wayne/Batman and Nicole Kidman as the love interest. Plot involves The riddler (Jim Carrey is terrific) who wants to rule the world with brainwaves. He goes to Harvey Dent/Two-face (Tommy Lee Jones) and become a powerful duo. But this time, Batman is not alone. He has the assistance of Chris O'Donnell (yikes) as Robin, but adds drama in the 'will-he-won't-he' manner of agreement to being ready to have a partner. This and other interesting things (i.e. sound-track) make this well done in some respects (least in comparison to the 97 film), but in retrospect from how I saw it as a kid it's... not as good.",Batman Forever
12,sunwarrior13,Just Enough To Entertain The Viewer,8,15 September 2012,"Batman Forever is a film produced by Tim Burton and directed by Joel Schumacher. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the third installment in the Batman film series, with Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne and Batman. The returning cast features Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop Two-Face,played by Tommy Lee Jones; and the Riddler,portrayed by Jim Carrey in their villainous scheme to drain information from all the brains in Gotham City. He gains allegiance from a love interest — psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian,played by Nicole Kidman — and a young, orphaned circus acrobat named Dick Grayson,portrayed by Chris O'Donnell,who becomes his sidekick Robin.Bruce Wayne is effectively brooding as he ponders strange dreams about his parents' death and escapes his own near-demise at the hands of Two- Face, a former district attorney driven insane and turned into a master criminal when a gangster throws acid in his face. Meanwhile, as sexy psychologist Chase Meridian tries to analyze and seduce Bruce Wayne and Wayne Enterprises employee Edward Nygma reacts badly to getting fired, using his self-invented mind-energy device to transform into the super- intelligent Riddler. The Riddler teams up with Two-Face to bring down Batman and drain the minds of Gotham City residents with his device, while Batman gets some much-needed help in the form of circus performer Dick Grayson, out for vengeance after being orphaned by Two-Face.This is a flashy movie that's more like a video game as the characters involved as more as superheroes and villains rather than human beings.Failure to attached human elements to the characters involved ultimately made the movie less better compared to the first two Batman films - Batman and Batman Returns.The only good thing about it is that is has enough to be able to entertain the viewer.",Batman Forever
13,bevo-13678,Droll,10,24 November 2020,Very apt title. With the amount of batmans made you could probably watch them forever,Batman Forever
14,hitchcockthelegend,A different direction brings differing results.,5,25 May 2008,"Batman takes on a new side kick as he fights to keep Gotham City out of the clutches of Two-Face and The Riddler.""No thanks, i'll get drive-thru""Thus these be the first words out of Val Kilmer's incarnation of Batman and thus setting the standard for what Joel Schumacher's two Batman movies would be like. Gone is the dark undertone from Tim Burton's visions, and the tight action sequences that marked Burton's debut out as a genuine genre piece of work, in their place comes sexy campery and ropey action set pieces. The casting of both Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnell as Robin is a big mistake, Kilmer easily being the most boring actor to don the suit out of all of them, whilst O'Donnell simply can't act outside of Robin's cartoonery bravado. Nicole Kidman looks positively gorgeous as Chase Meridian, but that's all that is brought to the party, it's a waste of the very talented Kidman's ability and a waste of the audience's time.It's not all bad tho, a comic book adaptation is only as good as its villains, and here we get a perfectly cast Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and a wildly over the top Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey steals every scene he is in, it's almost too much, but as maniacal and exuberant as it is, it is the films highlight and actually the films saving grace {Tommy Lee Jones was reportedly unhappy from having his thunder stolen in the movie by Carrey}. The script does work enough to make the story accessible to all ages, and there are enough crash bangs and wallops to entertain in that brain at the door kind of way.This was the biggest hit of 1995, so the paying public lapped it up and paved the way for another Schumacher film in the franchise, but with all that star power wasted, and nipples on the rubber suits, it's hard to see why it was so popular now. 5/10",Batman Forever
15,preppy-3,The best Batman sequel,8,26 February 2007,"I never liked Tim Burton's version of Batman. It was WAY too dark and violent. ""Batman"" (1989) was a huge hit. So was ""Batman Returns"" in 1992. However Warner Brothers got tons of complaints from parents about ""Returns"" being far too dark and violent for their kids. So Burton didn't direct this one--he's just one of the producers and has a cute cameo as Dr. Burton at the end of the movie. This was done by Joel Schumacher whose version of Batman wasn't anywhere are dark as Burtons. Most people disagree but I actually thought this was a lot of fun.**DEFINITE SPOILERS** The film starts right off with a bang as Batman (Val Kilmer) foils a robbery engineered by Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones). He also meets sexy Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who is sexually attracted to him. We also get the Riddler (Jim Carrey) popping up and giving him a needlessly convoluted origin. Him and Two Face decide to team up to kill Batman and control Gotham through a mind machine (don't ask). Also Two Face causes the death of two circus acrobats and their son (Chris O'Donnell) is adopted by Bruce Wayne (Kilmer). I realize that O'Donnell is far too old for the role (he was 25 when he did this) but it works (kind of). He figures out that Wayne is Batman and joins him as Robin to fight the villains. Also Dr. Meridian is trying to psychoanalyze Wayne and has strong suspicions that he's hiding something from her... **END SPOILERS**As I said most people hate this but I had fun. It's fast, well written and well directed by Schumacher. The special effects are impressive and the movie is never boring. There are also a few cute jokes snuck in for comic book fans--Metropolis is mentioned and O'Donnell suggests Nightwing as a name for himself. If you're seeing this for O'Donnell though be warned--he doesn't show up until 30 minutes in and isn't even in costume until the movie is half over. Also there's a loud booming score which perfectly fits the movie. Also I personally like the metal suits Batman and Robin are given. However has anyone ever noticed that Robin's codpiece is bigger than Batmans?The acting wavers--Kilmer is actually quite good as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Handsome and muscular--a huge improvement over Michael Keaton. Kidman is sexy and believable. Also I like Michael Gough as Alfred and Drew Barrymore is fun in a small role. The rest of the acting isn't that good however. O'Donnell is tall and handsome...but bland and plays Dick Grayson/Robin as an obnoxious brat. More than once I just wanted Batman to knock him flat. I never liked Carrey and his overacting as the Riddler quickly gets annoying. Jones can be good but he hated playing Two Face...and it shows. He ends up trying to out act Carrey and it's pretty terrible. So I give it an 8 for the story, direction, Kilmer and Kidman. However O'Donnell, Carrey and Jones really got on my nerves. Still this is worth catching.",Batman Forever
16,LeonLouisRicci,"""Is that over the top?... I can never tell.""",10,26 June 2014,"To be Clear, this is a Comic Book Movie.

This is a Batman movie for people who don't like comic books or see their worth as anything beyond ""funny books."" Val Kilmer doesn't take the role seriously at all. He's not alone as no one in the cast is taking this seriously. But that's Joel Schumacher for you. He clearly only cares about Batman for gay camp value. He is probably a big fan of the Adam West TV series and believes that is how Batman should be portrayed: as a joke. Career low-point for Tommy Lee Jones.

18,zardoz-13,"""Batman"" Farcever!!!",5,25 March 2013,"""Falling Down"" director Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton on the third live-action Caped Crusader epic ""Batman Forever"" with Val Kilmer donning the cape and cowl as the Dark Knight with Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey providing the menace. Unfortunately, as awful as the Michael Keaton ""Batman"" films were, ""Batman Forever"" qualifies as infinitely worse. This incredibly far-fetched adventure seems less contrived than ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns,"" but it suffers primarily from the shoddy screenplay writing skills of Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler , and Akiva Goldsman. Handsome Val Kilmer looks better suited to play the vigilante crime fighter, but his Batman behaves like a complete bimbo. He does so many idiotic things that you just want to throw up your hands in frustration. He allows himself to be trapped early on in a safe bursting with boiling acid. Not long thereafter as millionaire Bruce Wayne, he smashes his way without solicitation into the heroine's apartment because he fears that she is being assaulted. Later, the two villains waltz into Wayne Manor with comparable ease and then invade the Batcave to wreck havoc. Despite all these dreadful mistakes, ""Batman Forever"" looks much better than its predecessors. ""Lethal Weapon"" lenser Stephen Goldblatt makes this outing look exceptional and Schumacher maintains a swift pace. Schumacher must have been channeling the 1966 ""Batman"" because the palette of colors appears brighter and less film noir-like that the Burton ""Batman"" epics. The production designs of Barbara Ling, Christopher Burian-Mohr and Joseph P. Lucky's art direction, and Ingrid Ferrin & Bob Ringwood's costume designs distinguish this flawed film. One of the biggest problems with ""Batman Forever"" is that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey chew the scenery with such maniacal relish that Kilmer's Batman seems hopelessly dull by comparison. One of the few things that Schumacher manages to do with some success is replicate the death of Bruce's parents on a dark street. Since ""Batman Forever"" is a reboot, virtually all the equipment has been redesigned, such as the Batmobile. This exotic looking car looks like a souped-up sneaker. The Batwing and the Batboat look cool, but they aren't around long. Nevertheless, when the Batwing is blown out of the sky, it takes more than The Joker's well-aimed, .22 caliber long rifle bullet to do the job. The thing that sets this ""Batman"" outing apart from the two earlier examples is the inclusion of Robin the Boy Wonder. Chris O'Donnell appears almost too old to play the acrobatic Dick Grayson. If you're a Batman fanatic, you know that the death of the Flying Graysons was scrubbed from the first Keaton ""Batman"" with The Joker responsible for their deaths. The scenarists do a better job with the warped psychological problems that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson suffer from than the outrageous plot that piles one dumb exploit on top of another. Although it is a comic book opus, ""Batman Forever"" looks more realistic than the Burton ""Batman"" movies because the physical sets have a great sense of authenticity.",Batman Forever
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Was that over the top? I can never tell!"" Yes, Jim, it was, the rest of us *can* tell... but hey, you're by far not the only one in the film",5,18 November 2007,"More than ten years, and this probably still hurts like a chemical burn, in the hearts and minds of fans of the dark knight. Perhaps they had just gotten over the 60's series, too... and that one at least had the excuse that Batman hadn't really been done before that point. This follows a good film, and one that came close to being that, and, well, from the first lines, you can tell that this can by no means be considered as proper an approach as either of those. This film answered a once big question; would you rather never see your hero, your idol, in a film, or only see him or her done right? Burton got out of the director's chair when he found that his dark, and far more fitting, style of doing these films was not what the studio intended for future entries, and, presumably because he's cheap and easy to rely on for the producers, not making a fuss, Joel Schumacher was brought in. Everything proceeds to disintegrate. The bleak Gotham gains bright, tawdry neon, oh how the production team who created the architecture of the city in the first two must feel. The characterization is turned into superficial moments and lines of dialog. It's clear that Schumacher neither understands nor respects the medium of comic books; S1m0ne, by Andrew Niccol, goes too far in trying to make us laugh at celebrities and those at home who love them, but at least his production does hold truth and satire. We fans, we read comic books, is what we need really more people telling us how stupid they think that is? The presentation of the villains further illustrates it. Two-Face is essentially the Joker, just with only half a face of make-up. Where Nicholson was haunting and grotesque, Lee, in spite of being a very talented actor who I like and respect, and enjoy the work of, merely comes off as a nuisance, not a real threat. A cartoon. The utter lack of respect for the source material is seen in one brief part, mentioned in the Trivia section, where the character does something that not only is inconsistent, but downright goes straight against the very *core* of the personality of him! The Riddler is possibly even worse. I like Carrey, too... he's the very reason I initially watched it. Heck, these actors are almost all talented, only you wouldn't know it from watching this. The acting is overdone. Heck, everything is! Sequences are pushed to the extremes, with far too many colors and too much going on at once. The once well-written dialog is replaced with pitiful one-liners and such. Robin is introduced to this series of Batman, and he's made hip. See the earring? And just look at him hanging up the laundry! What were they *thinking*? The nipples on the suits even bothered Bob Kane himself. The action isn't even particularly exciting. It's such a shame that this actually had potential; there's back-story, motivation and explanation behind the title character, and the original plot(described elsewhere, it might spoil stuff in the film to reveal it here) sounds interesting. The worst may be that on the surface, this doesn't look anywhere near as awful as it is... it is a technically speaking fairly well-done film. Camera, editing and sound are by no means inspiring, but we *are* talking about Schumacher, here. They get the job done, he gets the job done, that's why the producers like him, that's why he keeps getting work. The effects vary, but many are good. There are a few references that aren't bad. I recommend this only to those who aren't fans. I don't know that I would have made it all the way through this and it's even worse follow-up had I been. As for who will enjoy it... that is a good question. If you're looking for parody, Black Scorpion is really better. 5/10",Batman Forever
20,view_and_review,"With this, Batman became a running gag",1,28 August 2020,"Parts three are always difficult. Usually, the first episode is a mega success and part two a moderate success. So, by part three a franchise can just slap the franchise name on a can of celluloid and watch the money pour in. ""Batman Forever"" was the franchise name on a can of celluloid. It was more cartoonish and more foolish. They went so far as to outfit Batman's suit with a butt to rival Kim Kardashian. It was a total joke.By this time Michael Keaton hopped off the Batman train that was barreling towards a collapsed bridge. Tim Burton also decided that two was enough although he did help produce. To see to the fiery death of the Batman franchise Joel Schumacher was brought in to direct and Val Kilmer was brought in to be the Dark Knight.
The nemeses in this installment would be Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carey). What a waste of talent. Both of these arch criminals came into existence so sloppily. Two-Face's existence was more digestible as he was a bad guy the moment the movie started. The Riddler, on the other hand, turned megalomaniac due to being slighted by Bruce Wayne.Even more clumsily added was Robin (Chris O'Donnell).His acrobat family was killed by Two-Face. Then he wound up being a ward of the state (though he's clearly an adult). He was unceremoniously dropped off at Wayne Manor for care (for some odd reason). Then, to discover the secrtet, he did the most unnecessarily elaborate acrobatic stunt to enter ""the only locked door in the mansion"" whereby he stumbled upon Bruce Wayne's secret. His whole existence was nauseating. He even stole the Batmobile to go joy riding where he was able to fortuitously come across a gang molesting a girl which gave him the chance to play hero and kiss the damsel in distress. A horny teenager could've written a better script.Let me not forget his foreshadowing display of martial arts skills while hanging his laundry on the clothesline. Beyond being over-the-top, I was wondering why the fool didn't use the dryer!Then we get to Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman). I had to save her character for last. She was the new blond love interest. From Kim Basinger to Michelle Pfeiffer to Nicole Kidman they were all carbon copies of one another. But Chase would be far less endearing than the previous two blond bombshells. She was nothing more than a sexually aroused skirt. She all but had an orgasm the moment she laid eyes on Batman. She shamelessly threw herself at him and of course, Batman couldn't pass on such a treat. He would eventually reveal his identity to yet another blondie he just met. I don't know why he doesn't tell every blond woman in Gotham his secret and get it out of the way.Ugh! This movie was frustrating: too many gadgets (as in the perfect gadget for every situation which would mean he's either prescient or carrying around so much equipment that he wouldn't even be able to move), too many shallow characters, too weak of a script. Bats are supposed to fly, this one just flopped.",Batman Forever
21,neil-476,Even Batman And Robin was better,5,31 March 2011,"The Batmobile in this movie is really good.Then we have the not-so-good stuff: 1. Val Kilmer - a charisma-free zone as both Batman and Bruce Wayne; 2. Jim Carrey - riding high on a wave of popularity and, as a consequence, given carte blanche to deliver a Riddler (the least interesting of Batman's rogues gallery) full of characteristic Carrey exaggerations, a performance which completely overpowers the movie. Which wouldn't be so bad if it was entertaining. But it isn't.3. Tommy Lee Jones - an inspired choice for Two-Face, Batman's most interesting villain, with a part so underwritten (or edited down to make room for Carrey's Riddler) that he is reduced to hysterical cackling. What a waste.4. Lurid colour photography.5. Chris O'Donnell's Robin/Dick Grayson. While I can understand making Robin an adult, and while I enjoyed his origin sequence, the character was vapid enough to make Kilmer's characterisation look as if it almost had some vitality to it.6. The various girls had no character whatsoever and there was little point to them even being in the film.7. The script was awful. The story was bad, the Riddler was monstrously allowed to take over the movie, and the dialogue was execrably bad.Dire. Even the Clooney movie which followed was better.",Batman Forever
22,evanston_dad,"Only Jim Carrey Saves This from Being an ""F""",2,12 May 2009,"Joel Schumacher took over the Batman franchise from Tim Burton and made mince meat out of the whole affair. The best thing that can be said about ""Batman Forever"" is that it's not as bad as Schumacher's own sequel, ""Batman and Robin."" Any Batman movie is only as good as its villains, and here we get two (or three, depending on your counting system). Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face in a grotesque, unwatchably hyper performance, and Jim Carrey plays the Riddler. Carrey just does his usual schtick, the same he does no matter what role he's playing, but God knows if there's anything salvageable about this movie, it's him.Instead of the moody production design of the first two Burton efforts, we instead get a lot of neon and swirling lights -- the effect is like being trapped inside a pinball machine.Schumacher is such a heavy handed director, he makes Oliver Stone look subtle.Grade: D-",Batman Forever
23,Uriah43,Good Cast but Wasted Potential,5,11 February 2017,"This movie begins with a partially disfigured villain named ""Two-Face"" (Tommy Lee Jones) and some of his thugs holding some hostages in a building until ""Batman"" (Val Kilmer) arrives and releases them after an intense fight. Unfortunately, Two-Face manages to escape and teams up with a new villain named ""the Riddler"" (Jim Carrey) who has his own agenda involving mind-control over all of the people in Gotham City. Meanwhile, two other people come into Batman's life with the first being a pretty psychiatrist named ""Chase Meridian"" (Nicole Kidman) who is infatuated with him and the other being a young circus performer by the name of ""Dick Grayson"" (Chris O'Donnell) who has just witnessed the death of his family at the hands of Two-Face and wants to avenge them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather odd continuation of the Batman franchise due in large part to the many attempts at humor which tended to obscure the overall plot. The fact that much of the humor wasn't especially funny certainly didn't help either. That being said, while I don't consider this to be a bad movie necessarily, it wasn't as good as its predecessors and didn't meet my expectations. Because of that, I have rated this film accordingly.

24,anaconda-40658,It Delivers on Backstory.,8,25 June 2015,"Batman Forever (1995): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell: This time it explains how the bat became his trademark thus generating a very underrated entry in the franchise. We also discover the mystery surrounding the death of his parents. Robin is introduced as well as the death of his family, and the vengeance he holds to villain Two-Face. Batman's identity will forever mystify the forces of evil. Plot is ridiculous but director Joel Schumacher develops characters better than previously. This is quite different for a director who previously made The Client and Flatliners. Val Kilmer plays a much more detailed Batman whose identity is threatened but his victory is done with brains over brawn. Tommy Lee Jones plays the ruthless Two-Face, former district attorney Harvey Dent whose past is showcased here. Chris O'Donnell plays Robin embodied by anger and vengeance toward Two-Face. Jim Carrey steals the film as the Riddler whose Brain-in-the-Box invention may access Batman's identity. Batman will beat him at his own game. Only Nicole Kidman is utterly cardboard as the flat romantic interest. She is one of those reporter types whose prime function is to play a damsel and be an all around pain in the ass. Otherwise this entry seems more focused on background information thus presenting deeper themes. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Batman Forever
25,HotToastyRag,Kid-friendly,5,18 December 2018,"Batman Forever isn't really anyone's favorite Batman movie; it's an intermittent volume that sometimes gets forgotten about when everyone rattles off their favorites. Val Kilmer plays Gotham City's hero in this one, but I've never heard anyone say he was their favorite Batman. Nicole Kidman plays his love interest, but she isn't given very much to do, and she doesn't have an alter ego, like some other comic book girls do. The villains in this one are Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Joker. In case you're worried about the kiddies, rest assured, this movie isn't nearly as scary as the earlier or later installments. Jim Carrey's Joker is comical, not frightening, and Tommy Lee Jones isn't scary when you compare him to other villains. The children don't have to be put to bed during this movie.While I did like the family friendly attitude of this movie-I disliked Christopher Nolan's tone in the later films-I missed Michael Keaton. To me, and many others, he's the only acceptable Batman. On the upside, Chris O'Donnell get introduced in this movie as Batman's sidekick Robin, but he has a much bigger, better part in the next film, Batman & Robin.",Batman Forever
26,Aaron1375,This film is a riddle and has two faces!,5,31 July 2012,"This film came out in 1995, the third sequel in the successful Batman series. Tim Burton is now just a footnote given a producer credit and Joel Schumacher is now the director. Why? Because Returns was not a beloved film and its box office gross, though high, still was regarded as a disappointment. So this one opened and there was fanfare aplenty. In fact, this one was considered much better than Returns, a fun film! Over the years though, it and Returns have switched places as now Returns is considered a very good Batman film and even the best of the original four by some and this one is seen as the one that was a precursor to the nightmare that was the fourth movie of the series. I think that Returns is the better film, but not by all that much. Both films, when I look back on them kind of missed the mark. This one just distracts you from the fact it missed the mark by adding bright colors and over the top performances.The story has Two-Face escaping Arkham Asylum and obsessed with killing Batman. Unfortunately, the scene depicting his escape was left out of the final cut that hit theaters. Batman comes to stop Harvey Dent and a criminal psychologist named Dr. Chase Meridian is on the scene to offer insight. Batman and Two-Face clash and soon we are introduced to Edward Nygma, an employee for Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, but goes insane when his hero rejects him. He soon dons the persona of the Riddler and teams up with Two-Face in an attempt to increase his knowledge and uncover the identity of Batman. Fortunately for Batman he will not have to face these two madmen alone as he will uncover an unlikely partner in Dick Grayson, soon to be known as Robin. First, though Batman is going to have to come to terms with his own near split persona.Some of the principal cast members from the previous two movies are back as Pat Hingle reprises his Commissioner Gordan and Michael Gough returns as Alfred. They are about the only thing linking Joel Schumacher's Batman films with Burton along with a few subtle nods to the original two films. For the most part though all four films stand on their own and you do not have to watch them in any particular order to make sense of anything. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton, and he looks more the part than did Keaton, but he just does not play the part all that well. I think he was a bit better than George Clooney, but that is because Clooney was not acting at all in Batman and Robin. It seems he was just directed to be himself. Though from what I hear both Val Kilmer and Tommy Lee Jones were a terror to not only the director, but to Jim Carey as well.The villains on display are Two-Face and The Riddler. Both at times are done rather well, and at other times just seem a bit to frenetic. Two-Face is supposed to have two halves to his persona, one good and the other twisted and evil. He decides things with a flip of the coin. Here though he often repeatedly flips his coin until he gets the desired outcome which suggests that he is not dual natured, but more like 75 percent evil and maybe 25 good. Tommy Lee Jones at times does a good time as Two-Face and at other times he is just a bit to campy. He is usually too campy in the scenes he is in with Jim Carey. Then there is Jim Carey as the Riddler, and look no further than Frank Gorshin's portrayal of the character and that is pretty much what Carey does. I find it funny and over the top, but it sort of carried the movie at times too.This film would end up making perhaps 50 more million dollars than Returns, though if you factor in the cost of the film only about 30 million more, but it was considered a huge success. I still cannot quite figure why. The studio thought it was such a hit they brought Joel Schumacher back for the fourth film and they seemed to want to make the film even more colorful and zany than this one. They apparently thought that was the reason this one outperformed Returns, but I do believe the real reason is they got Carey and Jones when both were very high and they kind of generated some buzz. Carey came out of nowhere to have three successive hits at the box office and Jones was an Oscar winner for the Fugitive. However, the people who made the film apparently thought it was not this that made the film a success (though not all that much more than Returns and still way behind the initial film) and added more and more to Batman and Robin.So in the end, this film had its moments, but was not quite the film it was believed to be. It mainly benefited from a couple of good casting calls and buzz. I liked it initially, but when I watch it now I do not remember why I enjoyed it so much. I hated the bat mobile, the bat suit was bland compared to Burton's and overall it just did not leave me wanting for more, much less a lot more comedy that would be presented in the next film. We already had that in the 60's! Still, with just a bit of work it could have been the winner everyone thought it was at the time.",Batman Forever
27,zetes,"I don't get the hate. Sure, Batman & Robin is terrible, but this one's pretty good",7,22 August 2016,"I've always remembered this much maligned third installment of the Batman movie series as being pretty okay, and, on my first viewing since the theater (where I saw it twice - more out of circumstance than desire), I thought my initial reaction was right. I think it just gets a lot of residual hatred from Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which was really awful, mostly because of Schwarzenegger. It does depend on how much tolerance you have for '90s Jim Carrey, because if your tolerance level is low, I can understand why you'd hate this one, too. I think, visually, this movie is about as good as Batman Returns. I like the fact that it's actually colorful, instead of just black and blue like the previous two installments. There's a lot of green from The Riddler, of course, but there are a lot of reds and purples, too, and it's just very pretty. The production design and costuming are great throughout. If there's a big problem with this one it's Val Kilmer. I don't like Keaton all that much as Batman, to be honest, but he made a great Bruce Wayne. Kilmer is pretty boring as both. And the less said about Chris O'Donnell's Robin, the better (I had honestly thought he didn't even appear until the fourth movie). I personally like Carrey's depiction of The Riddler, and I also find Tommy Lee Jones a lot of fun as two face. It's all very campy, but in a lot of ways I prefer that to the grim darkness of the first two films. After all, my favorite Batman movie is still the '66 one, and this film really hearkens back to the '60s Batman series.",Batman Forever

29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Batman Forever,6,7 June 2005,"Joel Schumacher brought on a whole new dimension to the franchise. Some liked it, while others hated it for some of the irrelevant stuff he added, like giving the batsuit nipples (to be anatomically correct? What gives?) and having Dick Grayson put on earrings (to be more hip?)Val Kilmer took on the mantle of the bat, only to have the plot wanting him to give it up to live a happy life with Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman). Well, who wouldn't? In my opinion, I thought he tried too hard to introduce the different voices for both Bats and Bruce, thus giving the former a very unnatural rough and gruff voice. But with his youth, he brought along a more physical Batman, with spectacular stunts and sets which made him look good. My only gripe? Some of the stunts are too improbable, even for the Batman (like, leaping from a high tower and landing right into a manhole??) Dr Chase Meridian, eye candy as she was, failed to improve the romance department from what we saw in Batman Returns. Catwoman was subtly referenced, and at times, Dr Meridian looked and sounded like some desperado stalker who had the hots for Batman. While the dialogue between Batman and Catwoman was pretty, the dialogue here was horrible and corny at times, coupled with some deliberate cleavage revealing scenes. The bat-signal was a significant improvement from the earlier ones, but suffered the indignity of being abused as a seduction call.Edward Nygma, the Riddler, was played by rubber-faced Jim Carrey. Hey, I'm a fan of Carrey, and I thought he made an excellent Riddler. However, the script and his role was a letdown. While the riddles were creative, the motivations of the Riddler was a nightmare - what with creating TV signals and beaming people's brainwaves into his own, thus making him super smart, and psychotic in the process. His hatred was towards Bruce Wayne, for being the rich dude that he was and for publicly shunning Edward's ideas in front of his WayneTech colleagues. Yes, finally, we see Wayne Tech in the movies, with Bruce Wayne walking the grounds of his empire. Little touches were appreciated, like the Riddler's question-marked costume, his cane and his bowl hat.To balance the Riddler's brains, we needed some brawn. Sadly, Two-Face's role was extremely off the mark. In the comics, there is a relationship of respect between Batman-Two-Face-Harvey Dent. Billy Dee Williams was replaced as Harvey Dent by none other than Tommy Lee Jones, and while Jones is an esteemed actor, again the script and his role were disappointing. The battles between Batman and Harvey (as he calls him) always had a tinge of the psychological, and this was seriously lacking. Instead, we got a Two-Face who was a rehash of the insanity of the Joker in the first Batman film.I applaud the efforts to bring the nuances of Two-Face onto the big screen. The costuming and makeup were excellent, and the featuring of the tossing of a scarred coin accurate. However, the usage of the coin is limited, and the fatal mistake put on screen had shown him tossing it multiple times! That is so wrong! He tosses it only once and abides by whatever the outcome of the result. Somehow, these nuances are only superficially shown, and lacked depth. I also don't get the idea of having 2 molls - Sugar and Spice (Debi Mazar and Drew Barrymore by the way) for Two-Face, be it just to highlight his duality. My bet is if this character was in the able hands of Christopher Nolan, we'd see a more credible Two-Face.The sets this time were brighter, lit by psychedelic neon lights. I initially smiled when Bruce entered a secret lift/tunnel en route to his satellite bat-cave headquarters (a tribute to the comics of the 70s) beneath Wayne Tech. However, in this show, this lift/tunnel brought him all the way back to Wayne Manor! I cringed at the impossibility. Arkham Asylum was also introduced for the first time in the franchise, and I thought it was pretty decent (pardon the pun).I enjoyed watching the Flying Graysons in action (hmm, was there an extra member of the family?), and how Dick Grayson/Robin's origin was tied to Two-Face's involvement in his family tragedy. But the producers forgot, that Dick was never as bratty and rebellious as what Chris O'Donnell put on screen, and isn't he a tad too old for the role? He's more Nightwing! A ""holy-Robin"" joke managed to appear, and thank goodness no more. It's good that the filmmakers decided to use the contemporary Robin costume, but what's questionable are the lingering shots of the crotch areas...The supporting characters like Alfred and Commissioner Gordon again took back seats. However we saw a nice touch added - that of Alfred tending to Batman's wounds, just like the comic books. Also, a bond develops between Alfred and Dick Grayson, which was also key. Gordon became more and more a cameo character, which saddens me given his role in the comics as the only cop Batman trusts.To summarize, I liked certain elements of the production values, but the script could have improved by leaps and bounds. Yes, my main gripe was with the script, and it was a roller coaster ride for me - elated when I saw certain elements introduced, and disappointment when the potential was not achieved.",Batman Forever
30,Mr-Fusion,A misguided effort to lighten things up makes for viewer discomfort,4,11 October 2011,"Warner Bros. was apparently unprepared for the parental backlash of angry letters over the dark and violent tone of ""Batman Returns"". So they did what any sensible studio would do and went in a different direction, lightening the tone and color palette of the next Batmovie. With a vengeance. ""Batman Forever"" is the gaudy result of that overreaction.""New blood"" is the operative phrase here, with Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, the production designer and score composer being replaced by new faces. Joel Schumacher, hot off the successes of John Grisham adaptations, was brought in to direct, while Val Kilmer was hired to wear the cape and cowl. Gone are the nightmarish Gothic cityscapes of Burton's Gotham City, in favor of an industrial city lit entirely by neon (even the machine guns have neon!). Also missing is Danny Elfman, replaced by Elliot Goldenthal's overly bombastic horns. And just to keep things light and fluffy, Chris O'Donnell was hired to play Robin. Yep, it's starting to look like the '60s TV show all over again.Causing trouble for the dynamic duo this time around are The Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), two characters written and played with such gleeful mischievousness that it's hard to even take them seriously.To his credit, Kilmer approaches the material with all seriousness (aside from the occasionally bad dialog), and he makes for an entirely capable Batman. Also surprising is that this is the first film in the Batman franchise to spend any time focusing on the title character. Instead of an origin story or flashbacks, Bruce Wayne is dealing with his psychosis with the help of a distractingly beautiful shrink (Nicole Kidman).This is a film produced in the spirit of the '60s Adam West version, with an overall camp nature (both in tone, dialog and direction). It is such an about-face from the previous Burton efforts that at times it's hard to watch for many fans of the character (myself included). Even the film's more enjoyable aspects are drowned out by the ridiculous score and the many campy performances. What's frustrating is that instead of improving on the missteps of ""Batman Returns"", WB floored it in the wrong direction and opened a whole new set of problems. But believe it or not, Schumacher and Co. would crank the camp dial to MAX for their next installment, ""Batman and Robin"". That Warner Bros. didn't learn from the mistakes of the Superman franchise (and Batman would be similarly beaten into the ground) is irritating beyond belief.4/10",Batman Forever

But that doesn't mean this was a bad installment to the ""Batman"" series, it's actually very decent worth more than one look. We do have a new but every exceptional Batman, Val Kilmer, who has a tough role to fit into after the great performances Michael Keaton brought. Nicole Kidman plays Chase, a beautiful and intelligent scientist who has the hots for Batman more than Bruce, she does a great job and looks so sexy! Jim Carrey, the master of comedy, takes the role of The Riddler, only he can bring the true comic relief and was a great choice. Tommy Lee Jones, as Two Face, was also great and so believable as a scary villain. Last but not least, Chris O'donnel as the wimsical, but more serious than anything version of Robin. The dynamic duo are finally put together for this masterpiece of a sequel! Batman is now fighting Two Face, or Harvey Dent, who was brutally scarred on one side of his face in a court case of his when he was a lawyer. When he fails one night to successfully capture Two Face, he meets Dr. Chase Meridian, a beautiful scientist and journalist. She is just fascinated with him and it's almost love at first sight for her. Batman of course is falling for her, but is playing hard to get. When Bruce Wayne makes a move on her though, she accepts and they attend a charity circus together, they see the Flying Gracins, a family of flying acrobats, but when the party is interrupted by Two Face and he demands to find out the true identity of Batman otherwise he'll set off a bomb in the circus! When the Gracins try to stop it and Dick Gracin, the youngest flying member goes his separate way to stop it himself, the family is on top of some very high up beams and wire which Two Face stops them by shooting the wires causing the Gracins to fall down to their deaths in front of everyone. When Dick stops the bomb, he is too late to see his family lying dead on the floor.He comes to live with Bruce and wants revenge on Two Face and promises death and justice! It's not too soon that he discovers that Bruce is Batman and wants to be him at first, but then decides that he shouldn't take over but they should become partners! Batman refuses knowing that it's too dangerous; he continues his affair with Chase. But there is a new problem, an angry employee, Edward Nygmam, at Bruce's business now wants to destroy Batman and become evil! Who better to join up with than Two Face? He also has a machine that can read a person's mind and makes it tell the person's deepest darkest secrets. When Bruce comes to a party after Edward is successful in selling these machines, he tempts Bruce into the biggest machine of all and finds out what Bruce has been hiding for so long. When Batman and Chase are together, she confesses to Batman that she is now falling for Bruce. When she and Bruce have a get together, he wishes to tell her the truth, you know a little bit before this scene he said to Alfred ""I've never been in love before"", what happened to Vicki Vale and Catwoman? I always wondered that! But anyways, Two Face's gang kidnaps Chase and now Bruce must save her, but his bat cave has been destroyed by The Riddler! With the riddles that Edward sent to Bruce as clues, he and Alfred put everything together and know that it's not going to be easy to defeat this powerful team, that's where Dick comes in, or now known as Robin! Can the dynamic duo save Chase in time and save the world from getting their brains sucked into The Riddler's and can Robin get the revenge he's wanted for so long with Two Face?Batman Forever is a fantastic installation into the Batman series. I would highly recommend it! It's got action, romance, drama, comedy, and great sets! Among a fantastic soundtrack featuring U2 and Seal's famous ""Kiss from a Rose"". It's a good movie and should be seen by every Batman fan! 8/10",Batman Forever
33,blanbrn,"Schumacher takes a different direction not as dark or good, yet still an exciting and highly entertaining ""Batman"" film.",8,12 July 2008,"Starting with 1995's ""Batman Forever"" the series would change in a different direction with Tim Burton leaving the directors chair and out is Michael Keaton as ""Batman"". So enter Joel Schumacher as director and he stayed away from the dark and gloom that Burton mastered so well as his focus was more on action and centered towards family with the introduction of the ""Boy Wonder"" named ""Robin"". Now Val Kilmer is on board as ""Bruce Wayne/Batman"" and still even though not as good as Keaton still Kilmer gives a direct and good performance. Some of the better things about this bat installment is the action never really stops from the beginning and the villains were in top form and the performances given by both Jones and Carrey were highly memorable unlike ""The Joker and Penguin"" both ""Two Face"" and the ""Riddler"" were more serious and dangerous criminals who were once trusted humans their revenge nature made them so deadly you as the viewer don't find them as gross or monster like as the previous two bat villains. I know the introduction of ""Robin""(Chris O' Donnell) ""Batman's"" new sidekick to the film excited many yet the thrills and pleasure I found most rewarding from this installment was the love connection that ""Batman"" wanted to have with Gotham's new criminal profiler Dr. Chase Meridian(Nicole Kidman who gives a knockout and sexy performance). Still ""Batman"" is all about business as this film is so highly enjoyable with it's action you as the viewer can't forget it and it's a pleasure to view many times even though the dark direction is gone with Schumacher going in a more action and fast paced adventure route.

34,MovieAddict2016,Batman Temporarily...,5,19 February 2004,"It's sad to see a series wither away. First there was ""Batman,"" a fun film with a good director at the helm who portrayed Gotham City with just the right tone of darkness, ignoring the camp qualities of the aptly named television show of the 1960s that starred Adam West, and had also betrayed the comic's tone to go for full-out laughs.Then there came ""Batman Returns,"" an over-the-top sequel that had too many quirky qualities and dark traits for my own personal enjoyment.Then Michael Keaton and Tim Burton left the series so that Val Kilmer and Joel Schumacher could step in (Burton produced the third film but ignored the fourth altogether; WB is smart, the new Special Edition DVDs coming out exclude ""Batman and Robin,"" too). This essentially marked the downfall of a series many refer to as one of the most disappointing and ""in-between"" of all time.Val Kilmer is a good Batman, and I think everyone has to admit this. He is arguably the best Batman of them all--as much as I like Michael Keaton as an actor, many people were dissatisfied with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne on the whole, and George Clooney was just George Clooney in the fourth film.Kilmer displays a sort of repressed anger and rage and hatred for crime that is vital to the Batman character in the first place. He looks as though his mind is heavy and his soul depressed with the mess of the world--too bad the material can't support the depths of Bruce Wayne in this one.After Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) emerges from the underground of Gotham City and threatens peace in his own extravagant way, Bruce Wayne (Kilmer) puts on his cape and defends his beloved city--much to the chagrin of a new villain, The Riddler (Jim Carrey), who teams up with Two-Face and decides to hatch an elaborate plan to brainwash America using small TV boxes. (Symbolism? A bad matter for a film like ""Batman Forever"" to try and tackle.)Meanwhile, Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) tries to unearth the mystery of Batman, and a recently orphaned acrobat named Dick (Chris O'Donnell) comes to live with Bruce and vows to seek vengeance against his family's murderer: Two-Face. This is, as far as I know, pretty close to the comic books--but the outcome is at times quite disastrous.Chris O'Donnell, as Robin, is the film's weak link in terms of acting--he brings nothing memorable to his character and merely stumbles through the movie like a walking plank made of wood. His family of acrobats, clothed with the same design of Robin from the cult TV series, takes a plummet a few stories up after trying to save the day. He gets mad. But O'Donnell is too smarmy and smart-alecky to like. Please, get rid of this guy.Thanks to Joel Schumacher, this stands as one of the wackiest films of all time. I looked forward to it quite enthusiastically back in 1995, when the top-notch cast and extreme word-of-mouth seemed to hype up the film to a maximum extreme. The result was discouraging, and to this day the entire circus sequence is ingrained in my memory as one of the most OTT of all time.In some respects this could be called one of the worst films of all time. It's over-the-top, ridiculously extravagant and horribly directed by Schumacher--whose films are hit (""Falling Down,"" ""Phone Booth"") or miss (his second ""Batman"" movie). Here he's somewhere in between. The acting by Kilmer, Lee Jones, Kidman, and even Carrey is fine. The movie itself is just bad--and that's where it fails. But in terms of entertainment, this is easier to digest than the second movie. I prefer it, despite its flaws. And it isn't half as bad as ""Batman and Robin.""Trivia note: Michael Keaton was originally attached to this project with Rene Russo as his love interest. However, after meeting Schumacher and disagreeing with his vision for the series, he left the project and Russo was deemed ""too old"" for Kilmer.",Batman Forever
35,Rainey-Dawn,Not As Bad As The Critics Say,6,8 September 2021,"The film is not all that bad. Yes it has flaws and things that bothered me about it but overall it is an entertaining movie.Problems: 1) Sometimes there is too much brightness - too neon. 2) Batman nipples and butt - come on now, the batnipples are bad enough but the batbutt needed to go!! 3) Two-face acting too much like The Joker - since when did Harvey do all that mess in the comics? 4) Pink hair on the Riddler - that looked bad. 5) Sometimes looked like a cartoon. 6) Since when is a college aged adult a ward of the state? Referring to Bruce watching over Richard. 7) Too many explosions. 8) Jim Carrey's exaggerated overacting at times.What I did like about the film: The comic book look and colours - I dig on that. I liked the story for the most part. The introduction of Robin was an enjoyment to me. And the fact I was entertained overall watching this one. So it's not all that bad.6.5/10.",Batman Forever
36,disdressed12,i think it's much better than most people give it credit for,8,20 July 2007,"i'm not sure why so many people seem to have such a low opinion of this movie.for sure it's a departure from the first two,which were directed by Tim Burton.this time out,Joel Schumacher takes over the reins.obviously his style is different then Burton's but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.one big difference is the look of the film.it's much more colourful,vibrantly so.the tone isn't as dark,but the film to me has an even greater sense of tragedy than the two previous.we get more of a feel for how tortured Bruce Wayne(played by Val Kilmer) is.KIlmer is very effective in the dual role.he has a natural screen presence and a sense of authority about him.(possible minor spoiler ahead,maybe)he also gets a partner,who becomes Robin,which adds a new element,bringing out feelings of guilt in Bruce.The love interest(played by Nicole Kidman)in this installment is much more substantial as well,and i liked the romantic tension and interplay between Bruce/Batman and her.Kidman adds a touch of class to the proceedings,which says a lot because i am generally not a fan.The two main villains come in the form of Two-face, a homicidal split personality played by Tommy Lee Jones,and The Riddler,played by JIim Carrey.both seemed to have a lot of fun with their respective roles,really letting loose several times,which is fitting since this movie was much less restrained than one and two.there are more gadgets,and more flashy vehicles for Batman and later,Robin.i didn't really like the bat mobile in this one.to me it just seemed much too over the top.i don't feel that the character of Batman would actually have a vehicle show showy,even gaudy.but that's just my opinion.Batman changes costumes before the end of the movie,upgrading to something more like a cyborg.his first costume is not too bad,but this second one,although it looks nice,i didn't really see it.i found the colour much too light for the character.i did,however really like Robin's costume a lot.i think it was the great mix of colours.it just seemed right.this Batman movie was more action adventure and also fun to watch.I really liked Bruce's evolution.he really grows as a person. i think it seems natural.Bruce/Batman is also shown too have a sense of humour,which really works.overall,i don't think i like it as much as the first two.i don't think it has the same impact.but there are many more good things about it than bad.i give ""Batman Forever"" a strong 8/10",Batman Forever
37,KineticSeoul,The Bat suit with nipples...,5,10 July 2012,"What this is, is a very slight sequel to Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"" but it's mostly a reboot. It has few of the same actors from the previous Batman movies such as for Commissioner Gordon and Alred. But this movie takes place in a more modernized version of Gotham city and doesn't have that Tim Burton vibe to it anymore. When I first saw this movie as a kid at a mall when it first came out in theaters with my older cousins. I thought this movie was great and found it entertaining. So for when it came out it was probably a decent movie for youths, but watching it now as an adult there is just way too many flaws with this flick. Joel Schumacher just doesn't know Batman all that much. And it clearly shows with the villains, they are just wacky and just way over the top. It was like they both were trying there best to impersonate Jack Nicholson's Joker. All the actors and actress in this were in there prime when this flick came out but they just didn't know the Batman universe all that well. I mean it doesn't have to stick very close to the comics but it sometimes didn't seem like a Batman movie cause certain things are off. You probably won't notice certain flaws in this as a kid but as and adult you pick up on certain things. Jim Carrey had potential to be a good Edward Nigma aka The Riddler but he just didn't act like the Riddler all that much. His portrayal was just too over the top and he seemed to be trying way too much to stand out, only it just didn't work. Yeah he has obsession with riddles and puzzles in this but seem to lack logic and didn't have that cool mischievous and mysterious element to him. Instead he is a very obnoxious character that is bonkers and jumping off the wall. It's basically just Jim Carrey being over the top and acting like Jim Carrey in a lot of his movies. Yeah there are version of the Riddler that is just acts plain crazy, not as much as this one though. But the methodical and yet mischievous representation of the Riddler is still the best one in my opinion. Which was in the comic books and even in the animated series. That is what the Riddler is a methodical villain that really really does his planning and scheming. Tommy Lee Jones version of Harvey Dent aka Two Face was the worst though. Besides the half melted face and a coin the guy was nothing like two face. Tommy Lee Jones probably didn't know Two Face but he sure didn't do his research either. He just comes off as another Joker impersonator, Cesar Romero's version of Joker to be exact. But the director didn't know the demeanor and essence of certain comic book characters so not everything is to blame for these actors. Val Kilmer however is passable as Bruce Wayne and looked the part as well. Micheal Keaton is still the better Batman though. I liked how they didn't portray Batman and Bruce Wayne as a boyscout cause he isn't and Val Kilmer did this well with his cold and serious and yet charismatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne. This is probably the first movie I seen with Nicole Kidman and she sure was in her prime in this as well. Not talking about her acting wise but when it comes to her look anyways. Even if her role isn't major to the story at least there was some eye candy that didn't really add or necessarily take away from this movie. She is basically a more forward version of Vicki Vale(Kim Basinger). And has two love interest, well it can be one as well. Finally when it comes to Robin played by Chris O'Donnell, he was decent but I wasn't a big Robin fan but his presence in this is alright. Kinda gets annoying sometimes but this portrayal of Dick Grayson aka Robin but sorta spot on. Nothing outstanding but it was good. No Robin from ""Teen Titans"" that is for sure. All the actors in this movie had potential with the roles they were given, but just didn't know how to portray these comic book characters. Anyways this movie seem to be going in a pop-culture style or commercial direction for Batman that Tim Burton claim to not be a part of for his version of Batman. The action in this movie is just silly like your watching a Saturday morning cartoon. I still give this movie a 6, maybe I am being a bit unfair but this movie had a part during my childhood. Not a big one but a part of it and it's still sort of nostalgic. Probably because this might be the first live action superhero movie I have ever seen. Also the theme song to this is no Danny Elfman's theme song to Batman but this one is still good. Not memorable but it fits well as a Batman theme song.5.5/10",Batman Forever
38,OllieSuave-007,Riddle me this.....,8,14 June 2007,"A contrast from Batman Returns, this film has Joel Schumacher at the director's chair. He gave us a more colorful and comic book setting in the movie. The story was pretty compelling, pitting Batman against Two-Face and the Riddler. Two-Face believed Batman was responsible for his disfigurement and the Riddler wants to drain all of Gotham citizens' brain cells so he could steal valuable information. In the mix is the sexy Dr. Chase Meredian (Nicole Kidman) and Dick Grayson/Robin (Chris O'Donnell), playing Batman's first partner-in-crime. We see Bruce Wayne comparing his past life with Dick Grayson's present, who has himself experienced a tragedy. Bruce comes in terms of his alter-ego and realizes that he is destined to be Batman. He, therefore, reaches out to Dick, who wants to make up the mishaps in his past and thus fights crime alongside Batman as Robin. Both Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell did great in their respectable roles. As did Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey in their roles as Two-Face and the Riddler-both psychotic and out-of-this-world. Nicold Kidman adds onto the drama and had good comprehension with Batman, serving has his new love interest. Good music score by Elliot Goldenthal as well. I like his new Batman theme.Overall, not a bad movie with a serviceable story, though a few scenes were a little too campy, reminding you of the 1960s Batman series. The plus side is that this movie has an all-star cast: Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, Pat Hingle, Michael Gough and Drew Barrymore.Grade B",Batman Forever

40,FeastMode,my notes,4,25 June 2019,"Bad. There was some that was better than the first two by Tim Burton, and also some that was worse. the action sequences were better in this newer movie, although some were still very unrealistic. There was actually fighting! yay! some real choreographed fight scenes although nothing special. but it was like watching the raid redemption compared to the first two. There weren't nearly as many dumb things as in the first two but the things that were dumb, oh my lord. about 5 parts where I burst out laughing. There was a part where he was putting on the new bat suit and they showed a bunch of different parts including a shot at his butt . I couldn't believe it. the dialogue was horrendous. I didn't like the score and it seemed overdramatic at times. Val Kilmer was a terrible choice as Batman, although I didn't like Keaton either. Some of the other acting was actually great. Jim Carrey as the Riddler was AMAZING. he was so convincing and made me love his character. awesome acting, and he looked perfect as a comic book villain. Tommy Lee Jones was great as two face, although I didn't really like the character and what he did, but that's more on the script than him. Nicole Kidman was good too (about 3 viewings)",Batman Forever
41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,This is where it all went wrong...,4,30 June 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Can't Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Bruce Wayne (a.k.a. Batman) has a new nemesis in the shape of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) a homicidal psychopath who was once a noble lawyer, only for his face and mind to be hideously deformed after a substance was thrown over him in a courtroom. But he's soon to be joined by another: The Riddler (Jim Carrey) who was a former scientist at Wayne Enterprises and had his ideas rejected by those in power. Whilst dealing with all of this, he entertains a romance with the beautiful psychologist Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and takes a boy acrobat under his wing whose family were murdered in a hesit by Two-Face, who will come to be known as Robin, the fateful sidekick...In my Batman Begins review, I stated how it was 'Batman for a new generation.' Yet ten years ago I suppose you could say the same thing was happening to the Batman franchise. It was a whole new Batman, with a lighter, sillier, more family friendly appeal to it, with a new actor playing Batman in the shape of Val Kilmer and a new hack director in the shape of Joel Schumacher, after Tim Burton had left to pursue greater things such as The Nightmare Before Christmas (although he does take over producing duties here.) I suppose it is all really a question of whether you prefer the dark or the light versions of Batman. But I know which camp I'm settled in.There is a lot of light and flashy effects in this one, but it is completely empty. The story is uninvolving, the characters naff and the acting poor. For starters, there's the impossibly wooden O' Donnell, who wouldn't go on to improve in any of his future projects and is at his worst here, and also in one scene zooms down a road in the Batmobile (which he's souped up!) to which a flock of girls crowd round it, which I think played a part in kick-starting the whole vacuous 'chav' craze, as well as Batman's subliminal messaging at the beginning with the line 'it's the car, right, chicks dig the car', when in fact ten years later, a whole string of Brian Harvey-alikes would be 'digging' the car. In the villain roles, Carrey can either make you laugh with his manic performances or he can severely get on your nerves, and that's definitely the case here and Jones can play a great villain and is trying his best here, but it's all just wasted on him. Kidman is very sexy as the love interest, but doesn't manage to contribute anything other than that. As Batman, I suppose Kilmer doesn't do anything Keaton didn't do but, like I said, I'll stay a Keaton man...I suppose a lot of it really depends on whether you're a dark Batman fan or a light Batman fan and I suppose Returns might just hold a bit of sentimental value for me, but, all the same, hats off to this, my personal least favourite of the series. **",Batman Forever
42,ElMaruecan82,"Some good chemistry in the film, ruined by too campy over-the-top villains",6,11 August 2017,"""Batman Forever"" has all the makings of a great superhero film, the costume design are top notch, Gotham City looks great and the special effects never betray the fact that this was released in 1995, and I particularly adored the moment where the Bat-Signal became the dot under the Riddler's interrogation mark, all in flashy green. But I can also use a still frame of that moment to describe my general puzzlement toward the film. It's not bad enough to deserve a severe bashing but it's one of these cases where a film comes so close to being great that your disappointment almost amplifies the flaws. I could say that at least, this is no ""Batman & Robin"" but that wouldn't say much, would it? So, Burton became the producer and Joel Schumacher, although in another league of filmmaking, injected something fresh and unprecedented in a franchise that was getting maybe too dark and too gloomy for its own good. Batman is no jovial fellow but the problem when you overplay the noir tone is that you create a world where the notion of 'heroism' is totally relative. And when someone goes to such extents to save the world from crime, having to wear all these heavy costumes, and engineering the most sophisticated weapons, you've got to accept that there are positive motives behind it. At the end of ""Batman Returns"", I felt quite depressed, this was a movie where the villains were as misfit as the 'hero' and needed a great deal of psychotherapy. ""Batman Forever"" tends to get to the original format with a clearly defined hero and villain and still maintain a balanced psychological approach to Bruce Wayne. It's not all flash and no substance.And another mistake it doesn't commit is to overflow the film with villains like ""Returns"", this time, there are two bad guys, they're not on the same level than Joker, but together, they form a pair that is rather entertaining although a bit redundant, there's the maniac Harvey Dent two-Face played by Tommy Lee Jones and Edward Nygma aka the Riddler, a scientist played by Jim Carrey. They form a rather interesting duo except for one thing: they're equally crazy, and it's like each one tries to top the other, they're like the human versions of ""The Lion King"" hyenas or the weasels from ""Who framed Roger Rabbi"". On the other hand, Val Kilmer (a decent Batman) plays a low-key Bruce Wayne who meets journalist Chase Meredian (Nicole Kidman) with and without the costume. Well, she's obviously attracted by his leather counterpart but from his interactions, you can tell he's tempted to unveil a few of his secrets, the interactions work and prove that there's not a Batman movie with a good romantic love interest.But while Serena Kyle was also enigmatic on her own right and kind of stole Batman's thunder, Chase is that little anchor to Batman's status as a hero, even hinting at some sexual aspects of Batman, the movie generally pretends to ignore, there's a sort of self-awareness to appreciate in the film. Overall, I loved how it tried some new things while respecting a form of continuity with the previous Batman, and that includes another great performance from Michael Gough as Alfred. I guess it also gets right the encounter with Dick Grayson aka future Robin in a circus scene that has all the futuristic and baroque visuals you expect from a Batman film, spicing up the movie with a new young and rebellious protagonist who's the tumultuous Yin to Batman's yang. The Freudian undertones are subdued; we know there's something of a surrogate father in Batman with Robin, while he's also hooked to the memories of his parents' death and the conviction that he killed them somehow.But the film seems always at the edge of reaching something powerful without really getting to it, and I guess the blame is on the overuse of special effects and the villains that never find the right note. When Bruce and Grace's interview were disrupted by their entrance, I was bothered too and I didn't really care for the part where Riddler was throwing explosive balls. Sure the pyrotechnics did justice to the film's budget, but did it have more to prove on a less visual level? I seriously wish it would have tried to explore more in depth the personality of ""Batman"", especially from the perspective of a journalist. That's what makes ""Batman Forever"" a frustrating experience, moments of brilliance ruined by unexpected plot contrivances and too flashy visuals thrown at our faces.I will never understand what the purpose of that close-up on Batman rubber buttocks was supposed to inspire, what the writers thought when Grace came up with such a corny line as ""Batman will come to rescue me"" and the two villains venture so many times in cartoons' territory, especially with Carrey channeling both the Mask and Ace Ventura, that you have the feeling Bruce Wayne is really lost, as the only realistic man, caught in a live-action cartoon. Joel Schumacher is no untalented director, he got the budget, the right casting and the special effects but for some reason, he didn't create the right balance between the hero and villains' personality, so that the film often falls in the obvious trap and while being slightly better than ""Batman Returns"" never reaches the level of ""Batman"", it's a mixed bag, but with a few enjoyable moments.Again, it plays many leagues above ""Batman & Robin"", which explains why they went for a fourth movie, you know, the one too many.",Batman Forever
43,Cineanalyst,Batty,3,16 December 2020,"At one point, Jim Carrey's Riddler inquires, ""Was that over the top? I can never tell."" In short, yes, that was over the top; this entire cartoon circus of a Batman franchise installment is gaudy. Heck, there's even a circus in it. Plus, it begins with an unfunny joke of Batman stating that he'll get drive-thru for dinner and ends with a shot of his posterior as he suits up as the caped crusader one last time in this wretched flick. To be fair, Tim Burton's two prior Batman films were quite goofy, too, including grotesque villains and their hordes of minions executing absurdly convoluted schemes as they squared off against a billionaire who dresses up like a bat and spruces up all of his transportation and gizmos to look equally batty in order to punch thugs throughout the streets of Gotham. But, geesh, the villains of ""Batman Forever"" make Jack Nicholson's inordinate Joker look restrained or penguins strapped with rockets seem sensible by comparison... well, almost.This sort of juvenile inanity was easier to tolerate in Burton's ""Batman Returns"" (1992) because it incorporated its darkly sinister production design into the narrative and the three main characters all reflected that. Largely, it did so through the framework of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" which the film specifically referenced, with Batman and Catwoman wearing masks while the Penguin lived in the subterranean sewer like the Phantom to the opera of political speeches above that was Gotham and while Batman emerged from his batcave to try to save the soul of Catwoman, its femme fatale version of Christine from the novel by Gaston Leroux. Joel Schumacher continues his predecessor's dualism theme--as overly evident in Two Face's appearance, but also extending to the shrink (named ""Chase Meridian"" of all things--get it?) who dates Bruce Wayne but has the hots for Batsy--but ""Batman Forever"" largely abandons integrating the duality with the narrative or production design in any sophisticated way. Instead, we get a colorful cartoon full of colorful cartoon characters, but mostly just a monotonously-teetering camera with an on-again, off-again relationship with canted angles. Schumacher and company must've thought their audience as passive as the victims of E. Ngyma's (I understand this one's from the comics, but, oh, these names) brainwave boob-tube device to offer up this ostentatious twaddle.Less than a decade later, Schumacher would actually ravage ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" too.

Take Robin for example, he had a stupid stud on him, yes it was meant to look cool on him but really it didn't suit him as a hero at all. I mean really, this is meant to be a well known superhero movie not a secondary school teenage based movie. Now we move onto Nicole Kidman's character Dr. Chase Meridian, I think she was way over the top at being too flirty and saucy with Batman.

I don't think it was have improved it much though. They could have lined this film in gold and it's still wouldn't be worth it's weight.

49,Bored_Dragon,"Good, but not great",7,18 October 2017,"When it comes to picture and sound, third part of Batman series stands shoulder to shoulder with first two, but at the same time it is too frivolous. Story is all right, it is interesting and holds attention. Characters are two-dimensional, which is flaw, but not too big considering that it's superhero comic adaptation. But this is Batman, so there should be a bit more depth. Weakest spot of this movie, in my opinion, is cast. I really have nothing against Kilmer, but he is bad choice for this role, especially Bruce Wayne part of it. Riddler is supposed to be comic relief, I presume, but he has too much space in this flick and takes over position of main villain, and for that he is too ridiculous. Carrey simply should not be in Batman movie. His overacting and mop and mow is simply too much. It's terribly irritating and it spoiled overall impression of the movie. That kind of clowning is acceptable in Mask and similar comedies, but Batman is not and should not be a comedy. At the other hand, Jones, who should be main villain and whose character has dark depth, here it's not shown serious enough and he stays in shadow of the Riddler. Highlights are Chris O'Donnell, whose character is well written and performed, and Nicole Kidman, who's always welcome spice in any movie. I'm not disappointed, but it could have been done much much better.7/10",Batman Forever
50,The-Sarkologist,This is just plain woeful,5,14 October 2011,"The first comment that I must make about this movie is that Jim Carey really does overact. Unfortunately is destroys the character and the movie along with it. The second comment is that Joel Schumacher really does not get the Gothic sense that Tim Burton brought out in the first two movies. Schumacher tries to make it Gothic but fails constantly with lines like (no thankyou, I will get drive through). The final comment I must make is that Val Kilmer doesn't do that good a job at Batman.In this installment of the Batman epic, Two-face (Tommy Lee Jones), a lawyer who was sprayed with acid by a gang boss leaving half of his face mutilated, is rampaging around Gotham City. At the same time, a mad scientist, Edward Nigma (Jim Carey) is developing a machine to transmit television waves straight into the brain. Bruce Wayne, his boss, rejects the idea and Nigma kills his supervisor and finishes the machine himself. He then makes himself the Riddler and creates a lair in which everybody's brain waves are siphoned to him.As with the previous movies, this movie deals with the dual personalities. We have Bruce Wayne, the philanthropic millionaire, and Batman, the dark crime fighter. Wayne is struggling with his dark side, and trying to erase a past that has haunted him since he was a kid. The strange thing about this movie is that it seems to have forgotten that the Joker killed his parents.What Batman forever does is that it builds on this dual theme. We have the entrance of Robin (Chris O'Donald) whose parents are murdered by Two Face and he seeks revenge. Thus Batman is trying to tell him what revenge will get him, while Robin is ignoring him and seeking to avenge his parent's death. Then we have Two Face, whose face confronts us with this dual personality. Everything about Two Face is double – a black side and a white side. Then there is Edward Nigma, alias the Riddler. Everybody here takes on the double personality. What is more, Doctor Meridian Chase (Nicole Kidman) comes into the movie to study this dual personality, but moreso concentrates upon Batman.I actually think Michael Keaton played a much better Batman than did Val Kilmer – and George Clooney was okay as well. I find that this movie has suffered a severe drop from the previous Batman movies, and it doesn't seem to pick up in the next one. At first I thought it was great, but upon seeing it a second time, I realised that the script was bad and that the pain and hurt that permeates through the first two movies, is destroyed by a more comic part to it. The problem is that Shumacher still tries to push a dark side while trying to retain a cheerful element, and as such I think the movie collapses.",Batman Forever

And Val K.i.l.m.e.r was great as Batman Michael Keaton was also great. Nicole K.i.d.m.a.n was in the movie to. She is a very good actress. Very pretty woman to. This is better then the last 3 Batman movies. If you don't agree that's o.k. If your mad about it grow up you pooh pooh heads. This is a great movie. Great acting. Great story line.

54,redryan64,A Change of Captains and a slight Course Correction in BATMAN FOREVER lightens up the Franchise from the Gross predecessor!,7,29 April 2008,"In many respects, the changes displayed in the succession of BATMAN RETURNS (Warner Brothers/Polygram Pictures, 1992) to BATMAN FOREVER (Warner Brothers/Polygram, 1995) were a real improvement. First of all, the dismissal of Tim Burton for Joel Schumacher had to be done; for after Mr. Burton's fast start in giving us a fine, dark representation of a grim, shadowy and avenging vigilante of the night in the initial BATMAN (Warner Brothers/Polygram, 1989); he gave us the extremely pessimistic and outright depressing BATMAN RETURNS.From starting out with a great and exciting, though flawed origin story* in BATMAN, which at long last gave the public Mr. Jack Nicholson in his interpretation of The Joker, Burton's next entry with a some what lycanthropic Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and a gross, grotesque and totally depressing Penguin (Danny Divito) in a one picture twin-bill of Batman enemies. That would seem to have established this ""Tag-Team mentality in the Batman screen stories; as this was followed up with our victim today in BATMAN FOREVER with the troublesome twosome of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddle (Jim Carrey). The ultimate installment, BATMAN AND ROBIN (Warners/Polygram, 1997) featured Mr. Freeze (Arnold ""the Gubernator"" Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) vs. the series # 3 Caped Crusader in George Clooney.But now back to BATMAN FOREVER; which is today's subject for our ""Roast."" AS previously stated, the film was a sort of improvement over the previous outing. The two sub-plots were manned by two very different villains; both of whom cast long shadows in the entire overall picture of the Batman Saga. Former D.A. Harvey Dent aka ""Two-Face"" made a handful of appearances in the early 1940's, and was referred to many times, mainly in depiction of a huge ""Two-Face"" replica coin in the Batcave.After a sort of Luke-warm origin story in a 1948 Batman Story in Detective Comics Number 160, the Riddler (born Edward Nigma), only made one more appearance prior to the big ""New Look"" Batman revamp of 1964; after which he made plenty of appearances, culminating with the great and immortal portrayal of Riddler by the late Frank Gorshin on the BATMAN TV Series.** In BATMAN FOREVER, some heretofore unused aspects of the bad-guys were incorporated into the stories in order to give some more substance and density to the proceedings. It's sort of like making the broth of your soup thicker by using milk, flour and raw eggs into the soup. (Ummmm, ummmmm! Today was a real soup day in Chicago with temps in the 30's on the penultimate day of April.) The Riddler's story gains strength, length and gravitas (hey I just used that word for the first time!) by way of making Riddler some half-fast inventor at Wayne Enterprises working on some dream altering machine.The movie, while being far from a masterpiece, is amusing, entertaining and relatively close to being a comics-type story. The lack of pretension makes for a fine escapist 2 hours or so well spent.But in getting down to my pet peeve; being the unnecessary alteration of previously established comics ""fact"". In this case, it is in relation to the birth name of Riddler. The Camp TV Series never once made mention of it; even though the very name, both given name and surname together, were responsible for his impulse of giving clues about his capers to his adversaries (Batman & Robin) .The birth name for the Riddler is Edward Nigma. When abbreviated using the first initial of E, it becomes, E.Nigma; with an enigma being something that is a truly puzzling situation. For some reason, the production crew chose to change the spelling from E. Nigma to E. Nymga. Why, you ask? We do have a theory.We think that in print, E. Nigma is too closely resembling to the ""N"" word. Just think about it. It's just another case of Political Correctness' and fear of being criticized having too much influence over too many a victim.NOTE: * The story finely incorporates elements of both the first Joker story from Batman Comics No. 1 and the Joker origin some years later. And yet, they try to make the killer one young, sadistic thug, Jack Napier (the future Joker!!) as being the murderer of the Waynes. Any aficionado of Batman knows that the killer was small timer street thug, Joe Chill.NOTE: ** We have a theory about the sudden rise in Riddler's Stock was due to his resemblance to Mr. Frank Gorshin; who was ever so popular then. Our guess is that in doing preparational research for the BATMAN TV Series, someone on the production team spotted the character in Comic Books File Copies in the D.C. Comics Editorial Offices, brought it to his superior's attention, and hence we had the same Bat Time, same Bat-History.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",Batman Forever
55,zkonedog,Superior Acting Saves Otherwise Bad Film,5,11 March 2017,"After watching just the first few minutes of this film by Joel Schumacher, it immediately becomes clear that this is nothing like the original two movies...and not in a good way.While the first two films were true to the interpretation of the Batman character as dark, brooding, and rather violent in nature (not at all like Superman, for example), Schumacher opts for a flashy, James Bond-like approach to the franchise, where every prop is equipped with flashing or glowing lights, bat-gadgets are used at a frenetic pace, and one-line quips are common fare. While good for a few shallow laughs, this approach to the Batman character marked the beginning of the end (until Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"") for the Batman franchise. Essentially, Batman can only survive with a ""good guy"" interpretation for so long before he strays too far from his original character intent.What makes this movie still a very watchable film, however, is the acting of Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler. Though Two-Face's background is hardly touched on at all (a major mistake), he is still an interesting character, as Jones hams up his dual personality at every opportunity. The same goes for the insanely funny Jim Carrey...The Riddler's backstory exists but is rather dumb, but Carrey still provides a hilarious character out of almost nothing to work with.Finally, the introduction of Robin onto the scene also works in this film, as an emotional backstory (essential for any Batman movie character) is included for him.Overall, this film strays the Batman franchise down the wrong path, but ultimately ends up watchable due to its tremendous acting. If only the succeeding film could have been so lucky...",Batman Forever
56,johnnyboyz,"Batman for box-office potential, more than anything; which in turn opens up some problems linked to villains and love interests.",5,6 September 2009,"One thing Batman Forever might act as a wonderful example of, is how different directors can take what is essentially the same source material and transform it; or make it 'their own', when it comes to putting it up there on a screen. But this is the only time anyone should apply the word 'wonderful' when talking of Batman Forever as in this case, the translation is one that is certainly a lot more colourful, but in equal regard – one that is certainly more dull. The translation isn't quite limited to expressionistic-inspired sets and mise-en-scene, or lack of, but additionally the attitudes towards the female characters and the focus on the villains being of a variety that leads them to become scarred and deranged, rather than naturally so.I still maintain that Burton's 'Returns' in the best Batman film; a film that balances a struggling lead with a naturally deformed and deranged villain whom is placed on a career ladder that will ultimately lead to power by way of politics. The film systematically taps into what is a public obsession for a 'hero' of the tragic variety, or a celebrity figure in which to lead them out of, what they perceive to be, a mire of some sort that they're in. Batman Forever's villains are of your bog-standard, sadistic, fast-tracked sort that are scarred in a physical sense but require everything to be rosy before they almost instantly turn to homicidal behaviour. You'll remember that Returns' chief antagonist, The Penguin, was initially embraced by the people of Gotham in what was a calm and methodical approach to a superhero film on Burton's behalf as this creature mingled with the inhabitants; grew more powerful in the process and thus established a position of power of our hero Batman. In Forever, the bad-guys are practically screaming and shouting from the off – promising noise, carnage and mayhem wherever and whenever possible in what is a tired display.The film has a certain compulsion to it; a certain and distracting sense of the obligatory. We never really feel as if our leads will be hurt, or are in much peril and there's never really a sense Batman could be injured or killed; the antagonists, at least one of them, is going for the very basic goal of control, manipulation and possession of the people in the city before eyeing the actual city itself as one big prize. So there's nothing new there and for all the glitz, colour and energy, it's actually quite sad to see the film eventually delve into a final act that sees a damsel in distress, quite literally locked in a tower, require rescuing from her (dark) knight in (shining?) armour.In regards to the woman of the piece, the supposed love interest for Batman, it is Nicole Kidman that plays Chase Meridian, a doctor: an educated and somewhat prestigious person whom embodies, or should embody, intellect and independence. Her strong and independent character is, early on, demonstrated in her office as she boxes a punch-bag, thus establishing a degree of 'hard-bodiedness' to her character. The trouble is, she doesn't. She's one of the loosest female psychologists that's probably ever been put to screen, and comes complete with some terrible, flirtatious lines of dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in a low-rent, erotic thriller. Upon meeting her for the first time, Jim Carrey's Edward Nygma exclaims what a 'pursuit' she must be, poking fun at her name 'Chase', but that's exactly the problem; she's nothing more than a chase; a 'pursuit'; a prize; ultimately, a trophy partner.If Selena Kyle, in the previous entry, went from rounded; plain and somewhat submissive secretary in the male-driven world of business, enterprising and globalisation, to the lone; independent; dominant and powerful Catwoman, then Chase goes in the opposite direction. She begins somewhat smart, before gradually falling to the level in which she exists purely so that she can look good and be rescued. There is one point, very early on, in which Chase references Catwoman in a dialogue exchange with Batman. She states that perhaps he'd take to her more if she were dressed in vinyl and came equipped with a whip, in what is a clear homage. The trouble is, Catwoman's utilisation of these aspects of mise-en-scene, in her costume and props respectively, helped define both her identity and characteristics; with Chase Meridian in Batman Forever; it's a leery, sexually-driven and somewhat pathetic suggestion which serves as nothing, bar a means to 'satisfy' the man she's got her eye on.The film details Nygma's disgruntled descent into madness within a capitalist driven and increasingly high pressured lifestyle reasonably well; taking time to document his growing interest in homicidal activity as he gleefully observes the circus hijack-come-massacre on partner-in-crime-to-be Two Face's (Lee-Jones) behalf, while balancing the invention he's made that might double up as an allegory for what happens when advanced and powerful weapons fall into the wrong hands.But everything is punctuated by annoying tidbits of this and that. Remember in 2008's The Dark Knight when Michael Caine, playing Alfred, states some clap-trap about how, years ago, when he was in the army and based in Burma, he once had to destroy a large patch of vegetation purely to catch a jewel thief; enforcing the ideology that in order to stop destruction and wrong-doing, sometimes caution must thrown to the wind in the process. Well, these sorts of annoying moral-boosting-speeches-come-pit-stops seem to have been around longer than I thought, as we learn in Batman Forever that ""Broken wings mend"" and that ""Robin will fly again"" following near-death experiences at the hands of Two Face, and everyone needs geeing up. The series went on to hit a critical all-time low before branching out into a box-office all-time high. In regards to the franchise, I'll stick with my 'Returns' and let everyone else get on with what they feel as if they're supposed to enjoy.",Batman Forever
57,filipemanuelneto,Absolute rubbish,2,26 March 2016,"This film is a continuation of the two ""Batman"" movies previously made and directed by Tim Burton at the turn of the eighties to the nineties. This time, who directs the freak-show is Joel Schumacher, with the participation of Val Kilmer (in the lead role), Tommy Lee Jones (Two-Face), Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase) and Jim Carrey (Riddler). If Burton's movies exaggerated the inability to show reality, the films directed by Schumacher show a reality that seems drenched in ecstasy and amphetamines. But the fault is not only the director, decidedly outdated, but also the absolutely miserable script, an abominable patchwork written by different hands. In fact, the actors cannot be blamed for the waste that this movie is. They had already given (and continued to give) evidences of their great talent in other films, and I'm sure they gave the best of themselves in this one too. As used to say a Portuguese actor named Nicolau Breyner (totally unknown to those who have never seen Portuguese cinema), ""is not because the work is bad that no longer deserves my total commitment."" Unfortunately for the actors in this film, the work was bad. Lack of realism, scenery and costumes coming out of the imagination of a user of psychedelics, use and abuse of stereotypes are just some of the mistakes that the film will commit, frame after frame. Did it have something good? Yes. The first is that the film has an end; the second is the light social criticism made with the character Riddle, who uses television as a mass mental control, a maneuver that almost approximates with our reality, of current mass media.So, Batman fans, beware: stay prudently far away from this film.",Batman Forever
58,TheMovieDiorama,Batman Forever is a puzzling riddle wrapped in a schlocky superhero enigma.,4,5 May 2019,"Burton has moved on, only labelling himself as a producer. The continuity has been reset. Keaton is no longer ""The Bat"". There was only one director that could transform a successfully tragic tone into a camp reminiscence of West's 60s era. Joel Schumacher. An amateur that I strongly dislike, mainly due to his poor directorial efforts, who would send this franchise down the path of recklessness. Thanks Joel! Batman is tasked in stopping the crazed genius Edward Nygma from extrapolating brainwaves from individuals who purchased his new television technology, becoming the ""smartest carbon life form in Gotham"". Meanwhile, Two-Face wants to kill Batman, so nothing new there.Now, given that Schumacher smacked his hands all over this instalment, I was expecting the very worst. I'm talking 'Batman & Robin' level of idiocy. Much to my surprise, the characters and screenplay were much more tolerable in this chapter. However do not mistake my unexpected shock as optimism, for this is still a bad film in many ways. I have no quarrels with the overall story. Its goofiness and absence of thematic purpose harks back to the early comic books where Batman would just simply stop the villain from taking over the world. There is a slight commentary on the increased usage of televisions and how susceptible audiences are, but this is merely an inadvertent afterthought.Where I do take issue is how the story is executed. Schumacher is unable to balance all of the characters into one cohesive film. The Riddler and Two-Face are developed enough, with their partnership coming from a mutual agreement. Conversely, Batman and his new found Robin were not developed at all. The chemistry was non-existent and whenever the story is focused on Dick's stupid shenanigans, the pace comes to a halt. It's never interesting.There were also a few miscellaneous scenes that made me exclaim how dumb the screenplay was. Riddle me this, Batman. How is it that you couldn't work out who was sending you all those riddles until the very last minute, yet the excessive use of green matched the sudden rise of Nygmatech? I mean, I'm no detective, but it was painfully obvious. A simple revelation, yet badly executed.Not as bad as some the performances though. Kidman acting as Batman's love interest and O'Donnell as his sidekick were excruciatingly horrendous, with the former having no expressive emotions and the latter just unable to act. Kilmer as the titular superhero has the unfortunate outcome of being half decent. As Batman, his physical prowess within the bulky suit was pretty decent. As Bruce Wayne? Yikes! Terrible in every sense. Again, emotionless right from the start, even with his line delivery. Jones as Two-Face was infectiously enjoyable, just nice to see him not play the typical grumpy sheriff. Carrey provides much of the film's memorability and laughs as The Riddler. However, his portrayal of this villain was ridiculously goofy, and unfortunately all I saw was Jim Carrey instead of The Riddler. Should've been more restrained and less exhausting. Although seeing him in a tight sparkly leotard with pink hair was a sight to behold!Schumacher's direction is something of an enigma itself. I shan't list all of the issues, otherwise we would be here all day. It's worth mentioning how many angled shots there were. Directors who excessively use this technique, usually don't know what they are doing and attempt to masquerade their downfalls with ""artsy"" Dutch angles. In actual fact, it's nauseating and loses the grand aesthetic appeal from the production design. I mean, Gotham looks absolutely fantastic. But you have to tilt your head constantly to truly take it all in. Be warned, you may get neck pains. The final showdown was a letdown and the stakes weren't really boiling, only just simmering.Batman Forever may not be the ""punny"" mess that its sequel would become, but you can clearly see the substantial downward step from previous instalments. It's camp, goofy and enjoyably bad. Yet it is just that, bad. A conundrum that not even The Riddler could solve.",Batman Forever

62,Anonymous_Maxine,And we have a comedy,8,25 October 2004,"At the time Batman Forever was released I think I was in the height of my Jim-Carry fanatic days, which explains why I was so fixated on his performance in the movie but begs the question of why I never bothered to see the film until yesterday, almost a decade after it was originally released. At any rate, I continue to be impressed with the powerful casts that these Batman films generate, even Batman Begins, set to release next year, has such heavyweights as Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson. Since Batman Returns was not exactly greeted with open arms by the Burton-loving public, I'm glad to see that this franchise is still making some pretty big splashes.Oddly enough, since I am a huge fan of Tommy Lee Jones, I was not particularly impressed with his performance. I guess his character in Under Siege is about as over-the-top as I like to see him go as a bad guy, and needless to say, Two-Face is WAY more over the top than the curiously named William Stranix. Tommy Lee Jones generally plays characters relentlessly after some truth, whether it be the massive cliché of world domination, as in the case here in Batman Forever (okay, GOTHAM domination, but keep in mind that in the Batman series, Gotham City is a planet in itself, like Detroit in the RoboCop movies) or, more commonly, justice, as in The Fugitive, The Client, Rules of Engagement, even The Missing and The Hunted, to a certain extent. In Batman Forever, he's insane, and despite his energy and his speed as an actor, he doesn't do this kind of crazy very well.Jim Carrey, on the other hand, I can't say enough about. He plays exactly the same geek that Michelle Pfeiffer played in Batman Returns and exactly the same geek that Uma Thurman will play in Batman & Robin, but his portrayal of The Riddler is one of those rare instances where it seems that the character was originally invented for a movie to be made just so that this one actor can play that role. He is provided lines that allow him to stretch his considerably stretchable face ('What a RUSH!') as well as some that allow him to do some of his slapstick stand-up comedy ('A flock of freakin' Freuds!'). Sure, he has a long way to go before The Truman Show and the spectacular but massively overlooked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but I can't help thinking that it's a testament to his acting skills that he can be so funny in a movie and yet provide a better villain than Tommy Lee Jones did, and Jones' character tried to burn Batman in a giant capsule filled with acid.I like Val Kilmer as Batman, but he is too much of a subtle actor to play an action hero. He's always got a lot going on beneath the surface in his roles, but all too often those things tend to be not so positive (see Tombstone and The Saint). Nevertheless, he fills the Batsuit and the role quite nicely, but it's still hard to follow two performances by Michael Keaton, who is also simply too good as Batman to be replaced. There were times when I thought it might have been better had the movie not even been made, but Jim Carrey's performance alone always changes my mind about that. Kilmer is capable of pulling off the role, but it's unfortunate that he had the double-whammy of having such a tough act to follow and, on top of that, being faced with the monumental task of getting people to look past the debut of the Bat-nipples. It's pretty easy to see why the comedic content of the second Batman sequel was enhanced so much, since Batman Returns was so dark and so gloomy that it surely dimmed the interest in the series. Director Joel Schumacher smartly realizes that superheroes in movies as dark as Batman Returns are still superheroes, but they are superheroes in the dark. Even Batman's great heroics couldn't remove him from the atmosphere of the rest of the movie. Now we get Jim Carrey, the staggeringly beautiful Nicole Kidman as the new Kim Basinger, and Two-Face, a hardened villain but one who laughs almost as much as the Joker. And it's good that there are such powerful side-characters, because the villains and the love interest are more important to the Batman films than Batman himself, who tends to be moody and self-reserved no matter who plays him or who directs. It is significant that with four Batman movies currently in release, we still don't know much about him other than that his parents were murdered right in front of him and he has lots and LOTS of money. Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, the largest character from the original comics to have been left out for this long. He fits the role well, but there are some moments in which the writing of his character is not given a lot of thought. I can understand that he is emotionally conflicted with not having been able to save the lives of his family members that died in the circus attack, but lamenting himself as a total failure is still laughable, even in the situation, since at the time he personally pushed a bomb that must have weighed hundreds of pounds out the roof of the circus tent and into the river, literally saving hundreds of lives. Then again, losing family is not an easy thing to get over, and it gives him a good reason to act like a jerk when Bruce Wayne is offering him free room and board in his cavernous mansion. Robin's character is really brought into play in this movie mostly to introduce him to the franchise and briefly introduce the conflicts that will erupt between him and Batman in greater detail and scope in Batman & Robin, which focuses largely on their relationship and their troubles working together, especially against a villain bent on turning them against each other. We learn enough about him in this movie to know that he comes from a life as an acrobat in the circus where he experienced familial tragedies similar to Wayne's own and that he loves motorcycles, but Dick Grayson doesn't become Robin until just long enough for he and Batman to team up against Two Face and The Riddler and then set the stage for Batman & Robin.Batman has now taken on a new actor, a new partner, a new director, and a new tone. The movie has lightened up more than a little bit, but the outrageous comic book villains are back, the action is emphasized over the noir atmosphere, and the movie has certainly taken some hints from its predecessor. Note: I don't normally do this, but the soundtrack is also excellent, especially for a soundtrack composed mainly of trendy songs, which I generally don't like. See, for example, the song 'Fun For Me,' by Moloko. Great stuff.",Batman Forever
63,Vartiainen,A more cartoonish take on Batman,8,2 September 2015,"After Tim Burton's Batman Returns proved to be a bit too dark for the audiences at the time, a new director was brought in to make, shall we say, safer Batman film. Something marketable, something mainstream, something that you could go see as a family. The director? Joel Schumacher. The film? Batman Forever. Though Tim Burton still stayed with the film as a producer, which is probably the main reason why this film is still considered to be a decent portrayal of Batman.Because yeah, it's not a bad film by any means. It definitely succeeded in being more accessible, plus it made a tidy profit for Warner Bros., which always helps. But at its core it still feels like a Batman film. It has most of the needed elements. It has a good Bruce Wayne in Val Kilmer. Not Keaton or Bale good, but he still pulls off the character. It has a magnificent villain in Jim Carrey's Riddler. Because honestly, who else would you have picked to play the Riddler? I'm of two minds about Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face. On the other hand, it's Tommy Lee Jones. On the other hand, I don't think the movie really needs Two-Face. His character is completely overshadowed by the Riddler, making him more aggravating than anything, as he is taking away screen time from the main villain. Plus the story would work just fine without him.It's also nice to see an origins story for Robin (Chris O'Donnell), although I think that O'Donnell wasn't the perfect guy to play the role. He comes off as too arrogant and cocky to be in any way likable.Batman Forever is not the perfect Batman film in any way, but I'm glad it exists. Jim Carrey's performance alone means that it's worth a watch for any fan of Gotham and its inhabitants, plus it has enough Burton in it to please even without our enigmatic man in green.",Batman Forever

65,lisafordeay,"Watched it for Jim Carrey,a slightly forgettable film.",5,27 August 2016,"I haven't seen this movie in years but I remember most of it all for one actor Jim Carrey. Instead of George Clooney or Micheal Keaton as Batman,Val Kilmer plays the cape crusader of Gotham city who must face his identity between a former nerdy scientist who is obsessed with Batman and science played by Jim Carrey and Two-Faced played by Tommy Lee Jones. But when an accident occurs at Carrey's workplace he ends up being turned into The Riddler. But with Bruce Wayne's complicated life will he save crime from The Riddler and Two-Faced.Now this movie had some memorable scenes including a cameo from Drew Barrymore,Jim Carrey's whacky persona as the riddler and him exposing Bruce Wayne as Batman basically I just watched it for one person Jim Carrey. This guy was so over the top,whacky and he was like the Bugs Bunny of my generation. Nowadays his comedic side isn't as good as it used to be and this film was probably the last comedic film before his films went bad. Yes I enjoyed Bruce Almighty too but after that he just wasn't the same. The special effects are good and Val Kilmer wasn't bad as Batman but his no Micheal Keaton or Christian Bale.5/10",Batman Forever
66,FiendishDramaturgy,"A good attempt, but a weak finished product.",8,1 October 2003,"Many critics have bashed Val Kilmer's portrayal of Batman, but I found him delightful and well-suited to the part. While there was enough camp for a complete plethora of girl scouts, I found his portrayal dark and convincing. It was the direction, again, which was lacking.More camp and reversion to the old 60's-70's comedic-styled Batman practically killed this movie for me. Nicole Kiddman's presence did absolutely nothing for it, either in my opinion. Her work was extremely plastic, predictable and downright amateurish. I normally greatly enjoy her performances. I loved her in ""Practical Magic,"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" but this is about seven light-years away from even touching on those performances. Chris O'Donnel as Robin...? *winces* I would have chosen someone else for the part, but he does make a valiant attempt.Moreover, they did stick to the original story of the death of Robin's family member and how he came to be Bruce Wayne's ward. That was nicely refreshing after the erroneous change of Bruce Wayne's parents being killed by the Joker in the first installment. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was hilarious and almost vertiginous in his portrayal, sadly that was one of the main elements of camp. He should have been much more serious and foreboding if he wished to avoid lending that old ""oh gods how lame"" feeling we all got from the old TV series.Jim Carrey's performance as the Riddler was...classic Jim Carrey. I found he was acting less than he was just playing on camera. His performance did not carry enough Riddler. His personality severely overrode his performance and we got Jim Carrey in a skintight green leotard, instead of the Riddler. I love Jim Carrey's style, so that was not so much a problem for me, but for some others, it was a serious detriment to the film.Still absent, were the wonderful Gothic architectures, the darkling sinister feel to the whole movie. This was simply pandemonium and mayhem with seemingly no direction whatsoever after the first thirty minutes of the movie.While this is not, I repeat ""NOT"" a bad movie, it did far less to capture and inspire the imagination than the first of its spawn. The effects were very reminiscent of the now degraded ""Lawnmower Man,"" and the body armor was ridiculous. Batman doesn't HAVE body armor, and if he DID, it certainly would never have had nipples pressed into the frigging thing! Ludicrous. I'm all for technology and its marvelous advances, but this was not a good example of its proper use in a film. I felt the nippled body armor was just another demonstration of the bad direction and yet another reversion to the camp of the old TV series. ""Holy rusted metal, Batman!"" Robin. *lol* Wow. You don't get any lamer than that. Call it an homage if you must, but in my opinion, it sorely cheapened the already low quality of dialog in this movie. With dialog like that, how can you help but laugh? Therefore, I have to say that this movie did make me laugh from time to time (although it was AT it, rather than WITH it), and there were some interesting ideas which I will not detail here (see the movie for yourself if you're interested in seeing them).That having been said, I miss the darkling Gothic/punk quality Tim Burton captured in the first. The first was not perfection, but it was much, much nearer that goal than this one, or ""Batman Returns.""I understand Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the next installment as Mr. Freeze. I can only hope he does not fall into the giddy, preposterous scenarios and cheap lame campy dialog they forced on Tommy Lee Jones. And George Clooney as Batman?! What ARE they thinking!? I have little hope that the next installment will surpass this one.The bright spots of this movie? Jim Carey's wardrobe, Val Kilmer's performance, Drew Barrymore's portrayal as ""Sugar,"" and the addition of Robin's character. As I already stated, they were not faithless in the story line of his history and how he came to be with Bruce Wayne. It was the one thing I admired about this movie, that the character development was quite deep and actually very good.It gets a 7.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Batman Forever
67,elshikh4,The Bat Nipples Were Here First !,4,22 March 2018,"Now that's a loud matter to review!(Val Kilmer) was just a handsome robot, delivering his lines tastelessly as if it's intentional. At one episode of ""Inside The Actor Studio"", (Kilmer) said that he hated the role, the suit, the whole deal, but Hey.. that's not an enough justification for not making his best, or spending any effort (or maybe what we watched was his best!).The script provided us with many explosive situations, but it was idiotic at certain places; Bruce Wayne is thinking about bat, so he's Batman! (I may think about sea at times, so that makes me Aquaman?!!). Batman saves Harvey Dent / Two-Face from a whole deformation, so the latter wants to revenge on Batman NOT the real doer?? Moreover, the solution of all the Riddler's riddles' is the ""Riddler"" himself, so he was only declaring himself??There were smart ideas along the way, which the script wasted utterly; like the character of the Two-Face as someone who lives an inner conflict all the time, and also the plan of the Riddler to take away the people's brains through TV. But who said that this movie wanted to be smart?!The movie wanted to make crazy action unremittingly, while being a huge party of vociferous colors unlike its too dark antecedent (Batman Returns - 1992). Yes, the colors were harmonious, but their turmoil was onerous. Therefore, (Elliot Goldenthal)'s orchestrated music sounded too noisy to stand among all of this. Ironically, the movie's music video with (U2)'s masterpiece (Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me) was better than the movie itself!Name good things IN it? Well, just 1 thing was perfect: The fact that (William Baldwin) was considered for the role of Batman and (Linda Hamilton) as his girl, and it didn't happened. Although I deemed not doing that a good thing, but still.. it's not a good thing IN it!To everyone complained about (Batman & Robin - 1997) as the uglier one in the first franchise, telling unstoppable jokes about the nipples of the Batsuit as the lowest bottom that that movie hit--please look closer, the nipples made their first appearance in here first, where the evil seed of ""silly"" was sown.To end it on a tolerant note, I'll say that this is a loud, gaudy, silly action; which's usual in most of Hollywood movies!",Batman Forever

Great U2 song Great Seal Song Great Massive Attack song Great Method Man song Great Mazzy Star song Great Offspring song Great Flaming Lips songThey actually had a Flaming Lips song in a movie!!!!! It is like a dream soundtrack for an audiophile in the 90s.But....it totally diverged from what Batman was. It killed the Dark thing, killed the world that Burton created. Bruce Wayne turned into James Bond....But it did have Chris O'Donnell and he was one of the cultural poster boys of the 90s. And it did have that soundtrack and Nicole Kidman never looked better...so we all went to see it, even if it was the worst role Tommy Lee Jones ever played.We walked away scoffing at the Bat nipples and the neon gang...but we still went out and got the soundtrack.",Batman Forever
69,freemantle_uk,This is not what Batman should be,4,1 September 2008,"If Tom Rothman, Chairman of Fox Studios is reading this, take note: this was when the decline of the original Batman franchise started. The reason was because of Warner Brothers believing that Batman Return did not make enough money and thereby turned away from Tim Burton's dark (even though I don't think its as dark as some others think) and gone back to the 60s model of Batman, which was the worst version of Batman possible. A family friendly version of a dark superhero doesn't work and studio interference goes too far. That's what makes me worry about Tom Rothman's idea with the Wolverine film.Tim Burton was ditched, but remained as a producer and Joel Schumacher replaced him. Michael Keaton also left the role of Batman and Val Kilmer (one of the most bland actors around) replaced him. The film also introduce Robin to the franchise and Batman faces Two-Face and the Riddler in this flick. The basic plot is Two-Face and the Riddler team up to drain the intelligence of Gotham, using a special device on television sets. Dick Grayson aka Robin, whole family is murdered by Two-Face and Bruce Wayne takes him in. At the Wayne mansion Dick discovery's who Bruce really is and become Batman's sidekick. Bruce is also falling for psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), who herself is interested in Batman.The first problem is that this film is aimed at kids: this is just wrong for Batman fans because we all know that he is a very dark character. The plot is very thin and completely over the top. It is easy to compare it to Christoper Nolan's version which was darker, more down too earth and takes the most realistic road possible. The casting was not very good either. I do not rate Val Kilmer as an actor, a big mistake for Chris O'Donnell, Tommy Lee Jones couldn't be bothered, Jim Carrey was not under control and Nicole Kidman was still finding her feet when it came to acting. There was no depth to the film. When it comes to more modern superhero films they was at least some ideas coming to suffer. Just look at the first two X-Men films, the Nolan Batmans and even in Spiderman there was psychological and personal issues. All those films were taken seriously: Batman Forever wasn't. The director by Schumacher, whilst not terrible, is nothing to write home about. He does not have the vision of Burton or Nolan and he should stick to tout films. When I was younger I did enjoy this film: but you give a 10-year-old a Batman film starting Jim Carrey they are bound to like.Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are great models on how not to make a superhero and producers should take note that too much interference will ruin a film!",Batman Forever
70,JoeB131,A warning sign of things to come...,4,18 November 2009,"This wasn't a very good movie, although not as bad as the one that followed it. All of the Burton/Schumacher Batman Movies have the following elements. 1) How I became an Evil Supervillian. 2) Batman has some kind of flashback 3) Supervillian kills one of his own henchmen 4)We have an extended scene with Batman putting on the Batsuit 5)There is a big climatic battle. 6) Batman KILLS one of the villains. (Again, this is always what ticks me off even about the Nolan Batman. Batman is not a killer. At least not since the 1940's, anyway.) Schumacher took over the helm of the Batman Franchise after Tim Burton went into whatever weird world Tim Burton went into. He proceeded to waste the material that he had. Another point- Burton and Schumacher chose to pick really name actors looking for a paycheck to play their villains. So they really weren't really playing the characters (most of whom have been around since the 1940's), they were playing their own personas in the costumes. Sometimes, this almost worked out, like Jack Nicholsen as the Joker. In this movie, it didn't. Okay, let's start with the obvious. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Not only the completely wrong guy to play the role, but then they pass on the most interesting way to use the character, which is to tell the origin story. Sorry, going for the Riddler's origin story wasn't nearly as interesting. More to the point, he played the character comedically, which just isn't what you do with Two-Face. Two-Face is actually a pretty grim character. then you had Jim Carey. Now, I like Jim Carey. He was totally wrong here. The Riddler is not a Jim Carey character. (As an aside, Carey did a very funny impersonation of Nicholsons' Joker on ""In Living Color"" in 1990 when he was relatively unknown.) He's not a character who matches wits with Batman, just some loon out to get Bruce Wayne. Kilmner was actually okay as Batman, even though his hair was the wrong color. Chris O'Donnel was whiny and not much fun as Robin. (I dislike him so much I can't stand to watch NCIS LA). Nicole Kidman, easy on the eyes, horrible for the ears. I want to bring up one more point. Pat Hingle as Commission Gordon. IN addition to the Michael Gogh, who plays Alfred, he is the only character who appeared in all four movies. Yet his character is never really that important and doesn't even look right. Now, how you could make four movies in this universe and not realize how important the character is to the mythology is beyond me.Another point- CGI. The first two movies used extensive minatures and sets, but this one used CGI to achieve the look of its Gotham City. Sadly, because this was an early effort, things look actually pretty fake. And I mean a nerd in his mother's basement could produce better results now.",Batman Forever

Kilmer is badly miscast as the Caped Crusader, playing him as if he were a doped up Grateful Dead roadie. Kidman is here for no apparent reason except for sex appeal.

72,alindsay-al,A horrible step down from the Burton films,2,11 July 2014,"With Tim Burton stepping away from the Batman franchise Joel Schumacher decided to take over and change everything great about those films and make this and the next film horrible. Batman is once again going against two villains Two Face and The Riddler while dealing with his relationship with partner Robin, his relationship with Dr Chase and his remembrance of his parents. Now after the memorable performance from Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman Val Kilmer had big shoes to fill and his performance is mixed. I thought as Bruce Wayne that Kilmer did a decent job possibly as good as Keaton but it was really hard to believe him as The Batman he just wasn't The Dark Knight that was expected and was largely disappointing as Batman. With the villains I believe that Tommy Lee Jones sucks as Two Face as he really tries his best to impersonate Jack Nicholson's performance as The Joker and his character never needed that he would have been so cool as a serious character instead of a ridiculous carton. Now with Jim Carrey as The Riddler it was obvious that he was going to be crazy and this is a version of The Riddler that has been documented and I understand why he acted the way he did so I don't hate his character. Nicole Kidman as Dr Chase did a decent job but was nothing special, and Chris O Donnell was pretty offensive as Robin with the fact that they tried to emphasise he was like an 18 year old which was ridiculous cause he even looks 35. Also his relationship with Bruce Wayne just sucked. The Story was Terrible with not a lot of coherence to it at all and they took all the obvious choices and went there. The script was not good at all with some of the dialogue failing to hit home at all and some of Jones and Carrey's lines were not good. The style of the film sucked as well everybody's costumes were horrible from Batman to Riddler and things like the lighting and the batmobile added to the pain. This is one of the worst comic book films ever and oh it continued for the next film, when they said Batman Forever they meant one more film and then it would be dead for almost 10 years.",Batman Forever
73,MaxBorg89,"Great villains, but that's it, basically...",6,18 October 2005,"Tim Burton left the Batman franchise to pursue his own visions: wise choice.The new director, Joel Schumacher, decided to make the third movie more similar to the TV-show made in the '60s: not a very good choice.Toning down the violence is all right, considering 90% of those who watch this kind of films are kids, but come on, give us a decent story: Batman(newcomer Val Kilmer) has to deal with two villains, Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler(Jim Carrey), and he gets help from psychologist Chase Meridian(Nicole Kidman) as well as Dick Grayson aka Robin(Chris O' Donnell), who wants to avenge his parents, killed by Two-Face(in the comic-book, this actually happened to another Robin, Jason Todd).The script is quite predictable, and it also is an insult for fans: Two-Face, a tragic yet fascinating villain, has been turned into an ugly psycho nobody cares about.As for the mentor/pupil subplot between Batman and Robin, with the exception of one scene(where the Dark Knight explains what would happen if his sidekick killed the bad guy), it could come from any soulless B-movie around.There's one good thing though:Jones and Carrey.The former makes Two-Face respectable despite the screenplay, but it's Carrey who really owns the film, making the Riddler a character we'd like to see again.It's partially enjoyable if you haven't seen Burton's work, but please, don't watch Schumacer's second Bat-flick.It's HORRIBLE!",Batman Forever
74,iquine,"Wild, Wacky and Jarring",7,19 February 2018,"(Flash Review)Watching this after a couple 60's French heist films was an abrupt switch as this was an explosion of wild and garish visuals and jarring pacing with aggressive shot framing. Once I got into mental rhythm it started to grow on me after a lackluster beginning. It grew on me due to Jim Carrey perfectly getting into the role of The Riddler. He stole the show for me and easily overshadowed Kilmer as Batman. This time Batman is up against Two-Face as he wrongly assumes Batman was the reason for his facial disfigurement and then also The Riddler who transforms himself from a computer genius into The Riddler striving to build a device to drain all the information from all the brains in Gotham. To top all that off, Batman's future partner Robin is introduced and then mix in a romantic angle with Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian and you have many interesting storylines that are sufficiently intertwined. The humor in this was more deliberate, felt more comic-like and had more sexual innuendos. The scene esthetics felt more busy than the first two and the effects looked more fake and dated than the 'older' movies ironically. Overall, this was still wild fun yet loses a bit of the original Burton magic for me.",Batman Forever
75,jimbo-53-186511,Whacked out and silly to the point where it stops being fun,3,11 September 2021,"Harvey Dent and Edward Nygma (or two face and the Riddler as they are otherwise known) both have their own grievances and vendettas against Batman and set about getting vengeance against the caped-crusader in their own madcap way. This time though Batman is not taking these 2 miscreants on alone and gets some help from his well-known sidekick...It seems that the production executives at Warner Bros decided on a lighter tone than the previous 2 films that were directed by Burton (allegedly Joel Schumacher wanted to keep the dark tone adopted by Burton) hence the rather drastically different feel that we have here with Batman Forever. To be totally honest I don't mind a lighter fun tone with superhero movies if the narrative and dialogue are strong; good one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humour are staple ingredients if you're going to adopt this approach, but you don't get any of that here.Whilst the narrative is more straight-forward in this film (just plain old revenge is the driver here) it's still not particularly engaging and the goofy tone to the film means that it is less action-orientated than the first 2 films and as a result is more dull. Things are not helped by ridiculous performances from both Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey; they make Jack Nicholson's hammy turn as the joker in Batman look restrained in comparison. Every time Jones and Carrey were on screen together it was almost like they were trying to out act each other and their performances are more embarrassing than funny. It's not really that surprising to see Carrey overacting as that has been his trademark in many of his films, but in quite a few of his comedy films this overacting is offset slightly by his material being funny which sadly it isn't here. Jones is more of a surprise though as he can be very good, but I guess the execs preferred a cartoonish performance rather than a fearsome one; this is something else that lets the film down in that the villains are not intimidating in Batman Forever; at least the Joker and Penguin had some menace about them. Val Kilmer has often got stick for his portrayal as Batman and whilst he isn't quite as good as Keaton, Kilmer in no way disgraces himself unlike some of his colleagues.Perhaps part of the film's failings lie with the fact that Joel Schumacher didn't want to make the film that the execs wanted him to make; that would at least explain why Batman Forever is so ridiculous. Maybe Schumacher simply didn't care?But then again if he didn't care then why should we?",Batman Forever

Tommy Lee Jones is good with what he's given as Two-Face but of course, Carrey tries to steal the show with his goofy humor. After halfway thru the film, you get used to Kilmer as Batman but then the movie is halfway over. It does get interesting at this point with Robin(Dick Grayson) entering the scene but everything goes much farther than it should as the enemies enter and destroy the batcave. Dr. Chase Meridian finds out more than she is supposed to and the lure of the Batman is much too revealed.

78,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A loving ode to 60's Batman,8,11 July 2016,"It's true, Batman Forever is a silly, overblown, cartoonish riot of buffoonry. But so what? It's also awesome in it's own way, and inhabits a certain corner of the Batman culture, the side of things that is rooted in camp and unhinged wonderment. Now, there's an important and discernible difference between taking things far and taking things too far. That difference is delineated on one side by a willingness to be goofy, colorful and not take this superhero stuff too seriously. The other side of that of course is a disregard for limits, throwing every ridiculous line, costume and awkward scene into it you can imagine. I'm referring to Joel Schumacher's followup to this, Batman & Robin. Everything that is weird, wonderful and extravagant about Forever just revved up to much in Robin, resulting in a pisss poor typhoon of mania and over acting. Not to say that Forever doesn't have over acting. Ohhhh boy is there over acting. Between Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, the thing is liable to give you epilipsy. But it somehow works despite its madness, a lucky stroke that Robin couldn't have cared less about adhering to. Val Kilmer is the sedating antidote to Jones and Carrey, a remakably laid back Bats and a pretty solid casting choice, both as Brooding Bruce and Buttkicking Bats. Eternally broken up about the death of his patents, Bruce fights off Harvey Two Face Dent (Jones) in a garish, disarming Gotham City that resembles Mardi Gras in Dr. Seuss land. Jones's Two Face is so far over the top, so rabid that it's a wonder he didn't give himself a bloody heart attack in the first take. Anyone who's interested can read up on his performance, and how he pushed himself right to the heights of bombast in order to try and out-Carrey the Jim. Carrey, playing the Riddler, is a ball of twisted nerves himself, set loose on the wacky sets and basically given free reign to.. well.. go friggin nuts. It's one of his most physical performances too, prancing around like a loon in green spandex that leaves nothing to the imagination. Aaron Eckhart's Two Face may have had the edge for grit, but Jones has the rollicking clown version, and runs away to kookoo land with mannerisms that even call to mind The Joker in some scenes. The only thing I've seen him more hopped up in is Natural Born Killers, but hell man its hard to top his work in that. The story is all over the place, involving a nonsensical subplot with a mind control device, multiple elaborate set pieces, endless scenery chewing and the eventual arrival of Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell who is like the cinematic Buzz Killington. Michael Gough and Pat Hingle dutifully tag along as Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, both looking tired at this point. Debi Mazar and Drew Barrymore have amusing dual cameos as Two Face's twin vixens, and Nicole Kidman does the slinky love interest shtick for Bruce as a sexy psychologist. Watch for an uncredited Ed Begley Jr. Too. There's no denying the silliness, but one has to admit that the achievement in costume, production design and artistry are clear off the charts with this one, and visually it should be a legend in the franchise. Say what you will about it, I love the thing.",Batman Forever

This movie is fun and colorful and I love the characters in this movie. Dr. Chase (Nicole Kidman) is a fantastic character, sexy and likable. I couldn't have loved Chris Odonnel more as Robin. I would've hated it if they would've gotten some kid to play him, that would've sucked. I think Jim Carrey was born to play the Riddler, same goes with Tommy Lee Jones.

""Batman Forever's"" purposefully bad plot is so awful that it is nowhere near what one could call funny (as it was obviously intended). In attempting to poke fun at themselves, these guys have missed the mark by a long shot. They could learn much from the masters of self degradation, the Poms. ""A Fish Called Wanda"" is just one fine example of their talent. And the Aussies aren't too bad at it either. You've only to take a look at the recent hits ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Muriel's Wedding"" to affirm that. But Schumacher and company just didn't have a clue where to start.Handsome Val Kilmer steps into the cape vacated by Michael Keaton but only manages to be just as bland in the role of the super hero haunted by childhood memories. Thank goodness he is never as painful as sidekick yawn Robin (an unenviably woeful part played by Chris O'Donnel). Nicole Kidman is a non-event, Jim Carrey a miles too 'over the top' Riddler' and Tommy Lee Jones is way out of his league as Harvey ""two face"" Dent.Director Joel Schumacher (""St.Elmo's Fire"", ""Flatliners"", ""Dying Young"" and ""Falling Down"") has done nothing but throw the whole thing together in a jumbled heap. Included in this deplorable mess is the afore mentioned less than inspiring acting, the awful plot, some outrageous yet eye-catching costumes(Bob Ringwood and Ingrid Ferrin), state of the art special effects (John Dykstra - ""Star Wars""), spectacular sets from Barbara Ling and more gadgets than you can poke a bat mobile at.

It's entertaining enough, so watch it! my rating:B minus. PG-13 for violence. 121 mins.",Batman Forever
82,Agent10,Forever a bomb,1,13 August 2002,"This film should have ruined many careers, but that was reserved for the even worse Batman and Robin. The original conception of the film had taken a horrible turn, not only in killing the franchise,but also turning the series into some sugar rush/caffeine trip which couldn't be stopped. A bad film, Val Kilmer was absolutely horrible in his role as Bruce Wayne, going through each scene like he had better things to do. Also, Jim Carrey's over the top view of The Riddler was far too annoying, making his character mostly unnecessary. Sadly, Tommy Lee Jones graced this horrible film, leaving a dark spot on his resume.

85,raulfaust,Batman Rocks Forever,8,4 February 2011,"Batman Forever is the third movie of the 90's franchise and did what it was supposed to do. The cinematography is just perfect, nothing more than that. The cast is very good; all the actors look the way they have to. Give a special attention to Jim Carrey's performance because he really rocked. You know, who could be better to portray an insane man? By the way, some people need to realize some things: Tim Burton wasn't credited as the director of this movie because he was being very criticized for the two earlier Batman films. Warner was smart enough to ""change"" it to Joel Schumacher, so it would be a good publicity: ""New Director - A Whole Better Film"". Obviously Tim Burton worked with him to make this movie; we can see it's not much different from the previous two. The only difference is that ""Batman Forever"" isn't too dark, but it's still pretty good.Also, I don't understand the big controversial about Batman's actor change. Let's be reasonable and admit that playing Batman isn't that hard. You just have to make some serious expressions, show confidence and say the words the writers made for you. I don't see a big difference between Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer at playing this role. Anyways, I think this movie deserved all the hype it had when released and I really hoped it was better rated on IMDb.",Batman Forever
86,justin-fencsak,The last great batman movie before the mess that was Batman and Robin,6,22 March 2018,"When I first saw Batman Forever during its opening weekend at the Sony (now AMC Loews) Wayne 8 plex in NJ, I had a great time enjoying it with my dad and stepmom. I even bought the terrible video game and thought how hard it was to beat it despite having mortal kombat moves and graphics from the same developer and publisher. This movie was a big hit during the summer, only to be surpassed by Toy Story at the end of the year. The casting is perfect, with Val Kilmer in his only role as the Dark Knight, with Chris O'Donnell as Robin, who would go on to become Robin again in Batman and Robin, along with Nicole Kidman as Chase Merdian, as well as the guy who played the butler Alfred from the previous two batman movies. As for the bad guys, Jim Carrey is the Riddler and delivers an amazing performance, along with Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, the character of which makes a grand intro in The Dark Knight. Drew Barrymore also plays a role as one of the femme fatales. As for the pacing, it's pretty quick and easy yet a bit campy compared to the darkness of the 1989 batman and its sequel, Batman returns.

The action scenes are capably handled, Tommy Lee Jones is an excellent villain as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent and Michael Gough and Pat Hingle reprise their respective roles. Val Kilmer is absolutely wooden as both Bruce Wayne and Batman (no doubt he was too busy thinking about his paycheck). He displays no depth and little emotion. He is very much a star from yesteryear. Nicole Kidman is the same - bland and irritating. Jim Carrey is OK as the Riddler but my word, he takes it a bit far at times! Chris O' Donnell is better than I thought as Robin. The photography and style are both complete opposites to Tim Burton's two films. In ""Batman Forever,"" everything is much more bright and colourful. The pace is pretty good.

88,alexanderdavies-99382,More of a guilty pleasure but a good one.,6,7 May 2018,"""Batman Forever"" was a deliberate change from the Gothic films from Tim Burton.
 The above film is a lot more light-hearted, is brightly lit, has a good pace and good action scenes. 
 Val Kilmer is absolutely terrible in the title role - he is that wooden, I thought someone would have knocked some nails into him! He displays no depth and no ability whatever. Goodness knows why he was cast. He is very much a forgotten name these days. Nicole Kidman is bloody irritating most of the time in this film. Her attempts at being seductive and at being an intelligent psychiatrist are woeful. I remember thinking that when I was at the cinema. She's just another dumb blonde in films. Chris O' Donnell is ok as Robin but Michael J. Fox would have been better. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are on hand to provide their usual solid support but neither has much to do. A pity. Out of the two villains, I much prefer the performance of Tommy Lee Jones. It disappoints me when he is written out for a lengthy period but his larger than life acting is the right approach for ""Batman Forever."" Jim Carrey is way too poofy as the Riddler. He makes Frank Gorshin's effort seem laid back and subtle in comparison. He should have been reined in a bit more by Joel Schumacher.
 The fight scenes are very good, with some crisp choreography. I liked the bit when Chris O' Donnell takes on those street punks in the alley way. The violence has certainly been toned down here. 
 The photography is an asset, even though most of the film was filmed on sound stages.
 This is a fair film to be honest. ""Batman and Robin"" is the one that was ruining it for everyone.",Batman Forever
89,eric262003,More Like Batman Gone Forever,5,12 January 2015,"Under the questionable direction of one Joel Schumacher, ""Batman Forever"" takes all the doom and gloom from the previous Tim Burton installments (which was a good thing by the way) we now have it ruined by a more flashy, coloured over and watered down kiddie film and that's where the franchise started to go down the tube. Yes I know it didn't go as low as the cheesy, old 1960's Adam West ""Batman"". But it sure comes very close (not to be a hypocrite but I actually enjoyed that series even if it was before my time). I guess to draw towards the younger age demographics, Mr. Schumacher alleviates all the dark rainy gloom that Burton created and made an atmosphere with vibrant colours, booming explosions and scenarios that might keep your attention in tact, but the scenarios just seem to be patted on without any reason or rhyme. I kept saying to myself during the whole process as to why did that scene take place, let alone, what is the purpose of that certain set piece was there making the execution virtually null and void. I mean the plot was already paper-thin, but at least have the set-pieces serve some sort of purpose. Is that so hard to ask? The ultimate poison that Schumacher injected in the franchise was his negligence to implement the psychological aspects that Mr. Burton carried in the previous two installments. Even so from the recurring nightmare involving a what else ""large bat, big surprise""? this movie is not only narrow, it's also quite lame. The film seems to segue into another side story as the Caped Crusader (Val Kilmer) is in battle with the notorious coin-flipping killer Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent (Tommy Lee Jones). The city of Gotham has gone through what appears to be a beauty makeover. Gone are the dark and dreary colours brought on by Burton's production designer Anton Faust and Bo Welch. Schumacher's imagery is dolled up with CGI enhanced vibrancy by day and repetitive neon green signs at night. Opening scenes were actually quite exciting, but then waters down to a formulaic melodrama as Bruce Wayne encountering a psychopathic genius who could very well just be Ace Ventura gone bad, Dr. Ed Nygma (played by the always fun Jim Carrey) who has worked on a diabolical apparatus that reads minds long before he developed the moniker, The Riddler. Nygma joins forces with Two-Face to exploit the entire city Gotham just who is this Batman who seems overwhelmed by playing father figure to an orphaned acrobat named Dick Grayson who later adopted the name Robin and a new love interest in Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman). After a myriad of unriveting confrontations with his adversaries, Schumacher decides the time is right for one last explosive showdown just before the end credits materialize. The ranting doesn't stop here. If you thought the effects, the atmosphere and the production designs were insignificant to the two installments, surely the acting makes it all up right? NOT! The acting also contributes to the side effects of Mr. Schumacher's debauchery to this up until now sprawling franchise. Kilmer is virtually a cardboard cutout here and the feeling of Michael Keaton's interpretation of the reclusive eccentric millionaire has found a restless foot in the grave. It seems that Kilmer was not interested in the role and you can see it from his stoic expressions he just wanted out. Chris O'Donnell was just annoying as Robin and Nicole Kidman was just nothing but window dressing. Tommy Lee Jones looked embarrassing and unconvincing as the evil Two-Face as this is one role that Jones will likely be forgotten. He is truly usurped by the more bizarrely flamboyant, but entertainingly funny Riddler in which Jim Carrey steals every scene he's in. Michael Gough returns for the third time in the subtle but convincing role as the loyal but weary butler Alfred, but cant implement much chemistry to the stoic Kilmer. There are other little positive tidbits about ""Batman Forever"" that doesn't make this movie entirely contrived. It does gracefully follow the traditional story lines of some the characters namely the story of how Grayson entered Wayne's life and how he became Robin and how hotshot lawyer Harvey Dent became the coin-flipping became Two-Face (after hot oil burned half of his face). That to me was mildly satisfying even though it was brief. And also U2's soundtrack was really awesome.And then the score was quite upsetting too. Danny Elfman's engaging score was sadly replaced by Elliott Goldenthal's more spontaneous campy heroic interludes. The Batmobile looks like a cheesy prototype in contrast to the once beastly vehicle that Keaton rode in the previous two films before. It's sad that we just don't know when to keep good thing coming as we see ""Batman Forever"" failing to measure up to the other two installments. Sometimes change isn't always for the better and this rule applies here in ""Batman Forever"". Mr. Schumacher, you owe Bob Kane an apology.",Batman Forever
90,brando647,My Favorite of the First-Generation Batman Movies,8,28 February 2015,"It's a widely accepted fact that Joel Schumacher was the man that nearly destroyed Batman's credibility until Christopher Nolan came along in 2005 and rejuvenated the character's film life with BATMAN BEGINS. I completely agree that BATMAN & ROBIN is the literally the worst thing to have ever happened to the Caped Crusader but, if I'm going to be honest, Schumacher's first Batman movie wasn'thorrible. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I actually still enjoy BATMAN FOREVER. It was the first Batman movie I saw in theaters, it features two of my favorite villains, and it hadn't quite fallen to the depressing level of camp that its 1997 sequel would bring. It still had major problems but, even now, they aren't enough to ruin my enjoyment. The plot, for instance, feels like something ripped from the 60's TV series: as it begins, Gotham is being terrorized by former district attorney Harvey Dent, living under his new criminal persona Two- Face (Tommy Lee Jones). As if Two-Face wasn't enough of an problem, disgruntled former Wayne Enterprises employee Edward Nygma has developed a dangerous new technology capable of harvesting the city's brainwaves and channeling them into his own mind, increasing his intelligence exponentially. Under his new guise as the Riddler (Jim Carrey), he forms an alliance with Two-Face to seek vengeance on Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer) and discover the true identity of Batman. To battle the double menace, Batman forms a new partnership with Dick ""Robin"" Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), a young circus acrobat whose family had been murdered by Two-Face.Michael Keaton had stepped away from the franchise at this point and was replaced in the cape and cowl by Val Kilmer. Kilmer, while amazing as Jim Morrison in THE DOORS, made for a wooden Bruce Wayne. He does little in the way of emoting the entire movie, rarely bothering to so much as raise his voice above a low rumble. Chris O'Donnell joins the series as Dick Grayson/Robin. O'Donnell makes out best, as his character has the only real defined arc. Wayne has got a minor subplot about coming to grips with his parents' deaths and embracing his role as Batman but it barely receives any attention. Robin, on the other hand, is hunting Two-Face on a personal vendetta. There are obvious parallels between Wayne and Grayson's stories but little is made of it. Nicole Kidman is Chase Meridian, a caricature who exists only to drool over Batman. She's supposed to be a criminal psychologist but you wouldn't know it because, from the moment she's introduced, she spends 99% of her time trying to get into Batman's codpiece. The villains fare better(ish). Tommy Lee Jones wastes an opportunity to make Two-Face into the truly awesome character he should be. Instead, he takes a cue from Jack Nicholson's Joker and cranks it up to 11, cackling and howling through the entire movie. The one character that really worked for me was Jim Carrey as the Riddler. He's definitely got some Frank Gorshin incorporated into his performance, and I loved Gorshin's Riddler when I watched the 60's TV show as a kid. He's way, way, way over the top in a way that only Carrey can do but it (mostly) works and he's a scene-stealer.To match the new campier direction the movie delves into, Joel Schumacher also ditches Burton's grim, atmospheric Gotham in exchange for bright colored lights and neon paint. BATMAN FOREVER is a total tonal shift from the two movies that came before. I loved Burton's visual take on Gotham City but Schumacher's new style never bothered me in this movie. Again, it might just be nostalgia bit I'm willing to give this movie more of a break than, say, the raging pile of disappointment that is BATMAN & ROBIN. BATMAN FOREVER still retains some semblance of a serious attitude about the material and creates a functional balance between zaniness and a grounded reality. I can't imagine this is a popular opinion but BATMAN FOREVER is probably my favorite of the original generation of Batman movies (the Burton and Schumacher films). It has major flaws (lazy writing and poorly developed characters) but it's fun. And for me, that counts for quite a bit. I'm rarely bored during BATMAN FOREVER. The action is shot well, the production design is pretty cool, and Jim Carrey owns it as the Riddler. You've certainly got to lower your standards for this one but BATMAN FOREVER is better than I think most people believe. But, you know, stop with this one. For the sake of your sanity, don't follow it into the 1997 Schumacher sequel.",Batman Forever
91,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Oddly, I'd say ""Batman Forever"" is the worst of the Burton/Schumacher series... Not as good or dark as the first two, and not as laugh-out-loud silly as the fourth...",5,20 September 2009,"Joel Schumacher's 1995 takeover of Burton's now classic ""Batman"" film series remains an enigma to me. The fourth film which follows this entry is the laughable ""Batman & Robin"", which many people regard as one of the worst films ever made. But, in being so indescribably bizarre and over-the-top-awful, ""Batman & Robin"" functioned as an unintentional comedy, and actually I watch it a few times a year with friends and beers for laughs... So in a strange way it works quite well. This film, however, is very transitional with Schumacher and the studio's attempt to make a very ""kiddy"" movie that appeals to a wider audience. And so, it doesn't have the dark edge or intriguing plots of Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns""... Nor is it quite silly enough to become an unintentional classic like ""Batman & Robin."" What we're left with is ""Batman Forever""... an OK-but-not-great movie that just feels weird compared to the other films.Starring Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne / Batman (taking over for Michael Keaton, who I've read wasn't pleased with the new, lighter and friendlier direction), this entry follows the dark knight as he tangles with two villains... Two-Face, the disfigured remnant of DA Harvey Dent, and the Riddler... a questioning mastermind with a taste for puzzles, who is more-or-less an answer to the Joker. Tommy Lee Jones portrays Two-Face in a performance that is just way too over-the-top, while Jim Carrey's Riddler is similarly insane, yet somehow works.As the film opens, Batman is thwarting Two-Face's attempt to rob a bank, which is also a trap to lure Batman in. After a fairly well-executed helicopter sequence, we are introduced to Edward Nigma (Carrey... and boy, you gotta love a name like that!), who works for Wayne enterprises and is developing a new form of television entertainment which involves reading and interacting with the viewer's brain-waves to create a completely virtual-reality-like experience. After Bruce Wayne is forced to deny Nigma's invention due to the dangers of tampering with the brain waves of a populous, Nigma looses his cool, and vows some sort of revenge on him... I don't know, the film moved pretty fast and I just didn't get that part.We also have a number of sub-plots, including a romance between Wayne and psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian (the beautiful Nicole Kidman), which was nice, but a bit creepy to me... She's just a little to... I dunno... school-girlish in her flirty behavior. We are also introduced to Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell... doing an alright job), who lost his family during an attack by Two-Face. Feeling slightly responsible for not having saved his parents, Bruce agrees to take care of Grayson, and the two form a troubled relationship, as Grayson wants revenge, while Bruce wants to steer him towards good.Of course, we know Dick will discover Wayne's secret and eventually join him as Robin, his sidekick, but the film does a halfway decent job at creating a tension between the characters.All-in-all, the acting is solid. Not great but solid. Kilmer is admirable, and for every awful performance, there is a good one to even it out. And the action is well done. But the movie just crumbles when it comes to the style and story.Schumacher's vibe just doesn't jive very well with what Burton had established. And if it weren't for the presence of Pat Hingle and Michael Gough as Commissioner Gordon and butler Alfred respectively, this very well could have been the start of a brand new series.I'm very torn... this film is just in the middle of good and bad. The only thing I really liked was Elliot Goldenthal's score, which is more cartoonish but still dark. But other than that... it's just average... And in this series, where everything else seems to be in absolutes (the first two were great, the fourth was awful)... That just doesn't sit well.Overall, ""Batman Forever"" definitely isn't bad... But it isn't good... And even though it isn't the worst of the series in terms of story and development... It's the worst in terms of entertainment value... Yet still worth checking out. Give it a rent. A 5.5 out of 10.",Batman Forever

Schumachers approach is too comical and Gotham has lost the sinister ora that Burton created, Val Kilmer is OK as the bat, and he certainly helps save the film from total disaster.All the other characters are new, Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian) brings sex appeal, but her character delivers little more. Chris O'Donnell is introduced as Robin, and his martial arts antics do add something to the film. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face and as usual his performance is decent, but the star of the show is Jim Carrey as the Riddler; his performance is both camp and eccentric, and it hits the mark brilliantly.The problem with the movie, although i did enjoy it, is the total change in style; the backdrop of Gotham city is no longer dark and Gothic and the series is moving away from Batmans comic roots.This was the beginning of the end, and it was followed by Batman and Robin.

94,Howlin Wolf,"If you like your comic book movies to be playful, bright and flashy, then there's nothing wrong with this...",7,29 January 2008,"So much of the criticism comes from the fact that the aesthetes are just very disdainful of that style; they think that if a movie's not full of angst, grit and brooding despair then it's automatically worthless. Sure Batman's origins tell of a dark character, but he also emerged over time as a superhero figure, and kids will naturally want to look up to that sort of role model. I agree that ""Batman and Robin"" was a textbook example of how to mess up a family movie badly, but ""Batman Forever is a reasonable attempt at trying to appeal to all demographics. Commercial leanings don't always signal bad intent.I do think we should always consider the many incarnations and genesis of a character over several years. If this movie seems a little camp, comical, and frothy, that's because part of its inspiration has a very colourful, artistic tradition. If you want sombre seriousness, stick with people who champion 'graphic novels' instead.

95,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Mediocre, but not Batman & Robin levels of awful.",5,8 March 2018,"Batman Forever was a sign of things getting truly batshit crazy for the Batman franchise. The last two films were great iterations of The Dark Knight but Warner Brothers wanted things to be lightened-up for younger audiences as opposed to Tim Burton's German-Expressionistic style of directing. Enter Joel Schumacher, the man who eventually crippled the franchise with Batman & Robin TWO YEARS after he did Batman Forever. Well, at least he kept his style of filmmaking consistent with the two movies: hamming it up to the point of no return, until Chris Nolan resurrected the franchise with Batman Begins in 2005 (thank Christ).So, is this film so sinfully bad that anyone who likes it deserves to be crucified to high-heaven and back? No. But it's not all that good either. Batman Forever has become a widely forgotten-about blockbuster because of how inoffensive it was. It still is, but the precedent it set for Batman & Robin was not.

96,dunmore_ego,From Dark Knight to Boogie Knight.,5,31 August 2010,"After Tim Burton gave us the brooding BATMAN (1989) and the dark-yet-kinda-silly BATMAN RETURNS, he relinquished the director's chair to Joel Schumacher, who promptly made Batman fruitier than Adam West.In BATMAN FOREVER, the third installment in the Modern Batman Legacy, Val Kilmer is the fruit bat whom we cannot be sure is hero - or victim (of Schumacher).Strangely, Kilmer seems to be the only person taking it all seriously, doing a magnificent brooding Batman and tormented Bruce Wayne. Yet everything and everyone around him is out to make this the stupidest Batman experience yet: sets dressed to fry our eyeballs with their colors, most of them looking like plastic leftovers from LOST IN SPACE, overacting on stir fry (Tommy Lee Jones and Nicole Kidman) and some guy who somehow passed the audition without any acting ability at all (Chris O'Donnell as Robin).Tommy Lee Jones is Two Face, a villain with half his face fried off, and Kidman is a psychologist who could use a good psychologist for the way she openly pussy-drips after Batman for a taste of his rubbery leathür.Besides Kilmer, one other beacon shines in this smarmy comicbook discotheque: Jim Carrey as The Riddler. Amidst the screaming colors and rainbow stupidity, Carrey's überacting almost steals the show as the greatest Batman Villain ever captured on screen, at one point asking Nicole Kidman, ""Was that over the top? I can never tell?"" You and us both, Ace! Two Face and The Riddler team up to kill Batman. After lots of colors and explosions and batarangs and epic music and Nicole Kidman flouncing around with her red lips on panty pout, the villains fail, due to Batman being so damn cool as Val Kilmer.",Batman Forever
97,pyrocitor,"""Anyone ever tell you that you have a SERIOUS IMPULSE CONTROL problem?!""",4,31 October 2016,"Once upon a time, Joel Schumacher was considered the saviour of the Batman franchise. Yeah. Let that one sink in. After Tim Burton's nose-biting, BDSM-alluding Bat-sequel threatened to alienate the action figure buying-demographic, Warner Bros. tapped Schumacher to deliver a more 'kid-friendly' Bat-bout. Still, anyone mistaking the resulting monstrosity as passably appropriate for any child audience cherishing any hope of a normal development has clearly received too many ""POW""s and ""BIFF""s to the head. It's a testament of how low the '90s superhero bar was set that Batman Forever was such a success when released. But hindsight, and a sampling of proper Batman films, is 20/20 - and Forever is so abrasively stupid, bloated, and obnoxiously noisy in every sense of the word that it's almost hard to watch. Even worse: the film doesn't even descend to the depths of abominable camp delirium that its predecessor, (**shudder**) Batman & Robin plumbs, stripping it of any hooting hate-watching frivolity. That's right, folks - Batman Forever may not be the worst Batman film in terms of quality, but it's easily a candidate for least enjoyable.There's no question that Schumacher has a vision - it's just a vision gilded by bugged out, dangling googly-eye slinky glasses. He cranks up Tim Burton's 'German Expressionism meets Looney Toons' aesthetic to a level of grotesque psychedelic lunacy that would make Adam West dizzy. It's tempting, taking a step back, eyes glazed, to almost find the amount of warped, distended decor (try to count the number of contorted statues in any given shot) and bonkers costume design (Two- Face's slew of bifurcated garments suggest the costume designer frequented Cirque du Soleil with a garbage bag of pharmaceuticals) impressive. The action sequences do receive a bit of a bump, with a revamped Batmobile (and Batplane, AND Bat ski- doo?) that look capably cool, even if Schumacher subjects the Batmobile to a chase that runs a thin line between fun and intolerably stupid, even within its ludicrous surroundings. And then we get more fawning Bat-butt and Bat-nips (Schumacher's unabashedly drawn to Batman's 'leather daddy' subtext - and just wait until Robin shows up ), and reflect that there's more of a sour, parodic quality to it all - Adam West without the silliness and earnest irony. And nobody's laughing here. Yet, somewhere, buried beneath the Russian doll layers of garish excess and embarrassing surplus of characters and subplots, there lie kernels of a promising Batman film. Yes, Two-Face's inclusion is entirely extraneous, and a cheap motivation for troves of vacuous, obvious psychobabble regarding duality, as the screenwriters desperately attempt to offset their dismal script with equally risible faux-profundity (did you know Bruce Wayne ALSO leads a double-life?! Don't worry - you'll get roughly 637 reminders). Still, the Riddler makes for an interesting villainous choice (it's oddly refreshing to have an antagonist lusting after intellect rather than the usual 'power' or 'money' preoccupations), and there are flirtations with social commentary in his master plan (TV sucking up the brain waves of its audience - yuk yuk). Similarly, Bruce Wayne's subplot with Dr. Chase Meridan allows twinkles of chemistry, playfully tapping into the 1950s-fetishism subtext teasingly inherent in the superhero mythos. If only it weren't compromised by Schumacher directing poor Nicole Kidman to act like a pornographic Jessica Rabbit (you can almost sense her cringing, fighting back the sharper, more charismatic performance she's aching to deliver), and Kilmer retorting with sparkling dialogue such as ""Chicks dig the car."" Holy squandered potential, Batman. Still, Kilmer's Batman may be a tad bland, his melodramatic parent-missing monologues largely falling flat(man), but he capably taps into Bruce Wayne's highly strung eccentricities, hitting a hybrid of Michael Keaton weird and Christian Bale suave. If anything, he's worthwhile for being the first time Wayne is more watchable than his titular alter ego - although the modified batsuit allows Kilmer to look like he can actually move for a change, drastically upgrading his fight choreography, the repeated shots of him leaping off rooftops, cape fluttering behind him, look more slight and silly than heroic. As his reluctantly unleashed teen sidekick, Chris O'Donnell's angsty teen 'tude would (almost) work, if his halfhearted brooding wasn't so insufferably smug. Thankfully, the delightful Michael Gough's consummately acerbic wit continues to fire on all four cylinders as wry bat-butler Alfred. Still, every 90s Bat-film is only as good as its villains, and - Two-Face would be proud - we have a 50/50 split here. In the good corner: Jim Carrey. You know it's a bad sign when he's one of the less over-the-top elements of the film, but even let off his chain at full-throttle, Carrey's Riddler is still (narrowly) on the right hemisphere of unhinged. Manic contortions counterbalance by impeccably precise cane-twirling, Carrey's crowing lunacy brings a welcomely appropriate energy entwined with a believable vengeful dark streak. Playful, jubilant, and thoroughly nuts, he's the film's only reliably palatable - nay, enjoyable - attribute. And in the bad corner: Tommy Lee Jones, whose obscene overacting is as uncomfortable as his abhorrently amateurish face paint. Braying and cavorting aimlessly, he's thrown all pretentious of intimidation out the window, with an obscene flood of aimless overacting that suggest his attempting to out-Carrey Carrey and demonstrating exactly how that's as bad an idea as it sounds. Batman Forever is ironically titled, as it opens the floodgates to the horrifically misguided creative direction that threatens to forever bury one of the industry's most iconic heroes. Arguably the spookiest ""Halloween film"" (for all the wrong reasons), as a viewing experience, it's akin to a drunken clown bellowing slurred nonsense in your face for two hours, oblivious to his pants being on fire: occasionally entertaining, sometimes sad, and generally just sickening and exhausting. As Carrey's Riddler bellows, ""Does anyone feel like a fried egg?"" (Still. Oh ho. Just you...chill. The Iceman cometh. And you ain't seen nothing' yet.) -4/10",Batman Forever
98,BrandtSponseller,A masterpiece in my eyes,10,25 May 2005,"Series note: The Batman films largely stand on their own; they are only continuations of the same story in some very minor details. It's not at all necessary to watch them in a particular order.Maybe it's because I love the Adam West ""Batman"" (1966) series so much, but I like Batman Forever better than the two Tim Burton Batman films--this despite the fact that I usually love Tim Burton. But there's more to it than the simple fact that director Joel Schumacher didn't turn a blind eye to the campier past instantiations of the character.Batman Forever has Batman (Val Kilmer) battling two different villains--Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey). The film tells of the villains' origins (Two-Face's is told much more briefly, through a flashback). It also features yet another tortured romantic entanglement between Batman and a blonde--this time it is Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a published psychiatrist whose work Batman has read, and who has a kind of obsessive fascination with the caped crusader (and other deviant or psychotic personalities). The villains are both working on world-domination plans, naturally enough (although starting locally), and the film eventually introduces the origin story of Batman sidekick Robin (Chris O'Donnell).One thing I like better about Batman Forever is that Schumacher decides to spend a lot more time with Batman. In interviews that Tim Burton has given, including those in the book Burton on Burton (first published in 1995), he seemed to not know what to do with the character. Burton expressed concern that Batman needed to be grounded in reality, and there needed to be some justification for him dressing up as he does to fight crime. It's a problem I'm not sure Burton ever solved for himself, and as a result, he spends much more time on other characters.Schumacher, on the other hand, seems very comfortable with the character. He still gives him the same kind of ""reality grounding"" and the same kind of dark disposition with a touch of sarcasm/smarminess (Keaton's Batman had this as well), but Batman Forever gives the audience a chance to emotionally step into Bruce Wayne's world. At the same time, Schumacher loses none of the focus on the film's villains. There is a fine balance. Plus, the villains seem better constructed here. We have a clear sense of who they are, what their goals are, and why they are doing what they're doing. That combination didn't exist for Burton's Joker, Penguin or Catwoman, who all had some cloudy aspects in terms of motivation and goals. These factors make for a more engaging story.Stylistically--when it comes to production design, cinematography, and overall atmosphere--Burton can't be beat for what he does, but Schumacher has his own admirable approach. Just as our entry into Batman's world is a bit more open here, so is our entry into the world of Gotham City. Schumacher often uses brighter colors, occasionally almost garish (I like that look--just check out my own artwork), and he has much more broader expanses of architecture, occasionally with a much more open feel. Much of the darkness and claustrophobia of the Burton production design is still present, but in patches. Schumacher takes a more varied approach--heck, there's even a scene here shot in bright, clear daylight. Schumacher's cinematography is also more varied in terms of a greater breadth of exaggerated comic book angles and perspectives, and he occasionally gives us sequences of very quick and glossy insert shots that almost have the feel of a slick, high-budget television commercial. For my money, that works well in this context.The Riddler and Two-Face are far better integrated here than were The Penguin and Catwoman in Batman Returns--both with the film overall and with each other. Carrey and Jones are given a chance to play off of each other's energy and style, and as different as they are, their chemistry is excellent. For viewers who aren't normally fans of Carrey's comic work, his performance might be a bit difficult to take at times, but he's really just giving a superbly satirical take on Frank Gorshin's Riddler--he's just cranked up both the camp and psychosis levels to 11.And speaking of psychoses, this is the first Batman film in my view where there is an effective sense of danger from the villains. It may be because Burton has said that he rarely sees anyone in terms of just good or evil, but his villains tend to come across more like Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990) monsters--you'd just as likely want to hang out with them as with Batman (although don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Nightbreed and Burton's lovable freaks, too). Schumacher directs Carrey and Jones to project visceral, out-of-control menace, yet he still manages to make them multi-faceted.Even though Burton's films can't escape camp--I'm skeptical that it would be possible (and it certainly isn't desirable, in my view) with Batman--Schumacher differs by giving a number of strong nods to the intentionally campy past Batmans, including Carrey's Riddler and Robin giving us a ""Hol(e)y rusted metal, Batman"" near the end. I suppose your opinion of the merit of this would be correlated to your view of the Adam West Batman. As I mentioned, I loved West's version, so I'm not at all bothered by the nods to it here. I'm a huge fan of camp.But the bottom line for me is that Batman Forever just flows better than the two previous films. There's a flow to the story, sequences, and scenes that makes the film coherent, captivating and relatively taut. I know it's not cool--I'll lose any chance of Batman fanboy membership--for saying it, but I love this film. Now it's off to re-watch Batman & Robin and see how many people I can make furious with me about that one!",Batman Forever
99,Sirus_the_Virus,I think it's the best of the original Batman films.,8,25 August 2009,"Most people would definitely disagree with me on this statement. But of the non Christopher Nolan Batman films, I like Batman Forever the most. Of course it's far from The Dark Knight or Batman Begins. That's why I say of the non-Christopher Nolan Batman films. There is something about Batman Forever that works very well. I know it doesn't have the creepiness or seriousness that the first two had. But in this film, we have Jim Carrey to lighten up the series. Carrey is probably what makes the movie for me. Any film that Carrey is in that is supposed to be serious turns out not to be. I am convinced that Tommy Lee Jones is a villain. I suppose Jim Carrey is villainous as The Riddler. Jim Carrey brings more of a mood the third time around. I know that some of the film is corny. But for some reason I like it more than both Batman and Batman Returns. I know Val Kilmer isn't as good as Michael Keaton. I know Joel Schumacher isn't as good as Tim Burton. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.The Plot: Batman returns once again to stop The Villainous Two-Face and stop The Riddler from brainwashing everyone.",Batman Forever

Why Tommy Lee-Jones?Why does Two-Face jump up and down constantly and giggle like a girl... But Riddler was he flamboyant... C'mon people green with ?

102,gizmomogwai,Time has not been kind to this movie,5,19 March 2009,"I was 11 when this movie came out, and I loved it. That's not surprising- I was part of the obvious target audience. It wasn't just the infamous next movie- Batman and Robin, also directed by Joel Schumacher- that later opened my eyes to Batman Forever's flaws. As I matured, and learned that less is more, Forever's weaknesses became more apparent. And it only looks worse after 2008, more than a decade after it came out, now that we've seen a different, better take on Two-Face in The Dark Knight.This movie's shortcomings are plentiful- whereas the Burton Batman movies were dark and stylish and the Nolan Batman movies were dark and semi-realistic, Batman Forever is loud, colourful, over the top and obnoxious. Examples? Tommy Lee Jones is loudly obnoxious as Two-Face, yelling and laughing maniacally and crying in agony whenever Batman survives one of his attempts to kill him. There are obnoxious glowsticks used in a couple of different scenes. Jim Carrey as the Riddler has some of the same problems- overdoing it, for example, where he pretends to mourn his boss, whom he actually killed. His humour, including a joke about a mole, is cheesy. ""Was that over the top?"" the Riddler asks at one point. ""I can never tell."" No kidding.I'm not sure what's worse, though, the style or the plot. I've heard people defending Schumacher by saying scenes were cut that could have made this movie darker and better. But reading about these scenes, even if they had been kept, they wouldn't take away from the fact that the Riddler sucks up everyone's intelligence with a 3-D toy. That's just ridiculous.What was Schumacher thinking? He meant this movie to be mindless fun. To this end, there are explosions, high-tech gadgets, and action; this is the most commercial of the Batman movies and it indeed did well at the box office. For those of us looking for a more meaningful movie, though, there's little appeal here. The good- We get to see some of Batman's psychology, and Robin is older than the comics version which makes him more believable, and Nicole Kidman gets naked (but we don't see anything). Val Kilmer's also mastered Batman's voice, better than Christian Bale anyway.But, as I said, a problem is that the Two-Face of this movie looks bad compared to the Two-Face of The Dark Knight. This includes in visuals- the CGI Two-Face looks fantastic in The Dark Knight, but here it's just bad purple colouring. This also includes in writing- in The Dark Knight he's more of a tragic villain, and we see his good side, as he's Harvey Dent for most of the movie. He's conflicted. Here he just wants to kill Batman, and doesn't think twice about it. It's rare that he tosses his coin, and when he does the coin rarely comes up tails.The result? Batman Forever won't last forever. It's better just ignored.",Batman Forever
103,emasterslake,A worthy sequel.,7,18 April 2006,"Just watched it for the first time ever recently.I enjoyed the first 2 BatMan movies. And kept hearing that this ones good too. Course the only downer is that Micheal Keaton isn't back as BatMan and Tim Burton is only producer for this one.Hear are my thoughts on it: BatMan Forever introduces 2 new threats in Gotham City. First one is 2-Face who was originally Harvey, with a split personality where he's sometimes the regular good guy and the other half is where he looses his temper. Either way he determines his decision by flipping a coin that has a good side and a bad side on it.The other one is Riddler, a geeky scientist who invented a new way of viewing TV. His boss describes him as a nut and won't improved on the idea. This drove him mad, like a madman. He's so determined to know more knowledge and wants to be where the Fat Cats are. Which give him the opportunity to sell his product that's a connection with a generator that gives him more knowledge than an average human being. All this knowledge gives him advantage over the crime wave with the power of ""riddles"" These 2 insane characters will be BatMan's most difficult challenge yet. And with a new girl friend(who has the hots for BatMan) and giving a teenager a home(who has nowhere to go) will be quite a twist.This BatMan movie is good but not as perfect as the first 2. If Tim Burton was director of this movie then we'd see this 3rd one to have the same charm as the first 2 did. It has some good actors in it. If it weren't for Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey's performances as the main villains then this movie would of suck.Val Kilmer was as good as Micheal Keaton's role as BatMan but not better. I prefer one of those 2 actor instead of Christen Bale who I dislike as BatMan.I recommend it to the die-hard BatMan fan as well as the Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey fans. Tim Burton fans might just rent it and see it for yourselves.",Batman Forever
104,reddiemurf81,"Not near as good as what came before,, but worth watching",6,17 April 2020,"Haven't watched this one for awhile (probably 10-15 yrs), and I still think what I thought then. Not great, not bad,, worth watching.Kilmer was good as Batman, at least in this adaptation (preferred Keaton, but still). Would've preferred he'd continued the role in the next movie,, it might've actually been ok.Carrey and Jones,, not bad,, not great,, memorable.O'Donnell,,, ha,,, could've been worse,,,,Kidman,,, dang she looked great in this one!Go watch it!!",Batman Forever
105,hall895,"Holy fiasco, Batman!",3,8 February 2012,"Tim Burton had great success with his first Batman film. Then came Batman Returns and many people, not without reason, complained the movie was too dark. The studio agreed and decided that going forward they wanted a more family-friendly Batman film franchise. Exit Burton, enter Joel Schumacher. The result? Disaster. Batman Forever is as abominably awful as movies get. It's like the campy television series. Except the TV show was fun because everyone involved in making it knew it was a joke and was in on the joke. Schumacher is actually serious with this pile of film excrement. This really is his vision of what Batman should be. It would be impossible for that vision to have been any more misguided.Michael Keaton had the good sense to walk away when Burton left the director's chair so we've got a new guy in the Batsuit. A Batsuit now complete with Bat-nipples by the way. Seriously, Joel? Nipples? Anyhow Val Kilmer's the new Batman and he's actually not bad. Unfortunately he's overshadowed by the actors playing the two villains. There's Jim Carrey as Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Carrey and Jones spend the entire movie engaging in a competition to see who can overact the most. This is a competition in which there are no winners, only losers with us unfortunate audience members the biggest losers of all. You sign up Carrey to play Riddler you know you're going to get an absurdly over the top performance, that's who Carrey is. But Tommy Lee Jones what on Earth were you thinking? When right at the film's start you see Two-Face hopping up and down and giggling like a schoolgirl when he thinks he's killed Batman you know this character and this movie are headed to some truly awful places. Two-Face isn't menacing, he's a joke and an unfunny joke at that. OK, the studio wanted a more family-friendly movie but come on now this is ridiculous. Oh by the way, if this movie wasn't cheesy enough I have one word for you. Robin. Everything about this character fails so miserably I don't even know where to begin so I'll just ignore him best I can and move on.The dark and gloomy Gotham we saw in the first two movies Schumacher has turned into some kind of Day-Glo amusement park attraction. Schumacher's Gotham comes complete with a band of face-painted, neon-wearing toughs whose weapons of choice are apparently glow sticks. The look of the movie is so completely wrong. The tone of it misses the mark entirely. The story is absurd and not at all compelling. Some of the acting is as bad as any you will ever see. Carrey and Jones are terrible but a special mention too for Joe Grifasi who in playing a bank guard taken hostage in the opening scene delivers one of the most cringe-inducing performances you will ever see. He plays the damsel in distress part wonderfully. Only problem is he's not a damsel. Impossible not to laugh at this guy. Will Batman save him? Who cares? Give Kilmer credit for if nothing else coming through this movie with his dignity intact, no small feat with all the nonsense around him. Nicole Kidman's not bad playing the requisite love interest and Michael Gough is always a treat as Alfred. Everyone else involved in making this movie should hang their heads in shame. There are so many awful things about Joel Schumacher's Batman movie. Perhaps the most awful thing of all? They let him make another one.",Batman Forever
106,Beta_Gallinger,"No more than average, with an unsatisfactory script, lacklustre performances, and always unfunny attempts at comic relief",5,1 April 2010,"The first two installments in Warner Bros. Pictures' Batman movie franchise, ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", were directed by Tim Burton and both turned out to be entertaining blockbusters for more than one reason, even if the first one is better. However, Joel Schumacher then took over to direct this third film, and unfortunately really brought the franchise down. I knew there was a movie called ""Batman Forever"" around the time it was released or very shortly afterwards, but never actually saw it until late 2005, shortly after watching its two predecessors. I can hardly remember my first viewing of this 1995 Batman flick, but can remember thinking it was mediocre, which didn't change with a second viewing nearly 4 ½ years later.Batman's latest foe in Gotham City is Two-Face, formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent. One side of his face was severely disfigured by acid, and he is now a lunatic who threatens the city and likes to make his decisions with the flip of a coin! He wrongly believes Batman is responsible for his deformation and wants the local superhero killed! After a battle between Batman and Two-Face, which ends with the villain's escape, it isn't long before another madman threatens Gotham City! Edward Nygma, a scientist who works for Wayne Enterprises, has invented a device which can manipulate human brainwaves, but the invention is too dangerous and is rejected by Bruce Wayne. This sends the scientist into frenzy, killing his supervisor, making it look like a suicide, and then quitting his job! He then creates himself an evil alter ego, the Riddler, and begins to use his invention to read the thoughts of other Gotham City residents and gain power and knowledge for his evil intentions! The Riddler also teams up with Two-Face!1989's ""Batman"" features Jack Nicholson as the Joker, a demented and comical villain portrayed very well by the actor. In 1992's ""Batman Returns"", Danny DeVito doesn't do as good a job as Penguin, but is still impressive. After ""Batman Forever"" starts, we are quickly introduced to another goofy madman out to terrorize Gotham City, Two-Face, played here by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones' performance here is clearly supposed to be funny, but fails miserably! It seems to me that he tried too hard to be like Nicholson as the Joker, and the results were just pathetic! Sadly, Jim Carrey isn't any better as Dr. Edward Nygma/the Riddler. This is also clearly meant for comic relief, but is also quite pathetic! I noticed a number of scenes in the film which I could tell were meant to be funny, but none of them even made me smile! Val Kilmer is okay as Bruce Wayne/Batman I guess, but he's no match for Michael Keaton. Nicole Kidman does a rather poor job in the role of Dr. Chase Meridian, Bruce Wayne's love interest in this film, and the romantic aspect of the movie is generally poorly crafted. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin is another major problem. This character is an arrogant idiot who does some stupid things, such as riding around in the Batmobile and claiming to be Batman! He's SO much like the movie version of Johnny Storm in ""Fantastic Four"", another lacklustre superhero film released ten years after this one! Schumacher might be largely responsible for the lacklustre performances in this particular film. In addition to the problems with the cast, characters, and humour, the script is also disappointing, rushing into the action too soon without properly introducing Two-Face to the audience until later, and it may sometimes be a little hard to follow.Tim Burton was one of the producers for this third installment in the Warner Bros. Batman movie franchise, but unlike the first two, he didn't direct it, and it shows. This first Batman film directed by Joel Schumacher, of two, is average at best, though some parts may be below average. There are some great visuals and sets, and I guess it is MILDLY exciting at times, but unfortunately, these are the only good things I can say about this mess, and they are far from enough to make up for everything that helps sink the film. Apparently, Robin Williams was considered for the role of the Riddler, and if that had happened, it may not have helped THAT much, but maybe at least SOME of the humour would have worked. While Jim Carrey is funny in some films, I could imagine Williams doing a slightly better job here, even with a weak script, and even if he wasn't as consistently funny as he has sometimes been. He can't save every film he appears in, but I think I would have found it hard to keep a straight face ALL the way through with him in the cast. Anyway, if you like good adrenaline-inducing comic book movies, I would say Burton's two Batman efforts are good choices, but not this one, and it only got worse with Schumacher's VERY poorly received 1997 follow-up, ""Batman & Robin""!",Batman Forever
107,vip_ebriega,"Not brilliant, but Schumacher makes it colorful enough to cover for his bad direction and plotting.",6,29 September 2007,"My Take: Eye candy with very little substance. Pleasant enough.After BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS, I felt that the Dark Knight has finally gotten the justice he deserved, which was much missed on the campy cheesy Adam West BATMAN series. The character received its deserving dark tone and character development within two of Tim Burton's versions. Yet, somehow, history has repeated itself when Joel Schumacher released his version called BATMAN FOREVER. Still, it's not as camp as the 60's series, but just about as pale.Val Kilmer, though, does give a worthy performance as Bruce Wayne, replacing Michael Keaton. Adding some deep seriousness to his character, but without losing the charm of a comic book hero. The villains, played by Tommy Lee Jones (as Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent) and Jim Carrey (as Edward ""The Riddler"" Nigma), lack the real humanity and dark comic tradition of the villains in the previous BATMAN films by Burton (who actually produced this film), but both villains are quite delightful, despite their shallowness and annoyance. Besides, speaking of being annoying, that role goes to Chris O' Donnell's character of Robin, which is simply their to annoy the audience, and give sidekicks a bad name. Sure, we understand, his parents are killed by Two Face, but, seriously, couldn't he be more annoying? Schumacher is not born to make these kind of movies. He doesn't know exactly what he's dealing with and what to do about them. They should have left Burton on the boat. Okay, so what if his first BATMAN films were criticized for being too gloomy. Batman is meant to be that way, something some other critics don't understand.BATMAN FOREVER is average fare, but average at best. It gives you that feeling of it being good, but you know it could be better. In the case of BATMAN FOREVER, soooo much better. Not Brilliant, but Schumacher makes it colorful enough to cover for his bad direction and plotting. Now, if only he could have removed a lot of unnecessary characters (Robin was big annoyance, while Drew Barrymore, a great young actress, in the role of a well-decorated servant, wasn't much in use) and just stick to it's original flow, it would have been at least a better film and i would have given it ***1/2 rating. Rating: *** out of 5.",Batman Forever
108,CitizenCaine,"A Lighter, More Enjoyable Batman",7,20 September 2003,"This film, the third in the modern series, is lighter and more enjoyable than the other three. The first two, directed by Tim Burton, are more dark and noir-like; the villains were more evil. The sets and special effects overwhelmed both movies. In the third movie, Batman Forever, the sets and effects are terrific again, but the story does a much better job of balancing those. The villains, played by Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, are a stark contrast to Jack Nicholson's Joker and Danny Devito's penguin. They play the riddler and false face as over the top, which was more consistent in tone to the TV series with Adam West. More interesting is the origin of Robin in this film and Batman's/Bruce Wayne's pursuit of Dr. Chase Meridian. These story lines balance the caped crusader's fight against the riddler and false face nicely. The soundtrack is exhilarating as usual. The problem I see with this and all the Batman films is that Batman is never that believable of a hero. He doesn't seem imposing enough. However, it's less of a problem in this film; because, the villains are more light and less imposing themselves than in the other films. Everyone has an idea of what Batman should be like, which is why no one Batman movie will satisfy everyone in terms of action, character, effects, music, plot, and sets. However, this one does a better job than any of the previous ones in satisfying the masses. *** of 4 stars.",Batman Forever

110,Stampsfightclub,Clichés run riot but Kilmer and Carrey make up for it,7,31 October 2008,"Gotham City's crime fighter Batman (Kilmer) is in trouble as his past catches up with him in his nightmares. As he desperately tries to solve his past, villains Two Face and the Riddler cause havoc in the city.Batman Forever has one of those openings that you either love or hate. Two Face is causing trouble in Gotham and when we see Batman arrive in a typical hero shot, the tone for a hero driven film is set. Having never seen this film when it was first released, I am unable to comment on its reception and how it shaped the generation. Now with the wonderful darkness and mystery in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and Dark Knight there is a feeling of convention and normality in the superhero genre in Forever.Filled with predictability and a normality that will have you turning away, Forever doesn't add much extra to the tone that was set by Tim Burton in the previous couple of films. The car, cave and other tools in the Batman's Arsenal were already set and are simply repeated here.Despite the normality, there is still a sense of interest and excitement and hardcore fans won't be let down by the testament to the comics.This third Batman film also has some great performances. Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) has created a wonderful villain in the Riddler.Filled with madness and creativity, the Riddler is more entertaining than the Mask and creates that wonderful charisma that very few can pull off and plaudits must be aimed at Carrey who is the star of the show. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal as Two Face is disappointing when juxtaposed next to Carrey's Riddler. Harvey Dent / Two Face feels very ordinary, with the coin flipping and the silly screams if Batman foils him makes him foolish and a lesser figure because of it. To be fair the writing wasn't the best for Two face, as it was more focused on cementing the background for The Riddler. The two work well together and create some dramatic and exciting action sequences and is worth the wait come the end of the film.There is plenty of hero clichés thrown in for Kilmer's Batman, such as the overcoming of difficulties, just in time moments and cheesy lines.Give Kilmer praise for outshining Keaton as his portrayal of the crime fighter is dark but also more relaxed and enjoyable. Kidman makes an intriguing protagonist but Chris O'Donnell's Robin feels like the ultimate action cliché.Despite the terrible use of hero clichés, Carrey and Kilmer make the film ultimately light hearted and enjoyable in good action fantasy.",Batman Forever
111,Mister-6,POW! BAFF! BOOM!,8,2 September 1999,"Okay, so ""Batman Forever"" is more a throwback to the old '60s series than it is the dark, sinister vision brought in by Burton's first two efforts.  I can see why they did this.The second movie (""Batman Returns"") was a little too dark and forbidding to be considered entertainment.  Kids watch movies like that and get scared to death.  Of course, maybe that's what Burton had in mind.  I dunno....As far as entertainment value, however, ""Forever"" has it covered all over the place.  The atmosphere carries over some of the sinister elements of the first two ""Batman"" movies, while still introducing a sense of fun that the second movie especially was missing.Kilmer's acting job was neither too heavy nor light.  There is still the sense of loss, despair and tragedy in his face, but there's moreover a man-of-action air that (in my opinion) Keaton's performance lacked.Of course, the villains in these movies get the best scenes, and how could they not?  Especially when they're Carrey and Jones as Riddler and Two-Face (respectively).  Carrey's manic madcap and Jones' violent outbursts sprinkled with occasional flashes of calm are a perfect match. 
Kidman exudes sensuality as Meridian, who feels strongly attracted between two men (little realizing they are the same man).  Her scenes with Batman, admittedly, add up to more than what Kim Basinger's and Michael Keaton's did in the original.  At least they simmer well together.O'Donnell, as Robin, is kind of stiff as if he isn't sure what he's doing in this movie.  He improves later on, but it's like he has to wait and see what everyone else is doing then catch up.  The best part, of course, is Alfred the Butler (Gough), always full of sage advice and snide comments.  Of course, he and Commissioner Gordon (Hingle) are the real veterans here, right from the beginning of the series. 
Of course, the story is filled with all kinds of psychological observations, thoughts on love, whether justice through anger is true justice, and so forth.  All balanced out by huge sets, flashy special effects and Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar as Two-Face's hench-persons. 
Drew and Debi, now there's a couple of special effects.All in all, it's a good adventure and if you like your movies big and flashy, ""Batman Forever"" is your hero.Eight stars.  The Dark Knight lives!",Batman Forever
112,DarthBill,"It's not the best, but it's got Bob's favorite Batman",7,7 February 2004,"Of the six actors to play Batman - Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney - Val Kilmer was always Bob Kane's favorite. Or at least, Bob Kane, creator of Batman, said that he thought Val was the best choice out of the bunch.Well, Val Kilmer's Batman has his work cut out for him as he does battle with Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face and Jim Carrey's Riddler. While not battling the two maniacs he's either hitting on - or being hit on by - Nicole Kidman's psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, or he's trying to persuade Chris O'Donnell's Dick Grayson/Robin that a life of crime fighting is really no life at all (because really he doesn't want other people to suffer through what he suffers).Val Kilmer is a capable Batman, but given his past performances in ""The Doors"" (which wasn't very good, to be honest) and ""Tombstone"" (which was good) he should have been better, but he does what he can to weigh down this CGI-powered, light hearted romp. Doubtlessly, after ""Batman Returns"" and the creation of the Batman animated series Warner Brothers probably wanted to tone things down a bit, but how they could have gone this far is beyond me. Kilmer's not bad as it is, but if he'd been working with Tim Burton he probably would have been even better.It's all a shame really, because this film actually tried to shift focus to Batman as opposed to letting the villains have the lime light. If the film hadn't been so goofy it might have worked, but the film IS goofy and it can't seem to decide if it wants to be serious or self-parody. Without Kilmer in ""Batman & Robin"" it looked even worse.The other actors are fine. Jones seems to be having fun in a change of pace role, Kidman is a more believable love interest with a more believable relationship to Bruce Wayne than Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale and O'Donnell is a decent Robin, and of course, Michael Gough as the loveable Alfred. The real disappointment is actually Jim Carrey as the Riddler. It basically feels like he's doing Ace Ventura only as a villain, but it's hard to take him seriously as a villain because, well, he's Jim. Some have complained about the Riddler's flamboyancy in this film, as his behavior occasionally suggests borderline latent homosexuality, and since this was supposed to be a ""kid friendly"" superhero film, that might make some parents question it. Speaking of sexual overtones, how about Nicole getting friendly with Batman (not to mention the scene where she appears naked except for her silken white blanket?).Well, if you're looking a no brainer, look no further.",Batman Forever

114,ivo-cobra8,Criminally underrated a guilty pleasure of mine my childhood favorite batman movie,8,12 May 2017,"Criminally underrated solid and very decent superhero Batman Forever. As a kid it was my all time favorite superhero movie I love the character Batman I love him to death. This is my fourth and last favorite Batman film in the franchise in my honest opinion it is MILES way better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel, Batman Begins, Batman & Robin and The Dark Knight Rises those movies suck a dick! It is not a bad movie it is very decent and very solid superhero action film that goes fast around, it is not boring, it is good and entertaining my guilty pleasure. Starring Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Chris O'Donnell, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Tim Burton, based on the DC Comics character Batman. It is the third installment of the initial Batman film series. I LOVE the 90s and I love this movie to death! It defines my childhood, I grew up with this movie and it has a special place in my heart. When I first heard that Hollywood is making the third Batman movie I wanted so badly to go in the theater and see this movie. Sadly my father never drove me to the movie seeing it. I asked him, I bagged him, he did not quarantined my wish. So my mom bought me a Batman Forever (Comic Adaptation) and I read it every night in my bed, I still have that comic I am keeping it. My mom bough me Batman Forever sticker album and I collect stickers and glue them and I also still have it. I am big Batman fanboy and I admit, Batman Forever is my guilty pleasure. The movie has an excellent cast, good plot, lot's of action, very solid superhero Batman, cool villains, lot's of humor from Jim Carrey, it is less dark but still a cool movie.Batman Forever (1995) Batman must battle Two-Face and The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.Val Kilmer did a very decent and solid excellent job as Bruce Wayne/Batman I have enjoy it. It goes very fast around, it is not slow it is not boring and I understood what the movie was about and when it stood for. Batman in here was an excellent superhero, he kicked a lot of ass, he kicked bad guys, in the opening scene he saved a security guard in the vault who was a hostage, he saved Dick Grayson and Dr. Chase Meridian when they fall down, he defeat The Riddler and he destroy Riddler's brainwave collecting device , he defeat Harvey Dent on the end of the movie, by determining their fate with the flip coin, Batman throw a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to fall in to his death. He destroys the helicopter, he jumps trough window makes a flip side kick's Harvey's Dent gang by kicking their asses, he drives with batmobil on the wall and Harvey destroys with rocket launcher his gang's cars missing the batmobil and making a huge explosions. He fly Batplane destroys Riddler's brainwave lasers in the air and he saves Robin in the water. He was a decent likable superhero and I like it.I enjoy Nicole Kidman in this movie as Dr. Chase Meridian she was excellent, gorgeous and very sexy beautiful Bruce Wayne's/ Batman's love interest, she was miles ways better as Michelle Pfeiffer, Katie Holmes that sucked ass and Anne Hathaway. I love Kim Basinger and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Jim Carrey was great a The Riddler he was really funny and I liked him, I liked his humor he put smile on my face. Tommy Lee Jones was again a bad guy in the Warner Bros. film, the first time he was a villain in Under Siege and this time he is again a villain. Well acted from Tommy Lee Jones he did good in his performance.I love the make up, special effect I love the costumes for Batman, Two-Face and The Riddler. I Love the soundtracks: Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me by U2, Kiss From A Rose by Seal and Smash It Up by The Offspring. Last and at least Dick Grayson was great he saved Batman, he saved all those people in the circus from the bomb who was set by Two-Face and he kicked Harvey's ass by the end I love that scene. I have few problems: I don't like the music score by Elliot Goldenthal I thought he did a poor job making a song for Batman film. I rather prefer Danny Elfman. The design for batmobil was poor and sh***. The new bat suit on the end of the film was awful and it wasn't a Batman from the first two movies. Batman shouldn't have a partner, he doesn't need it he should have been alone. I would cut Robin out of the movie.Batman Forever get's 8/10 a B+ for been a really solid Batman movie and it is my favorite Batman film. Criminally underrated doesn't deserve the hate! 8/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Warner Bros.

115,fernandoschiavi,Lighter and visually attractive for the whole family...the wrong path,5,8 August 2015,"In 1995, comes to theaters worldwide the third adventure of Batman, surrounded by expectations, anxiety, and recklessness. The Reason? Warner Bros. ha the vision that Batman Returns was darker than should be, and attributed this to the fact a bit away the audience's movie theaters: children - due to pitch dark, Gothic and heavier created by Tim Burton, in his conception of Gotham City and the tone of the characters. Then trying to disentangle this grim and violent climate of the franchise, the producer decided to go another route, lighter and visually attractive for the whole family. And she hardly knew what was going down the wrong path. Tim Burton then went to work only as a producer, alongside Peter Macgregor-Scott, and Michael Keaton was not chosen to return as the main character. Joel Schumacher then takes the franchise. First of all, he had two problems. The first would be to find a new Batman. And Val Kilmer was chosen. The second problem that had to be faced was recreating a Gotham City already established and assembled in the minds of viewers and show a vision less heavy and more enticing to attract more women and children. The director chose to abandon the gargoyles and then parts observing the presence of a more obscure, but continued with skyscrapers and bet on spectacular monuments, giving a gigantic scale and more refined to the city. But the main change was in the same color palette for the art direction of Barbara Ling and photography Stephen Goldblatt, who along with director, included high doses of light and neon lights in every scene, leaving aside completely dark and dangerous atmosphere of Gotham, and putting New York, where was the new Gotham. The script is just smart and belittles the intelligence of the viewer. He clearly assumes a tone of humor excessive and still tries to get serious, as to tell the story of Robin. There are too many side stories, but unlike shown in Batman-The Return, everything is on the screen and played very poorly developed. We have two villains, a love interest for the hero and the emergence of its ally, Robin.Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne unconvincing, since it seems to be acting without motivation. He has the same look of boredom the whole movie. Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the character Two-Face of an extremely childlike laughter forced crying and trying to transpire insanity every look, blatantly trying to emulate the crazy Joker Jack Nicholson. The interpretation of Jones, at least, suits the tone of the film, leading Two-Face in an allegorical way, extravagant and extremely ridiculous. The episode where he is hit by acid during the trial is quickly shown in the film, but no mention of the split personality is left out, or any reason that led former prosecutor admired Gotham to descend into the evil side without any apparent humanity.The Riddler Jim Carrey is going down the same path of the Two-Face. In the film, the Riddler creates a machine that allows you to discover all the secrets that people have and joins the Two- Face to defeat Batman. Carrey is a great actor, but since the film's tone demanded something more theatrical, he used and abused all faces who knows. Vive hopping and voice intoning every sentence, also in an acting ridiculous. Yet he stands showing the side of her comic and grim Riddler.The villains were not developed. Here are just caricatures with extravagant costumes. But if the villains do not excite much, in the category women, the film is very well represented. If we lost Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, Drew Barrymore is beautiful, sensual playing Sugar, one of Two-Face women and Nicole Kidman is stated as one of the most beautiful and sexy women in Hollywood and even with a character through nymphomaniac can give some importance and depth to it.The costumes and art direction were very criticized. The uniform of the Batman in this film would undoubtedly be the most beautiful of these first three films, if the costume designers had not had the bright idea of putting nipples on the armor. The visual Harvey does not cause such a controversy and is acceptable, but the glue of the Riddler is horrible. Elegant and beautiful even, only the costumes of Dr. Chase Meridian. Neither the Batmobile stopped being ridiculed, and even having a body like the other films, it boasts dozens of lights and a shiny wheel with a bat. And what about the ""Intruder Alert"" in the Batcave? The least secret secret cave in the world and has an alarm saying that intruders is triggered. Does Batman have insurance with some of these companies to protect residential Batcave? Even Batman is concerned about the safety of his cave'. Totally unnecessary.The soundtrack not only fulfills the proposed impress at any time. Elliot Goldenthal was chosen to compose the score. In addition to the orchestrated songs, the track was commercially successful since tried to make the film more pop.Even with all these factors, there are moments in the first film laudable Schumacher. The action scenes are relatively better and grander - like chase and the opening scene in which Batman thwarts the robbery of Two-Face and the final climax - and even some scenes forced to the extreme, like the Batmobile climbing buildings, can yield interesting moments.This film was also the first time we've seen the last of Bruce Wayne and his quest for revenge - after the death of their parents - even without any further - only flashes of the past. The movie presents good moments, but unfortunately their problems and overcome their very qualities. Get up to fun and thrill at various times in some action scenes (many randomly inserted), but that's it. Fun fast and distorts many facts and characters of comics.",Batman Forever
116,Agent_Iris,The Schumacher era begins,4,13 October 2020,"Since Warner Brothers was not happy with how Tim Burton made Batman Returns a little too dark to sell toys to children, they decided to pull a 180° Bat-turn with this film.Now, Gotham city looks like it was thrown up on by a neon para-demon, all the characters (especially the villains) have been retconned to their campy 1960s equivalents and the Batsuit now comes equipped with nipples.Tommy Lee Jones gives the worst performance of his career as Two-face, where he tries to out Jim Carrey Jim Carrey's Riddler at chewing the scenery.Robin is added to the Batman Universe here and is played by Chris O'Donnell as a whiny, annoying twit.Val Kilmer sleepwalks through his performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Nicole Kidman plays a psychologist who flip-flops between wanting to sleep with Batman and Bruce Wayne.The plot, such as it is, is too ridiculous to waste my time in trying to explain. In summary, the villains build a super weapon that the heroes must destroy - or else!Although I remember this film being generally well received at the time, it is SO 1990s and has not aged well at all.The best thing to come out of this glorified toy commercial is ""Kiss from a Rose"" by Seal on the film's soundtrack.",Batman Forever
117,russem31,Well done,8,2 December 2005,"Though I will miss Tim Burton's vision of Batman, Joel Schumacher does a solid job as the directing baton is passed to him. His version of Batman is quite different from Burton, favoring wild color over Gothic darkness, but regardless, the Batmobile is about the same and the Bat Suit itself is at least a continuation from the previous films (until he gets a new suit towards the end of the film that is), so it's not too far of a change as to raise an eyebrow. Not only that, there is reference to Catwoman, just as Batman Returns had a reference to Vicki Vale from the first film. This again adds continuity. And Elliot Goldenthal does as good a job as he can given with the music score given the fact that Danny Elfman's main Batman theme will always remain classic. All in all, this film deserves a solid 8 out of 10.",Batman Forever

121,manitobaman81,Good,7,21 August 2014,"While there is some strong personality being displayed, it is done in a way that is truthful to human nature. There is a real duality to all the characters. Kilmer is able to show that Bruce Wayne isn't being two different people, but one man forced to go against his heart if he wants to survive, in a measured performance. He strikes a rhythm with his role and it combined with the entertainment of a drama that feels real, makes the movie go at a nice pace. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. There are fisticuffs back and forth between those who claim to work for justice. It gives a picture of a backwards society that diminishes reality, where culminating incidents brought by suffered individuals show the truth. Here you will find a bit of realism existing in a delusional world.",Batman Forever
122,perfectbond,Not much here except Jim Carrey,6,13 February 2003,"Given the amount of money Warner Bros. budgeted for this project, the quality of this film was subpar to say the least. It doesn't matter how good the the props, sets, and special effects are and how talented the actors are if there is no quality script to work with. That's the biggest reason for Batman Forever's shortcomings. Another huge negative in my mind is the interpretation of Two-Face Tommy Lee Jones was asked to give. I know there has to be flexibility in translating from the comic page to the screen but Two-Face is more like the Joker than Two-Face in this film. Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, and Chris O'Donnell (what happened to him?) are serviceable in their roles. In my opinion the best thing about Batman Forever is Jim Carrey. He might be slightly over the top once in a while, but boy what a talent. His physicality, his facial expressions, his impressions, his flexible voice, my goodness he is gifted.

But Val Kilmer was just not a very good Batman and Nicole Kidman's character here wasn't interesting at all. On the plus sides Chris O'Donnell was quite a fun Robin, Tommy Lee Jones was effective as Two-Face and Jim Carrey was his usual fun self. But in a Batman film the main actor should really be decent.Action wise it's not bad and has some fun scenes, but the plot isn't great and the music wasn't as good as the first two films in my opinion.5/10: A bit of fun but not a great film",Batman Forever

Did you know that actors are also human beings? I know,right, what a mind blower. It's almost as if the point of acting is to artistically portray human emotions.

126,DarthVoorhees,Good film which has received unfair criticism,10,28 December 2005,"Is Batman Forever the best Batman movie? No far from it but it is a worthy one.I hate Batman & Robin as much as the next movie goer but to say Joel Schumacher is a horrible director because of it is wrong.He excels at creating visually spectacular films.Batman Forever is more fun to look at than any other Batman film.To say Batman Forever doesn't have a dark and psychologically gripping story is false,it may be lighter visually but mentally it matches the Burton films.Bruce Wayne is torn because he doesn't know if he can keep being Batman.He is afraid his life has become cursed because his life has been devoted his work as Batman to revenge.The scenes between him and Dick Grayson are some of the highlights,Dick wants to be his partner but Bruce fears that Dick will become empty like he did.Maybe Kilmer wasn't the best choice but he works well,his Batman is more of a tragic one than Keaton's.As for the villains,I'm not found of the material they gave to Two-Face.Two-Face would never deliver some of the lines he was given in the film.People say Billy Dee Williams would have done better.Yes it would have been interesting to see his portrayal but in the end it was the poor dialog for Two-Face that was the big downfall.On a plus side the make-up effects are spectacular. Jim Carrey's Riddler on the other hand is probably one of his best performances.He effectively portrays a jealous man obsessed with out doing Bruce Wayne.He delivers his dark jokes really well and you can't help but feel disappointed that he hasn't played many villains.The plot is great.The Riddler tries to find and exploit Batman by marketing a box.A home entertainment device that manipulates the brain to produce 3-D television.The Riddler is able to steal people's minds while doing this.He and Two-Face hope to have a box on every television in America so their crimes can never stop and they will become super geniuses.The box plot was a great satire on 90's America if you ask me.Sure Batman Forever has faults but it's fate was unfairly sealed by its sequel.I think Batman Forever has aged the best out of the four movies.I proudly have it in my DVD collection.3.5/4",Batman Forever
127,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Joygasm!""",5,27 August 2020,"Batman Forever was released into theatre's in 1995 three years after Tim Burton gave audiences a darker and gritter take on the caped crusader with the then controversial Batman Returns while the movie wasn't particularly violent or shocking it was certainly aimed at a more mature audience with some scenes showing the more disturbing and ugly sides of one of Batmans most Iconic villains The Penguin (Danny DeVito).Warner Bros decided after Tim Burtons Batman Returns that they wanted the next Batman movie to have a lighter and more comedic tone than the previous movies. This decision was made basically so they could market the movie as being suitable for a younger audience thus selling more children's toys and action figures. The movie even starts with a scene that was shot as part of a McDonald's commercial in which Batman tells his Butler Alfred that he will get drive through for dinner which in the commercial promoted kids Happy Meals with a Batman Forever toy inside this instantly sets the tone for the movie when the very first line out of Batmans mouth is ""No thanks Alfred I'll get drive through"" after that line you just knew that this was a Batman movie not to be taken seriously.The movie stars (Val Kilmer) as Batman who is somewhat okay in the role but he never really added anything of value to the character his performance is still better than (George Clooneys) but then again Kilmer didn't set the bar very high in this movie. The movie also stars (Jim Carrey) as The Riddler. Carreys performance as Riddler is just crazy and whacky as Carrey brings his unique blend of funny voices and physical comedy to the role making for a funny and entertaining Riddler. Also starring in the movie is (Tommy Lee Jones) as Harvey Dent aka Two-Face now before this movie I always saw Jones as a serious actor in movies like The Fugitive and Under Seige but in Batman Forever he's just as crazy and funny as his Co-Star (Jim Carrey) his performance as Two-Face is so over the top and hilarious that you just can't take him seriously even when he's holding people at gunpoint he's cracking jokes it would have been interesting seeing Jones play The Joker in a Batman movie.Batman Forever was directed by Joel Schumacher but was also produced by the previous Batman movies director Tim Burton who also had a small cameo in the movie. The movie was a financial success making more than Batman Returns at the box office but overall it failed to impress both fans and critics but because the movie was technically a financial success a forth Batman movie was greenlit by Warner Bros again directed by Joel Schumacher the infamously bad Batman & Robin (1997) which almost killed the Batman franchise for good.I highly recommend watching Batman Forever not because it's a good Batman movie because it really isn't but simply because of how entertaining and whacky this movie is after watching this interpretation of Batman you will begin to appreciate just how good modern day Batman movies are even the bad ones like Batman V Superman.",Batman Forever
128,timdalton007,Forever Reconsidered,8,24 June 2020,"Conventional wisdom (if there is such a thing) has it that the Batman franchise of the 1990s suffered from diminishing returns. Primarily, that the opening two Tim Burton-directed installments were better than the entries directed by Joel Schumacher. While there is little doubt that Batman & Robin was the nadir of the franchise in this incarnation (if not in the Dark Knight's cinematic career), can the same be said for Batman Forever?This reviewer thinks not.With Burton's Returns having viewed as too dark and maybe a bit too odd for its own good, it's safe to say Forever was a course-correction picture by those making it. Watching the film, it's clear that was the case. There are still traces of Burton's influence in the themes and designs, but, from the opening minutes set to Elliot Goldenthal's rousing but Danny Elfman themeless score, it's clear that this will be a different kettle of fish altogether. It's abundantly clear as Schumacher takes the viewer from the Batcave into a brighter, flashier version of Gotham City than the grimy 1980s NYC inspired depiction Burton's films gave us, one that has a life, an ethos all its own.Indeed, what was the case for Gotham is also the case for the film as a whole. From its action sequences and production design to the Goldenthal score, Forever often eschews the darker edge of Burton for something lighter, pacier, perhaps more playful in places. Yet, it doesn't lose sight of the gothic elements introduced in the earlier films, as the character exploration for Bruce Wayne/Batman, and the twisted duality found in those he faces off against can attest. Forever also goes a step further in exploring Bruce Wayne's headspace, of a hero tiring of being a masked vigilante and perhaps harboring guilt about the event that set him down this path. More than anything else, the film charts a path between the extremes of the two films time would see it sandwiched between in the form of the dark oddness of Returns and toyetic over the top cringe-inducement of Batman & Robin.It's also clear from its Batman. With Burton gone, Michael Keaton left the role of Batman behind, with Val Kilmer stepping into the part. Whereas Keaton had a quirky quality alongside a brooding intelligence, Kilmer brings both intellect and a sense of vulnerability. The latter required for a film that's occupied with Bruce Wayne's headspace, as discussed above. While the film never quite explored in-depth (though further explored in deleted scenes on the DVD release), there's still a sense of wheels turning behind Kilmer's eyes that brings a new dimension to the part. Kilmer also looks good in the Batsuit, a prerequisite, and there's no denying his chemistry with Nicole Kidman's Doctor Chase Meridian either. Watching Kilmer as Batman is like watching George Lazenby playing James Bond: there's a lot of potential in the performance, but it's a shame there's not more of it in later films. For this film, though, one gets the sense of a Batman film actually interested in Batman, rather than using him as an excuse to feature villains one feels Burton might have been more interested in featuring.In some ways, however, the villains are the weak point of the film. The biggest mistake Batman Forever (and Batman & Robin for that matter) makes is that both of its antagonists are over the top. Tommy Lee Jones's Two-Face not as much as Jim Carrey's Riddler, for obvious reasons, but there's a need for a more anchored threat to be there, the straight man, to use a comedic term. Instead, viewers get a duo who seem to be trying to upstage each other, leaving the film feeling out of balance. Jones, though, has some solid moments on his own early on, particularly his opening lines, before the role descends into theatricality. It's Carrey who steals the show, and how could he not with his antics on full display, even if they're not generally to the film's benefit.Over the last two decades, it's become easy to lump Batman Forever in with Batman & Robin, writing off both films. While fair in the case of that film, it is not something Forever deserves. For it charted a path all its own, bringing a lighter sense to proceedings while also picking up the pace a bit. Yet, unlike the film that followed it, it didn't lose sight of the Gothic roots of the character, and the cinematic works that proceeded it. The result might not be up to the heights (dizzying for some) of Burton's 1989 film, but it's an immensely watchable piece of work.And one can think of nothing better to say about the late Joel Schumacher's first, and best, Batman outing.",Batman Forever
129,gigan-92,"""Did you all take stupid pills this morning?""",3,4 January 2011,"Often regarded as the lesser of two evils, honestly not by much. I just re-visited the movie in hopes my assumptions were wrong. After all, I hadn't seen it in well over ten years, but Joel Schumacher didn't fail to disappoint. I rate this film lower than an F (5 stars), due to the fact that not only is this (along with ""Batman and Robin"") simply a bad movie, it literally attempts to destroy the very essence of Batman and Gotham City. Schumacher, clearly searching hard for a way to capitalize/'distinguish' himself from the work of Tim Burton, turns Gotham into a neon-highlighter cityscape. Even the thugs in all their maligned-intent want to glow-in-the-dark. The setting and atmosphere are already off, so let's see how else our director tried to kill Batman.Val Kilmer is the worst Bruce Wayne ever, topping Adam West by far, trying hard to be at times funny like Keaton but failing miserably. Every joke comes off as terribly corny. There is no tortured soul within this Wayne. So, in turn our director in essence rips the heart and soul out of Batman, and all that the character stands for. A close up of nipples (wtf?) on the Bat suit as well as a close up of Batman's ass do little to amuse me, only make me wonder why anyone would view it as funny.Chris O'Donnell plays Robin, who I was so bored by I was left indifferent about him. Let me say that as much as I admire Jim Carey, he simply didn't belong in this movie. Nicole Kidman was purely eye-candy and Tommy Lee Jones humiliated himself as Two-Face, a raping of the original character who even in the show was a much darker and more complex character. This was merely a rip off of the original from '89. Plus there are so many cleavage and eye-candy shots of women in this flick it's hard to believe this was even considered a more child-friendly Batman movie at all. And the plot, if you'd like to call it one, was written by eight year olds on speed, and was utterly hopeless from the start. And need I remind everyone the score was as dismal as the next movie's.I guess after all that the only thing left to ask, which is to the people who re view this positively, is ""Did you all take stupid pills this morning?""- Toy Story (1995)",Batman Forever
130,sashank_kini-1,I don't want THIS Batman forever!,5,14 January 2009,"You may notice that my summary and my score contradict each other as my summary may sound very nasty. But what I mean is that I don't want this character to be Batman forever. The movie by itself is fairly entertaining. Its extremely loud with cheesy action and stuffs that could make an intellectual's brain go crazy.But I may pass this movie for its loud action and somewhat entertaining performance by Jim Carrey. But I felt that his character was flamboyant and positively gay. I know that the director was a homosexual himself but that doesn't mean that he'll have to add a lot of homophobic rubbish content in a superhero movie. Its Batman,a straight superhero movie.I felt that the red hair and the exotic clothes were over-the-top and rather meant for the director's fantasies. I did not find it in Batman and Robin (by the way, that's a horrible movie) but I could spot it in this. Tommy Lee Jones gave an embarrassing performance as Two- face. I also felt that he shared a somewhat homophobic relation with Jim Carrey, you know, the way in which they talked and were close to one another. Tommy Lee Jones was, according to me, a very silly villain and not at all intimidating like Joker played by Jack Nicholson.Val something was wooden faced. I think the statues in the film would have more expression than him. But as batman, he managed to pull off in this movie. Though I feel that there should be no other movie with him. Again over here, I'd like to tell about the director's hidden homo content : The scene in which they take a close-up of his backside when he tries the Batman suit. Nicole Kidman is wasted. She too tries her best to be wooden along with Val. But at least, Val did not seem to be wasted. She was unnecessary, though charming to look at. I cannot believe she won an Oscar for some movie, on the basis of this movie.Robin is one of the worst characters in any films. His stupid affinity towards Alfred and cars and bikes Blah, Blah, Blah. I felt that he too should have died in the circus. His pathetic laundry martial arts scene and silly way to make off with the Bat mobile just too woo women seeming like hookers was extremely unnecessary.What this movie lacks in acting department, it makes up with all its action and performance by Carrey, which is very loud and over-the-top, like I said before. I'm going with a 5 for this movie. Its a fairly good action movie to cut your vacation time.",Batman Forever
131,griffolyon12,The Best Bat-Film in the Burton/Schumacher Series of Bat-Films!,10,20 May 2008,"Batman Forever is easily one of the more enjoyable superhero movies ever produced in my opinion. It has a perfect balance of comedy, drama, action and adventure, and romance to satisfy pretty much any film enthusiasts. Even though this film had its quirks, especially from a Batman fan's point of view, this Bat-Film is just overall too much fun to let those itty bitty problems bother you.Batman Forever is the continuing story of Bruce Wayne (in this film played by Val Kilmer) continuing his conquest of ridding Gotham City's criminal underworld of crime to avenge his parents as the mysterious hero, Batman. The film follows two of Batman's most notorious villains, Riddler and Two-Face (played by Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, respectively), the two hatch a plot to steal mind waves from unsuspecting citizens of the world, and use the information from their minds to get access to deep, dark secrets and other high profile things like bank codes and such. Yes, their plan sounds kind of out there, but it really doesn't play too much into the overall story of the film, it is really just a reason for Batman to show up at the end and beat up the bad guys. The bulk of the story is about Batman having a romance with the beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian (played by Nicole Kidman), and his growing relationship with this young man from a Circus who saw his parents murdered in front of him, this man is named Dick Grayson (played by Chris O' Donnell).This film is often considered by many Batman fans to of been the point where the Batman film franchise began to go down hill, and I must say I couldn't disagree more. This film is fairly true to the 1940s roots of the comics, where Batman wasn't an all out camp fest like he was in the 60s, but wasn't entirely at all realistic like it is now in the comics, allowing this film to have more fun. The creativeness of the city of Gotham in this film is amazing and spectacular, it is truly one of the finer interpretations of Gotham ever put on film. Another thing that is truly worth mention in this particular movie are the action sequences, each one scripted to perfection, this particular Batman film being really the only one that successfully portrayed Batman as a hero and not an anti-hero, which once again many hate that part of this one, but I personally don't mind it, it allows for much more entertaining escapism. The best part of this film though was Jim Carrey as the Riddler, his high octane performance never has a weak moment, and he keeps the laughs coming while still being a sick and twisted villain. The other cast members were really great as well, but Jim Carrey just really stole each scene he was in from the other actors.Overall, this is easily the most crowd pleasing Batman film of them all, and it is a joy to watch from beginning to end. The only minor things that get on my nerves are the annoying Batnipples on the Batsuit in like the last twenty minutes of the film, but since it is only twenty minutes of them, I can take it.I give Batman Forever a fun and entertaining 10 out of 10!",Batman Forever
132,rossrobinson,great,10,28 March 2004,"Batman Forever i think is a fantastic movie. This is the 3rd batman movie in the batman movie series. This one was made in 1995, someone else took the part to play Batman as Michael Keaton didn't star as Batman for the 3rd time. Out of all the Batman movies i have seen, i prefer Batman Returns because i think it's a fantastic movie, it has allsorts of characters like The catwoman, the penguin etc: That movie was made in 1992. Out of the 4 movies, i think the least favourite batman movie i saw has got to be Batman and Robin. That one starred George Clooney as playing Batman. Arnold Swarzenegger starred and play the part of Mr Freeze in the movie. Batman and Robin was made in 1997. I am looking forward to the next Batman movie, which comes out in 2005. I heard that Michael Caine is to play the part of the butler (Alfred)I give Batman Forever 10 out of 10.",Batman Forever
133,Min111,Batman 3,6,6 August 2017,"I remember first seeing 'Batman Forever' on television during the night back in the nineties. Yes, I liked watching the movie so much. Why did you like the movie? Because it was kid friendly unlike 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' which were 'dark' movies, and geared more towards older people. I'm not trying to degrade 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' - they were still good movies. The kids will find those movies unsuitable, but that still didn't stop me from watching them anyhow.I was crazy regarding 'Batman' as a kid - he's one of my favourite superheroes. People need to keep in mind though that 'Batman' is from DC Comics. Who's more popular than the caped crusader? The answer is Superman!Anyway, the kids will like 'Batman Forever' because the movie was targeted towards them, or a more younger audience. Yes, it's family or kid friendly.'Batman Forever' is basically 'Batman 3'. It's the next movie after 'Batman Returns' which is basically 'Batman 2'. Yes, 'Batman Forever' is still a sequel to 'Batman Returns'. Personally, I didn't mind whether 'Batman Forever' was dark or friendly. Because the producers made the movie more friendly, the gamble paid-off.'Batman Forever' is a success! Why is the movie a success? Because the movie introduced us with two brand new 'Batman' enemies: Riddler and Two-Face. Who do you think is the more popular? I think it's the Riddler who's famous for these question marks. You probably realise my review is full of questions - it's no coincidence really. The Riddler happens to be one of my favourite enemies of the 'Batman'. I also like how he's associated with the colour green. He's a familiar foe. I like how he leaves riddles and puzzles at the scene of every crime. He possesses a different challenge to 'Batman' (Bruce Wayne) altogether. The other enemy is 'Two Face' who appears insane in 'Batman Forever' - you need to see the movie though. I liked the part which shows him at the courtroom where there was an accident which made Harvey Dent's (Two-Face) face disfigured on one-side. He's another familiar foe. I actually liked how Two-Face appeared in the movie. I thought his design was neat. I like how he flips or tosses his coin in making a decision.I like how the name of the movie is called 'Batman Forever'. Basically, Bruce Wayne is destined to fight crime as 'Batman' forever. Do you get it now?I think the main point regarding the movie is the issue with the cast which I didn't have a problem with. If 'Batman Forever' was another one of those 'dark' movies, the cast had to be the same in order to be a success! Because 'Batman Forever' was targeted to bring in the kids, I feel the makers or producers got away with it regarding the cast. Why is it exactly? Because the cast in 'Batman Forever' was impressive. You had popular actors and actresses in the movie such as Drew Barrymore, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones and Val Kilmer.I was surprised to find out though that Drew Barrymore was in 'Batman Forever'. I didn't notice her in the movie at all. I guess I didn't see the movie carefully enough. I think she'll make good as 'Batgirl' or 'Batwoman'.Let's not forget Alfred Pennyworth who's Bruce Wayne's faithful and trustable butler. I'm sure everyone likes the guy who played the butler. He's such a gentlemen! Yes, he was the same guy who played the character in 'Batman', 'Batman Returns' and even 'Batman & Robin'. Personally, I think he's way better than Michael Caine as the butler.Let's also not forget another character - Robin. He marks his debut in 'Batman Forever'. I'm sure nearly everyone likes Robin who happens to be a nice sidekick! Sadly, in the movie, Robin's family are murdered.There's a new character named Dr Chase. She's a psychologist and romantic interest of Bruce Wayne. She's fit! She's hot! She even packs a punch! She's fascinated by the dual nature of 'Batman'.It's these actors and actresses why 'Batman Forever' was such a good movie. If it was anyone else, the movie will have failed! What do you think?I liked Val Kilmer as 'Batman', and I thought he was the right replacement for Michael Keaton. He's definitely not the best 'Batman' though. Anyway, he plays a character who has to deal with his dual identity as a crime fighter in Gotham.I actually wanted 'Batman Forever' to be a 'dark' movie just like the other two, but only with the same cast. I'm sure it also would've been a good movie like 'Batman Forever' is already. Either way, it didn't matter.I can see now my review is riddled with questions. The Riddler is really something - I can tell you that. You can see him only in this particular movie.'Batman Forever' is an 'action' and 'adventure' movie.Thanks for reading my review everyone.",Batman Forever
134,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,2 August 2021,"Joel Schumacher assembled a very talented cast, but he couldn't take advantage of having such an actor, and he disappointed many. He's not rubbish, but he doesn't come close to his predecessors, and aside from Jim Carey who played the Riddler very well, Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman and Tommy Lee Jones haven't done anything more in compensation than can be expected of them. There was no consistency in their performances, in the evolution and development of the story and in the direction and production itself, which this time was in charge of Tim Burton instead of directing him as he did in the two previous ones. Watchable movie that brings a little fun.Film viewed on the 31st to the 1st of August 2021.",Batman Forever
135,dr_foreman,the worst Batman film,1,10 July 2004,"At least ""Batman & Robin"" can be laughed at for the camp classic that it is. ""Batman Forever"" masquerades as a decent movie, but it falls so far short that it earns a much larger share of my hatred.  It does my heart good to see that, with the passage of time, people are finally realizing that the much-maligned ""Batman Returns"" eats this turkey for breakfast.There's so much to hate about this movie.  Carrey is just awful as the Riddler; his crotch-hugging costume is tacky, his shouting grates on the nerves, and you know what?  He doesn't even come up with too many riddles. Tommy Lee Jones is equally awful as Two-Face, as he mugs and hollers in a vain attempt to keep pace with his insane co-star.  His character is poorly written, too; Two-Face always abides by the decision his coin makes, and he would never flip and re-flip it to get a certain result, as he does in this movie.  Believe it or not, that little sequence changes - and ruins - the entire character.  The plot stinks, too, as the Riddler is apparently trying to control everyone's minds with what appears to be a big blender.Complete with garish costumes, neon lights, and bombastic music, ""Batman Forever"" is certainly the best headache-inducer out there, but it's not a good comic book movie even though it struggles valiantly to capture the right ""feel.""  Joel Schumacher, who also directed the equally tacky ""Phone Booth,"" is rightfully lambasted for ruining the Batman franchise after two pretty strong initial entries.  Bad...just really bad...",Batman Forever
136,LebowskiT1000,"Good Movie, could have been much better.",8,16 November 2002,"I definitely liked the first ""Batman"" film the most in the series, but I'm unsure if I liked ""Batman Returns"" or ""Batman Forever"" better.  It's actually a tough call for me.  I may be saying this because I'm Jim Carrey biased, I'm not sure.I thought the story was actually pretty good and well thought out.  I really liked the introduction of Robin in the film.  When I first heard they were going to introduce Robin, I thought ""UH OH, this can't be good"", but I thought they pulled it off quite nicely.  The story on the whole was far from perfect, but it was good.  Most of the problems I had with the film were the visuals and the sounds, not so much the story.  I thought the visual effects were done very well, but the overall film is just too colorful and flashy.  And the sound effects were just plain STUPID!  For instance, when the henchman gets electrocuted in the beginning of the film, what was with that sound?  And when Jim Carrey is throwing bombs around in the batcave???  Please!!!  So basically, I'm saying eliminate the sound effects and some of the visuals, and perhaps replace the director (Joel Schumacher) and you have a pretty darn good movie.  Although, I must say in Joel Schumacher's defense, he has made some EXCELLENT films!As for the cast, I thought they were all pretty good.  Val Kilmer was pretty good as Bruce Wayne/Batman (Michael Keaton is still the best though).  Tommy Lee Jones did a fantastic job as Two-Face, I really enjoyed his scenes and the way he played the character.  Jim Carrey was the film highlight for me. He's such a cool actor, and who better to play The Riddler?  Chris O'Donnell did a surprisingly good job with Dick Grayson/Robin, he was a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the cast was good as well Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Nicole Kidman, Drew Barrymore, Debi Mazar, Ed Begley Jr. and Jon Favreau (in a small, dialogue-less, nearly non-existent role...but still cool to see in the film).All in all, I thought this film was geared more toward the younger audience, but was still fairly good.  The film could have been much better than it was.  All I can say is, don't expect the same sort of film as ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", this is a new director, with a new star, and a new visualization.  With that said, I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Batman Forever
137,OriginalMovieBuff21,Now I liked this 3rd Batman,8,29 September 2004,"Batman Forever is a good sequel and is a very fun film to experience. I enjoyed this movie a lot. A lot of people say this is like the biggest disappointment to the Batman franchise, but it isn't. I honestly don't think this should get a 5.4 rating either. This film is better than the 2nd Batman to my opinion. Oh well, Val Kilmer was good as Batman, not better than Michael Keaton but was still good. The bad guy characters were good and funny and the action was very awesome. There was some corny acting but that doesn't make this movie bad, I mean all superhero films have bad dialouge besides the 1st Batman. I highly recommend this movie and this is sure entertaining. Don't go with the critics on IMDb for this one, go with people that like it.Hedeen's outlook: 8/10 *** B",Batman Forever
138,policy134,"By far, the best Batman movie of the four I have seen.",8,26 March 2005,"I love Tim Burton movies and if you watch Ed Wood you can't help but say that he is truly a unique filmmaker. But as far as Batman is concerned he really fowled things up. Not that the films weren't interesting to watch but the truly ugly characters in the first two movies were extremely hard to take. Jack Nicholson is usually one of my favorite actors but you could somehow tell that he was in the wrong movie. As for the second, it was a total disaster. The main villain so pathetic that everything he did almost made you vomit. Michelle Pfeiffer did have her moments but was buried under too much makeup and latex.In '95 we got this very entertaining piece of fluff (let's be honest, that is the only way to describe it). The performances were pretty over the top from all the actors, except Val Kilmer, who seemed to be in some kind of a coma all the way through. It's funny to think that he got his big break in the spoof ""Top Secret"" where he was much more alive. Since then he has become like the second Brando, extremely eccentric and overall ham. Tommy Lee Jones has expressed his regrets in ever making this movie and who could blame him with a co-star like Carrey. Carrey pretty much bulldozes him in every scene they appear together. Nicole Kidman is kind of bland but that's understandable. What can you do when all the best lines go to the male actors. The only serious fault I will point out is Robin's background story. I think it was a mistake to have Bruce Wayne attend the circus performance where Dick Grayson's parents and siblings were killed. It robs the Robin character the mystery which has always surrounded the Batman character to simply show you what happens on screen. Other than that Chris O'Donnell was the right choice for the role. He shows the right amount of anger that fits his character.The production design couldn't be better. As Roger Ebert has written: ""It's great bubble gum for the eyes"". To say that the dour tone of the first two movies needed to changed is an understatement and I think Joel Schumacher did a great job relieving the tension of very serious themes in the movie like revenge and scarred pasts. At one point the Wayne character says: ""Even Chase (Kidman) thinks being Batman is a curse"". That sums it up pretty well but in the end he also says: ""For I am both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Not because I have to be, but because I want to be"". Great exit line.",Batman Forever
139,departed07,"Nowhere near as dark and brilliant as Batman Returns or ""Mask of the Phantasm""",7,21 January 2008,"If people could accept the eccentricities of Tim Burton in other countries, why couldn't they accept it in Batman Returns in the states? ""Batman Forever"" is the third Batman movie but the first in the Joel Schumacher Bat-flicks that would be the last of entertainment before Batman and Robin made bat droppings.Val Kilmer does what he can to portray Batman while playing a daunted Bruce Wayne where we get to see flashbacks of his parents burial giving a hint on how he became Batman. He's not as mysterious like Michael Keaton in the first two installments of Tim Burton's bat franchise, but he does what he can. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are the villains in the movie for which Jones plays Two-Face, a criminal mastermind who makes his decision by flipping a coin and wants Batman dead; Carrey plays Edward Nygma, an eccentric genius who considers Bruce Wayne his idol but is rejected by Bruce and his boss (Ed Begley Jr. in a cameo) after his experiment of tampering with people's brainwaves isn't considered a good idea. Nicole Kidman plays the damsel in distress/psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian, who isn't as tempting as Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in ""Returns"", but isn't weak unlike Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) in ""Batman."" While she falls for Batman, she's trying to help Bruce Wayne with his troubles before discovering some deep dark secrets. Chris O'Donnell is Dick Grayson/Robin, who is taken into Bruce's custody once Two-Face kills his parents and wants revenge on the criminal.What makes this film less attracted than the first two live action installments from Tim Burton or the animated masterpiece ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,"" is the loss of darkness from those three films where after the Batman Returns incident with millions of people petitioning all fast-food places from McDonalds to Burger King to get rid of the toys after seeing scenes of grotesque that could frighten children. (It was rated PG-13 you buffoons! Read the label!) Batman Forever is faithful to the campy 1960's TV show where some of the goofiness will leave some Bat fans walking out on the film or changing the channel.

Well, tonight on TBS they showed the movie and I STILL say it's an enjoyable picture with 3 out of 4 stars.The only difference is that now I remember why I liked this movie!!!!
Batman & Robin sucked because Joel Schumacher had 100% creative control. In this picture Schumacher probably had about 40-50% creative control! In conclusion Tim Burton (the director of the first two Batman movies) produced this movie and you can see the Burton touch. All Schumacher really did was turn the characters campy and disregard the friendship between Bruce and Harvey! So basically everything else is Tim Burton.From a flash back sequence to Batman escaping a car chase in an alley to Batman crashing in from the window to the Riddler's hide out! It's all BURTON!

142,FilmFanInTheHouse,"The dark undertone of the films is now gone with a more camper, comedy style.",6,12 July 2008,"Batman Forever (1995, Dir. Joel Schumacher) Gotham City has a new villain on the streets. After being horribly scared, Harvey Two-Face (Jones) strikes fear into anyone who meets him. He teams up with The Riddler (Carrey) with an evil plan in tow. The Dark Knight, Batman (Kilmer) is out to bring down these two enemies and save the citizens of Gotham City once again, but he's not alone. After his family are killed by Two-Face, Dick Grayson (O'Donnell) moves into the Wayne manor and discovers an amazing truth.Now with Joel Schumacher in the directing chair, the Batman franchise begins a huge change. The dark undertone of the films is now gone with a more camper, comedy style. The villains are well played, if over the top and Val Kilmer does have a good try as Batman, but fails to live up to what Keaton did. Unfortunately, it misses the fun and enjoyment from the previous two movies and severely starts to weaken the franchise.Let's start this party with a bang.  Harvey Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones)",Batman Forever
143,baileycrawly,Jim Carrey Made It Tolerable,3,20 September 2020,"How the mighty have fallen!There's a lot of changes between Batman Returns and Batman Forever, and most of them are horribly negative. We lost Michael Keaton, who chose not to take part in this project after being dissatisfied with the creative direction it was taking (good choice), Tim Burton stepped down from the director's chair and into the role of producer, and Joel Schumacher stepped in as the director. Batman was recast by Val Kilmer (who, to be fair, was acceptable in the role, although not as good as Keaton was).This movie isn't good. The change in director brought with it an entirely different style that just doesn't mesh well with the previous two at all. This film doesn't have the distinctly stylized gothic elements that are Tim Burton's trademarks, and the pacing in this film is nothing short of dull. The characters who, while fleshed out (in the case of Batman, at least) over the course of two movies by Tim Burton, manage to be two-dimensional and boring. Everything Burton set up in his films is ruined in this one; the ""Superhero Series for People Who Don't Like Superhero Movies"" becomes just another superhero movie with this entry, and it's dreadful.It could've been so much better. Jim Carrey gave a fantastic performance as The Riddler (as Jim always does), but his character suffers from a major lack of screen time that would otherwise have made the film much more interesting. He is the only character in the movie that has any really distinct, distinguishable personality, largely in part to Jim's own manic-comedic delivery.This movie is a boring shell of what Tim Burton created in the first two Batman films. It should've been left in the manuscript stage for another 2 or 3 treatments before it was ever even pitched to Warner Bros., and Tim Burton should've had the opportunity to work with Michael Keaton to further realize the vision he was working on instead of this mess.A major let-down after those that came before it.",Batman Forever
144,chrisbrown6453,Holy caped crusader! Batman Forever is certainly lighter than the gloomy Batman Returns.,7,20 July 2001,"You'd think that the powers that be would have learned a lesson from Returns, but no. Why do we need two overassertive villains, when one will do quite nicely? Poor Tommy Lee Jones, as Harvey Two-Face with the acid-enhanced complexion, is completely overshadowed by Jim Carrey's dizzy Riddler. Val Kilmer slips into Michael Keaton's batsuit, complete with nipples, without causing any major ripples. He has a little more sex appeal, so the scenes with Nicole Kidman, as the come-hither psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, have some resonance. She calls it as she sees it when she says ""I could write quite a paper on a grown man who dresses like a rodent."" He still calls women ""chicks"" too, Doctor. Batman finally gets his Robin this time out in the person of Chris O'Donnell. Robin is a high-flying trapeze artist who is orphaned when his entire family hits the circus floor without a net, thanks to Two-Face. He wants revenge, certainly, but wouldn't turn down a chance to drive the Batmobile as the designated sidekick. There's little homoerotic subtext, though one critic sniped that, with his haircut and pierced ear, Robin looks as if he's on his way to an Act-Up meeting. What about the Riddler, who could be on his way to Wigstock in his glittery, clingy bodysuit topped off with a diamond tiara? Carrey mugs it up and is over the top as usual, but still manages to make us laugh. Loved Michael Gough as Alfred the unflappable bat-butler, but Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, as the two ""chicks"" Sugar and Spice, tend to get lost in the elaborate set decoration.

145,DavidSim240183,What a Bat-astrophe!,2,15 February 2008,"Tim Burton's Batman sagas were quite wonderful for the way they captured the Dark Knight on film. They felt like fully realised comic books for the big screen. A difficult thing to achieve that Burton pulled off masterfully. Sadly, after Batman Returns, Burton was not asked to fill the directors chair for the third instalment. Warner Bros were allegedly unhappy with the very dark directions Burton had took the series (idiots!). So in an effort to lighten the load, they turned over the reins to...wait for it...Joel Schumacher!!!In reviewing Joel Schumacher's work, I've been quite vocal over how awful he is as a director. He seems incapable of investing his films with anything remotely in the way of substance. His films are often loud, splashy spectacles dripping in atmosphere but hollow as a jack-o-lantern. Batman Forever was the film that made me a hater of Joel Schumacher. After all, the very idea that he could fill Tim Burton's shoes was ludicrous. But its what he does to the world of Batman that is so unforgivable.From the first five minutes I was cringing. The film opens with Batman suiting up. Close-ups of gloves. Belt buckles. Capes. But the sight of nipples on the Bat-Suit threw me for six. As did the new Batmobile. With two ludicrous fins sticking in the air, its something nobody would be caught dead driving in. But the cap on the scene is Batman tells faithful Alfred (Michael Gough) he'll get Drive-Thru on the way home.Its a statement that in one fell swoop completely obliterates the mystery and dark intrigue we always admired about Batman. And it just gets worse from there. The next shock the film has in store for us is the new Gotham City. Gone are Tim Burton's dark, Gothic imaginings. Instead, the city is awash in flashy lights, blazing neon and psychedelics. Tim Burton may be credited as producer, but Batman Forever is not one of his films...period!Just about everything in Batman Forever is a shambles. Val Kilmer, picking up where Michael Keaton left off, is all wrong for the part. Keaton really did a superb job of encapsulating the feelings of barely disguised psychosis, balanced on a knife-edge between moral indecision and tightly wound urgency. But Kilmer is bland by comparison. He never possesses anything in the way of charisma, nor carries himself with the larger than life stature you'd expect of Batman.And then there's the villains. This is what really sinks Batman Forever (as well as having Schumacher in the director's chair). After exhausting most of the well known villains in the Batman universe, this film has one famous one, and one not so famous. The Riddler (Jim Carrey), and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).One of the joys of the previous films was the way Tim Burton made the villains so fascinating to regard on a psychological level. The Joker was a manic psychopath on the one hand, but a surprisingly vulnerable creature on the other. And the same could be said of Catwoman and the Penguin.But Two-Face and the Riddler have none of the fascinating psychological complexities that made Tim Burton's Batman films so rich and accessible. The mistake of Schumacher is to let Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones run riot through the film with zero restraint. I suppose that's to be expected of Jim Carrey, but not of Tommy Lee Jones.I think Tommy Lee Jones is a superb actor. He can command a scene without having to do much of anything. But he's quite awful as Two-Face. In fact this must rank as the worst thing he's ever done. His performance is shrill, grating and utterly vacuous. I didn't think it was possible for Jones to give a bad performance until I saw Batman Forever.But as bad as Jones is, Jim Carrey is even worse. I know the Riddler is supposed to be zany, but Carrey boosts it to such an absurd degree the character loses all sense of credibility and menace. I mean how exactly do you take a villain seriously who dresses in a leotard covered in question marks, and wears a mask that looks like it was lifted from Dame Edna's wardrobe?This film sees the introduction of Robin too. Chris O'Donnell is OK, but as the orphaned acrobat turned crimefighter, he never quite convinces of his struggle between darkness and light. Nicole Kidman, although glamorous hardly convinces as criminal psychologist Dr Chase Meridian. She's only there because Batman needs a love interest. And to look good in sexy outfits. Even if she's not very important to the plot (assuming the film even has one!).The film attempts to delve into Batman's origins, which holds occasional moments of interest, but Batman Begins did it much better. The film is crammed with so many new characters, each subplot is shortchanged in some way or another. The film is an underdeveloped mess.Everyone seems out to get revenge on somebody. Two-Face blames Batman for his disfigurement. The Riddler hates Bruce Wayne for shunning one of his inventions. Two-Face killed Robin's family, so naturally the Boy-Wonder wants vengeance. Schumacher may have been striving for multilayered, but honestly the narrative is so crowded the film hardly achieves anything it sets out to do.Being a Joel Schumacher film, the sets are expectedly lavish. But they're only designed to dazzle. Schumacher never makes them literal representations of the psychology of the characters the way Tim Burton did. Aside from an excellent film score by Elliot Goldenthal, Batman Forever is a failure on every level. Joel Schumacher took Tim Burton's breathtaking, darkly beautiful vision and turned it into a camp extravaganza. And the same goes for Schumacher's equally dreadful Batman & Robin.Avoid at all costs!",Batman Forever

I'm wonderig did they actually put the""I'll get drive-thru"" line in the movie just for the McD commercial!Re-watching the movie I have mixed feelings. On the other hand I love the visual style. The colors are vibrant and dreamlike, and it's like one big neon light show. That alone makes it feel very 90's, in a good way, and it looks like a comic book. But take off the visual effects and...ooops. Is there any substance at all?The plot has a lot of interesting points but somehow it lacks momentum. And the casting is just not as good as in the Tim Burton movies. Some recurring actors like Michael Gough as Alfred are some of the best aspects. Also Nicole Kidman is good but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey... they're kind of ""okay"" but nothing compared to all the villains of two previous films. They're a bit too over-the-top silly. I'd like this movie better if the villains were just a little bit more serious. And Val Kilmer as Batman... not terrible but not great either.Overall, it does the job being a decent Batman movie but it's not one of the best. Sidenote: after watching all the Burton/Schumacher films again lately, I realized that nowadays I actually find Batman & Robin more entertaining to watch than this!",Batman Forever
147,Rautus,Okay but not great,5,10 July 2008,"In 1989 Batman was released and showed a much more darker tone than the 1960's Adam West Batman TV show and movie which was camp, Tim Burton's Batman remains to be the highest grossing Batman movie to date. Batman was followed by a sequel in 1992 which was more darker than the first film although the movie was criticised for being a little bit too dark and depressing, Tim Burton once again was the director and Michael Keaton was once again Batman/ Bruce Wayne. Batman Returns was a box office success but wasn't has successful has the first Batman film. Years later Warner Brothers decided to make a third Batman movie, this time instead of being dark and gritty like the previous two films it returned to the campy style of the 1960's Batman show. Tim Burton was producer but replaced has director by Joel Schumacher who had previously made the 1980's horror cult classic The Lost Boys, Michael Keaton who had previously played Batman was replaced by Val Kilmer. Jim Carry was cast to give the movie a more kid friendly tone, Tommy Lee Jones was cast as the other villain Two Face, Nichole Kidman was cast has Batman's love interest and Chris O'Donnel was cast as Batman's sidekick Robin. With this big cast Batman Forever was hyped to be the best out the series and of course Batman Forever was a box office success although it did receive mixed reviews from critics. Batman Forever was the Batman movie Warner Brothers wanted, it was safe and profitable. This however wasn't the same with Batman & Robin.Anyway on with my review. I remember hearing about Batman Forever and being sicked to see it, I saw Batman Forever in the cinemas with my parents and brothers and was completely disappointed with it. I was five years old and I preferred the dark style of the original two Tim Burton Batman films, we actually walked out of the cinemas after the first half hour of the film. Years later I watched the movie again, being older I watched it with a open mind. I must admit it's not has bad as I remembered it but it's still not the best Batman movie, it's just a little bit better than Batman & Robin. The one problem with this movie is that it's lost the dark style of the first two films for a more campy kid friendly style, while the first two were dark and bleak this one is bright and colourful. Another problem with this film is that it does seem a bit too silly, the Riddler acts too zany and Two Face acts like a campy villain. Another thing is Val Kimler's performance has Batman and Bruce Wayne, he's no replacement for Michael Keaton. He doesn't have that same presence Michael Keaton had. That said Batman Forever did have it's good points such has the costumes, they did look pretty cool. The Vechiles were also good and the action although a bit more over the top was okay. The good thing is that now the Batman movies have returned to the dark and gritty style with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.Batman Forever does have it's moments but it's not has good as Batman and Batman Returns, younger viewers may like this film more than the older viewers. Fans of Batman may want to check this film out but don't expect it to be like the darker Batman films.",Batman Forever
148,joelwatchesmovies,More bad than good,6,8 September 2019,"The dialogue is bad, and aside from Carrey's typically enjoyable schtick, everything about the baddies is really bad too: the two-villain dynamic is awkward AF (I read afterwards that TLJ hated Carrey on set and you can totally tell), the brain-sucking thing is dumb, and the ""useless henchmen"" syndrome here is the worst I've ever seen. Kilmer's brooding Batman is good though and the campy action-based plot is fun enough, featuring some cool cinematography (loved those zooms and skewed shots).",Batman Forever
149,emperor_bender,A new direction for the Batman series...didn't say it was a good one though,6,18 February 2009,"OK so I knew this wasn't going to be as good. Tim Burton wasn't directing, Michael Keaton wasn't starring, and over all the movie looked a little ridiculous.The movie was still on the good side, it just wasn't anything compared to the first two dark movies. The movie was much lighter here. The music was more adventurous, the scenery much lighter, and the characters more silly than menacing. I was still entertained however.Val Kilmer replaces Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne. I wasn't all that fond of him filling the role, but he did get through it pretty well. Tommy Lee Jones was way over-the-top as Two-Face, although I think he was really good still. He made a good villain to say the least. Jim Carrey stole the show however as Edward Nygma/The Riddler. He was crazy, menacing, yet hilarious. Just how Jim Carrey usually is. Nicole Kidman was kind of annoying as Dr. Chase Meridian, she was far too clingy and needy it seemed. Chris O'Donnell was pretty good as Dick Grayson, but bad as Robin, Batman's newfound sidekick. Michael Gough thankfully returns as Alfred, and is easily a good reason to watch this movie. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, another good reason to watch.Over all, not too bad, but don't watch this expecting dark art like the first two movies.6/10",Batman Forever
150,Lebowskidoo,Batacular!,9,19 November 2018,"Sit down kids, and let me take you back to that olde timey year, 1995...this was actually the #1 movie that year, the theater was packed when I saw it, and remember, this was before stadium seating, so you got all up in each other's armrests!I was disappointed Keaton left with Burton, but this was pretty fresh at the time. I still listen to my soundtrack CD, it's still great. Kilmer is so subdued, as both Bats and Bruce. Tommy Lee Jones almost explodes his own head attempting to out-ham Jim Carrey. Jones goes too far, Carrey is perfect. Kidman never disappoints, ever.After so many newer and darker versions since, it's only natural to look at this as cheesy, but it's one of the best Batman movies we've got.",Batman Forever
151,EthanBJones_03,"Average Bat-flick, not the worst; not the best",5,21 August 2016,Overall: This movie is pretty decent but fails to live up to the astonishing legacy that is Keaton and Burton's Batman.Good: The music and cinematography is quite well done and Val Kilmer makes a good Bruce Wayne. I actually really enjoyed Carrey's version of The Riddler and though Carrey hit the mark perfectly. Michael Gough and Paat Hingle reprise their roles of Alfred and Commissioner Gordon respectively and do a good job at it. The actual overall plot wasn't terrible and I though the puzzles were really cool.Bad: The special effects are atrocious and I despise Tommy-Lee Jones' portrayal of Two-Face. I believe that The Riddler works in a more comedic and campier atmosphere but Two-Face doesn't. Two-Face is a more cunning and straight talking villain rather than this... mess! The dialogue is cheesy at best and Nicole Kidman's character felt completely pointless to the story and was just there to provide a love interest for Batman. Val Kilmer was a horrible Batman and Chris O'Donnell's Robin felt more like Jason Todd and I feel it would have been better going down this route.Best Part: The cool riddles/puzzle that Batman must solve.5/10,Batman Forever
152,johnnymacbest,Yuck!!,4,2 June 2011,"I use to like this, but now I hate it. None of the magi that Tim Burton weaves in the first two is in this movie. For one thing, they made the movie way too kid friendly and campy for the character and that did diminish the emotional turmoil and darkness of the Batman mythos. Another bizarre thing about this film is the design of Gotham City, which was a dark, brooding cesspool of crime and decadence; here it's trying too hard to be like that critically acclaimed sci-fi flick by Ridley Scott. And there was way too much neon. TOO MUCH!!! How can they dilute the Gothic atmosphere of such an iconic, fictional landscape? HOW!?!?! I know it's no use crying over spilled milk but the point still stands. I would've been much happier had Tim Burton been brought back on board as director but Warner Bros, in their quest for dollar signs, decided to make it kid-friendly, sacrificing not only the darkness and complex character emotions from the first two films, but also its artistic merit. The result is a film that has been drained of it's truly compelling qualities for the sake of profit that does nothing for the collective conscience of the intelligence of it's audience.All that amounts to what is really wrong with this film. As I look back on it, I realize it's not a good film. Too over the top, cartoonish, colorful, and just plain silly. It's not just the nipples on the Batsuit that plagues this film, it's the writing and screenplay that goes borderline inane and in-cohesive. There's no actual story here; it's just a mash-up of action scenes and quiet moments that try to hammer into the audience that there's' a story, but really it isn't. In conclusion, I'm very GRATEFUL for Christopher Nolan and co for digging the Batman franchise out of it's neon, homo-erotic grave. Batman Forever is a clear departure from the visionary world of Burton's films. Nolan has done much better than what came before.",Batman Forever
153,waqassaleem-85201,Simply average,5,14 October 2020,It is a average film which is because of the slo screenplay. It makes the film feel very boring. If u want to watch otherwise it's best to skip this Batman film.,Batman Forever
154,bh_tafe3,How the Grinch Stole Gotham.,5,8 March 2015,"Joel Schumacher takes the Batman series into a very different direction to Tim Burton with mixed results, in this 1995 blockbuster that temporarily revived the Batman film franchise.Val Kilmer takes over the reigns as Batman, but don't let that effect your viewing, he is pretty much a background character in this one. Like the original Batman, this one bases its story around the superstar playing its main villain, and unfortunately for the viewers, Jim Carrey is no Jack Nicholson. Carrey stars as Edward Nigma, a harmless nut with dangerous ideas until those dangerous ideas drive him crazy and he becomes The Riddler.The Riddler teams up with Two Face, who is also left in the background in spite of being played by a far better actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and being a far more interesting character than Carrey's Riddler. It is Two Face who seems to find a similar tone to the Joker in the original, rather than the Riddler who is basically Ace Ventura playing a Batman villain. This one also introduces Robin, (Chris O'Donnell killing his career stone dead) a circus trapeze artist trying to avenge the death of his father. There is an interesting back story waiting to get out with the Robin character, but we don't see it here.Nicole Kidman, around the time she was temporarily a minor sex symbol due to a string of seductive roles in To Die For, Eyes Wide Shut, and frankly here, as a therapist love interest who is deeply in need of therapy herself, and spends a good chunk of the movie trying to get Bruce Wayne into bed.There were two big hit songs that came from this movie: Kiss From a Rose by Seal and Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me by U2. The former is infinitely more memorable than anything else from this movie.Batman Forever is inoffensive nonsense made for the whole family. It's not a terrible film, but isn't good either. If you don't feel like watching Carrey act over the top for two hours, give it a miss. And certainly avoid if you were a fan of the Tim Burton films. If you were into the 1960s show, you may like this, if you can stand Carrey. Maybe How the Grinch stole Gotham would have been a better title?",Batman Forever
155,nobbytatoes,"more cartoonish that it's predecessors, but an interesting change to the Batman world",7,30 August 2006,"Tim Burton's installments of the Batman series both have their own distinct touches and nuances. Batman Returns saw Burton change Batman's world, and ultimately surpassing him original vision in Batman. Stepping out of the directors chair and only producing this installment, Batman Forever is taken into new direction with Joel Schumacher behind the camera this time.The biggest change is the visual style and tones. Schumacher has lightened and brighten Gothan City out of its dark and Gothic, eighteenth century architecture, with more vibrant colour palate; the over use of black light paints and every colour of the rainbow ensures this. The visuals are more cartoonish with this introduction of a brighter colour scheme. Though it perfectly suits the story of this installment.Batman and Batman Returns dug into it's characters to have a character driven plot. Layers were revealed and explored developing Bruce, and in Batman Returns its villains as well. Here characters are two dimensional and more caricatures, with a broken record story of retreading Bruce's torment of his parents death. Yet these caricature characters suit the cartoonish overtures of the story. This is more embodied in villain line up. Two-Face's straight down the middle split, looks ripped right out of the comic, and The Riddler's hyperbolic actions and eccentric persona.Batman Forever yet has some merit deep within it's story. There is a great sub-text about contemporary media and the peoples zombie attraction to television, used effectively in The Riddlers plan of domination. Yet this is left deep within the script and only scratched upon in Schumacher heightening the action. Action scenes are doubled and take away from developing the story further.With Michael Keaton dropping the cape, Val Kilmer has big shoes to fill. Kilmer doesn't reach the level of Keaton, but still does an engaging Bruce Wayne. Chris O'Donnell isn't that amazing either as Robin. Nicole Kidman's is seductive as Chase Meridian, if not as interesting a love interest as Selina Kyle. Tommy Lee Jones adds fun to Two-Face, if he isn't ultimately the most interesting villain. Jim Carrey steals every scene as The Riddler, and adds so much rapid firing humour, as the funniest villain in the franchise.Ultimately not as strong as it's two predecessors, yet fun is to be had with its cartoonish antics.",Batman Forever
156,RiffRaffMcKinley,Of course Schumacher's a hack! But there's something here!,8,22 March 2008,"In retrospect, due to the ""Batman & Robin"" debacle of 1997, this sequel seems less and less forgivable with each passing year. However, at the time (1995), it was an interesting change of direction for a series of films that had grown stale and boring after a mere one sequel.Part of the reason why this movie is so much better than the migraine that followed is probably that Tim Burton was still attached as a producer. I don't know Schumacher's background, but judging from these films and the lamentable ""Phantom of the Opera,"" it can't possibly be very good.I don't know if I'll be reviled for saying this, but I'll say it anyway. Kilmer was a better Batman than Keaton, and that, in the end, makes all the difference. If anyone else would have taken over, I'm sure the movie would have been a disaster. We'd always have the 1989 original, but it just wouldn't be the same. Fortunately, the camp here is the good kind, like ""The Apple"" or ""Superman: The Movie."" The villains are over-the-top, but considering one of them is Jim Carrey, it's alright.If the movie were two notches better, Schumacher could almost be forgiven for the mess he would make next. But before ""Batman Begins"", there were only two worthy outings in this lineage and I guess we can live with that. It's not like Cecil B. DeMille, after all.",Batman Forever
157,tankace,If you are going to see it better get drunk first.,5,23 July 2016,"So continuing this ride we now are to the Batman Forever movie ,which I have mixed feeling about it. For real I can say what I like or not to a movie and the intensity of that felling ,in general I can give a score to that. But no with this film for it is strange, to say the least! For was clear that if Burton hadn't ever read a Batman comic, Schumancher did know more for the character myth ,but his take is of and nothing in the movie makes me think, The Knight of Gotham.So in order to give the best possible analyses I will break down this review in questions and answers to make my life easier. And here we go:Is Val Kilmer a good Batman? And Robin ,what about him?Well the Bruce Wayne part he plays it very well, but the Batman part he lacks the charisma Keaton had, he is more a billion in a tide suit ,who has fun while doing it and less the Caped Crusader. As for the Robin , Chris O'Donnell is OK and it was a great idea to take the origin story of the Animated series (this two part episodes who a Grammy for god sake!), but this script is flawed and full of camp. And TO THE BATMOBILE, is the best part of the movie! Slick, technologically advance and it looks like it is organic, very nice!To the villains...what I believe about them?Tommy Lee Jones Two-Faces and Jim Carrey Riddler are the Joker, I don't know why but in the 90' every super-villain was like the Joker. I blame Nicholshon of that! Just kidding please don't kill me. To the point the Two-Face is the main antagonist and Riddler is seems to be put in to that the last minute with Jim Carrey in order to draw bigger audience. Any way are like live action cartoons and I don't fell fear when I saw them ,I laughed my ass of! That is not good because Batman the animated series had already depicted them and a cartoon was more mature than a live action movie!!The love interest of the movie? One word ,generic and forgettable hot girl.What my view of the Gotham?As far as I can see, we still see Burton's Gotham just with more neon lights everywhere! That makes sense of Burton was in the design chair that time and he went all out with a cartoon images over the Gothic buildings in very corner of the city. But in the end nothing worth remembering. Inshort if someone say to go watch it, take enough alcohol and you will be fine!",Batman Forever
158,Okonh0wp,One of my favorite films,10,27 February 2005,"Feeling inspired to respond to all these negative reviews, I'd like to take this opportunity to defend Batman Forever. My first guess as to how people would respond to Batman Forever, retroactively, now that Batman and Robin is that be Batman Forever's stock would be tarnished and seen as much worse, retroactively, than it actually was, because of its grouping with Batman and Robin. While Batman and Robin extends those ""campy characteristics"" to an extreme, without extending any substance to them, I think it's important to note that Batman Forever had a stopping point to its corniness before it ever interfered with the story at hand.It's important for everyone to realize that since Batman's creation in what I believe was the 1920s, there have been two parallel versions of Batman going on. One is the ""dark knight"" Batman, the mysterious force of good who no one knows about, and then there's the ""camp"" batman, who's more family-friendly, and more colorful, put it that way, his costume has blues and purples in it, rather than just plain black. The key difference, when you think about it, is Robin, because with Robin in the picture, Batman is nowhere near as mysterious and extraordinary because there is at least one other person doing the same things he is and there is at least one other person who is fighting the same battles he is, and also because Batman has to watch out for someone else, you know he's not selfless and evil.The people who like the ""dark knight"" Batman, are probably people whose prime hobby is comic book collecting over film watching, because that's where the dark knight first appeared.Me, on the other hand am a film watcher who was born in 1983, so when Batman Returns came out I was 9, and while the depth of Burton's dark urban vision was so extraordinary even i could be amazed by it, I had a hard time with all the violence, seeing so many of Penguin's henchmen killed (a couple at the hands of Penguin, himself) or the scene where catwoman robs a store and kills a guy with her fingernails, etc. I'm not saying I needed a happy ending, but all the characters, even Batman, were just very depressing.When Batman Forever came out, I was 12, and unlike its predecessor I really got on board the ride, because the movie had really great heroes and villains, which i could be engaged rooting for or against. In Batman Forever, Batman and the villains are all equally perverse and dark, I really didn't care much who won at the end, and maybe people who are harsh on Schumaker's films fail to take into account what these Batman movies are like for a kid's perspective.Visually, the movie was a marvel to watch. Tommy Lee Jones' make-up job is so great, i'd like to see someone tell me they weren't blown away, the first time we see the left side of his face in the film. Some people say that Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Two-Face wasn't true to the original character, who was a less hysterical individual, but I think a more composed and cool villain wouldn't have been as fun, simply put. The Riddler/Two Face partnership is the best mildly deranged villain/completely deranged villain chemistry in the series, I found (especially considering the other two partnerships never really had very much interaction with each other). Just look at the movie poster for this movie and the colors of the riddler's green, two-face's purple, robin's red, batman's dark blue/black. Like a John Williams score associates musical themes with each character, those colors with surreally bold hues draw out the characters throughout the movie. Also, Nicole Kidman blew me away too. This was long before she was in a stage where every movie role she took was basically crying out, ""give me an Oscar."" And as for Val Kilmer vs. Michael Keaton? Well, I think the best person to answer that question would be original Batman creator Barry Kane (did I get the name right?) who aid that Val Kilmer was the actor who played Batman closest to the vision he originally conceived it to be.",Batman Forever
159,goya-4,"No, it just feels that way",2,23 June 1999,"One would think that with all the talent involved, it would be an exciting movie. One would think. What it is however is  overlong and has too many characters to know what to do with.  It is also suprisingly boring, especially Tommy Lee Jones' & Jim Carrey' s characters. Very disappointing. 3 out of 10",Batman Forever
160,ozthegreatat42330,"Best of the Series. Kilmer rocks as Batman, O'Donnell perfect as Robin.",9,22 March 2007,"After having read the comments of the other commenter's I am strongly forced to disagree. Joel Schumacher did an excellent job in most regards with this film, which is my favorite of the four. Val Kilmer made the better Batman and Bruce Wayne, in this commenter's humble opinion. I never could see Michael Keaton in the role, and George Clooney just plain sucked as Batman. Chris O'Donnell was a perfect pick as ""Robin"". Jim Carrey did steal the show as the Riddler, with Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Chase Meridian was the only jarring character in the film, not seeming the professional that she was supposed to be. The fourth film had the better story line, but this film had the distinct flavor of the Batman Comics I followed when I was a kid in the fifties and sixties. Again the sound score was also excellent. You can say what you please bu this one remains the best cast of all, in my opinion.",Batman Forever
161,Trevor-Kerensky,"Not the best, but not the worst either",5,17 May 2018,"I'd only seen this film a few times and remember some of the elements that made it different from the Tim Burton ones. Pat Hingle and Michael Gough return as Commissioner Gordon and Alfred respectively, but the rest of the cast is new. Two new villains and a new Gotham City. It felt like Joel Schumacher overdid it with how he did the city and the characters. Gotham looks like Tokyo with all the neon and the Greco-Roman naked human statues. A little too Art Deco to be honest. Jim Carrey was OK in this, this film being the first of his movies I had seen. But I did not care for how they did Two-Face with his mannerisms and appearance. It was a bit too overdone. The Bat and Robin suits were a little too much like Roman gladiator breastplates (you have to watch the movie in order to see what I mean). But this film isn't as bad as the second Joel Schumacher Batman outing although I'd rather go with Mask of the Phantasm and the Dark Knight trilogy any day. There were some cheesy moments that will make you go WTF though I did not seem to mind when I was younger. Still, it's not that bad, but not that great either.",Batman Forever
162,dockerykelli,Such a great film,9,25 June 2019,"Batman Forever to me, was such a wonderful movie!!! It's action packed, with laughter, love. An overall great cast and storyline.",Batman Forever
163,Dockelektro,Action masterpiece no to be compared,9,23 December 2000,"First one essential thing: this film is not really a sequel to any franchise. Actually, the only thing that links it to the Tim Burton works are the basic characters (like Batman, Alfred, Gordon and Gotham) and the fact that this is a Batman movie. But one thing should be once more told: one shall not start comparing. Because this is going to influence everything that ensues our analysis. People say that this movie is bad because Batman is a dark and Gothic character. But doesn't anyone remember the comic book which inspired the COLORFUL and HUMORISTIC series? That's right, this movie is actually an incredible powerhouse remake of the camp 50's series: Robin's circus clothes, the Riddler's green, etc. And the movie is a reformulation, a new deal, which faces the whole Batman concept in a whole new way. What has been done here was experimenting. A ""what if"" situation. ""What if Batman lived in a colorful neon-filled city, with giant statues and colorful thugs in the alleys? What if his car and his boat and his plane were slicker, faster and more beautifully designed? What if Batman was younger, stronger and sexier? And what if the movie had humor?"" One has to face the truth: there is nothing in the Batman series like its gift to inspire our awe. The film starts in a way that never stops. And I never saw villains like the ones depicted here. First and really important: they make a great chemistry, an essential fact which didn't work between Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy. Second, they are GREAT actors. Third, they create characters with charisma which make us decide between loving them or hating them. All the set design ideas are 100% effective, 100% inspiring and 100% passionating. My favorite is the scene where Riddler's sign uses the Batsign as part of the question mark. This Gotham is a city where we actually wanna live in. There are enormous statues, car overpasses, artistic graffitis and neon lights. And this is the most spectacular thing in Batman Forever: its atmosphere. This could be a movie where the characters ignored their surroundings, but here helicopters fly through eye-wash signs, and the Batmobile climbs up a wall (what a spectacular shot). This is the shake the Batman movies always wanted to have. And this one rendered the action of the first two positively arthritic. We had two movies centered around a Gothic city, with dark settings all Tim Burton's own. This movie said ""now let's try something completely different"". And the fact that it is the highest grossing movie of 1995 isn't casual. It has a reason. Its novelty was the reason. Unfortunately, this would be also the last time Batman would reach such novelty. Batman & Robin proved the volatility of the concept.... or maybe the director... or maybe even the characters... fact is that Batman Forever is a very special movie. It combines amazing action sequences with dream-like surroundings (just check out that circus) and charismatic leads. It is without a doubt the best movie by Joel Schumacher and it is without a doubt one of the best movies of the Batman series.",Batman Forever
164,Brian-272,Sure it is exciting but a drop-off from Batman and Batman Returns.,7,17 January 2001,This third installment of The Caped Crusader (Val Kilmer) battling new villains Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) has many changes from the first two Batman films. First a new director Joel Schumacher and he does take a new direction it is the total opposite of Tim Burton. Gone is Burton's mysterious and dark moody direction you have Schumacher make Batman more dull and ordinary and the sets in Batman Forever have lost the realism and the graphic art touch if you've noticed the buildings look fake just like a toy and every scene on the set looks unreal. Schumacher has plenty of action in this Batman though to keep our heart pumping. The real negatives on Batman Forever are many I know that Jim Carrey gives a good performance as The Riddler but I would have rather had Robin Williams play the part. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was fantastic but still these villains were no match for the legends and most liked Batman villains The Joker (Jack Nicholson) and The Penguin (Danny DeVito). Not only does the performance of Nicholson and DeVito thrill us but both were just right for their parts I can't say the same for Carrey and Jones. Plus The Joker and Penguin are more dangerous criminals that are liked at the same time due to their wit. One of the best things of Batman Forever is Nicole Kidman she adds much needed sex appeal. Even most agree that her character Dr. Chase Meridian is out of place it just doesn't fit the Batman story as good as Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) or The Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) but Kidman provides the best sex appeal of the three. The addition of Robin (Chris O'Donnell) doesn't help that much I just never felt Robin was an important part of the Batman saga. Now the main character himself Batman (Val Kilmer) is very stiff and seems uncommon as Batman it's like he's been programmed to be a robot what was Warner Bros. thinking pay Michael Keaton his worth! Anyway the action of Batman Forever makes it very memorable and watch when you desire but a drop-off of good villain characters and most of all the absence of the dark moody direction of Tim Burton makes Batman Forever a drop-off.,Batman Forever
165,kermitkid,Perfect blend of silly and serious,8,31 March 2020,"Given that this is the same director of that absolute garbage ""Batman and Robin"", I went in to this with my expectations extremely low. This actually ended up being pretty decent. It's not amazing, but it was at least fun. It actually managed to find a balance between silly and serious. The problem with ""Batman and Robin"" was that it was all silliness,and was just cringeworthy throughout. This showed restraint (for the most part). Some of the dialogue is corny, and some of the acting is over the top (Jim Carrey), but I enjoyed this film. Obviously, it did well enough that they gave Shumacker another Batman movie to direct, and that was the one that ended up being there downfall, but this was a pretty good attempt. Some of the plot didn't make sense (Why is Robin in his late 20s here, when in the comics he was 15?) and the effects aren't the best (but this was 1995, I'll give it a pass). This is like the Adam West ""Batman"" show mixed with the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films. I think the best part of this movie was Tommy Lee Jones. He managed to ham it up as Two-Face, but also managed to show restraint when it was needed. Unfortunately, Jim Carrey as the Riddler did not show restraint and was just annoying. Think Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor in ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" but about 10 times worse. I'd say this movie is at least worth a watch, but for goodness' sakes, stay far, far away from ""Batman and Robin"".Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5",Batman Forever
166,kylehaines96,Kill The Bat!,7,8 November 2011,This is one movie where after I watch it I have no Idea why people have so much hatred for it. Here is my analysis. After the film Batman Returns Came out in 1992 people were really shocked that the movie was so dark that they said it should have either some of the violence should have been taken out or make the film Rated R. So now the people who said they wanted a darker Batman now want a much more Family Friendly Batman. But this is a fun film to watch.The film is about Batman/Bruce Wayne now played by Val Kilmer has now 2 new villains Harvey Dent/Two Face played by Tommy Lee Jones who had his face burned in acid and half of his face is burnt and wants to dump acid on everyone to make everyone like him so he doesn't feel like outcast. The second villain is Dr. Edward Nygma/The Riddler played by Jim Carrey who becomes insane and wants to join Two Face to take down Batman. This is also the first film to introduce Batmans Sidekick Robin played by Chris O'Donnell who is a misfit that wants to join Batman to take down Two Face because Two Face killed Robins parents.In my opinion this is one of the better Batman films because of the entertainment value. I think that Val Kilmer was quite a nice choice to play Batman and the introduction of Robin as nice. I liked how they waited until later on to put Robin in the films instead of him being there at minute 1. I recommend it because it's a fun film to watch.Rated PG-13 For Strong Stylized Action.2hrs 2min/122min.***/****,Batman Forever
167,patches89,RIDDLE ME THIS,2,15 November 2020,"After the first 2 Tim Burton films WB moved from him to Joel Schumacher in an attempt to make Batman less dark. Batman/Bruce Wayne changed from Michael Keaton to Val Kilmer which I have to be honest wasnt the same, he just didnt do for the character what Keaton did for me. Jim Carrey an actor I love was charged with The Riddler but it felt like too much Carrey and not enough Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones in theory playing Two-Face was a brilliant idea but the writing generally hindered what impact he would have made, id even argue he would have been brilliant under Tim Burton. Personally felt this could have done with being darker but was more geared to a younger audience which hurt the whole film and I found myself not caring about any of it",Batman Forever
168,the amorphousmachine,Better than the fourth...,5,10 September 2000,"Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman are okay in this, and they have some pretty good chemistry! Jim Carrey steals the show, but Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell looked the part but failed to add spark.Chris O'Donnell was plain annoying as Robin due the script-writing. His character had no depth and I disliked the way he was introduced! Tommy Lee Jones just over-acted in his role as Two-Face! Batman Forever had some corny scenes but it also had some cool ones, particularly those with Jim Carrey, but it still didn't match the visual style and story-line of Burton's first two outings that I felt represented the comic!I was disappointed that Michael Keaton wasn't in this but 'Batman Forever' could have been much worse (Batman and Robin anyone?), and it is obvious that Joel Schumacher restrained himself in this film. Batman Forever gets a **1/2 out of *****!",Batman Forever
169,EvanKevelson,An actual story with a limited target audience,7,12 February 2021,"All the fans at the time still salivating from the first two which where horrid.
I'm presented with very colorful Bad Guys and this brought some Nostalgia back from 1966. That being said I'd rather have seen a Harvey Dent background story than the introduction of the Boy Wonder.
The riddler was played brilliantly the way the script was written anyone could have played two face. Val Kilmer in the suit was relatively similar to Keaton, and outside a much smoother Rich Playboy Bruce Wayne type with quite a Seductress in Nicole Kidman.
This movie I thought had a great flow was targeted for 11-21 year olds and with that in mind it was successful.
The successor was just over the top with three villains and batgirl.
Overall in terms of DC you have the Nolan Trilogy and the 1978 Superman and the first Wonderwoman unlike Blunder Woman 84...or Justice league garbage etc...",Batman Forever
170,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Defending - an underrated favorite comic book superhero of mine science fiction - action of 90's,10,26 September 2019,"Why this movie get so much hate? I don't get it and I am going to defend it. Fanboys likes Batman Returns and Batman Begins more I don't, I love Batman Forever to death. This is Joel Schumacher diferent version more action, ligther tone. Better villians than in Returns. It is better portrayed by comic books than Batman Returns is. It is new style by Joel Schumacher in comparison to Tim Burton. Instead of a dark and grey-shadow heavy tone, you will get a variety of color across the board. Batman Forever is my fourth personal favorite Batman film of all time.You will see this (literally) when Robin takes the Batmobile out through the city in Chapter 16, a scene which leads to an ally-attack by people who glow-in-the-dark. I am defending this film against haters. To me this better than Returns or The Dark Night Rises.""I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?""Previous films show almost no color or the people of Gotham, here the mean-streets come to life under the neon lights. That's the type of color palette will echo again and again, not only in Riddler's orange hair and bright green wardrobe, but with Two-Face, his two-tone suits and purple make-up on his scarred-side of his face. It is an action sci-fi fantasy Rated PG-13 for strong stylized action. Gotham City is lighter now, but it is still a fantasy world so I like it. At least dosen't look like New York like looks in The Dark Knight Rises.Val Kilmer in my opinion did an excellent job as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He has a lot to do in here, I love his performence as an actor. He is not better than Michael Keaton but he does his job prefessionaly and he acts serious believable. Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian is the best hot sexy babe in this movie. I had crush on her for years. She is MILES way better than Kim Basinger yes I love Kim. I love Vicky Vale a lot but I Love Nicole more. Love Chase Meridian more as batman's love interest. Nicole Kidman is better than Michelle Pfeiffer or Anne Hathaway. Been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman. Jim Carrey as The Riddler was goofy but excellent he really performed professionaly by comic books Edward Nygma. Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/ Two-Face was a bad-ass, he was the best bad guy I saw. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson did an excellent performance I love his martial arts style. He was good as Robin, I like him. We have Drew Barrymore as Spice and Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson as the gang leader in here. When you see O'Donnell beating a gang leader that is Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson kickboxing champion. He was payed to get hit by O'Donnell but still a good choreography. Excellent stunts no CGI in here.The movie gets hate because it has lighter tone, humor and it is difrent version from Schumacher. I don't care! When this movie come out in 1995 I wanted to see this movie in the movie teather, but my abusive strick father did not want to buy me a ticket or drive me to teather to see this movie, it was my wish and he did not care. So my mom bought me a Sticker Album instead and I collect Stickers. My mom also bought me comic book diferent version from this movie. I still have them both. I read them both every night in my room. 4 years later my parents give the money so that i could rent this movie in the video store on VHS. I loved it than and I enjoy it and love it now. I always enjoyed Batman (1989) and Batman Forever (1995) before Nolan movies come out. Even before Zack Snyder destroyed Batman story arc.This time around the fight scenes are much better chorographed for Batman he kicks a lot of asses. The has movie tone's of action. Like Two-Face try's to kill Batman and Batmobil drives on the wall. It has a lot of explosions. Two-Face goons are using automatic machine guns on Batman. Two-Face henchmans weren't goofy like Penquins in Batman Returns. Great visual effects and stunts. Awesome costums for Two-Face, The Riddler and Batman. The movie meantions The Dark Knight it is reference to Batman. Maroney did scare Harvey Dent for life, like in the comic book. Arkham Asylium is also shown in the finale. Batman saves a security guard in the opening sequence. He crashes on Nygma party kicks Two-Face goons asses. He saves those people held been hostages. Batman throws Batarang and destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device. Batman defeats both Two-Face and The Riddler all alone by him self. Saves Dr. Chase Meridian. Batman does a lot more in this movie than he did in Returns. I love that this movie is not set during winter on Christmas Eve like Returns was, it is set on Halloween I prefer fall over winter.Warner Bros. decide not hire Tim Burton as the director again they hired Joel Schumacher instead and Burton quit this movie. But Schumacher convince him to stay as a producer so Tim did. Michael Keaton wanted to come back the third time, but when he heard Tim Burton is not the director he drop out. The part of Dr. Chase Meridian got Rene Russo from Lethal Weapon 3, but since Keaton left the project Rene Russo was fired because producers felt she is too old for a younger actor and Nicole Kidman got the part and i am glad she did. Nicole Kidman is MILES way times better than Rene Russo. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones did not get a long. Lee Jones said to Carrey that he hated his movies. I read that Schumacher did not get a long almost with any of the cast except Jim Carrey and yes I have a respeact thowards Jim Carrey he was professional.The Dark Knight of Gotham City confronts a dastardly duo: Two-Face and the Riddler. Formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent, Two-Face incorrectly believes Batman caused the courtroom accident which left him disfigured on one side; he has unleashed a reign of terror on the good people of Gotham. Edward Nygma, computer-genius and former employee of millionaire Bruce Wayne, is out to get the philanthropist; as The Riddler he perfects a device for draining information from all the brains in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's knowledge of his other identity. Batman/Wayne is/are the love focus of Dr. Chase Meridan. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner Robin the Boy Wonder.I love the songs in this movie: Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me by U2, Kiss From A Rose by Seal and Smash It Up by The Offspring.Batman Forever is my fourth favorite film in the franchise I prefer The Dark Knight over this movie, but Batman Forever has special place in my heart I love this movie death it is from my childhood.",Batman Forever

172,stormhawk2021,"Not good as Batman or Batman Returns, but entertains",5,20 June 2017,"""Batman Forever"" (1995) was the third installment of the Murciélago saga. On this occasion, the great director Tim Burton (who had previously directed the two great masterpieces of the Black Knight saga: ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"") would stand aside in the direction of the film but would remain as producer . Why this change of director? We see it:The film ""Batman Returns"" by Tim Burton did not meet all the expectations initially created by the directors of Warner Bros. Some fans were not very satisfied with what the film gave of itself. This made ""Batman Returns"" a relative (and I say relative because it never was) failure at the box office. Therefore, these executives wanted to give a great change of image to the Murciélago, modifying radically all the aesthetics that Batman had left behind in the previous films and in the comics. And who was in charge of leading such a radical change? Joel Schumacher, a director who has directed films such as ""The Customer"", ""Last Call"" or ""The Phantom of the Opera"" among others.What was said, a radical change of image was being prepared. Unfortunately, this change was worse, but much worse. From a dark and dark Gotham we went to Gotham full of colorful and neon lights. From ordinary citizens to phosphorescent punks and tacky drag- queens. From ordinary buildings to statues and muscular sculptures and impossible. From a dreaded and obscure Batman to a friendly and metrosexual Batman, etc. Joel Schumacher had made Gotham City his own private fantasy.Nevertheless ""Batman Forever"" still keeps some touch, if slight, of what had been previously, surely by the minimal presence of Tim Burton in the film. The movie entertains a lot and I have never considered it bad because I have always liked it. Although it was clear that good cinema had departed from ""Batman Forever"" to give way to action and special effects. The successful moments of the film are based on the reflections that Bruce Wayne makes regarding the death of his parents. The cast of ""Batman Forever"" was spectacular.""Batman Forever"" turned out to be the highest grossing film of 1995, which of course supposed a success. But not only because of the money the film fetched, but because the merchandising and the amount of toys in the movie that were sold contributed to the success of the sales. That said, the action, the special effects and the gaudy colors had won this time to good cinema, darkness and reality.Needless to say, the directors of Warner decided to renew Joel Schumacher to continue with the saga of the Murciélago after the success raised with ""Batman Forever."" This is one of the biggest mistakes in Warner Bros. history. In 1997 Joel Schumacher himself directed ""Batman & Robin"", one of the greatest train wrecks filmed ever in film history.",Batman Forever
173,CriticsVoiceVideo,Best written Batman film.,9,26 June 2021,"Such an improvement over the drab first two Tim Burton films. So much more entertaining. Joel Schumacher brings the action. Good cast (except I wish they would have brought back Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, which would have been perfect but...), enjoyable, and maybe my favorite Batman film. Joel Schumacher does a great job bringing the original TV series into the modern age. Playful, fun, sexy and surprisingly the most heart moving out of all the ""BATMAN"" films. Gotham City CGI gets better in the sequel, but still looks cool af here. Love it.",Batman Forever
174,mirosuionitsaki2,Probably the best one yet.,9,22 December 2009,"I don't know about you, but I truly enjoyed this movie. It actually made me more excited than the previous two. It was very silly, and it was quite a surprise to see Drew Barrymore on the set, but not Jim Carrey seeing how he was on the actual cover of the movie.After a circus accident, Robin wants revenge for Two-face for killing his whole family, and he happens to stay with Bruce Wayne and break into his bat lair and steals his car. Amazing. He now has to convince Batman or Bruce Wayne to let him join him.. or them. Same people, you know.I have to say that this is a very underrated film, but then again, I can see how people can hate it. It can be a little bit too silly, the idea of the heroic and epic Batman having a silly sidekick is kind of ridiculous, but who cares? Try it out, check it out.",Batman Forever

Only character which was flawed was Nicole Kidman's as Dr.Chase Meridian. Chris O'Donnell is OK as Robin.In whole, the movie rather goes back to the old Batman series with all the campiness involved. There is a few laughs and a few references to the DC Comics universe...Watch it if you want to spend a good time watching Jim Carrey's antics, he is the show there...Riddle me this...",Batman Forever
176,TheHande,"Batman Returns, with a vengeance",9,20 July 2006,"Most Batman films have been praised for their brilliant casting. In all honesty I think only one Batman film deserves this kind of praise, namely Batman Forever.The Schumacher era Batman films may have sacrificed seriousness with a bit of campy add-ons but at least Schumacher was able to do what Burton failed. Mainly, this is the first Batman film to truly capture the epic scale of the story. Camera work and lighting on the film is also a great deal better than in the previous two films, adding a bit of psychedelic energy into the film.Casting wise, I don't think they could have found a better actor for any film. Jim Carrie gives us a delightfully zany Riddler and shows us just how the Joker should have been portrayed. I am also a big fan of Tommy Lee Jones and felt that the crazy energy he brought to Two-Face's character only added to the film.Additionally, Val Kilmer has the perfect stoic presence required to play both Batman and Bruce Wayne. I personally had nothing against Robin, since I think that if they'd just have Bruce go through another dysfunctional relationship as a sub-plot I would have just gotten bored. The action is great, the humour is funny and with this the film has quite a bit of drama.As is, Forever remains as one of my favorite Batman films of all time. Even if it doesn't match the darkness of Batman Begins, it is still a fun movie and many times better than its predecessors",Batman Forever
177,swedzin,And here we are... the bad spawn of Joel Schumacher,4,9 September 2011,"1995. And I remember it was a dark, cold night... And I couldn't wait to see Batman Forever! Me, little kid back then, very thrilled, anything could please me! I remember waiting in front of the cinema, Bat-bliss. Then it goes... lights out, it's warm. Me and my family, thrilling Eliot Goldenthal's score, powerful intro credits... and then goes a wild action, neon lights, lively characters, hot lady, annoying partner, explosions, two hot chicks and new kind of image of dark knight. Wow! I was happy and excited, and thinking to myself... what a cool film.Then... You grow up. And you start to have thoughts... you start to think more rationally. And the world around you is real and different to you...2011. Saw this film again, well I have seen it several times before, since I have it in my film collection. And I am still thinking to myself, being a Batman fan... what a hell did I just watch? Tim Burton, the man who set this wonderful franchise for us, he gave us an amazing image of Batman. Wonderfully set as the new live action adaptation. Just that Joel Schumacher can ruin it for us! I don't know if Joel ever read any of the comic books, but it seems that he just took characters and put them in this terrible world of neon lights. In this horrific colored world. This terrible looking Gotham City, perhaps the worst design of Gotham City I have ever seen. Too much lights! This film was meant for kids! Joel was obviously inspired by the old Adam West show. And, for sure, tried to test it in 1995. And, it went bad! Schumacher ruined everything about Batman, about the character, comic book and the franchise. Lee Batchler, who wrote the story, he did put any effort in it. Nothing intriguing. This was the most childish story ever! Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the script, just decided to keep things more light and merry. While, Batman should be more darker and serious. Let's begin with the characters and actors. Val Kilmer - visually not Bruce Wayne at all, he is good actor, but not good as Bruce Wayne or Batman. His lips didn't match with the proportions of the mask. It was weird. But, his voice was cool. Tommy Lee Jones is an amazing actor. And he really did good, over the top acting here. He amused me from time to time. But he missed the character! His performance looked like he based it upon Jack Nicholson's Joker. Two- Face is supposed be calm, psychotic and cold bringer of death.A real life grim reaper with a coin instead of a scythe. Jones ruined this character forever. Jim Carey as Riddler. I was never sure about this choice. Carey was definitively cast because he was a big comedian star back then. And yet, just like Jones, he ruined the character. Played it amusingly funny and over the top. Riddler is supposed to be calm, calculating, until someone prove to be more intelligent than him, then he is a raging psycho. But, keep it in mind that's it is not always an actors fault. Nicole Kidman was not that special, nor developed. She was there to be hot blonde and love interest to Batman. And of course Chris O'Donell. I always thought that Robin was unnecessary. O'Donell looked like he had a ball with his part. But the writers give him a little to work with. And I think that he could have been better. Now, for some other things. we have pretty weird, so called neon gangs. Since when is that a good, creative idea for Gotham City gang? It's just doesn't fit in Batman universe. The Batmobile design is little bit changes, not for the worse, but that blue engine light is terrible. The only thing I like about this film is Eliot Goldenthal's score. The guy is brilliant. No matter how the music sounds, I think he is the only one who was serious during this film. A fine replacement for Danny Elfman. And of course - Alfred. I think that Michael Gough was one of the best Alfreds. He has this old, gentleman posture, astringent eyes, but resonant and soft voice.And for the end, one more thing. Why is everybody so traumatized with nipples on Batman's costume?! Yes, they were too much and too funny. Joel Schumacher, being ""openly gay"", he stated that the movie costume designers wanted to give more anatomic look to the costume. Interesting idea, but turned out ridiculous. Schumacher, liked it, perhaps for personal reasons. The things is that so many people were so bothered with that, that they don't notice more important things in the film. Like, crucial things - characters, character development, script, story, music score, directing... but, no! Let's talk nipples.Overall, this movie is recommended for little kids. And for the adults who want to have a good time. It's pretty much harmless fun. But if you are a big Batman fan who wants more darker story, then avoid this.",Batman Forever
178,fjhuerta-2,The beginning of the end,2,13 August 2000,"Joel Schumacher... why? We were so happy with Burton!So we get to know the ""Boy Wonder""... as in BOY, it's no WONDER how come everyone thinks Batman and Robin were gay. They surely seem like a gay couple more like partners. Their suits are ridiculous... what´s with the nipples? What's with the ridiculous Batmobile? What´s with the  ridiculous sets? Why is everything ridiculous? Why can't I believe Val Kilmer is Batman?The answer is simple: this is NOT Kane's Batman. It's West's Batman, the Batman that was so corny he was ridiculous, the one with the ""Boom!"" and ""Slap!"" written all over the screen. While Jim Carrey does fit this description, it is such a shame that Mr. Schumacher couldn't quite make up his mind about a couple of things.1) If you are going to make a ""campy"" movie: forget about the protective suits and get everyone in spandex. Just like the Riddler. 2) If you are going to make a ""campy"" movie: forget every trace of reality. Make the heroes completely invincible, and let them stage uproars on the set. Don't constrain them! (the characters had to be constrained because of the earlier pictures' dramas). 3) If you are going to make a ""campy"" movie: at least make it funny.This movie walks the fine line between ""reality"" (whatever that means in a movie"" and foolishness.

180,rparham,This Batman isn't Forever,5,26 June 2006,"Time can sometimes not be kind to a film. What may have seemed like a great, enjoyable romp when first viewed amidst the hype and glitz of an initial release can suddenly look much less appealing as the distance allows greater perspective. A film for which this is the case is Batman Forever. In 1995, I found it an entertaining, enjoyable film. Having just recently seen it again in some time due to the release of the first four Batman films on DVD in new special two-disc editions, Batman Forever has fallen quite far in my standing of quality. What emerged from the DVD player was a film that was all flash and overacting, lacking any real depth or interest aside from the pretty visuals and occasional one-liners. It still isn't quite as bad as Batman & Robin, but it isn't good either.Batman Forever was an attempt by Warner Bros. to ""lighten"" up the Batman series, which had been believed to have grown too dark under original director Tim Burton with his second outing, Batman Returns. Enter Joel Schumacher, a director who had made several hits for Warner Bros., including the stylish vampire film The Lost Boys. Schumacher was apparently given the directive to bring Batman out of the shadows, and he did accomplish this: Batman Forever is a continuous explosion of neon and color, with outlandish costume and set design to accompany it. However, as attractive as Batman Forever looks, what lurks beneath is a relatively lackluster and thin core, burdened by the beginning of a return to the campiness of the 1960's television series that would render the Batman franchise null for nearly a decade.Batman Forever's plot, what there is of it, finds villainous Harvey Dent aka Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) planning to kill Batman (Val Kilmer). Harvey blames Batman for allowing him to be scarred with acid on one side of his face that caused his mind to become unhinged and create a split personality. At the same time, Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), a scientist in his company's R & D division is harboring an obsession with the millionaire. When Wayne rebuffs Nygma's latest invention, a device that will beam a television signal directly into the human brain, Nygma becomes incensed, and begins to plot revenge on Wayne. Nygma quickly discovers that his box does more than send television right to the brain, it also allows him to become smarter by feeding off the watcher's brain waves.Nygma adopts an alter ego, the Riddler, and joins forces with Two-Face to rob Gotham of enough money to finance more of his devices and therefore become smarter. Two-Face indulges his desire to wipe Batman off the face of the Earth, attacking a circus that Bruce Wayne is attending and killing a group of trapeze artists named the Flying Graysons, leaving only Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) alive. Dick is determined to have revenge on Two-Face and when he discovers that Bruce Wayne is Batman, demands that he take him on as a partner. Finally, Batman is being lusted after by psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who finds herself attracted to Batman because she has always liked ""the wrong guy."" Some of the elements of Batman Forever would work in a better written movie, but here ideas and plot are all secondary to the overarching spectacle. Batman Forever is designed to look good and provide some mild laughs, but nothing else. Everything that would make an interesting story is buried under mounds of production design, special effects, reasonably unexciting action sequences and a ridiculous amount of camera mugging by Jones and Carrey. Sure, there is a plot, but it is all wildly underdeveloped. The Riddler want's to capture Gotham's brain power because . . . it's a rush? I guess. Maybe. The film doesn't really do anything with this idea. What is the goal? I'm not sure. Two-Face is even shallower. He wants to kill Batman. That's it. He has no other depth to him, his motives are that base. Neither of them are interesting characters. Sure, Carrey and Jones are entertaining to watch at times, but even here the film trips itself up. They both overact to the hilt, there isn't a moment of subtlety, no menace to either of them. They aren't villains, they are caricatures of villains, or, more specifically, caricatures of Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker in Batman. There, it was original, and the Joker had some sense of menace. Here, it's all played for slapstick, and how can that be threatening? Batman fares even worse. Val Kilmer has replaced Michael Keaton as the lead, but that doesn't really help matters. Kilmer is rather wooden in the role, and the filmmaker's attempt at adding any layers to Wayne is laughable. There is a subplot of sorts involving Wayne's memories following his parent's death, but it all adds up to nothing. His romance with Chase is also a dead zone. There is no chemistry, no attraction between them. Chase is a relatively one-dimensional character also who seems unduly attracted to Batman (maybe she has a thing for black). You couldn't care less if they end up together or not. The introduction of Robin/Dick Grayson has some interesting elements, and is arguably the most fleshed out element of the film, but it is mashed in with so much other junk as to prove just a minor subplot.Batman Forever isn't a waste: it looks good, the music score is effective at times, some of the jokes are funny. However, it is most likely that the recent Batman Begins, with an emphasis on character and plot, has quickly made the prior Batman films look exactly like they always were, but was sometimes previously hard to discern: shallow spectacles. For those who complain about empty blockbusters, Batman Forever is more fuel for the fire.",Batman Forever
181,kevinxirau,Eye candy with an eye sore.,6,12 January 2012,"Boy, things really went south for Batman, didn't it? While the previous film ""Batman Returns"" was successful, it was considered too dark and depressing, which I basically agree, and thus Tim Burton was reduced to being a producer instead of a director and have Joel Schumacher take his place. As a result, Batman became more mainstream and it turned out to be a bit of a mistake.Is Batman Forever terrible? No, far from it. The Caped Crusader just took a wrong turn. I admit the effects, music, action scenes, character development, certain lines, and plot are pretty impressive. It all helped me stomach everything else.In my opinion, Val Kilmer is the worst Batman ever. While his tone is good enough for Batman, he keeps that same tone as Bruce Wayne, which can lead one into figuring out his identity pretty easily. Now that's just lame. George Clooney does a way better job. Kilmer's suit isn't that good either, particularly that they put nipples on it. Awkward...Jim Carrey is the actor that steals the show. His performance as the Riddler is over-the-top and hilarious. The riddles he leaves behind are actually pretty interesting; it would take a genius to figure them out. This is all good for a ""kid-friendly"" movie, but for serious hardcore Batman fans, it leaves them wishing that the Riddler is more realistic taken more seriously, which I agree.Two-Face is one of the bigger problems i have for this movie. Previously, Billy Dee Williams (Lando from Star Wars) played as Harvey Dent in the first Batman movie, but Shumacher never followed it up properly, instead using Tommy Lee Jones. What was he thinking?!! Two-Face now is an over-the-top villain who shoots, laughs, and has a split personality that isn't conveyed entirely well.Chris O'Donnell as Robin is, surprisingly, one of the better performances here. His character is taken more seriously and is older than his comic book counterpart, written as more tragic, cool, and able to put up a good fight. Even his final costume is pretty good.Finally, there's Nicole Kidman as psychologist and love interest Dr. Chase Meridian. Her character is both sexy and determined, having an interesting and complex relationship with the Dark Knight. Nicely done.Overall, this movie is good, but not good enough. It leaves die-hard Batman fans wishing that this was darker and more serious instead of cheesy and comedic. It makes ""Batman and Robin"" seem like a step ahead. Only worth the watch at least once or twice.",Batman Forever
182,Mitch-38,Not up to original...so few are,5,27 January 2001,"BATMAN FOREVER continues the series, with new lead Val Kilmer under the hood, so's to speak. Also minus director Tim Burton, it should be mentioned.Sullen Bruce Wayne hasn't changed, yet this installment finds the supreme addition of gizmo weaponry and effects. Of course, here come some new villians (not really new-just recreated), Two-Faced and the Riddler. This really could have been titled, ""THE VILLIANS OF GOTHAM...oh...and Batman, TOO."" Tommy Lee Jones chews (and chews) up the scenes, and develops a ferocious caricature of a portrayal. Jim Carrey has the physical comedy prowess, yet noticeably lacks the malevolence. (Paging Frank Gorshin...).
The plot doesn't aim for intricacy, and opts off for sheer simplicity. While Batman/Bruce Wayne has limited screen time, Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle- a favorite character actor of mine from way back) and Alfred the butler (Michael Gough) are essentially reduced to cameos. These elements, plus Nicole Kidman as Batman's shrink, and introducing Dick Grayson into the mix, and what you get is simply too many anvils in the fire.
While leagues ahead of BATMAN RETURNS, the overall effect leaves one weary from keeping track of loose thread subplots. One really gets close to thinking this formula has about ran dry.",Batman Forever
183,Old Joe,Batman Forever is one giant riddle!,6,29 January 2002,"The most famous line from this Batman movie in my opinion would have to be when the Riddler says `Riddle me this, riddle me that, who is afraid of the big black bat?' In fact, this movie is full of one liners such as this and can be bagged for doing so. But why dwell on the bad things in a movie full of fun and mischief.In Batman Forever, the Caped Crusader battles a devious duo in Two-Face and The Riddler, while attempting to resist the advances of sexy psychologist, Chase Meridian. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner, Robin the Boy Wonder.Again the baddies in this film make a huge impact on the audience. They did on me. Jim Carrey was brilliant as the crazy prankster, The Riddler. His wit and true genius came through in this role. This role was not unlike the role he portrayed in the 1994 smash, The Mask. I loved that film. Considering this film was made one year after the Mask, Carrey steps out of one movie and into another no trouble at all. The films that Carrey has done later on in his career have made more people in the movie industry stand up and take notice. Man On The Moon and The Truman Show showed us the true talent of Carrey. But other people might have the opinion that Carrey was over the top in his role of the Riddler in Batman 3. Like Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman, Carrey steals the show. So who is the main character in the Batman films? Batman? I don't believe so!The other baddie in  Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones. Jones took on the role of the scarred and evil Two-Face, aka Harvey Dent. Jones portrayed this character very well. The start of the film was pretty good, with Two-Face causing havoc in Gotham. I say this role could have been better if the audience could have seen more into what happened to Dent as the Gotham District Attorney and how he turned into the evil man he was. Jones has done some impressive films in his time. Films like Men In Black, Us Marshals and Volcano were all favourites of mine, thanks mainly to Tommy Lee Jones. One of his latest films which I did enjoy was Rules Of Engagement, a terrific courtroom drama movie co-starring Samuel L. Jackson.
Taking on the role of Batman in third film was Val Kilmer. I have nothing against Kilmer as I feel he is a good actor, but he is not as good as Michael Keaton. Then again it would be a hard role to find the correct actor for. Every time I  watch this film, I hope to find Keaton jump onto the screen as the Dark Knight. But Batman's partner Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell, was casted perfectly in this role. After watching the first Batman movie, I heard that the role of Robin could be going to Michael J. Fox. As good as Fox would have been, I'm glad O'Donnell was given the chance to do this role. The Aussie taste in this film was good to see. Of course I am talking about Australian actress, Nicole Kidman, who was Dr Chase Meridian. I loved the relationship that the beautiful doctor first has with Bruce Wayne, then with Batman. I want to say that I feel sorry for Kidman and former Husband Tom Cruise. The pressure that must be placed on a relationship in this kind of industry must be harsh. I hope that everything works out in the end for both parties.
This film was directed not by Tim Burton, but Joel Schumacher this time around. As spectacular as this film looks, I believe Burton gave us a better feel to what Batman should be. Dark and Gothic. Yet, Schumacher made this film too light and colourful. Gotham City was nowhere near what it was meant to look like in my view. Schumacher turned the Dark Knight into what I would say is the 'Bright Knight!'. Schumacher overall did a good job, but he didn't capture what Batman is all about.One part of this film which I did enjoy was the soundtrack. With performers such as Seal, U2 and The Offspring making quite a CD. My favourite song on it would have to be Seal's 'Kiss from a rose'. The vehicles in this film were very impressive. The new Batmobile (which I have seen up close) was magnificent. Also the Batwing, Batboat and Batsub all look good in this film. The Batcave was ok, but has nothing on the caves in the first two films. I must say that the storyline with the Riddler blowing up the Batcave was alright.I was on holidays in 1995 when I got to see Batman Forever in the Cinema. My first impressions of this film were that it was well done. One day on this holiday, I happened to be on a bus and the driver said he had watched this film and pointed out a fact which I never considered, that Batman never kills any of his enemies. This film is a prime example of that. I don't know which way to go on Batman Three. The storyline is at times very corny, yet it also has some excellent fighting and robbery scenes, with the brilliant Carrey stealing the limelight. But the Batman franchise was starting to get thin by 1995. These movie reviewers don't agree though:`A Stunning Extravaganza' - Dave Kehr, New York Daily News`The Best 'Batman' yet.' - Pat Collins, WWOR-TVRating: 4 Stars or 8/10.",Batman Forever

185,Ziya90,The only rotten apple in the basket,2,15 February 2010,"I like Val Kilmer, but he was the worst choice as Batman in the series if you ask me. The villains, The Riddler and Two Face, yes they look appealing, interesting, but both, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were exaggerating, I mean their performances and characters both. Tommy Lee Jones is one of my all time favorite actors and I like Jim Carrey, but in this movie, they become unbearable, especially Carrey. Lee Jones also recalls Warden Dwight McClusky, he is as mad as him! (in a negative way) The personalities of the villains are perky in contrast with the original characters. By the way, Nolan's Two Face did not impress me either, but because of screen time problem, not the character. Some critics claim that the relationships in the movie are obscure. They say Two Face and The Riddler have a sexual relationship, so do Batman and Robin. I see such kind of things in the forums either. Mostly, it seems me malicious. Last year, while searching Batman on the internet, I found a picture that Batman and Robin kiss each other. No comment! And please don't charge me with being homophobic or something. Yes, The Riddler in the movie was a bit effeminate, but it does not mean that he sleeps with Two Face! May be this is their fantasy, who knows. They did the same thing for Batman and Robin either. Anyway,there is a love story between Bruce Wayne and Dr. Meridian, it was dull and makes the movie mediocre. A doctor and her patient fall in love. It is not original like the love affair between Bruce Wayne and Selina. Batman Forever is one of the most noisy movies ever made like Stephen Sommers movies, I don't say this as a good thing or bad thing, even if sometimes it was overblown to me. My favorite part is the part which Two Face and his gang chase Batman. As for the final part, it was very weak. In addition, sometimes it is too dark, a disturbing darkness and the expected clash between Batman & Robin and The Riddler % Two Face does not happen. I said it is the only rotten apple, because personally I think that Batman and Robin is much better than this one. May be the only thing I liked about this movie is the first conversation between Batman and Alfred. ''I suppose I could not convince you to take along a sandwich.'' ''I'll get drive-thru.''",Batman Forever
186,kurciasbezdalas,Unappreciated version of Batman,8,24 September 2008,"Many people didn't liked this film because it wasn't taking itself so seriously as previous Batman films. But since when superhero movies should be taken seriously? After all most of the audience will be children. This version is more colorful, more comical and has more action. It's pretty fun to watch. The fighting scenes were much better than in previous films. Althau in some scenes it could be just a little more serious. A good example would be the scene when Bruce Wayne went to a psychiatrist to find out if the man who is sending him a freaky letters is crazy. Probably the most noticeable actor in this film was Jim Carrey. This film would be much worse without him.",Batman Forever
187,PCC0921,The Change to Schumacher,7,15 January 2021,"The third Batman film begins very quickly as the caped crusader (Val Kilmer trying his hardest to fill Michael Keaton's shoes), is called in to save the life of a security guard from the clutches of Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent (Tommy Lee Jones), who is bent on destroying Batman. Batman foils Dent's plans, and enrages Dent even further, so Dent attacks a few more times and during the annual Gotham City Circus, Dent kills the family of a young acrobat, Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell giving us a new kind of Robin). Dick decides he wants revenge. and after becoming Bruce Wayne's ward, he discovers Wayne's secret, and decides that the best way to get his revenge is to become Batman's partner.Meanwhile, an eccentric inventor (Jim Carrey), who has a hatred for Wayne, goes a little crazy with one of his inventions, and becomes the Riddler. He joins forces with Dent and they plot to reveal Batman's true identity. The original Alfred (Michael Gough) and the original Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle), from the Tim Burton movies, return for this one, with a new love interest for Wayne, Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).The film is visually fantastic. The stunts, the action, the colors and the cinematography are all done quite well. Tommy Lee Jones is great, Val Kilmer does his best and Jim Carrey does make a good Riddler. The film does have a good comic book feel to it and it is great to see a Robin who is not post-comics code goofball. The chemistry between Wayne and Meridian is good also and Michael Gough again is the perfect Alfred. Two-Face's character and Robin's character, even-though were portrayed well, felt waisted in this film. That they were only used to tie up the loose ends in the film that the main two characters couldn't finish. There is a finality to Two-Face that is clearly felt early on in the film. You also could tell that O'Donnell's Robin had a enjoyable ceiling that ended with this film.The Bat-Mobile design for this film was a joke and I missed the Burton design, because it actually looked like a car. The film left no feeling in your emotions and by the time the credits were done, I had all but forgotten the film. It was so bad that I went back to see it a second time, because I thought I missed something. This film also lacked the humor of the first two.I miss Burton's apocalyptic touch to the Batman mythos, because that gave the film an almost electrical charge, which gripped a person and when I left the theatre after the first two movies, they were all I could talk about for weeks. We are lucky that Burton hung around as a producer for this film, because in some of the scenes we do see some Burton influenced imagery that saved the film from being a loss. The first two films had an emotion to them. They were pieces of artwork, that Burton put his heart and soul into and it would shine on the screen.Warner Brothers paid too much attention to Joe Moviegoer and Johnny Pop-Culture. They tried to bring in too much of the Adam West Batman into this film. We have to understand the Adam West Batman is gone and replaced with a much darker vigilante in the form of the Dark Knight. Remember, that Gotham City is supposed to be the gothic place where you will find the apocalypse. I will recommend this film, because of the fun, action and the amazing visuals, but in respect to the other two films I think it is the worst of the three.6.6 (C- MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",Batman Forever
188,wildlife-ptech,Fun entertainer but over the top Carrey,7,16 October 2019,Rating6/10Watchable sequel sheds the darkness and feels more light and disposable. Jones is good but upstaged by a hammy Jim Carrey. Fun film more geared towards kids.,Batman Forever
189,AwesomeWolf,"It's very colourful, and that's just the first of many problems",4,10 January 2005,"Much like the villain Riddler, 'Batman Forever' is an enigma. As much as I want to hate it, I just can't, but as much as I want to like it, I can't do that either. 'Batman Forever' has its strengths, but it also has great weaknesses. I blame Joel Schumacher. You're a very bad man, Joel Schumacher.Gotham City now has more neon lights than Tokyo and Hong Kong combined, but the insane criminals are still hanging around. The origin-less and insane Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) is intent on killing Batman (Val Kilmer), and spends most of the movie trying to do this. Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) is also quite insane, a former employee of Wayne Enterprises, Nygma takes up the life of a super-villain and becomes the Riddler. As both Two-Face and Riddler are insane, and intent on taking out Batman, they form a partnership that sees them spending the movie trying to kill Batman, crashing parties, and generally being insane.Its funny: I thought 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' could have been better if they focused more on Batman. Well, 'Batman Forever' is all about Batman, but unfortunately at the expense of every other character. Val Kilmer is good as Batman, and he could have been better if he had not had some of the ridiculous lines that he did. The problem is the villains: Portrayed perfectly in the first two movies, they are now just around for the sake of needing villains. Tommy Lee Jones was not playing Two-Face as much as he was playing a second-rate rip-off of Joker. Nearly all of Nicole Kidman's screen time as Dr Chase Meridian was just cringe-worthy. Jim Carrey was much better at playing The Riddler, even if he was essentially playing an evil version of himself. In fact, he wasn't even that intimidating. He seemed like the kind of villain who needed only a hug to mend his wicked ways.What was Schumacher trying to achieve with this? A balance of dark Batman and campy 60s Batman? Val Kilmer would have been great as Batman, but then Schumacher has to give him nipples on the Bat-Suit and some really stupid lines. Not to mention that Gotham City has gone from being dark and imposing to a very computer generated neon light-show. While Val Kilmer is the Dark Knight, Joel Schumacher is setting everything up nicely for 'Batman and Robin', and you thought Tim Burton had a twisted vision. Joel Schumacher, you are a very bad man.'Batman Forever' is not a terrible film, its just not good either. I'd give it a 5, but taking into consideration that it allowed for Schumacher to move onto 'Batman and Robin', it get's a lowly 4/10 from me. Joel Schumacher, you are a very bad man.",Batman Forever
190,JaydoDre,Childish and shallow but fun,8,1 June 2012,"I had to lie about my age to see this movie in a German movie theater when it first came out. After seeing this (and other movies like this one) I could for a long time not understand why I would not be allowed to see something like that, and now later in life I understand it...even less, because this Batman 3 is clearly a kids movie.With vivid characters with wild expressionist acting this comic book coming to life made a strong impression on me. Add to it violence, a hot Nicole Kidman, Seal's and U2's two songs and I was sold. I loved the performance by Tommy Lee, because...well, it's Tommy Lee. Jim Carrey, walking proof that this is a kid's movie, is just being his crazy self; Nicole Kidman did what she does best - pitching tents; and Val Kilmer is the somewhat emotionless contrasting background to it all.I see however, that for an adult, the over the top act full of dumb jokes and epileptic acting may be a little too much. This is twice the truth when compared to the two movies that preceded Batman Forever, which were substantially darker and more serious.The special effects are not particularly spectacular and there is nothing else to hang your brain on. The sound effects are just as shallow and childish as the rest of it. More importantly, the film does not age well. You can see the first two Batmans today and they still give you food for thought, but this one fades into history to be dusted off only occasionally as a one-liner: ""you know there was already a Batman 3 before."" and nothing more. However it is good movie for your kids that put together an interesting combination of actors.",Batman Forever
191,smellthecult-com-1,Batman Begins.to decline,5,15 October 2009,"Val Kilmer's sole outing in the Batmobile is a mixed affair to say the least. The tone is set almost before the credits have finished rolling: Evocative shots of the Batmobile with Batman himself beside it look impressive and Gothic, in a flashy sort of way. I actually thought ""That looks pretty cool. Maybe this could be OK,"" then the first dialogue interchange happens: ALFRED: ""Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you, sir?"" BATMAN: ""I'll get drive-thru."" And something inside me shrivelled and cooled. My initial feelings of optimism were replaced by a grim knowledge that, if nothing else, the film-makers were going for laughs. Jesus H. Christ. Why this infuriating insistence that every movie has to be 'witty?' You know, it's perfectly fine for something to be 'spooky' or 'moving' or just plain impressive visually without the need to crowbar in humour that only a toothless simpleton could possibly find amusing. Honestly, this is playground humour at its worst. Rant over. The plot itself is functional enough, with one of Wayne's disgruntled employees hellbent on taking over everyone's thoughts with a mind controlling device and transforming into The Riddler along the way. Tommy Lee Jones sticks his oar in as well as Two Face. It's all a little bloated, with an unnecessary overload of famous faces, none of whom are up to much, with the notable exception of Michael Gough as Butler Alfred. It''s not dreadful, folks, it just should have been so much better when you think about how much it cost to make the damn thing.",Batman Forever

It's far better than Batman and Robin, the villain team is good with their chemistry, and there are cool and suspenseful action sequences that can even give you feelings at times! I actually think that this is better than Batman Returns and has some good and interestingly done sequences with Bruce Wayne too!

193,David_Frames,"""Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap...""",3,18 June 2005,"Big problems arose for Warner Brothers when the final figures came in for Batman Returns. Burton's Bat-Sequel had made substantially less than the original. Nearly $90m less in fact and although $160M was still a respectable gross those greedy bean counters plotted to dump the secret of their success and his Gothic, expressionist aesthetic and replace it with something a little more friendly for the those baby-bats who need to be able to enjoy the flick in order to buy the accompanying Burger King meal. Not so much Batman Forever then, more Batman and his ancillary markets and thus we have this second sequel which is the end of the road as far as serious Bat-Adventures are concerned.Schumacher's interpretation of the studios remit is a Gotham in which Batman is Val Kilmer and the tone is an uneasy straddle between the camp, fantasy approach of the 60's T.V series and the Looney Tunes, just without the jokes. Elfman is gone too, his melancholic, sometimes haunting contribution replaced by Elliot Goldenthal's shrill, ear bleeding circus tunes. It tries marginally harder than its successor, the ungodly ...and Robin but only just. Jim Carrey as the Riddler is a suitably sadistic, over the top combination of gurning, infantilism and spite - probably the most interesting character in an otherwise wasted cast but really stupidity personified. That he could get paid $20M for this nonsense is the only genuinely funny thing about his performance. So despite the odd visual flourish this has nothing to recommend it to serious fans of the caped crusader and come of think of it, not much to attract the casual viewer. So what, you may ask, is Batman Forever for? Its back to those Burger King meals I'm afraid...",Batman Forever

Val Kilmer was good as Batman. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey gave good over the top, cartoon like performances as the villains, which in my opinion suited the film as it's clear it wasn't taking itself too seriously. Robin was a bit of a weak link to start with but towards the end he became much more involved. I also really enjoyed Nicole Kidman's character.The costumes/make up and vehicles were excellent and the action scenes were done pretty well too.

Fun and exhilarating (though overly eccentric and a bit cheesy at times), I enjoyed Batman Forever more than its two predecessors. Nicole Kidman and Jim Carrey were great, and I thought Val Kilmer did an admirable job at portraying the caped crusader. While it isn't an ""Oscar-worthy"" film, it was entertaining and fun to watch.",Batman Forever
196,BrickNash,Some decent parts completely overshadowed by juvenile pap!,5,22 September 2013,"Batman Forever was the highly anticipated third film in the, up until this point hugely successful Batman series.Before Batman Forever Tim Burton had provided us with two absolutely mindblowing and never before seen adaptations of the Dark Knight on film. His dark, Gothic take on the comic book character was a perfect match and because of this Batman was no longer the camp, jokey image of the 60's, but a new true hero for the modern age.The film and it's sequel Batman & Robin are probably the best examples in movie history of what happens when a studio interferes with the creative process in order to make more money.Batman Forever, while still retaining some of the moody imagery of Burton, is a dumbed down, jokey, made for kids adventure that saw the series take a major downturn. The film has very high production values but these are lost in a sea of garish neon colours and odd camera angles. Director Joel Schumacher, a fine director in his own right seems to know absolutely nothing about the characters at all and we are left with a very find cast who seem to be winging it. Val Kilmer replaces the excellent Michael Keaton and to be fair, he has the look and the ability to pull of the character with ease but even he looks lost, unenthusiastic and probably wondering what the hell happened. No one can blame him for accepting the role without reading the script, based on the previous two movies I think anyone would kill to be in that position but it just didn't come off the way anyone expected and he was right not to return. The script is mostly terrible, jam packed full of juvenile humour which completely deflates any of the more serious scenes in the film (Of which there are quite a lot and are reasonably well done). The biggest joke in the film is the villains. Played completely like cartoon characters, there is zero sense of danger from two face and the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones looks like he's having a real laugh playing two face which has a lot of energy but it is true that he seems to be taking his performance based on Jack Nicholson's Joker and Jim Carey, a man whom I normally love in films and thought was a perfect choice for the role, is just really Ace Ventura in a green suit for the whole film. A shame because I consider Carey a fine actor and would love to have seen that manic side used to portray a truly psychotic and evil version of the character. Instead we get humour of 5 year olds, terrible dialogue and cartoon boing sound effects.The film does have many good points, the cinematography is lush, it's a good length with plenty of other serious sub-plots to keep you interested. Chris O' Donnel excellent as Dick Grayson/Robin and he brings a real sense of seriousness and emotion to the film with his scenes. The big bonus is that Batman Forever provides more screen time to the wonderful Michael Gough who stayed on as butler Alfred from the Burton films.Batman Forever's biggest failing is that it tries to be a part of the world that the Burton films created. Had it been a fresh reboot it might have worked in it's own right.Essentially the filmmakers took what made the previous two films so popular, the moody and bizarre darkness and watered it down to a milky, money making fluid in order to get kids bums on cinema seats and it was pretty obviously done as well.There was a reason why Batman and Batman Returns did so well at the box office and have endured over the years with fans. Batman Forever did exceptionally well also but a lower age rating and a great franchise reputation were almost completely responsible for this success.If you are on a Batman Film binge then 'Forever' is worth tacking on to the end of the first two if you need more, but this is where things started to really go downhill.",Batman Forever
197,extravaluejotter,"1 Schumacher Good, 2 Schumacher Bad",7,27 July 2006,"There's a lot to like in Joel Schumacher's first Batman film. Schumacher manages to combine the darkness of Tim Burton's preceding films with the camp comedy of the 1960's TV series. There are a couple of moments where the sly in-jokes fall flat, but in the main, ""Batman Forever"" is good old-fashioned popcorn entertainment.Val Kilmer cuts an impressive dash as the Caped Crusader and Chris O'Donnell manages well with introducing the character of Robin. Nicole Kidman plays a v.sexy psychiatrist and the villain of the piece is well represented by Jim Carrey as the vain and insecure Riddler. Poor old Tommy Lee Jones has so little to do in the movie that he can hardly be classed as a proper villain. Jones is never given a chance to show the dual nature of his character ""Two-Face"", which is a real waste of the man's talent.There ARE elements of this movie that presage the toe-curling awfulness of Schumacher's self-indulgent ""Batman and Robin"". The BatMobile becomes a plastic toy, all neon lights and wobbly fins. The tight shot of Kilmer's equally tight rubber-clad butt as he dresses in his Batman costume is gratuitous. Overall, there is the creeping feeling that perhaps we have seen all this ""City In Terror/Dark Knight In Turmoil"" formulaic shtick before.Joel Schumacher IS a good director and I admit that I'm viewing ""Batman Forever"" with hindsight. It's a much better film than ""Batman and Robin"" and should really be seen as a creditable effort to carry the Batman torch that Tim Burton rekindled in 1989.",Batman Forever

In this film the handsome Harvey Dent is replaced by the craggy faced Tommy Lee Jones whose face makes the whole point of two-face redundant! I mean, it was his fantastic looks that sent two-face over the edge, Two-face's visage in this film looks less like acid damage and more like sh*t make-up! Anyway, I'm getting distracted, then along comes Edward Nygma (get in E. Nygma, like Enigma, but even less funny than the dying on stage bit that I did!)who invents this machine that sucks in brainwaves and makes the wearer of the key device smarter turning Ed Nygma into the Riddler (WTF!) I hated this film when I saw it at the pictures and it annoyed the hell out of me that so few people saw the stupid appalling errors that run through this film, from Batman's crap fighting abilities that pale into significance with Robin's to the scene where when the Batcave's security is breached every piece of equipment comes on rather than hides away! What kind of security is that? The performances are terrible and the direction is shockingly bad with Gotham turned into a gay extravaganza with eighty foot naked statues on every street corner. The score is forgettable and its hard to believe that so much work was put into something so shockingly awful, the only saving grace for this film is that it's not ""Batman and Robin"".

200,C22Man,Riddle me this? Not as daft as the before or after,5,6 January 2015,"Batman Forever represented a major change in style for Batman films at that point. After complaints about the dark and grim feel of Batman Returns, it was decided that it was time to tone things down and this led to Forever's lighter approach. Joel Schumacher replaced Burton and Val Kilmer stepped in as the dark knight. What we get is a film that feels very different and very loose, but it was a big success and actually has some very good elements. It is the Batman film people call bland and forgettable, but I think that there is something interesting trying to break through the surface and that it is better than Returns. Story: Well there are two distinct stories going on here. The main one involving the villains' scheme is daft and makes little sense, while the one concentrating on Bruce and Dick is very well-told. The Riddler, a disgruntled Wayne Enterprises worker, creates a device that can drain brainwaves which can be used to make him smarter and he teams up with Two-Face to fund his scheme. This whole plan is like something from the 60's TV show and is just used to get the villains on screen together because it makes little sense. Elsewhere, acrobat Dick Grayson's parents are killed by Two-Face and Bruce tries to steer him away from a life of revenge. Now this story is great, the relationship seems genuine and the themes of revenge are handled excellently. We also get a greater look at the psychology of Bruce Wayne, giving us more insight than either of the two previous films.Batman/Bruce Wayne: Here's a contentious point, I think Val Kilmer is a really good Batman. I think that he balances out both aspects better than anyone else has. His Wayne is believable as a suave, good- looking playboy while having that haunted edge. His Batman is mysterious and more heroic than any other on-screen version. He looks the part in and out of the suit too. With better writing he could have been the definitive Batman and it's a shame he only got one shot at it.Villains: All I can say is that Tommy Lee Jones butchers Two-Face. He's Two-Face for about 30 seconds, as soon as he say's ''luck'' he goes off the deep end and never looks back. Face is basically a Joker knock- off as all he does is run around laughing manically and no aspects of his duality are played up. It's not only a massive waste of a great character, but of Jones as well as he could have been perfect for the part. Jim Carrey is.well Jim Carrey with a hint of Frank Gorshin. He is very entertaining and clearly trying his best so I'll give him that, but his Riddler is just too crazed and holds none of the menace the character should. It was too tailored towards his acting and written differently I think the role could have been pulled it off well.Support: Nicole Kidman is forgettable as psychiatrist Dr. Meridian. To be fair the character is just there for Bruce to be interested in and is given almost nothing to do but look pretty. Chris O'Donnell does a good job as Grayson, even if he looks a bit old. He handles the weighty material well and has chemistry with Kilmer. Michael Gough is excellent once again as a gentler Alfred, while Pat Hingle is dull as Gordon and has little to do throughout.Action: The fight scenes here are a lot better than those in the Burton films. Batman frequently fights many foes using a variety of methods and gadgets which broadens his abilities nicely. The entire opening battle with Two-Face is fantastic and the fight at the party is enjoyable too.Music: Elliot Goldenthal comes in for the music and, though it's not as good as Elfman's scores, he does a rather good job. His main theme is a good replacement. Production: First off, the film does look fantastic. It really does look like a comic book come to life and the use of colour as well as lighting is spectacular. Gotham City also feels less set bound than before and some of the ambitious locations used look great, especially for the time. One problem is some of the writing, which can come off as clunky and awkward. Batman saying things like ''Chicks love the car'' is just ridiculous and so out of character. The Riddler's dialogue is mostly jokes, but then again that is Jim Carrey, and Two-Face adds nothing of interest. Yet when the writing does concentrate on Bruce it can be really good and, as said, we get a more in-depth look at Bruce which is great. The costumes are well made, the Bat suit is probably the best on-screen one and Robin's suit looks really good as well. The villain costumes are a bit over-the-top, Carrey in a spandex is just weird, but they serve a purpose.Conclusion: Batman Forever is much mangled, but is nowhere near as bad as most people say. Of course it has problems as said some of the writing is daft, the villains are overblown and it is heading into a campy direction which would be turned up to eleven in Batman & Robin. But it does have a lot of good things that many overlook. Val Kilmer is a great lead, the Robin arch is done well, it looks at Bruce Wayne a lot more and the action is enjoyably big. I see it as a sort of guilty pleasure in a way, there's problems with it but there's also some really good stuff that is worth watching the silly moments for. Overall it's not as strange or nonsensical as Returns and it's not as mind-blowingly camp as Batman & Robin, it has just the right balance.",Batman Forever
201,Kakueke,A lighter touch,7,22 November 2001,"""Batman Forever"" represents a shift out of the overdone night world of Tim Burton, ultimately needed.  Val Kilmer is a bit better as Bruce Wayne than is Michael Keaton, and as Batman he is more mysterious, a bit more low key, in a positive way (altho still with annoying monotone).  This mixes well with the less-overdone darkness, as does the continued theme of a vulnerable Batman, with shrink.  Nicole Kidman is a good love focus.  Overall, Batman's presence still seems slightly understated.  It was nice to have Robin included this time, of course.  But the introduction of Chris O'Donnell has to be strong, and thus, the show is somewhat stolen from Batman, as it is in various ways in all the Batman movies from 1989 onward.  O'Donnell does well, and actually has a more macho presence than Keaton or George Clooney, although Kilmer arguably matches him.  Robin is still a youth, like Burt Ward, but a real manly one, and we know the ladies like him.Whereas Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is basically solid, no particular comments from me, Jim Carrey as the Riddler was both better and worse. Harlequin, Pantomime.  But no, certainly not really the latter, for boy, does he talk!  The most full-of-himself Batman villain, far exceeding Jack Nicholson's Joker.   Pompous, campy.  In fact, as for the latter word, I can think of no villain on the TV series (certainly not Frank Gorshin) that outdid Carrey in that category.  Not in either loudness or effeminateness. Clearly, Carrey's performance is strong -- he acts well, he overacts.  What am I stating, am I being confusing?  Let me put it this way:  the acting performance, what Carrey accomplishes, the talent he shows, is great.   But as for the effect on the viewer, it gets yecchy, and not just in too much, but too often.  Perhaps a metaphor for the problem, and certainly a problem in itself, is the lack of riddles.  Give me a break, we need more than a couple of riddles.  Instead of more riddles, we get too much of Carrey. 
""Batman Forever"" is livelier than the first two Batmans, and far surpasses the unpleasant Batman II.  Batman I is best represented by the great role of The Joker and overall humor that matches or exceeds that of ""Forever,"" but I give ""Forever"" a slight edge.",Batman Forever

206,emilie8605,a winner!,8,10 January 2004,"after viewing the batman returns, this one does do a world of good to follow that one. using a new batman for every film does do the mystery a great deal of good, however, the female roles should be given a little more thought, then just throwing in nicole kidman.  that one really was a messup, since she doesnt fit the qualities to make the female role.  those qualities, in my opinion, consist of 2 things: a certain kind of *umph* and she always should be a good actress, so she can sell the performance to the audience. that performance is really iffy, and she just looked like she was forced into the part, just for the cash. she wasnt as good as michelle, but she is pretty.  that's all she was.  I thought maybe they should have looked into calling katie holmes or tara reid.  that's just me. the evil guys really rocked, and added to the main performances of batman, and the sidekick, robin. robin, chris o'donnell was the right choice for batman. maybe if he had the hair short and parted like burt ward from the 60's, he would have been identical to the original tv series robin. the riddler was always obsessed with wearing the color green, which green i thought means greed, and he does appear greedy (**SPOILER**) since he wants all the knowledge in gotham city with that weird thing that looks like a hourglass.  the makeup was super on two-face, tommy, i send you kudos.  this is a great third edition to the batman series.  it makes you wanna break out in costume and wear your leather batman outfit..well, kinda.

207,xbrad68,JP Morgan mentioned on the CBS news tonight,8,9 March 2006,"Batman Forever starring Val Kilmer is an Okay movie. George Clooney was told by movie executives that he ruined the Batman franchise. That was not true because George Clooney is a very good actor and won best supporting actor at the academy awards for the movie Syriana. Robins holy/holey remark is so so. President Jack Kennedy hinted to me that ""You shall be true to those who are false to you."" I therefore truthfully reported that the Ki stargates were in fact large augurs that ground up the bodies of dead sentient species that went through them and then used the meat and bones for fishfood. The words Morgan and chum were used close together on the CBS News so I know that America has read my law abiding E-mails. It was not my intention to anger the care rank Ki with the truth. The Character of Daniel Jackson representing me is shown passing through the Stargate successfully so perhaps they are positioned near a moonfleet moons airlock and do not always augur people. If after billions of years the Care Rank Ki have not made a real stargate theirs is no disgrace. Perhaps the laws of physics did not make this possible. The messages back through time devices of the Care Rank Ki are impressive on the other hand and of strategic importance to the Kisser Alliance.Here is the new code for Americas Nuclear War Football:""Drop squad you're Simon Le Bon between the marionets Donne the Brad M Ki Aweigh int."" I give my advance approval for a defensive nuclear strike against any foreign aggressor who launches first as Brad HD Morgan the American Shadow Vice President.

When he was playing that riddle game with Batman when he had Robin and Chase in those cages, I kept wanting to ask the Riddler ""What's green and bleeding if it doesn't shut its face?"" Sorry. Bad move casting Jim Carrey as the Riddler. I really miss Frank Gorshin in that roll. I thought Tommy Lee Jones did a good job as Two-Face.Now, what is this crap? Batman seemed to be warming up, opening up a little bit. While that may be great for the touchy-feely crowd, that isn't Batman. Batman is the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader, the Winged Avenger. He is not warm and fuzzy and all mellow. Didn't like the direction they took this. And Robin got in one of those ridiculous ""holy"" lines from the old sixties TV series. Pretty lame.

210,BigWhiskers,More like Batman Forever awful,3,11 August 2012,"I went to see this and actually thought it was better than the first 2 which of course isn't saying much . Val Kilmer was at least more physically easier to look at. Nicole Kidman however was annoying and Chris O'Donnell was totally unnecessary as Robin, his acting is awful - he comes across as a pouty little crybaby. Good thing they avoided the Robin character in the reboots as Bale did not want the sidekick thing because it does detract from the darker tones. And Robin didn't come along for a long time in the stories anyway. The problem with the Batman movies from the 80's and 90's was it catered to the six flags generation - amusement park rides and corny music etc. It was all about making money off toys and action figures. I mean how many times did you see these Batman and Robin action figures in stores or at McDonalds. Carrey as the Riddler is wasted in what could have been a really bad-ass role for him ,instead he is played more for comic relief as is Tommy Lee Jones two face. Nobody is serious in this film.It's like one big joke and the ending with the characters running towards the screen like the 60's show used to do in the animated intros is such a campy piece of crap.",Batman Forever
211,ciscokid1970,In my opinion the BEST of the Batmans,9,25 May 2010,"OK I am writing this in retrospective, but this movie is still the best of the Batman series. We have now had 4 different Batmans (Keaton, Kilmer, Clooney and Bale) and 6 movies. This movie was the complete package, solid story, plenty of action and brilliant bad guys.Be honest before you rate my reviewin EVERY Batman movie we have rated it by the quality of the villain. And Jim Carrey as Riddler was the best rendition of a comic book villain. (The Joker movies had impressive acting but took Joker way out of scope) As a bonus they threw in a good performance from Tommy Lee Jones and nice little parts for Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar. Kilmer does a low key job as Wayne and Batman, which is what Batman is SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. Hey even Chris O'Donnell as robin only added to the comic color pages. Top it off with the best song in any of the batman movies, U2 – Hold me thrill me kiss me.Action is fantastic, filming is rich and colorful (not just looking like it was filmed in a basement). Batmans toys were used and seen when needednot just talked about like in other movies.Of all the Batman movies this is the one I find myself watching the most. It also has fantastic action without seeming wimped down. It is still safe for kids 10 and older. Well worth owning.",Batman Forever
212,stp43,The Spirit Of Adam West Infects The Dark Knight,6,7 August 2003,"For fans of the dark, serious Batman as portrayed in the comics and also in The Animated Series, this third Batman film under the wing of Tim Burton is a major disappointment, a reversion to some of the cheesy camp of the Adam West Batmans of the 1960s. While some of the weaknesses in such an approach could be seen even in the first two Burton Batmans (notably in Jack Nicholson's overrated Joker performance), it is here under Joel Schumacher's direction that the ghost of Adam West really infects Gotham City, right down to the tone used in parts of Eliot Goldenthal's score - the car-chase scene, pitting the Batmobile against an army of 1950s Cadillacs, is scored almost like Neal Hefti and Nelson Riddle would have scored it for the 1960s show.Now don't get me wrong; I enjoy the Adam West Batmans as well. The point here is that that particular context does not work as well in the dark Frank Miller/Paul Dini/Bruce Timm context put forth so brilliantly over the years. The campy quality of the Adam West Batmans is found primarily in the obnoxious in-your-face cheesiness of the villains and also in the weak context of their origin. The Animated Series always succeeded in exploring the villains even within the confines of a 30-minute episode; here, despite the feature length, there is no serious exploration of the villains.Not that there isn't any exploration of character - Schumacher surprisingly scores in his treatment of Bruce Wayne/Batman's relationship with Doctor Chase Meridian, who acts rather like a vamp as she lusts after Batman (even to stripping half-naked before him) and who almost consummates this love with the Dark Knight. This angle gets off to a slow start (the stripping angle is a bit annoying) but overall manages to work.A lot of people didn't like Val Kilmer's performance here, but I thought he got the voice and mannerisms down properly; he's not as good as Kevin Conroy here, but he's surprisingly close. Nicole Kidman does a great Barry Morse-esquire American accent, though her opening line, ""Hot entrance,"" gets her performance off to a less-than-stellar start. The primary weakness of the film lies in Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Fans of Richard Moll's Two-Face and John Glover's Riddler must cringe at seeing Jones and Carrey do nothing but try to out-Joker Jack Nicholson's Joker - Riddler asking Two-Face if he knows he has a serious problem with controlling impulse, and also if anyone else feels like a fried egg when linking his brain with his Box mind-control beam is thoroughly inept, both in the writing and also in the actual execution. Two-Face here is strictly one-dimensional; he hates Batman and is completely over the top in doing so, yelling forever about trapping the Bat, and whining almost like a child as each attempt on Batman's life goes wrong. The Riddler is no better; Carrey basically overdoses on Frank Gorshin and makes The Riddler The Cable Guy meets The Farrelley Brothers, not the understated criminal John Glover perfected in The Animated Series - since when did the real Riddler ever yell as loud as Carrey? Even Frank Gorshin knew how to make him subtle.And yet in spite of all this, the film is an entertaining spectacle, featuring several great fight scenes, the strikingly strong scene where Two-Face attacks the circus and leaves Dick Grayson the sole survivor of The Flying Graysons (the closeness of Mr. and Mrs. Grayson is especially well done albeit brief), the final reconciliation between Batman and his new partner, Robin, before they both go after Two-Face and Riddler, and Batman's aerial rescue of Chase and Robin. So while dismal compared to the serious Batman, Batman Forever is no total loss; it has enough quality to be an entertaining spectacle.",Batman Forever
213,Doublej20005,An Underwhelming Sequel to Say the Least,4,31 December 2020,"I... don't really know what I was expecting. Like, this is really bad. Val Kilmer clearly doesn't want to be there, the character motivations are really underdeveloped, especially compared to the first two films, and the directing is just really bad. It's a shame because, from what I've seen based on Letterboxd Average Ratings, Joel Schumacher is clearly a good director, but the action is really hard to follow at points because of the directing. Now there are the obvious stupid parts (Bat nipples etc) but more than that it just didn't entertain me as much as I wanted it too. I knew that these films were going to be bad, but I hoped to at least enjoy them. I enjoyed the first hour to an extent, but after that it became equal parts boring as it is outright bad, although the decent ending saves it from being truly terrible. I think what annoyed me most about the film was Chase Meridian, who is just a terrible character. Her line delivery is way too over the top, and her dialogue is just painful to listen to. At least Jim Carrey was fun I guess, but yeah, this isn't very good. I can kind of tell why some people would enjoy this, but I was honestly left a bit bored, and the worst thing a film can really do is bore me.",Batman Forever
214,T-ZER0,Batman films turn sour,2,2 August 2019,"If any of you seen my YouTube channel, you know that I think this movie is pretty bad, and it is. Compared to the previous two, it's too campy and lacking good story. Let's start with the positives:Jim Carrey does an amazing job as Riddler, I do believe he is my favorite Riddler. Because he's played characters like the Mask and Ace Ventura, he was the ideal pick for this role. Schumacher at least did that right. As well as his cool costume.Chris O' Donnell is my favorite Robin so far. His origin story is touching and I love how his backstory parallels Batman's. His family was murdered by a psychopath and he wants to take his revenge. Also, the Robin costume is cool, too bad Robin didn't have much action sequences. But I loved the fight between him and Two-Face. I also loved that Two-Face was his archenemy.Now to the negatives:Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is awful. He's way to manic and not calm and collected like the real Two-Face is. That's what made the real Two-Face scary. Is that he's cool and you don't know what his attitude is at that moment.Val Kilmer's Batman was pretty bad too. I don't understand how he can be considered Batman when all he wants to do is satisfy his sexual desires with Chase Meridian. She's the reason he gave up being Batman.Finally, the worst part of the movie. Chase Meridian. I know most of you are thinking: ""What are you talking about? She was the best part! She was soo sexy!"" To Be Honest, If the only reason why anyone likes her is because of her sex appeal, they have a real problem. The old Batman comics were never about liking women because of their bodies. We have to endure over forty minutes of Chase harassing Batman. On the rooftop, at a party, and even in her own bedroom. Which I'm wondering why would Batman even agree to meet her at her apartment? Superheroes probably get hit on by a lot of groupies, and he's going to let one woman ruin his career because he thinks she's hot??Besides that, we go through her rejecting Bruce and then Batman over and over again. How are we expected to cheer for them when on her first scenes with Batman she hits on him like a drunkard.So yeah, the movie is that bad. If you must see it. See it for Carrey, but if you don't. You're not missing much.",Batman Forever
215,asinyne,Cool movie here,7,1 June 2006,"I certainly think this is a better film than rated here. Nicole Kidman was super hot, Kilmer was decent, and Tommy Jones was fun as two face. Batman and the sets looked good, very Tim Burtonish. The story wasn't especially well written but that's OK because it's mostly about style and letting a great cast ham it up to the max...and they do. I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan but he made a fun Riddler. The movie does take quite a while to really hit its stride but the second half is a fun ride. Every single scene with Nicole Kidman in it sizzles. She and Kilmer have good chemistry together. Tommy Lee's last line before he ""dies"" is really cool. He delivered it so perfectly and in character. I loved that part. Batman makes several great entrances, I especially liked the one at the Riddler's big party towards the end of the show. I don't consider myself a huge fan of the Batman films(this is actually the first one I've seen), however I was entertained and this is absolutely a don't miss for Nicloe Kidman fans. There is a scene with her in bed covered by only a silk sheet and WOW! The 2.99 I paid at goodwill for this VHS rewarded me handsomely with that scene alone!...cheers",Batman Forever
216,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,An Underrated Superhero Film,5,30 June 2019,"Introduction:Batman Forever is an okay superhero film. Many might hate it, but I think the hate is so undeserved. It's silly, I agree. Tommy Lee Jones is awful, I agree. It's not as good as some other Batman films, I agree. But I still like it, it's kind of like my love for the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy, it knows it's dumb. And it decides to embrace the silliness.Why I Like It:I always found it hypocritical that people love the Adam West series, even though it's just as silly as this movie. And, am I the only one that likes the silliness? It establishes itself as silly from the first line, in the infamous moments, where Alfred asks Bruce as he's about go out for a night of crime fighting. ""May I interest you in a sandwich?"" and Batman says, ""I'll get drive-thru."" People rage over this moment. But when it's done in the Dark Knight, with Batman saying a witty line, no one cares. And while I love the Dark Knight, if people are gonna criticize Batman Forever, for something the Dark Knight did as well. I have to point that out. And even the, Batman Forever still has dark imagery, people always forget about those. But the film does have silly imagery for kids, and dark imagery for adults.I also hate that Joel Schumacher gets so much hate for this film. When he made Phone Booth and The Lost Boys, two great films, possibly even some of the greatest of all time.I also like all the characters, as they feel like they were perfectly adapted from the comic book. The Riddler, even though he wasn't a perfect adaptation, was based on a version from the comics. Something many people might not know. And I just love the over the top performance from Jim Carry, who really injects new life into the character. While I don't think he's as good as the version in the show Gotham. Gotham is my favorite Batman adaptation, so it's pretty stiff competition. I also think Chris O'Donnell's Robin is underrated. Even though he's miscast, as he was a 20 year old man, playing a teenager. But that doesn't mean the performance was bad, and it doesn't mean he wasn't written well. Robin was interesting, as his world was turned upside down after the death of his parents. And you really have an understanding of the character's struggle.However, it's not all perfect. Val Kilmer is rather a little bland as Batman. He's alright, he just doesn't compare to other versions. But the elephant in the room is Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. I think the over the top performance doesn't fit the character. Two-Face should a little more calm and calculative than this.I also believe the look of the film, is very comic book accurate. And while Gotham is often depicted as a dark, Gothic looking place. There are versions that are a little more colorful. And even the dark looking ones, have color. And this city has so much character to it. Vibrant colors, and excellent sets. What can I say? I think Gotham City looks great.Conclusion:So, this only brings up the question, why is it so hated? I think that people hate this film, because it's in the shadow of Batman & Robin. And because that film is so bad, people hate this one as well. I mean, do people remember Batman Forever? You probably don't. and that probably brings up a question. How come I still hate Batman & Robin? Well, because Batman & Robin is too silly, and makes no sense. The two villains want to do entirely different things. One wants to freeze over the Earth, the other wants to cover it in plants. That makes no sense, and those plans contradict each other. Regardless, I think Batman Forever is a good movie, it's an unpopular opinion. But who says I have to agree with what the majority say?",Batman Forever
217,andyajoflaherty,What happened?,3,28 June 2020,"You'd think having the combined talents of Jim Carrey, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones and Nicole Kidman would pretty much guarantee a quality product, but alas this film fails spectacularly after the rather sublime Batman Returns. A move toward the cheesy camp, err.... 'camp' was not a wise move imo, and for a Batman film there was a distinct lack of, well, Batman. Two Face was an irritating Joker knock off, and Carrey seemed to be playing the Mask all over again, except more ridiculous and less intelligently - ironic really, given the films plot. Ah well at least there was plenty of Kidman cleavage and legs, so it's not all bad. Just mostly bad...",Batman Forever
218,BlueSkies765,Batman Forever,10,8 June 2019,"Generally considered as one of the weaker movies of the Batman franchise, I do however like this movie a lot and not just for nostalgic reasons.The tone is completely different from the Nolan entries. Batman Forever aimed to be 'kid-friendly' with a more colorful and goofy approach. I can see how this is popular with the younger crowd as I too -when I was a kid- loved the cheesy oneliners by the bad guys and over-the-top comedy.
The above characterized the 90s. Nostalgia lovers will eat this kind of stuff up but because it's very much a product of that time it can also feel outdated for those who haven't experienced that era.As I rewatch this years later I see the problems with Batman Forever. It has too many storylines running at the same time. The first half of the movie is all over the place. It's scene after scene with little coherence. It's like it can't decide what it wants to be. Ironically because the theme of the movie is also about this.Bruce Wayne's struggle to find himself with Robin and his enemies The Riddler and Two-Face serving as metaphors for his internal crisis. This is what Batman Forever was aiming for. There was a deeper message but it was unfocused because too many things were going on.
For instance when Dr. Meridian guides Bruce to overcome his demons she gives him the two-colored doll (reference to Two-Face and his dual identity). These were all little things to add depth to the story but it got convoluted because there was too much going on in the first half.The second half of the movie had focus. It was a full-blown war between the good guys and the bad guys. Even though this didn't offer much depth at least it had direction so I stayed engaged as I wanted to see what will happen next. Unlike losing interest at times during the first half because it jumped from one random scene to another.I still consider Batman Forever a classic. Val Kilmer is my favorite Batman and the star-studded cast from Nicole Kidman to Jim Carrey gave this movie plenty of memorable moments.",Batman Forever
219,Derek237,And now for something completely different,7,15 November 2005,"I loved the first two Batman movies, and honestly would have loved to see Burton go on to direct more entries in the series, but Joel Shumacher's Batman Forever is not at all an unwelcome change. I think some people recollect this film and automatically associate it with Shumacher's awful second Batman attempt, Batman & Robin. That is the bad movie. This is not. People also seem to forget how big of a hit it was. Artistically, there were things it got wrong and didn't do as well as the others, but there were things it did so much better, too. For one thing, this is the only 'Batman' with a decent soundtrack to its name (including 2 great songs by U2 and Seal).In some ways you can look at this as a transition from the dark, tortured Batman to a Batman who has finally conquered his personal demons and gone on to be happier in being a man who fights crime in the night dressed up in rubber. For this one it was good, 'cause that's essentially how it ends, but the result of this led to the campy and just plain boring 4th episode.But I really was surprised at how psychological of a movie Batman Forever is. I'm not saying it's particularly deep, but when you look at Edward Nygma's obsession with Bruce Wayne (stalking him, to imitating him right down to the mole), Harvey Dent's schizophrenia as Two-Face, and the fact that both Bruce Wayne AND Batman end up romancing the same psychologist is all enormously amusing. The romance isn't to be taken that lightly, though. I thought out of all 5 films Chase Meridian was Bruce's best girlfriend. The whole Vicky Vale relationship was pretty stale if you cut out all of the conflict with the Joker, and obviously Selina Kyle didn't work out so well for Bruce. Having this woman who could understand the mind of the tortured Bruce Wayne was a great idea, and I don't need to tell you that the gorgeous and talented Nicole Kidman pulled it off well.Something I liked (and would have liked to have seen more of) was the competitive relationship between Bruce Wayne and Edward Nygma. They're enemies as Batman and The Riddler but also as regular people in everyday life. Take that scene at the Nygmatec Ball when Edward gloats about how well off he is, but Bruce is totally unflinching. Jim Carrey does a great job with a character that is so obsessed with this person; who idolizes him but hates him at the same time and is generally evil, but still can make us fall on the floor laughing.This is a rousing and dynamic picture. It's basically the lighter side of being Batman. It was exciting with some great action sequences: I loved the end where both Robin and Chase are dropped and he saves them both. That piece of Elliot Goldenthal music when Batman finally grasps Robin's arm is excellent.I liked Burton's 2 films and obviously Batman Begins better than Forever, but when you're in the right mood for it, it really is a fantastic movie that, if nothing else, thoroughly entertains.My rating: 7/10",Batman Forever

Despite the great main plot, again we've Batman/Bruce getting romantically involved with someone. Differently of the other two movies, that romance doesn't seems to fit the story and is just odd. About the villain, Jim Carrey as the Riddler becomes a classic, but Two-Face has all his potential wasted in this script. Some references to Adam West's Batman TV series and Dick Grayson appearance made it fun to watch. The change of tone is also very odd, I believe that's a reason why the fans of the first two movies didn't like that one.",Batman Forever

This one didn't have a dark tone like Tim Burton's two films but I like it and it's good to enjoy the action. Val Kilmer was all right playing Batman and Bruce Wayne. When I watch him he feels like he's calm and smooth. Jim Carrey was crazy and demented as the Riddler. He was almost like Jack Nicholson's character of the Joker. Although Carrey played a crazy character in the Cable Guy. Tommy Lee Jones was a bad boy as Two-Face. Chris O'Donnell did a great performance as Robin. Nicole Kidman captured my eyes and heart with her character. She is beautiful and I like her.Top 3 Batman films: 1. Batman (1989) 2. Batman Returns 3.

222,walsh-22,Batman lives on,7,1 July 2009,"Michael Keaton was menacing as Batman in the first two films and Val Kilmer brings the same intensity but who really stands out in Batman Forever is Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face/Harvey Dent and Jim Carey as the Riddler. They were really off the wall and kept me entertained especially Carey but Jones was a surprise, I have never seen him as crazy as this.Okay the film can be cartoonish (sorry if I spelt it wrong) at times but I think Joel Schumacher captures the spirit of Batman that Tim Burton started in his films but I can also understand that a lot of people didn't like this version to the films done previously by Burton and Keaton as some of the other roles were not suitable cast and it was a bit over the top in places but it is still worth watching.",Batman Forever

That's right, add wacky, over-the-top goof-ball villains! Tom Lee Jones stars in his second movie featuring him as a psycho and U2 on the soundtrack. He guffaws, he sneers, he sobs, he smiles manically and gives as physical as a performance as his aging body allows.Pity, then, that he fades completely in every scene Jim Carrey is in, or every scene where we expect him to enter soon, which are all of Lee's scenes. And it's no wonder. Jim Carrey is his usual wacko character, grimacing and silly-walking his way through the movie. While that's usually fun to watch, Joel Schumachers tilting direction makes it all slightly nauseating.He does have some of the best lines, and there's nothing wrong with his performance. I stress 'his', cause there was plenty of wrong with the others. Chris O'Donnel juts his jaw and strains his face, throwing lines left and right without the slightest fore-thought. Nicole Kidman stands around looking sassy and gets some of the worst lines.Val Kilmer is totally bland, and were it not for ""Heat"" I would not be able to recall how he looked. And we covered Tom Lee Jones. There are a few other roles, all of them filled with people busting to top Jim Carreys performance. The only one we can trust is old Michael Gough, the butler.There are plenty of phony-looking gun fights and explosions, large sets that actually give you the unusual gut feeling that the money could have been used to build that house in Gambia or Etiopia, and more innuendo than you can stand, ranging from the obvious(closeup of the Batbutt with a mysterious zipper) to the slightly more sublime(Alfred calling Robin ""Master Dick"").Unless you're a Jim Carrey fan or like camp-noir movies, then there's nothing for you to see here. Move along.",Batman Forever
224,Newsense,Campman Forever,2,24 August 2008,"When I first saw this movie in theaters with my brother I was at a loss for words. I didn't hate this movie but I didn't love it either. Burton's Batman movies gave the comic book character the needed respect its deserved. Joel Blueblocker turned Batman into a clown show.Plot: Two-Face(played by Tommy Lee Jones) is bent on trying to kill Batman. Edward Nygma(played by Jim Carrey) is bent on making Bruce Wayne suffer for refusing to back up his brain drain machine. In the middle of all this Bruce Wayne/Batman(played by Val Kilmer) has to deal with Chase Meridian(played by Nicole Kidman), a psychiatrist, whose high school crush on Batman is nothing short of frustrating.Opinion: The positives of this movie: The special effects aren't half bad and it has some decent action sequences. The negatives: The dialog is painfully juvenile. I like Val Kilmer but not as Batman. He's basically sleepwalking through the whole movie. Nicole Kidman, a great actress, is wooden as a pine tree while she spouts corny one-liners and laughable psychological rhetoric throughout the movie. Tommy Lee Jones, another great actor, is terrible as Two-Face. He was more over-the-top here than he was as that psychotic warden in Natural Born Killers! Jim Carrey is excruciating as Riddler! He was still doing that stupid a** Ace Ventura shtick throughout the movie plus Edward Nygma's obsession with making Bruce Wayne pay for ignoring him is akin to a jilted girlfriend making her ex-boyfriend pay for cheating on her. If that wasn't bad enough you have deal with overtly campy dialog peppered throughout the duration of the movie and when Batman walked away from Chase with a smile on his face? Talk about pure cheese! That scene will remain in movie cheese history along with Keanu Reeves flipping off the devil in Constantine and the bat card in Batman & Robin. While this movie is not as terrible as the monstrosity that comes after it(Batman and Robin) it was preview of the nail in the coffin for one of the best superhero movie series of all time.",Batman Forever

This movie was a disappointment. I couldn't really see any acting and I couldn't see much direction from Joel Schumacher, who's actually a good director. But in the end, the writing is what makes the film bad. What a bad movie choice for Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey! They could've chosen better!

226,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Hit and miss,6,2 June 2006,"Batman Forever's reputation has been unfairly tarnished by Batman & Robin. Overall, BF is actually a fun action movie with a few good elements of drama. Schumacher was told to make a more family friendly Batman movie, and he delivered. It would have been better if he did not have to take out certain scenes that were vital to Bruce Wayne's character development. These scenes are available in the deleted scenes feature on the most recent DVD release.BF has a typical superhero movie plot. Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is obsessed with killing Batman. Jim Carrey plays Edward Nygma, a man who idolizes Bruce Wayne and literally wants to be him. But when Bruce Wayne turns down his invention, a machine that would connect human minds to their televisions, Nygma embarks on a quest for revenge. He learns that his machine can actually make him smarter. As the Riddler, he teams up with Two-Face to kill Batman and become the smartest man in the world.Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer) has his own personal problems. He is haunted by his parent's death, and somehow feels responsible. On top of that, he falls in love with a psychologist named Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), but she is obsessed with Batman. Wayne adopts Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), a circus performer whose parents were killed by Two-Face. Grayson has a thirst for revenge, much like Bruce Wayne did in Batman (1989).Val Kilmer makes a decent Batman and an even better Bruce Wayne. I still place him below Keaton because his voice was monotonous, whereas Keaton managed to be creepy with his whispers. Chris O'Donnell and Michael Gough both gave good performances too. What really makes the movie work is the relationship between these characters. Dick Grayson is almost a mirror image of Bruce Wayne. I must also give props to Schumacher and Kilmer for how they handled Bruce's flashbacks to his parent's death. They presented a truly tortured man. Chase Meridian's romance with Bruce Wayne, while not extraordinary, is much more tolerable than the love stories in some of the more recent comic book movies. Dare I say, Batman Forever has the best action scenes of all the Batman movies too.So far, my review has been mostly positive, but I have plenty of problems with this movie. My criticisms of Batman Forever are really just creative differences. One sentence can sum it up: I prefer a darker Batman. Ultimately, this movie is just too goofy. For one thing, Gotham City is too bright; neon lights and Gotham City just don't mix. Gotham should be dark and gloomy. Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Two-Face is so clownish it's a travesty. Jones did not understand the character. The scene where he flips the coin until he gets the response he wants is completely out of character. He is essentially reduced to the Riddler's lackey. While Jim Carrey's performance was a good tribute to Frank Gorshin, I prefer the Riddler from Batman: The Animated Series, who was sinister in a subtler way. Carrey, like Jones, is just too goofy for me.I know this criticism has been done to death, but I have to bring it up. The most infamous aspect of Schumacher's legacy is the bat nipples. Let me tell you, the nipples didn't phase me as much as the close up shots of Batman's butt. I mean really, what was the point? For me, all of these goofy/comedic elements almost negate what is good about the movie, which is why I can only give it a 6.",Batman Forever
227,GTeixeira,Schumacher tries to undo everything Burton did,2,21 October 2013,"The idea behind Batman has always been quite dark; however, seeing as comic books were being marketed towards kids, they had to make Batman goofy and campy (an image further emphasized by Adam West's TV serial). By the 80's, they started backing up the dark side of the character; Tim Burton's 'Batman' being a much needed deviation towards creating this new image.The third film of Batman's franchise, 'Batman Forever' saw Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer enter the fray to replace Tim Burton and Michael Keaton as director and star respectively. However, Schumacher took the franchise in the entire opposite direction Burton was doing: he reenacted the old silly, campy and idiotic vision of Batman.Whereas Burton created a fascinating city, Schumacher creates a mere dulled-down and neon-filled version of his world. The special effects try to be flashy, but are merely dull and even outdated. Schumacher's tries to add wit and something akin to slapstick comedy end up making it work not like he expected, but as a witless 'so bad it is kinda funny' kind of film. Heck, the plot is ludicrous even for a comic book story.The cast might seem good in theory but, in the end, is totally out of chemistry and misplayed. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey try to play mere copycats of Jack Nicholson's Joker. By the end, not only do they contradict everything said of their characters by doing so (and also make every comic fan cringe), they end up doing little more than an exercise in overacting and buffoonery; TLJ makes a complete joke of himself as Two-Face while Carrey, one of my favorite modern comedians, is way too hit-or-miss as the Riddler.Val Kilmer is far too feminine in comparison to Keaton, and while he is somewhat passable as Bruce Wayne he holds no sense of menace or mystery as Batman; Chris O'Donnell manages to be even worse, and actually ends up as a clichèd troubled teenager. Nicole Kidman is very ill-suited as a femme fatale, and Drew Barrymore is pretty much a cameo (I didn't even know she was there the first time I watched). Even Michael Gough is worse here than he was on Burton's films.Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer, the main couple, seem to be doing completely different scenes at all when together and their expressions never match; that's how good the chemistry and acting is here.Unfortunately, despite the entire idiocy that was 'Batman Forever' (and there was a lot, from the battles with Two-Face to the attack on Wayne Manor), Schumacher somehow got permission to further destroy the franchise with an even worse sequel. My only guess is that, being gay, Schumacher was a believer of the Batman/Robin innuendos and/or identified himself with Adam West's campy version and decided to try and turn Batman back into the campy hero he loved and/or identified with.Which would explain Batman's nipples in the sequel...",Batman Forever
228,andrewmerritt-31652,Call it a guilty pleasure,7,4 November 2019,"Batman Forever stars Val Kilmer, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey and is directed by Joel Schumacher. After Michael Keaton and Tim Burton left the project with Tim Burton still staying on as producer Joel Schumacher took up the reins. And Joel Schumacher has directed some great films like Flatliners, Falling Down, and the Lost Boys. And his new vision of Batman feels like your going on some weird acid trip that's very colorful, campy, and flamboyant. Its like Joel Schumacher took inspiration from the 1960s Batman and decided to make it his own, but he didn't take it seriously as the 1960s Batman did. Granted the 1960s Batman was campy and cheesy when it first came out, but even that took Batman and the villains seriously than this confusing movie. I will say that Val Kilmer was the perfect choice for Bruce Wayne as Batman, but they need to work on his dialogue as well as his portrayal instead of making him into a lovesick puppy. Your Bruce Wayne you can get any girl your heart desires don't make Nicole Kidman your own and only love when you had Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle. We also have Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler. Even their portrayal and costume design needs some work as the costumes look like someone in the costume department couldn't afford the costumes they were going for so they ran to the nearest Party City or Hot Topic and threw it on almost anything in the movie without a second thought. And both Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey felt like one big competition of who could act more crazy, zany, and insane where the winner is clearly Jim Carrey and if you get into a competition with Jim Carrey you're going to lose. Jim Carrey was the perfect choice as the Riddler, but I wish Joel Schumacher took inspiration from the animated series or the 1960s Batman instead of Jim Carrey acting like Ace Ventura on speed and offer smart intellectual riddles instead of riddles that a monkey could figure them out. So in the end I would say Batman Forever is a guilt pleasure in the Batman franchise that is enjoyable to watch, but needs some work in the costume and the screenplay department.",Batman Forever

230,matlefebvre20,"Batman reviews, part III: The beginning of the end",4,25 July 2007,"From the beginning of the title sequence of the movie ""Batman Forever"" and from the first dialog between Batman (Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton) and his butler Afred (Michael Gough), we can feel that there's obviously something in that movie that makes things different from the first two Tim Burton movies.And what follows for the next two hours corresponds exactly with what you were expecting. The film is far less dark and it is fulfilled with action, explosions and gaudy images, just like a James Bond flick. It is obvious enough that the new director Joel Schumacher has a vision which is the opposite of Burton's one.Schumacher seems to be a filmmaker who grew up with the campy TV series from the '60s which starred Adam West and Burt Ward. The movie ""Forever"" looks like a conjugation of that series and the atmosphere from the Burton movies and Schumacher never hesitates to include references from that series and the first two films. Unfortunately, this is a disastrous move...At the very beginning, we assist to a gravity-less confrontation between Batman and coin-flipping, disfigured gangster Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), whose only purpose is to give an introduction without rushing anything in. By the way, we assist to the introduction of Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who tries to seduce Batman, but she falls in love with Bruce Wayne.One night at the circus, Two-Face kills the members of the Grayson family, an acrobat group, except the youngest one Dick (Chris O'Donnell). Bruce Wayne then offers to Dick to accommodate him. But the boy quickly discovers his host's secret. Progressively, Dick wins Wayne's trust and he's allowed to become Batman's sidekick, Robin.At the same time, the Riddler, aka Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), arrives. Nygma is the inventor of the Box, an apparatus having the capacity of picking up cerebral waves and transmitting them directly to the Riddler's brain.While the first two movies only counted three main actors, this one has no less than five major characters. And of these five characters, two are good, two are bad and one is rather average.It's Val Kilmer who's that average actor. His performance is correct, without being exceptional. We feel that he doesn't own that glum and tortured soul which Michael Keaton owned so well in the first movie. However, he is not insensitive and we can notice some moments of melancholy when he dreams about his parents' murder. He might be intelligent, but when he tries (and succeeds) in finding the Riddler's real identity, nobody can fall for his mental capacities. To sum up, his performance can be ranked in-between both Keaton roles.After Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle, it's Chase Meridian's turn to fall in love with Bruce Wayne. But she is boring and often annoying, having practically no role to play, but the traditional damsel-in-distress role.But it's Tommy Lee Jones who is the worst of them all. And yet, he was the ideal guy to play this part... if only he played it the right way. Jones' legendary serious and imperturbable mood should have been the main ingredient for Two-Face, but Jones decided to go over-the-top and transform himself into a wild man. And these are the results : he acts like a moron when he's happy and when he's not, he reacts like a child who has been stolen from his lollipop. One technical mistake involves that Two-Face flips his coin until he gets the option he wants, while it's not the way it works in the comics. But I have to admit that his make-up was pretty good and convincing.On the good actors' side, we first find Chris O'Donnell who is surprisingly successful as Dick Grayson/Robin. We can feel his boiling and impetuous temperament after the murder of his family and the parallelism of this drama with Bruce Wayne's own tragedy acts like some sort of catalyst and brings out Wayne's dark memories, adding a slight, but essential psychological side to the film.But it's Jim Carrey who steals the show as the Riddler. Contrary to Jones, Carrey plays his part like any other role he's played before, that is by being exuberant and maniacal. And he's so sensational that he unavoidably provokes laughter from the audience, should he act sensefully or not. Besides, I think that it's there that Jones made his mistake. He saw what Carrey was doing and thought that it was great, so he tried to act the same way. He just didn't realize that it wasn't working in his case.Anyway, the whole movie is exuberant and over-the-top. This should explain the overabundant use of more-or-less adequate gadgets. The Batcave, which was previously a sinister place, now looks more like Q's headquarters. I was strongly disappointed to see the Batmobile rolling on the side of a building with the help of a grappling gun. And the idea of the fireproof cape under which Batman hides is frankly ridiculous.Gotham City's architecture doesn't really change, but its peaceful and calm look is transgressed by the apparition of ludicrous billboards, like the giant luminous eye. And how could we forget the the incredibly stupid replica of the Statue of Liberty? So, overall, ""Batman Forever"" is an attempt to make the franchise more accessible to those who didn't appreciate Tim Burton's dark and bizarre treatment.But it's not necessary to be a fan of the series to realize at which point Schumacher's movie is silly and ridiculous. The director can try to redeem himself by strewing his work of references to win over the nostalgic ones, but it changes absolutely nothing. It can even make things worse...""Batman Forever"" might be superior to its 1997 sequel ""Batman & Robin"", which slightly rises its value, but it's far from receiving praises.",Batman Forever

232,eamon-hennedy,Redeemed by Carrey.,6,8 December 2003,"First and foremost Batman Forever is not the worst film in the Batman series, that honor goes to the following film, Batman and Robin. While Batman Forever is not the greatest film in the world (possible understatement), there are factors that make it an enjoyable enough film.First of all the problems. Well Val Kilmer is far from being the perfect Batman. Sure he is good looking, but his performance is bland and he makes the character of Bruce Wayne uninteresting. Whereas Michael Keaton brought a quirky yet vicious quality to the Dark Knight, Kilmer brings very little. Keaton excelled at playing the part. The inner torment, the endless quest for revenge were touched on in great ways by Keaton, but Kilmer sleepwalks through the whole film. Likewise his chemistry with Nicole Kidman in non-existent. The film tries to present the relationship between Kidman's Doctor Chase and Wayne in a quirky manner (he loves her, she loves Batman and of course Wayne and Batman are one and the same), it's just the film can't reached those quirky heights as it's become centered around outrageous action sequences, gadgets and a camp production design. Kidman herself is good, but it doesn't help when her leading man is acting like a brick wall.
The film itself is unfocused. One minute the movie can be camp (the scenes between Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones) and at others quite dark (the killing of Robin's parents). The humor wins out more as the film is not aiming as high at the darker elements as Burton did. This is essentially the first step in making the Batman films a series for kids, which the first two films did not do despite the fact there was a heavy slant on merchandising.There are good aspect, redeeming aspects. Jim Carrey is simply awesome as the Riddler. The man is pumping energy as if he is powered by a national grid. His performance recalls Jack Nicholson in the first film (although the inherent psychotic characteristics are missing here) and is almost as much fun. He is backed fantastically by Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face who tries valiantly to keep up with Carrey, but he's swiping the film from everyone. Undeniably a fine comedian, it is this essence that makes the Riddler a great villain. At the end the film is not perfect (although it's a masterpiece compared to the following film), but it is two hours of fun nevertheless and is worth watching to see Jim Carrey. His performance alone is worth a viewing.",Batman Forever
233,Cephyran,Satisfactory at best...,7,19 November 2004,"I find this movie interesting mostly because I was the right age to appreciate it when I first saw it. Now, being eight years older, I can look back and analyze it for what it is. Batman Forever has a few strong points. First of all, Jim Carrey was born to play the Riddler. His style and sense of humor is a perfect fit for the Riddler's antics. And Tommy Lee Jones, while being a touch too old, does a decent Job with the bipolar Two-Face.Val Kilmer steps into the batshoes this time, and while his performance wasn't horrible, he just doesn't have that presence that Michael Keaton possessed when in costume. Val Kilmer is a good actor - it just wasn't a great role for him. He's too much of a Bruce Wayne, and not enough of a Batman. Nicole Kidman is attractive and compelling, and her character makes use of both these qualities. But her involvement in the story is shallow at best.Chris O'Donnell, while not a bad actor, is certainly not a good actor. Aside from the fact that Robin is supposed to be under eighteen, which O'Donnell is obviously not, he's really useless overall to the story, and he doesn't have the charisma that some of the youthful actors today have - mainly because he's lacking in youth. I'm particularly glad he wasn't chosen to be Spider-Man, to be honest.Overall, I'd say the movie could have been better, but at the same time, it wasn't that bad. There are certainly worse movies out there.",Batman Forever
234,saint405,My favorite Batman movie!,9,1 July 2005,"Finally, a good Batman film! We had the original Batman that was flawed and the horrid sequel Batman Returns but Batman Forever is the best of the bunch. Val Kilmer is now in charge of the Batcave as the new Bruce Wayne/Batman who has to take care of villains like Two Face, who is played perfectly by Tommy Lee Jones, and the sadistic Riddler, great job Jim Carey, who is stealing peoples brain waves for his own use. Robin is now introduced with Chris O'Donnel as the boy wonder who wants revenge after Two Face kills his parents at the circus. Jim Carey as Edward Nygma goes crazy and kills his boss and creates his persona as the Rdiddler to unleash his new brain box which will steal their brain waves and give Riddler information that he can use against Gotham City. Now this is a Batman film ladies and gentlemen! Great acting from Carey, Jones, and Kilmer as one of the best Batmans. Batmans new girlfriend is good as well, Dr. Chase. The riddles are mind boggling and the sets are perfect for this Batman tone. The plot is wacky, yes but it works! The directing is good too, to bad the next Batman movie failed miserably. Now if you had to choose which original Batman movie to watch, get Batman Forever. Batman Forever gets the big 9, not perfect but a short notch away from 100% pure entertainment!

235,brent_or,"Decent, but it could have easily been so much better...",7,7 July 2012,"Forget about Batman & Robin. When this one was released two years prior, it was greeted much more positively than the regard in which many people hold it today. It is a pretty decent film, aside from a few hiccups; the biggest issue is in the character portrayals (particularly Two-Face, but also Batman and Riddler) and dialog. After Batman Returns, they had to go in a more accessible, light direction, but Batman is not serious enough, Two-Face is woefully shallow in spite of TLJ's bombastic portrayal, and Jim Carrey's Riddler, while an entertaining, eminently quotable performance, is just too over the top.If you check out the deleted scenes and commentaries, you can see how, with a slightly different script and different editing, Batman Forever could have been a much more serious film, with a more effectively cohesive psychological look into Bruce Wayne's mind. Pity.But now, on to the good. The Robin origin story, including Chris O'Donnell's portrayal, is hands down the best thing about this film, and is absolutely wonderful. Val Kilmer does a fine job in the lead role, and Nicole Kidman manages to be mesmerizing and story-appropriate. I personally love the day-glo neon punk sequence, and also the Batmobile (aside from the tacky logo hub caps). I think that it was a great artistic stroke to show a differently stylized conception of Gotham City, as a contrast to Tim Burton's dark, Gothic feel.It is just too bad that this movie was pushed as far as it was into wacky land, because it could have been genuinely terrific. As it is, it is nowhere near as over-the-shark as Batman & Robin. It is probably the best modern Batman film for children, and not bad overall.",Batman Forever
236,tml_pohlak_13,A semi-disastrous film,7,3 January 2009,"Watching ""Batman Forever"" it is obvious that Tim Burton is no longer directing. Joel Schumacher tried a kid-friendly approach, making this Batman movie more of a comedy than anything. The switch in direction also resulted in Val Kilmer replacing Michael Keaton as Batman. Chris O'Donnell comes on scene as Robin; Jim Carrey portrays the Riddler; and Tommy-Lee Jones becomes Two-Face.Schumacher made the film into a disaster. That being said, I found it still fun to watch, if only for its cheesy qualities. Cheesy? Yes. But in a fun, light-cheddar sort of way.Let me add that I enjoyed Jim Carrey's comic Riddler. His Riddler did injustice to the comic book character, that I freely admit. Luckily, Carrey is a comedic genius, and some of his lines certainly made me chuckle.Tommy-Lee Jones as Two-Face? Disappointing. Jones does great in other movies, and I had such high hopes. No, this Two-Face goes with the cheesy atmosphere of the rest of the film. The ""split-personalities"" joke is carried way too far, to the point where Two-Face refers to himself in the plural.I'm not a fan of Joel Schumacher. I blame him for using two villains in the same movie, a trick he ripped off from Burton's ""Batman Returns"". ""Returns"" had an alliance between the Penguin and Catwoman. ""Hey!"" thinks Joel. ""Why not get the Riddler and Two-Face to team up?"" But the thing that was great about Burton's approach was that the villains backstabbed each other, and their alliance quickly fell through. Schumacher's approach is just plain cliché and boring.Did Schumacher destroy the Batman franchise? Definitely. He started the deterioration in ""Batman Forever"", and completed it with ""Batman & Robin"". But at least ""Batman Forever"" is somewhat watchable. To sum up, it is a poorly made film, but one I found somewhat fun.I still recommend Burton's films more than this.",Batman Forever

Tommy Lee Jones is just as good as Two-Face, with some truly wicked moments.Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell were a problem.  They're too close in age and look; unfortunately, Kilmer was the better actor while O'Donnell was the closer match to the character.  Nicole Kidman's character seemed to be there just to put a female character in the movie for Batman to rescue (although Carrey's Katharine Hepburn impersonation--""Batman?  Batman, you say?  Coming for you?""--come close enough).",Batman Forever
238,nmholland,"Not Really As Bad as Its Sequel, But Lacks Enjoyment",5,28 April 2016,"Batman Forever is directed by Joel Schumacher and stars Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire living in Gotham city that is a secret vigilante at night called Batman. Recently, the former district attorney of Gotham, a man named Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones), has been deformed during a court meeting, and now has a grudge against Batman, blaming him for his disfigurement. Joining him is another villain on the rise, a tricky man called the Riddler (Jim Carrey). The combined power of these two villains might just be too much for Batman and his new prodige, Robin.Batman Forever is actually my least favorite of the Batman films. Although Batman & Robin (1997) is a worse film, it's funny in the manner of how bad it is. Batman Forever lacks enjoyment, a good plot, and well rounded characters. Most everything about Batman Forever is dull, even though it was planned to bring Gotham back to life, after the darker Tim Burton film that was Batman Returns (1992). With the combined poor script, direction, and characters, Batman Forever is simply a mess.The worst thing about Batman Forever is the characters, particularly the villains. After the success and popularity of Jack Nicholson's Joker, the script for Batman Forever called for both Two Face (Harvey Dent) and the Riddler to be less interesting incarnations of the Joker. Their combined plan isn't a good one, and both of the actors that play them, while being good actors, are so over the top that their characters are just plain bad. Also, Dr. Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman, is just present so that Bruce Wayne can have a love interest. She constantly tries to go down on him, much like Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, but isn't ever successful. Dr. Chase is an apparent weak character that takes a lot away from the character of Bruce Wayne, as she's in a relationship with him.The only character I actually thought was even slightly well rounded was that of Robin. Before he was ruined in Batman & Robin (1997), Dick Grayson's character, played by Chris O'Donnell, wasn't complete trash. I understood why he was willing to do what he had planned, and O'Donnell played him well. The conflict with his origin story, no spoilers, was easily understood, and it played out well. I didn't completely hate him, unlike in the unwanted sequel.As far as acting, Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones don't really do that good. Val Kilmer was a good Batman, but fell slightly short as Bruce Wayne, both privately and publicly. Of course, Michael Gough is a good Alfred, just like in the prior two films. Nicole Kidman played her character well, but the character in herself was pretty bland and not unique at all. Chris O'Donnell did pretty good, although he was nothing special. With the combined talent of legendary actors Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jim Carrey, you'd think that the acting in Batman Forever would be good, but it's not.Another bad thing I'd like to point out is the costume design. Although it isn't that big of an aspect, the costumes for this movie just look like they came straight from a children's book. Batman can't even turn his head; he has to turn his entire body just to look from side to side. Jim Carrey's costume of the tight green spandex with question marks all over it is really bad, and so is Tommy Lee Jones' split-down-the-middle Two Face costume. Unlike what a person with an actual chemical burn would look like, Tommy Lee Jones just looks like something off of Power Rangers. Both the batsuit and Robin's suit had subtle rubber nipples on them, and we all know where that went.The direction for Batman Forever isn't anything exciting either. Although the direction isn't exactly bad, it doesn't bring anything new to life. The look of Gotham, as well, is just awful. For some reason, Joel Schumacher envisioned Gotham city with all of the buildings, and cars, and even clothes glowing. Most everything glows in this film, and it's very distracting and such a bad contrast from what Gotham city is really like (in the comics). Although Tim Burton may have gone a bit too ""Tim Burton"" with Batman Returns (1992), at least the city was dark, like it should be, rather than glowing and bright everywhere.The things I really did like about Batman Forever were smaller things, such as the scene in which Bruce Wayne convinces Dick Grayson to stay at the mansion. The way he convinces him is very witty, and sly, which embodied the character of Bruce Wayne pretty well. I also liked the riddle aspect of the film, where the Riddler sends riddles to Bruce throughout the film. Although the riddles were super easy, it was a neat idea, and kept the audience somewhat involved in the film.Other than that, there wasn't too much enjoyment to be found in Batman Forever. It was clearly made for children, and to sell toys, and I don't think that many others will enjoy it either.",Batman Forever
239,McFrogg,Buttman Begins,5,23 April 2017,"According to some fans, Batman Forever was the beginning of the end for the Batman series. But to be honest, I think it began with Burton's Batman Returns. Warner Bros gave Burton too much freedom, which resulted in a dark and disturbing horror movie that frightened small kids and their parents. Warner Bros saw that it was a mistake to let Burton off the leash, and decided to put him back in his cage and try something lighter. The same thing is currently happening with the new movies based on DC's characters after the grimdark piece of crap called Batman v Superman: Dawn of Nietzsche. As a wise man called Joseph Esposito once said: ""history repeats itself, try and you'll succeed!""They tried with Batman Forever, but did they succeed? We finally get to know more about Batman. Batman is a lot less violent. The suit looks great, except for a few details. The action scenes are much better. Robin is in it. The music is very good. Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell were great as Batman and Robin. We also get a city that's uglier than Burton's. The movie can't decide if it's serious or campy. Still too much sexual content. Gossip Gertie. A lot of screaming and shouting from Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. And worst of all, we get to see Batman's butt. Who wants to see Batman's rubber butt? Seriously...forget all of the scary scenes in Batman Returns, when I saw that as a kid, it freaked me the heck out. No, no, no...don't show the hero's butt cheeks, it's just plain wrong! I wonder how Joel Schumacher got Val Kilmer to do it. ""Look over there, Val! Jim Morrison's ghost! Oh yeah..."" No wonder they were enemies. The movie, like Two-Face, has a lot of good stuff in it, and a lot of bad stuff. It's like they made two separate movies and edited it into one strange movie. They wanted a lighter Batman movie, but ended up with an annoying one instead.It's still better than Batman Returns, though.",Batman Forever
240,tomb_92,Not what Batman should be,5,3 September 2009,"This is the film where the Batman franchise lost its way. The sinister, fantastical world of Tim Burton is replaced by the sillier less realistic (if possible) realm of Joel Schumacher. Michael Keaton's captivating and interesting performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman is replaced by the less realistic and convincing Val Kilmer. Tommy Lee Jones makes a great performance but the part isn't written for Two-Face, but for some other villain and consequently I find myself preferring Aaron Eckhart's performance in The Dark Knight. In fact the only reason to watch this film is to see Jim Carrey's fantastic take on The Riddler, a villain with no real agenda, just having fun, not overly sinister or evil, but just played for fun, Carrey is perfect for the role and I couldn't see anyone else playing him. Oh, and Chris O'Donnell plays a truly hateful Robin, in a frankly pointless and uninteresting plot-line.",Batman Forever
241,sc8031,"There's a good idea in there somewhere, I just can't find it",4,17 July 2008,"This really isn't such a terrible movie, but it has some serious flaws which make the overall product stagnate.Tommy Lee Jones would have been better with adequate scripting and direction, but unfortunately his performance of Two-Face is deplorably one-dimensional. He rants and raves and cries and throws violent tantrums and never calmly assesses anything. Yet, like the Riddler originally was in the comics, Two-Face is supposed to be a very intelligent, sociable member of upper-class society whose psyche has become irreparably damaged. His educated, influential background is what makes him all the more dangerous when he is tormented by his chaotic, violent half. But because the character portraits and histories are so marginalized, the villains here are unmemorable and have little in common with the villains from the comic franchise.Bizarrely enough, the only background on Two-Face we get is that some mob boss threw acid on his face in a courtroom during a trial (we see a video of this from CNN, showing us how Two-Face used to be Harvey Dent, the Gotham District Attorney). Yes, somehow the mob boss brought acid into the courtroom, onto the witness stand, and managed to throw it at the DA's face without any interference. In the movie, the CNN reporter is like, ""although Batman tried to save him, he was unable to "" and you see Batman jumping out from the courtroom audience in full batsuit as Harvey Dent/Two-Face tries to use paper to shield his face from the acid. Seriously? Even if we buy that weird scenario, why does Two-Face hate Batman so much? Nay, in Batman Forever we get Robin's background instead. Kind of a bizarre direction to go when you consider Robin isn't a strong lead character, particularly in the hands of Chris O'Donnell (or maybe he's adequately annoying). Hell, Robin's not a very strong character at all (supposedly Tim Burton really hated Robin as a character). It's weird that we get a lot of background on Robin and the Riddler, even though Two-Face is the character that Batman and Robin have serious emotional ties to.Jim Carrey's performance is fine, if typical of this period in his career, but I wonder why he was never tagged to play the Joker or the Scarecrow. The Riddler, as he is mistakenly portrayed here by Carrey, is an over-the-top trickster basket-case. But in the old Batman comics, the guy was an overly intellectual, scheming, almost aristocratic foe. The kind of guy Bruce Wayne could talk to at a dinner party for a while before noticing how malicious he is.Nicole Kidman's role is laughable. It's almost like she's a caricature of a damsel-in-distress from some '50s adventure flick. I surmise she was cast intentionally for her bad acting. But of course, the script is not much to work with.Anyway... the whole movie itself is not terrible. It has a unique look and feel: lots of purples and greens, a Gotham nightlife that has the aesthetic look of a rave, some interesting sets (particularly the finale), and violent scenes that are unique for their goofy sense of humor. The acting is capable, but the cast is not given proper material to work with and the movie's pacing is not stitched together properly. There is a good idea in here somewhere, but nothing is strong enough to make it memorable. In other words, it's not a real shame that there will be another Batman movie with the same villains.",Batman Forever
242,adamsmith-51004,"Batman? Batman, you say? Coming for you? I'm counting on it!",6,14 April 2021,"Well what can I say that hasn't been said already about this film. Okay, seeing as Tim Burton is no longer directing it's not a bad effort. It would get a lot worse with Batman and Robin and make this look a masterpiece by comparison.Anyway this is where ir started going downhill though because Warner Bros wanted to make it appeal to younger children. They introduced some overly-campy humour. Most of it comes from the films two lead villains, Two-Face and the Riddler. Two-Face is meant to be a tragic and confused character with multiple personalities whereas the Riddler is meant to be an reclusive evil eccentric. Here they behave like naughty little schoolboys. The plotline is ok but a little cheesy.The plot involves Batman/Bruce Wayne (Kilmer) struggle with his identities and seeking therapy from beautiful Dr Chase Meridian (Kidman)As this occurs, three members of a family of acrobats are murdered by the newly escaped Two-Face, leaving their youngest son Dick Grayson (O' Donnell, who isn't too bad actually) to survive. As a result Bruce takes Dick in and Dick soon finds out who Bruce is. Whilst this is occurring, one of Bruce Waynes disgruntled ex-employees Edward Nygma is creating a successful bussiness of his own and has invented an invention that makes t.v. Programmes become reality for the viewers whilst secretly sucking out bits about peoples private lives from their minds whilst they are in their hypnotic trance.The acting is mixed. Val Kilmer makes a good Bruce Wayne but isn't too scary as Batman. Nicole Kidman is rather wooden. Chris O'Donnell is okay as the grieving and vengeful Dick Grayson. Jim Carrey is his usual manic self and Tommy Lee Jones is way too over the top as Two Face.It's okay but not great.",Batman Forever
243,voicemaster71,"My favorite of the four Batman films, but yet not without flaws",8,20 June 2005,"This was the Batman movie that was the hardest for me to wait for. I remember being excited about finally seeing a big screen Batman movie with Robin finally making his debut. I can't believe it's now been 10 years since this movie was released in theaters. I firmly believe there are two camps of Batman fans. On one side, you have the Dark Knight fans, who love Batman as a gritty figure who fights crime totally alone. Then there's the camp on the other side, Dynamic Duo fans who like both Batman and Robin. This is the camp that I am in and I am downright proud of it. I am also going to speak against the negative reviews and give this movie a positive one. Starting with why I love this movie. 1: This movie has the Riddler and Two Face, which rounds out the most popular villains in Batman's rogues gallery. 2: I am a Jim Carrey fan, and I look at the Riddler as a character who could be funny like Frank Gorshin or dead serious like the Riddler on Batman: The Animated Series, so I could enjoy the Prince of Puzzles either way. Plus, seeing Carrey using his natural comic talent was pure entertainment. 3: Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian. She is beautiful and her love triangle with Batman and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne was real interesting 4: Batman himself: I only liked Val Kilmer's Batman scenes when he's in the suit. Bruce Wayne is a whole different story. If he did anything better than Michael Keaton, it was only with the raspy Batman voice he used. He was able to project that voice better than Keaton did. 5: One scene in Gotham City, in the daytime was actually shot in New York. But that was it. 6: The biggest reason I love this movie. One word: ROBIN!!! I grew up not only with the 1960's live TV show, but also the animated cartoons of Batman by Filmation and the SuperFriends. Batman and Robin were always a team and I'd waited many many years for a big budget movie with them in it. Then I had to wait from 1989 to 1995 to see Robin debut. That's the only thing I'll give Joel Schumacher credit for, is that unlike Tim Burton, he was willing to bring the Teen Wonder to the big screen. Chris O Donnell does a superb job as Dick Grayson initially being an angry youth after the deaths of his family and Batman having no desire to make him his partner. The Robin costume was an extreme compliment to Batman's black batsuit while Robin's red and green are very dark in color. At the same time, Dick's costume from the animated series is what his family's circus uniforms were. And yes, I got a kick out of ""Holy Rusted Metal Batman"". While I love this movie, it is not without flaws that keep me from enjoying this movie 100%. 1: The biggest flaw was the casting of Batman himself. To me, Michael Keaton was sorely missed and I guess he decided to bail since his buddy Tim Burton was not directing this one. I can't help but wonder what Joel Schumacher was thinking when he cast Val Kilmer. Kilmer does not remind me of Batman by any means. I just could not accept him as Bruce Wayne. Bruce is NOT a blonde. If Kilmer had to be the lead, I would have made him color his hair dark. So I just could not accept a blonde Bruce Wayne who looked like he was in his 20's as our hero. 2: I was surprised and disappointed that Two Face was portrayed as being funny like the Joker. I did enjoy Tommy Lee Jones's performance, but I felt this wasn't Two Face's personality and I really wished there had been some continuity between all four films other than the same Alfred and Commissioner Gordon being in the films. 3: Dick Grayson wearing earrings and nipples on the Batsuit, plus watching them suit up in anatomically correct outfits? What the hell is that crap?! Schumacher should have been B----slapped for doing that!! 4: The Batmobile looked a little weird for me. 5: Once again, not only is Batman upstaged by the villains, but once again, everybody learns that Bruce Wayne is Batman and once again, most of the major villains die at the end. 6: While I didn't miss Tim Burton all that much, Michael Keaton and composer Danny Elfman were sorely missed. Eliot Goldenthal did a fairly good job with the film score, but I preferred Elfman's music and I would have loved to have seen what he could have done for music regarding Robin, Riddler, and Two Face. 7: What's with Dick Grayson having a brother? In the comics, he was an only child like Bruce was.Overall,I'd have to say that this is my favorite of the four Batman movies of this era, but even this one can't beat Batman Begins with Christian Bale.",Batman Forever

246,tonyjackie,"On reflection, this really isn't that bad",7,9 August 2008,"I have always regarded 'Batman Forever' as the most underrated of the Batman films and gave it a score of 8. Recently I decided to watch the movie again and was surprised to find myself reasonably happy with what I saw. It is most probably down to the last two Batman movies 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' that my opinion has changed a little because Iprefer the darker tones of those movies. So maybe it is my fault that this movie is now downgraded slightly as it was a movie of it's time and I genuinely did used to rate it highly. But where I once found the comic book look of the film to be very effective, perhaps it was overdone.As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Val Kilmer is a bit dull in the role and doesn't seem to be particularly enjoying it. Jim Carrey is fine as The Riddler but he is a little bit too over the top at times. It is the most convincing portrayal in this movie though. Tommy Lee Jones looks uncomfortable as Two Face and he is played more like The Joker in retrospect. Nicole Kidman is wasted as Chase as she is supposed to be a tough psychologist but comes across as a lovestruck teenager. Chris O' Donnell is OK as Robin and I can understand why Robin was part of this story.It is a reasonably entertaining film with some fabulous sets. I have always thought that the music for this film was very good and that hasn't changed. I now feel I have to drop it's overall score down to 7 and that is mainly because of the later movies.

247,the_mysteriousx,Forever awful!,1,3 July 2004,"After seeing this in the theater in 1995, I swore I'd never see another Batman film it was so bad. Well, I decided to revisit it and finally see Batman and Robin in the past week and well, this movie still has absolutely no redeeming values.We can't even get a minute into the film when we are introduced to Val Kilmer as Batman in the batcave as the corporate sell out. ""I'll get drive thru"" he responds to Alfred after he had offered him a sandwich to go (I remember the stupid McD's tie-in commercial). Good to know the filmmakers are straight with us and let us know there is no integrity in this bat-world.Kilmer is a robot as Bruce Wayne AND as Batman. Some lines almost sound as if they can't even get out because he is just so incredibly rigid. The dialogue is of course, idiotic, but then what did we expect. Joel Schumacher began his deconstruction of the franchise with non-stop MTV cuts and completely gratuitous dutch angles, not to mention every damned shot has every color in the spectrum represented in it! That's not art, that's a bad excuse for not having a visual style.The villains - ugghhh!!! It was such a bad idea to combine two villains that are basically identical. They are both totally 100% insane. They don't compliment each other at all, instead they annihilate you with a never-ending barrage of craziness and bad over-acting. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two of the five most in-demand actors at the time and they got top billing, but Carrey is simply the wrong choice for the Riddler and worse, the character of the Riddler is now a scientist!!!??? Two-Face is a poor man's version of the Joker without the grandeur and presence of Nicholson's great madness. Drew Barrymore is utterly wasted in a nothing role. Chris O'Donnell is given the thankless role of Robin and gets to be the sidekick to the robot, Batman. I don't even remember seeing Commissioner Gordon; his role was so useless. Nicole Kidman looking so beautiful is actually the single thing that got me through the film.I could go on and on, but ultimately this film is really responsible for killing the Batman franchise. The series lost its' soul, as we no longer followed Batman the character. In this film there are weak attempts to copy the first film by showing Bruce Wayne contemplating over his parents' deaths again. This is pointless because we've tread down this path before. We don't get anything new.Batman Forever actually launched this modern style we are stuck in with tons of ridiculous effects and ignoring the great story and artistic style that made the first two Batman films good. Most recent films such as Van Helsing are carbon copies of this empty film. Glitzy colors, cuts and famous actors - no script or care for characters and no care to create a plausible world within the realm of fantasy.***BTW - Worst moment - Batman avoiding getting trapped in the alley by Two-Face's gang and then driving the Batmobile up the wall. And then they cut to the next scene as if we naturally can figure out where the hell he drove next after heading skyward.

Chris O'Donnell as Robin, well, did an okay job. The villains of the movie were absurd. Joel Schmuck-er tried what Jack Nicholson/The Joker has set as precedence for villainy and ruined it.

I can never tell.""",5,6 March 2017,"An almost-offensive step backward from Tim Burton's excellent ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns,"" Joel Schumacher's ""Batman Forever"" expunges the franchise's authentic darkness, weight, and soul in exchange for neon colors, overwrought silliness, and superficial spectacle. Reducing Bob Kane's cape and cowl wearing crime fighter and his shadow-concealed heroism to a plastic, studio-scrubbed superhero works in terms of building a crowd-pleasing antidote to Burton's elegant esoterica, but it does not create anything with depth or resonance. Still, Schumacher's film is committed to its new direction and is able to entertain despite its frustrating emptiness.Beginning with winky one-liners and scenery-chewing characters, ""Batman Forever"" instantly begins down a new tonal path. It is, once again, an operatic superhero outing, but the narrative eschews any kind of inviting earnestness and dark-tinged whimsy. Instead, from its outset, the film seems to poke fun at the previous chapters' evocative seriousness and puts a premium on hyperactive pop.Packing in as many characters as its story can handle, ""Batman Forever"" finds Batman at odds with the destructive forces of Two- Face and the Riddler. Allied with Dick Grayson and Dr. Chase Meridian, Batman must work to save Gotham City and its denizens. To the narrative's credit, it successfully mines the sillier side of its source material. Not finding its inspiration in Frank Miller's gritty ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" the story is fueled by kid- friendly scripting and the goofier portions of the Batman canon.Those goofier areas fuel the production, as well, but they are amped to headache-inducing levels. Schumacher assembles something loud, garish, and full of energy where the film's villains prance manically and the heroes are an afterthought. It is a large-scale, fully rendered carnival ride with canted angles and a refusal to take itself seriously.The cast ideally fits the film's tone and color. Val Kilmer is a smug pretty-boy but eventually gels into his role as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as, respectively, the Riddler and Two-Face howl throughout the work and devour scenery by the flat- full. Nicole Kidman is not given much of any interest to do as Dr. Chase Meridian, but Chris O'Donnell actually begins to develop a compelling Dick Grayson.Turning 180 degrees from Burton's sophisticated superhero epics, ""Batman Forever"" succeeds at creating something engaging in spite of its lack of control and charm. The film makes no apologies for its style and noise and, perhaps, should be commended for its commitment to the series' change in direction. It may disappoint fans of Burton's bat-films, but it makes for a superhero film that can, at least, never be accused of being bland.",Batman Forever
251,Tresix,Best at Bat!!,9,15 June 1999,"Finally, the right combination of action and humor makes BATMAN FOREVER the best of the live-action Batflicks. Val Kilmer seems to be born for the role of Batman, he's got the right build (even out of the molded rubber suit), the good looks and is able to get deep within the psyche of a man who has gone through terrible trauma to make him do the things that he does. Nicole Kidman as the kickboxing Dr. Meridian is probably the best of Bruce Wayne's love interests. I was hoping that she would return as Batgirl or something. Jim Carrey's Riddler is the right combination of the mysterious comic book character and Frank Gorshin's over-the-top prankster. Chris O'Donnell is good as Robin, although I would have gone with a younger actor (like maybe Jonathan Taylor Thomas from HOME IMPROVEMENT). Now, about Two-Face. Harvey Dent's schizo former DA is my favorite of the Bat-villains because of his tragic link to Batman. I was first disappointed that they didn't choose Billy Dee Williams to reprise his role from the '89 film, then disappointed that they didn't choose another black actor. Next, despite Tommy Lee Jones giving his all, they wrote Two-Face wrong. He is not a joyful character in the mold of the Joker or other Bat-villains. As I said, he is a tragic figure who cannot help himself when it comes to committing his crimes. They should have toned him down just a wee bit.

253,crazyrabbits,"Slightly worse than the previous films, but not by much...",4,10 June 2006,"In my continuing review of the Batman films, I have decided to re-watch the 1995 part of the trilogy, ""Batman Forever"". It has been maligned by critics everywhere, but I did notice some good things in the film. However, there are also a lot of things that could have been taken out of the film to make it better.The plot revolves around Batman trying to stop Harvey Dent/Two-Face (played with panache by Tommy Lee Jones), a former District Attorney who wants revenge against Batman, and Edward Nygma/The Riddler (played by Jim Carrey), an inventor who goes crazy and proceeds to try and take over the minds of every Gotham citizen to satisfy his thirst for knowledge. Along the way, Bruce Wayne also gains a partner in Dick Grayson (played by Chris O'Donnell), and also flirts with Dr. Chase Meridian (played by Nicole Kidman).I can tell you this much. The plot is a lot stronger in this film than in the previous two installments. Whereas the nefarious plots in the previous films involved kidnapping kids, using penguins to blow up a city, killing people with beauty products, using poison balloons to kill people, and running for the Mayor of Gotham City, here in this film, it actually feels like these two guys pose an actual threat to the citizens of Gotham City. While people may say that the Joker, Penguin and Catwoman were all dangerous people, they simply acted tough, and got other people to do their work for them. Here, we actually see these two men carrying out missions by themselves.However, that doesn't mean the actors who play them are convincingly menacing. Jones and Carrey chew the scenery up for most of the film, as do quite a few other characters, even Val Kilmer himself. His line delivery in certain scenes (notably in the scene where he thinks that Two-Face killed his family) causes unintentional laughs instead of pathos. However, the supporting cast, anchored by Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred, give good performances.One notable good thing about the first two films was the moody, dark architecture that permeated Gotham City. It actually felt like a living, breathing metropolis. Unfortunately, while the Gotham City portrayed in the first two films and Batman Begins actually felt like areas that could be lived in, this film features a bright, neon city, full of bizarre architectural choices, like the window of the Wayne Enterprises Science Division overlooking a giant dam, a clone Statue of Liberty in Gotham Harbour, a strange divide between the quiet Wayne Manor and urban, neon metropolis, and the absolutely ridiculous hideout that Edward Nygma seems to have built-BY HIMSELF-on an island.The most egregious error in the film was making it more slapstick and silly, as opposed to being dark and brooding in the first two films. Every time we see The Riddler or Two-Face, they are always cracking stupid one-liners. Even Robin makes a number of ridiculous comments. It's not vital that we see this kind of comedy in a Batman film.Another thing that irked me was the level of stupidity in the Batcave. I understand that Batman wants to be prepared, but what the heck is he going to do with all that stuff he keeps in the Batcave? I mean, he has multiple suits (some of which are merely cosmetic changes on the same costume), and scores of gadgets, most of which I doubt he's used. In addition, some things don't even make sense. For instance, why would you need neon lights on the Batmobile, especially when you are a dark vigilante?Bottom Line: I give this film a 4 out of 10, if only for the strength of the supporting cast and the more acceptable plot. That's not saying much, though. Joel Schumacher should have never been signed on to the franchise. He made the film more campy, more neon, and more ridiculous than it's predecessors.",Batman Forever
254,FilmFreak94,Not Terrible But Not the Batman Film I'm Looking For,6,27 March 2012,"After Batman Returns got mixed reviews and complaints for being too dark Burton left making a third movie due to Warner Bros. wanting a more family friendly image for Batman. Enter Joel Schumacher who did a whole 180 to look, characters, and overall appeal to the series. The story starts with Batman(now played by Val Kilmer) foiling a bank heist planned by former District Attorney Harvey Dent(now played by Tommy Lee Jones) who, after a recent accident involving acid thrown in his face, has renamed himself Two-Face.Along with Two-Face, former Wayne Enterprises employee, Edward Nigma(played by Jim Carrey) has turned to crime and given himself the identity of The Riddler.But Batman is joined by a new partner himself. After Two-Face killed his family, Dick Grayson(Chris O'Donnell) joins the caped crusader as Robin. Together they must stop Riddler and Two-Face's plans to take over the minds of Gotham.And now let's cut to the chase. While the visual look of the film is interesting sometimes it seems like whoever was in charge of lighting got a little carried away with the red and green. Plus the camera is sometimes shot at an angle and those shots can be good sometimes but when it's overused it's jarring.The acting for the most part is good. I liked Val Kilmer as Batman and Bruce Wayne well enough and his love interest Chase Meridian(Nicole Kidman) is all right. But the ones that seemed to either overact or underact were Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell. Jones is a good actor usually but with this it felt like he was trying to copy Jack Nicholson's Joker and Two-Face is as far from Joker as you can get. He's tortured and has to deal with two personalities that are the polar opposites of each other. I didn't get that from his performance. Chris O'Donnell for the first part of the film just whined constantly and didn't do much to the plot. He got better by the climax but the first part almost ruined the character for me. Jim Carrey was an up and coming star by this point and acted more like Jim Carrey playing the Riddler than the actual Riddler. He seemed to be more emulating Frank Gorshin's performance from the old series but there were times when I thought it would've been better if he went in a different direction. But overall the film isn't terrible and is at least worth a watch. There's some interesting scenes involving Bruce Wayne's back story and there's a pretty funny reference to the Adam West TV show near the end. Not a bad movie but not the best Batman movie.6.5/10",Batman Forever
255,GluStick,"I don't know why, but I really liked it.",8,9 October 1999,"This could be called my guilty pleasure. I really liked this movie. It had great f/x and good villains. Val Kilmer sucked, though. I really wish Michael Keaton would have been here for this. I also wish that Tim Burton would've made this too but it was done just fine by Joel Schumacher. I didn't like Chris O'Donnell that much because he had stupid lines but he did an ok acting job. Jim Carrey did a great job. He was a great choice for the role of the Riddler. The end was really cool. I liked the f/x at the end a lot. I don't know what I see in this movie but whatever it is, I like it. A lot of people thought this was stupid and that Tim Burton did a better job than Joel Schumacher but I'd say about equal. It was a fun ride for me but others should be careful.

256,sanddragon939,Definitely not the film which tarnished Batman forever...,7,14 August 2009,"A lot of people claim that it was Batman Forever which proved to be the beginning of the end of the original Batman film franchise...they base this assumption on the fact that Joel Schumacher, who directed the God-awful Batman & Robin (the REAL culprit in this matter) also directed this film... Having seen this film a couple of times, I can say with confidence that this isn't a great epic film by any means; but its certainly not a piece of crap loaded with stupid cheesy one-liners and twisted ridiculous plot either. In fact, this had the potential to become possibly the most serious and the best Batman film, if it weren't for a few flaws that kind off dumbed it down... The major flaw with this movie is the portrayal of the villains; not necessarily the acting (Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones both did brilliant work on that) but the way the characters must have been written. Both Riddler and Two Face are portrayed as deluded cackling psychopaths, in short, they are pretty much Joker under different names. Sure, the gimmicks of the villains are faithfully adapted from the comics; Riddler's riddles and Two Face's coin toss and obsession with duality; but their personalities are totally ignored or rather covered up in evil laughter most of the time. The whole idea of the Brain Box was a bit too contrived, and a bit too sci-fi for the Riddler, or hell for a Batman film in general. And Two Face's obsession with destroying Batman and Riddlers obsession with Bruce Wayne hardly comes across as well as it was meant to. Basically, we are left with campy villains straight out of a 60's comic book...definitely not a great idea, especially given that this film was made at a time when the Batman mythos were seriously darkening in tone... There are a few things I really liked about this movie though...the first is Robin's origin, which was really done well. Having Two Face kill his parents isn't true too the comics, but it fits in well with the rest of the film and gives Dick a solid personal motive to go after Two Face by becoming Robin. I also liked the way they show Dick's heroic side even before he puts on the cape, by saving the circus from the bomb. Then there was the depiction of Batman's origin, which I think was done with a lot of depth and was actually better then the origin we were given in the first film...we're finally told clearly exactly how his parents death led to Bruce choosing to fight injustice and how he was inspired to strike terror into the minds of criminals by becoming a bat...until Nolan came along, this was the best depiction of the origin on screen. I also liked the way the movie depicts a constant parallel between Batman and Robin's origins, which further links the two together. Then there was Val Kilmer's portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Again, until Christian Bale, this was the best portrayal of Wayne we've seen. Kilmer portrays Bruce Wayne and Batman as two sides of the same coin, with Batman having a real split personality and facing a conflict between his two identities. Bruce Wayne here is not just a cover for Batman, he is an individual in his own right. This contrasts strongly with Michael Keaton's portrayal which makes it evident to all that Bruce is just a cover for Batman. And lastly, there is Bruce's romance with Chase Meridian, which is quite natural and adds a lot of depth to Bruce Wayne/Batman as well(the aforementioned 'origin scenes' for instance). All in all, this could have been the best Batman film, if not for the screw-up with the villains and some stupid unnecessary dialogue.",Batman Forever
257,Skeletors_Hood,The best of the series,10,25 October 2001,"Finally,  a decent Batman!!!A Batman that moves like a fighter, who works magic like a true fighter would, not Keaton ""do I have to do this fight stuff"" stiff movements that make action scenes drag on.  AND bonus...a believable Bruce Wayne to boot!One of Kilmer's best...and he out-did Keaton!! Stunning!Okay, ravings aside, I really do think that this was the best of the series on multiple levels.  Those loyal to the Keaton films grit your teeth.Batman is a gritty character - always was, after the 60's anyway.  But there is a limit, a balance to that grittiness...playboy millionaire Bruce Wayne. Keaton seemed to leave this part in the dirt, hoping fans would ignore it for the spectacle of the alter-ego.  I HATED that!!  Bruce Wayne IS Batman, and Keaton ignored that!  His portrayal of Bruce was an obvious walk-through to the point that it bored me.  And his Batman??  Give me a break.  Pee Wee Herman had better fighting moves.  The only thing that Keaton has that put him in the role is he actually LOOKS like Bruce Wayne, and nothing else! Thankfully, he was put to pasture on this film.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a Keaton fan, but this was never his role to play.It was Kilmer's.Kilmer pulled off the alter-ego balance nicely.  Unlike Keaton's Wayne, which just moped about in the dark, Kilmer's portrayal was active in society, and looked happy when he was around town, like any playboy is.  And he fought greatly as Batman, without acting stiffly about it.  It was finally a Batman worth my while, due to great acting!  Christopher Reeve is famous as Superman because he pulled greatly as Kent and Superman, and Kilmer was on the same par! Bravo!The villains in the movie were great also.  Instead of just a Bat-grudge, or we'll rule Gotham plan, they were showing sparks of creativity where Burton's films didn't.  There was a logical partnership between the two, and their motives paired off nicely.  They were only shadowed by the previous performance of Jack's Joker, but they did a better team up than the Penguin and Catwoman, which I put down as an unfortunate accident.  Jones was wonderful as Two-Face, pushing the character to limits that showed the struggle the two minds have within one brain, and Carrey's Riddler was entertaining, though I will admit he was too physical for me.  I like Riddler as an intellectual threat, sitting in the background, maybe even a thief, but not as giggley as he was played in this film.  But still, great. And with the long awaited arrival of Robin, the movie and cast even themselves out nicely.A full 10 out of 10.  The action isn't lame, the script isn't lagging, and the acting isn't tongue-in-cheek.  If only Burton could have directed like this, and if only the success could have gone on in the sequel.  That being said, one can see why this is the shining Batman from the series.",Batman Forever
258,MinorityReporter,"Batman Forever! Camp, but fun!",5,8 September 2007,"OK, so Burton was butted out for being too melancholic and dark to the extend that the audience could no longer identify with the characters, so in comes Joel Schumacher, a directer of questionable skill, to bring a more lively feel to the franchise. Well, he succeeded but he also started the beginning of the end for the original Batman franchise. His campier approach to the source material is indeed fun to watch (at least in this installment) and for what it is worth really quite entertaining. You do get the feeling, however, that he had been curbed just a bit so as not to make the franchise succumb into camp and silly one-liners. Too bad the producers didn't continue to hold him back because I, for one quite enjoyed this installment into the Batman series.Michael Keaton chose not to return as Batman because he wanted to prove that he had the versatility to play something else than Batman. Val Kilmer was cast as the lead instead and wanted to play the character in the same vein as Keaton, with a great measure of seriousness (much to Schumacher's dismay who already wanted to go all out camp) and for what it is worth I actually think Kilmer managed to pull of a reasonable Batman. I don't think he holds a candle to Keaton but an adequate performance. He balances Bruce Wayne out quite a bit and never becomes as manic or as brooding as Keaton was. In light of the obvious return to the camp values of the 60's series Robin was introduced. Not so much to lighten the tone (hardly necessary) but more to give the Bruce Wayne character some new interesting challenge. Chris O'Donnel got the part (ahead of Christian Bale, how weird is that?!) and while not the most talented of actors he is kind of fitting as a sidekick. As the new love interest Nicole Kidman was introduced and she is smoking hot. Her character is really kind of pointless but she serves her purpose as eye candy perfectly. Two new villains are introduced, Two-Face and The Riddler in the forms of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is a riot to watch. Not really faithful to the original character but fun, fun, fun. His performance is much in key with what he was known for at the time. Overacting wildly and while he pulls it off, the other villain is not so lucky. Tommy Lee Jones is painful to watch. While Carrey pulls the overacting off Tommy Lee only aggravates and annoys. While Carrey was not really faithful to the original character he still stayed within the limits. Tommy Lee (not really his fault I suppose) completely goes against everything the character stands for in one little scene where he repeatedly flips his coin to get the outcome he wants. Something he stated earlier to be the only true justice. This kind of alteration to the character is just not acceptable.The soundtrack is not nearly as catchy as the one in the two previous movies. I guess they really wanted to distance themselves from the original movies and that means that instead of Danny Elfman's brilliant notes we have to settle for mediocre Elliot Goldenthal's only acceptable score. The score is bombastic like Elfman's but it has no charm and is not a score you will hum to yourself once you've seen the movie. Much in key with the soundtrack the sets have been revamped into a neon-filled neo-noir style which is appropriate given to tone of the film but it is just not as interesting to watch as Burton's Gothic version. The neon lights are used excessively in one scene in particular which just comes off as ridiculous.The action is decent, not as tense as in the original movies but fairly entertaining. The action was dumbed down quite a bit and some more or less ridiculous sound effects were added but they were fun to watch. Now I'm not saying that Michael Keaton had the perfect physique to play Batman but they film makers had the good sense not to let him show of his torso in full screen. They do this in one scene where you can quite obviously tell that Kilmer's physique was inferior to Chris O'Donnel's. I'm not a film maker myself but I'm pretty sure something like that will ruin the credibility of a man who is supposed to be able to fight something like fifty people when his sidekick is stronger than him.All in all Batman Forever is not an excellent let alone even a good film. The direction is lacking and some of the characters were obviously miscast. But somehow I cannot bring myself to hate this movie (like I hate Batman & Robin - worst movie, no wait, worst thing mankind has ever created) because it is so much fun and make no pretension of being otherwise. Val Kilmer is solid and one half of the villains is fun to watch. I did/do, however, dislike the general direction the franchise took with this movie and its sequel proved to be everything a movie is NOT supposed to be.6/10",Batman Forever
259,k_g_barreto,What did I just watched?,4,31 December 2019,"I'm wondering why there's so many positive reviews here. Sure, it isn't the worst movie ever made, but it is not a good movie either. Jim Carrey's perfomance as Riddler is terrible, incredibly force and silly, the same goes to Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face, that acts exactly like The Riddler, it would be better if there was some difference, Two-Face being the serious guy that compromises, even being a madman with a multiple personality disorder, and Riddler being the goofy one, not the best take, but it would make sense. I cringed hard when they interacted, it was awful and ridiculous. And there's Chase as well, poor Nicole Kidman, she deserved more than a character that looks like it was written by a horny 16-years old, and that comes from a 16-yo. A guy said that this film is not afraid in being a comic book film, and I bet he never read one comic book. I'm not the fan who expects extreme fidelity in adaptations, so I really don't care about some differences, but this is not a truly comic book film, like the Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Spiderverse, Ragnarok, Watchmen, and many others of different tones than this childish comedy.I know it's not Schumacher fault, I even liked the directing here, unfortunetely there's so much scenes and dialogue that I remember, and not in a good way. If there's something I enjoyed here, it was the relationship of Bruce and Dick, how they are alike, the whole vendetta, the Waynes murder appears here again, but I thought it was necessary, and improved Bruce's character to me. Both Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnel did fine as their respective characters, I didn't expected nothing great, but it was good.Well, there we have a FLAWED movie, and I mean it, but still enjoyable somehow, cringy sometimes, but is still watchable and there's worse movies out there to see.",Batman Forever

No feeling for what physical surroundings would make the story work.  Just a lot of design that gets in the way.  The direction is heartless and scenes move mechanically.

262,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Fantastic comicbook adaption,8,4 August 2000,"Guilty by association with Batman & Robin, Batman Forever is a spectacular superhero adventure that deserves far more respect than it's crap follow-up. Basically it's Batman versus the Riddler, with Robin and Two-Face as their respective partners, and Nicole Kidman providing the sexy romantic intrest. The film is intoxicating and atmospheric, providing a feel that few movies, comic based or not, achieve.One of the most impressive casts ever assembled perform excellently. . Val Kilmer may not be as good a caped crusader as Michael Keaton, but only because he looks too young to be Bruce Wayne. He makes a great superhero, nevertheless. Nicole Kidman is the best Bat-babe out of all four films, full of and giving a classy performance. Jim Carrey is absolutely hilarious as the Riddler.  Chris O'Donnell gives an excellent performance as the modern day Dick Grayson, taking what could have been a lousy, over-the-top rebellious teen role and turned it into a proper, 3D character. Only Tommy Lee Jones lets the side down, thinking he's playing a cartoon character rather than one of the most complicated and facinating supervillains of all time.Everything looks stunning, mixing Tim Burton's dark, urban feel of the original movie with a brighter, more comicbook-like style.  Steven Goldblatt's cinematography is outstanding, giving the Batcave  a mysterious magnificence and Arkham Asylum a nightmarish ambience. The costumes are all absolutely superb. Batman and Robin look awesome, and make the best dynamic duo ever. It's just a shame we never saw more of the caped crusaders from this film;  Val Kilmer was replaced by the blandly cheerful George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell lost the cool Robin costume and turned into Nightwing in all but name.There are three new vehicles this time -  updated versions of the Batmobile and Batwing and the Batboat, all looking awesome. And all getting destroyed, natch. An intelligent script revolves around the psychology of the main protaganists, giving far more detailed, and real, insight into their tortured minds than the other Batmovies.The plot avoids making Batman the background figure he was in the previous movie by making him the centre of everybody's attention. The Riddler is obsessed with Bruce Wayne, Two-Face has a homicidal vendetta with Batman, Chase Meridian is facinated with Batman and Dick Grayson moves in with Bruce and wants to deck Batman.  The plot strands somehow interwine perfectly, working up to an excellent, genuinely exciting climax which solidify the film's main theme of duality.Despite the awfully edited fight sequences, the action scenes are far more inventive and original than in most action movies. They are also of a very high quality - and there are a lot of them, full of eye-opening stunts. The special effects are genuinely as good as they get. The Danny Elfman theme tune is sadly missing but some great songs by U2 ('Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me') and Seal ('Kissed By A Rose') are some compensation.There are several stand-out sequences, such as when the Batmobile barely escapes a huge explosion by driving up a wall, Robin's first appearence in the Batcave, and the final action scene with Robin and Chase falling to their deaths and Batman trying to catch them. This final scene works so well, it's no wonder Schumacher repeated it numerous times, too far lesser effect, in Batman & Robin (1997).Batman Forever combines romance, action and spectacle with great characters, some fine plotting and a real comicbook feel that isn't campy, silly or offensive. More than any other film, this is a comicbook come to life. While not up to the likes of Superman (1978), the original Batman (1989) or X-Men (2000), Batman Forever is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies ever. It's an excellently crafted film and sheer, five star entertainment.",Batman Forever

Did Burton make good Batman movies? Sure, I enjoyed Batman plenty, and Batman Returns had to grow on, me, but I came to greatly appreciate its great tension.What doesn't get acknowledged is that Batman Forever addressed aspects of Batman that were previously ignored. Burton admittedly cast Keaton, knowing that he didn't look anything like a supreme athlete Batman is known for being. I enjoyed Keaton as the Bat, but had so much more appreciation for the physicality getting priority in this case. Kilmer looks more athletic (and I imagine would have looked even better if he had time to beef up for the role. He got the part when the film was at the zero hour), and showed plenty of emotion as a tormented individual marred by loss. The martial arts were more akin to Batman with better stunt work, coupled with incredible moves.Batman had stronger relationships with Gordon and with Alfred here. Bruce Wayne was more the public figure we know him as. I still think that the definitive live action Bat-flick is yet to be made (thus far, Mask of the Phantasm has covered that area above all).

Val Kilmer's Batman/ Bruce Wayne is very serious and major steps above George Cooney's rendition.Kilmer is believable. The origin of Robin is handled well and the introduction of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) is well done. Both actors are well over the top in their performances and are aided by very explosive special effects. Finally to round out the quintet is the lovely Nicole Kidman as a renowned pyschologist (psychiatrist?) who is this movie's love interest.The battle scenes are exciting and the movie doesn't have any dull moments. There definitely is not a ""Tim Burton"" feel to the movie, outside of the psyches of the characters.

272,talarisw,Joel Shumacher takes over as director in the 3rd Batman film where Val Kilmer as Batman with Robin fights Jim Carrey's manic but brilliant Riddler.,8,17 December 2012,"This is a really good movie but you have to put the whole thing in context. Part of me wants to hate this movie because this film is not dark. They way batman is supposed to be is dark, that's who he is, that's the way Bob Kane created him back in 1939. That's the reason why I loved the two Tim Burton directed Batman films because they are so dark. But this is a film of it's time, made in 1995, you can never make a Batman movie like this one today. Especially after the extremely dark Christopher Nolan's Batmans. People now understand Batman should be dark but back in '95 people didn't fully understand that. The last film was controversial as some felt it was too dark, some parents said it scared kids and most problematic it was too dark to market towards kids, so Warners fired Tim and hired Joel Shumacher to make this film less dark and more family friendly. However despite all that, this is a really good movie. But it's also a strange movie because it's hard to say what this movie is, I mean is this supposed to be a sequel to Batman Returns or some kind of reboot. It has nothing to do with the previous two by Burton in both style or story. It basically disregards the continuity of the last two but Micheal Gough who played Alfred returns here along with Pat Hingle returning as Commissioner Gordan implying that this is a sequel. So I look at this as half sequel half reboot. The biggest thing about this movie is the visual look, I mean very colorful, the exact opposite of Tim Burton who made Gotham city look dark and gloomy. Joel let people know this is not going to be like that because Gotham looks bright and colorful. While Tim's Gotham looks like New York city, Joel's Gotham looks like Las Vegas, very flashy with a lot of bright lights. Even though Gotham city is supposed to be dark, I must admit it shows a lot of imagination and creativity to create his look of Gotham . This film is very cartoon-ish and campy, complete with cartoon sound effects. But what makes this movie good is that it does have a lot of seriousness to it and even a little dark. The plot is that Bruce Wayne is loosing the drive to continue being Batman & we look into his past as to why he became batman in the first place, he even quits being Batman for a time but the movie does a good job at exploring Bruce Wayne's psych in a way the previous films didn't. Val Kilmor(Keaton left 'cause he didn't want to do a non dark batman) is a good but not fantastic batman, he's a little stiff as Bruce Wayne but does a good job. The film has a lot of stuff going on in it, a love interest, the introduction of Robin, two villains & Batman himself but it does a good job balancing all characters in a coherent story. Nicole Kidman is the love interest, psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian, she's one of the best loves for Batman in a movie. She works really good in the story, she has a great romance with Bruce & her being a shrink is nicely done. Kidman gives a great performance & she looks really sexy in here too. Batman's famed sidekick Robin is introduced played by Chris O'Donnell. He does a decent job here, he provides some humor & O'Donnell does a good job being angry, rebellious but still likable. The writers do a good job at Bruce's & Dick's relationship & their share feeling of vengeance for the murders of their parents. But there's one bad thing about this movie, that's Tommy Lee Jones as the villain Two-Face, for non comic book geeks you probably find his two-face to be fine but as a comic book geek I must say two-face here is a huge disappointment! He's just way too campy and 1 dimensional. If you know the comic book, two-face has the potential to be a very psychologically damaged, terrifying, & sympathetic villain. But here he's just a campy villain who lacks all the qualities I just mentioned and Joel goes overboard with the theme of everything being in twos for two-face, it got too silly. But to make up for the lackluster take on two-face is famous comedian Jim Carrey in his truly fantastic performance as my favorite batman villain, The Riddler! Durning this time Jim was at the peek of his popularity and one could say that his performance here is just another routine comedy act for Jim but I think it's much more then that. Carrey brings so much color & life to the Riddler. It's truly fascinating to watch Jim go, he's really over the top here, so much so that he makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look understated. But Jim is both funny & menacing here not to mention crazy. There are many different ways you can portray the Riddler and Carrey gave a performance that's unique & all his own and he's helped by a good script that has a good story for Edward Nygma who will become the Riddler. They give Nygma his brilliance as he plans to absorb people's brainwaves making him the superior intellect. I also like the various riddler outfits he wears. Jim looks great in his skin tight green jump suit & with red hair. I love the way he twirls his cane and the scene where riddler gleefully destroys the bat-cave is awesome! He has a great laugh, and a lot great one liners. Carrey's performance is a stand out in the entire movie series. This movie has a lot great special effects, great action scenes and score, so despite not being really dark I find this to be a really good movie.",Batman Forever
273,Chris-332,The first of the terrors.,3,14 August 1999,"Batman Forever was the first and unfortunately not the last Batman movie directed by Joel Shumacher. Shumacher's vision of the Caped Crusader was the EXACT opposite of Tim Burton's remarkable vision. Joel Shumacher turned Batman's world back into the campy 60's TV monstrosity. As I was watching this, I was thinking about what Burton thought of this atrocity. Joel Shumacher turned Batman upside down into a movie with no story, pitiful acting, unfunny humor, campy dialogue, cheesy villains, horrible sets, and lukewarm directing! This series began SO phenomenally, it would have been great if Burton continued and helmed this monstrosity of a movie with the help of good ol' Sam Hamm to write and Danny Elfman to do the music. It would have been MAGNIFICENT! But of course, they had to get Joel Shumacher to direct poorly, Elliot Goldenthal to do a sucky score, and the Anti-Christ himself, Akiva Goldman, who went on to do atrocities as Batman and Robin(moan) and Lost in Space. Sorry, Warner Bros., but you messed up bigtime.",Batman Forever
274,Time Tripper,"Not the best, not the worst.",5,13 January 2001,"I can't hate this movie, because I'm sure everyone was trying their best. We were presented with a pretty cookie-cutter ""by the numbers"" script that attempted to explore Batman's rationale more, but did so only as an excuse for the romance.  The relationship between Batman and Chase Meridian is pretty ridicules.  Then again, Batman trying to have a relationship with anyone is pretty ridicules.  So why bother, other than an excuse to put an attractive female lead in a movie?  Jim Carrey was a corny, Riddler.  I just wish they'd gone for homicidal rather than zany.  Tommy Lee Jones...did some one forget to tell him that he wasn't playing the Joker?  Did he research the part at all?  Chris O'Donnell's Robin was just annoying.  As you've probably already guessed, my main problem with this movie was bad characterizations (maybe if it had been just Two-Face or the Riddler instead of both it might have had a chance).  But this movie tried, and was based on some sound ideas.  But, it still wasn't particularly good.  Watchable, but not enjoyable.",Batman Forever
275,timefreezer7,Nice dark atmosphere,7,4 June 2001,"... but nothing more . Joel Schumacher did a great job by mixing the dark Gothism with colourful neon lighting . I cannot understand why the critics disliked it and said that Burton 's dark touch was gone . I will have to remind you that Batman the Animated Series has this mixed dark / coloured atmosphere and was brilliant . After the dark like hell Batman Returns the producers themselves could not do anything but add a little colour to attract the audience . Even if Burton directed it he would not have another choice especially considering that one of the villains (the Riddler) is dressed in striking green and has red hair. The atmosphere is very good but unfortunately the action scenes are dumb : some contrived bad shot car chases . The finale didn 't have the tension of Batman Returns . And the villains ... oh the villainsthey are a huge disappointment. Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) was simply decorative . Jones made a bad ""wild "" performance . If only could they realise how deep Two-Face 's character is . The cartoon series gave successfully his background : a D.A. with hidden aggressiveness and semipsychotic episodes of violence until the acid on his face disfigured his looks and his mind irrepairably . If they had some scenes aboutHarvey Dent 's predicament we could have made a better movie. And the Riddler , oh the Riddler ... I cannot dispute that Jim Carrey was not enjoyable but he was simply miscast . I managed to download the final draft of Akiva Goldsman 's screenplay . The Riddler had hilarious impersonations and witty puns , but unfortunately it was clear that the role was destined for Robin Williams who would be perfect to deliver these lines . Unfortunately Schumacher ignored them and gave Carrey freedom to reduce the role to a wild pantomime . The only joke of these which survived was "" He may have to settle with the bronze !! "" . Another letdown was the absence of witty riddles and it is natural since Akiva Goldsman washed his hands of this task . The Riddler is witty and there had to be a sublot with a puzzled mystery just like in the comics , witty and mind intriguing . The final draft also consisted of many successful references to the 2 prequels which gave more succesful motives to Bruce Wayne 's acts . Unfortunately once again Schumacher chose to ignore them or shot these scenes and edited them out ( I hope that eventually a director 's cut will be released ) The only reference which survived was the subtext about Catwoman as an 'inproper' woman for Batman .Sometimes I believe that the lacklustre villains were intentional in order to prevent another couple of scene stealers after the Penguin and Catwoman . This was successful since Val Kilmer as Batman manages finally to be the center of the film . Kilmer gave if not the best , the most balanced performance . His predecessor Michael Keaton sometimes was very miserable and dark and his successor George Clooney lacked totally the dark . Kilmer had a perfect mix of dark psyche with problematic background and humanistic emotions . After all he DOES seek for psychiatric help which is a very positive sign . He is trying to redeem himself from a dark avengeful murderer to a server of society who does not fight crime simply to fill in his personal void . The psychiatrist Chase Meridian is performed quite well by Nicole Kidman. Although this ""love triangle"" story is contrived and silly the seduction scene is a cult . Kilmer and Kidman have a beautiful chemistry (just like Keaton & Pfeiffer in Batman Returns) . The best part of the entire film is definitely the psychoanalysis scenes where Chase tries to explain Batman 's motives or trying to heal Bruce 's traumatic past . The professional terms used are brilliant and give a realistic approach to this fantasy film . As for the addition of Dick Grayson in the saga simply could not be made in a better way . Chris O' Donnell gives a very satisfying performance . I will have to warn you though that Robin is ""born"" only in the finale . Overall an enjoyable film . Don 't expect great action or powerful bad guys . This has to be the weakest entry in the quartet. See it for the comic atmosphere and Val Kilmer&Nicole Kidman.BATMAN FOREVER         7.5 / 10",Batman Forever
276,Herbest8,Pretty good,7,11 June 2010,"In this third installment in the ""Batman"" series, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton are gone and in their place is Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer.This time around, Batman/Bruce Wayne takes on the combined threat of Two-Face and The Riddler while also acquiring a partner in the form of Robin (played pretty badly by Chris O'Donnell). Bats also finds the time to acquire a new love interest in Chase Merdian, played by the lovely Nicole Kidman.This film has a bad reputation thanks to it's immediate sequel but the truth is, the film is not horrible but it certainly is a step down from the first two films. Kilmer is alright but seems a little lost as Batman. Tommy Lee Jones is bland while Jim Carrey does a typical fine job. My only wish is that Jones had played straight man to Carrey, that would have been a nice contrast between the two villains.The visuals and cinematography is impressive but the score is a tad too whimsical. Danny Elfman's score was sorely missed for me personally. I also wish there had been more of an emotional connection between the audience and the characters which had been done so well in the second film but wasn't done at all here.Overall, ""Batman Forever"" is entertaining but nothing special.",Batman Forever
277,zurnderrick,"Way to kill the franchise, Schumacher!",5,23 August 2009,"I don not like this film. It is stupid, odd, and just plain different from all the other Batman films. The acting is terrible, the casting is even worse, and it's just too main street for my taste. I rather stick my head up an ostrich's butt while it wrestles with a bull on top of the Empire State Building when it is raining Moonpies.Val Kilmer is boring as Batman, just as insipid as the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are just over the top and plain silly when it comes to playing Two-Face and Riddler. They are campy, never settle down, and can't sit still in any of the scenes.And Chris O'Donnell as Robin is just as boring as Batman. His acting has no charm, though I must say, his fighting style is quite good, it's too bad he could use it when fighting bad guys and he ends up getting captured! Overall, this is a stupid film that really spoils the Batman franchise. But what would follow would be one of the most horrible and dim-whitted failures to ever hit the big screen.",Batman Forever
278,Jakethemuss,Where the series went wrong,3,11 August 2007,"I have already written a long review documenting my loathing toward 'Batman and Robin', so I won't tire myself out with an essay, but would like to point out that this is where Batman started to slip. Joel Shumacher stepped into the chair after 2 brilliant outings from the Gothic and talented mind of Tim Burton, and lost the plot a little.This film pits Batman (Val Kilmer) against The Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), and has Robin (Chris O'Donell as his eager sidekick. It follows a predictable, childish and unconvincing path as Batman confronts his camp OTT enemies whilst uttering corny lines. The way it is executed forces me to think it is aimed at purely pre-teen Americans, and would be suitable for Saturday morning TV alongside other shallow, 2 dimensional films. Schumacher seems to have misunderstood what Batman is about, who he is, and turned a good concept into a brightly coloured mess.I saw the first 10 or so minutes of this the other night on TV, and after many years without seeing it, I soon realised just how daft, cheesy and comical it is, through and through. The lines are wooden and clichéd, the acting is questionable, and actors like Mr Lee Jones are totally wasted despite their valiant efforts to save this film.",Batman Forever
279,JoshuaMLosapio,A Good Movie Trapped Inside a Dud,5,17 September 2019,"The best way to describe ""Batman Forever"" is a good movie trapped inside a bad one. Schumacher attempts to explore the heart of the Batman mythos by returning to Bruce's origin and placing more emphasis on the title character than in the Burton films. The movie's approach to the psychology of Bruce Wayne is genuinely interesting, and the relationship between Batman and Robin is well done. Unfortunately these strong story elements are overshadowed by a messy plot and an overall campy tone that ruins whatever character study Schumacher was aiming for.The main narrative is unfocused and cluttered with too many characters: not the least of which is the aggravating Riddler & Two Face comedy duo that gets old very quickly. Nicole Kidman is one of the most talented actresses of her generation - but she's wasted in a film that uses her as a creepy stalker who's interested in Batman only because she wants to sleep with him. In the previous films Vicky Vale and Selina Kyle were proactive and independent women with complex emotions well beyond sexual desire. But in ""Batman Forever"" the only significant female character almost entirely exists as a figure of sexual interest for the male lead.Val Kilmer is a capable Batman, but he lacks the fire that Keaton brought to the role. Even poor George Clooney contributed his trademark charm to Bruce Wayne in ""Batman & Robin,"" one of the worst movies ever made. The best actor in ""Batman Forever"" by far is Chris O'Donnell as Robin - who also has the most character development. I enjoyed watching his story unfold onscreen, and I wish more focus had been placed on Dick Grayson than the far less interesting villains who dominate much of the film.Unlike the Burton films that had a clear look and feel, ""Batman Forever"" has a completely incoherent visual style that seems more like a music video than a Hollywood blockbuster. The bright neon colors and science fiction influences in the set design simply don't mesh well with the neo-noir world of Batman. The bombastic musical score is also a major step down from Danny Elfman's masterful work on ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns."" ""Batman Forever"" is a movie with several good qualities, and somewhere beneath the sound and fury of Joel Schumacher's Gotham there lies a compelling Batman story. But as is, ""Batman Forever"" doesn't work. 5/10.",Batman Forever
280,neobateman,"Cool concept, bad execution",5,6 October 2016,"Batman Forever was released in 1995 and had a huge change of style after the incredibly dark Batman Returns. Tim Burton was replaced by Joel Schumacher who has made some really good movies. He was assigned of making a family friendly Batman film, not being happy where the franchise was going Michael Keaton stepped down as Batman. Val Kilmer took over the role and I will say his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is better than Keaton's, Batman is a different story. Positives first, I really like the special effects, I like Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne and I love the idea of Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Unfortunately the film suffers from a weak script and bad characterizations. Bruce while more interesting than before, still comes across as bland and boring mostly. Two-Face and the Riddler are Joker rip-offs and Nicole Kidman as Bruce's love interest is flat out boring. Overall entertaining enough, not very memorable though.",Batman Forever

282,TheFilmConnoisseur,The Schumacher Era Begins....,8,17 June 2003,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorWhen Batman Returns was released in 1992 many parents were upset because of the excessive violence. Ironically since the animated series was perhaps as dark and violent. Anyhow, after the controversy Warner Bros. enlisted the help of director Joel Schumacher to make a more kid friendly Batman film.The ending of Batman Returns was obviously a cliffhanger and Tim Burton's plan for this film was to have a resilient hero. While that element is present here many things have changed. Before Schumacher has Batman as an American Express Card client he needs to get rid of the dark side and allow the campiness to come in.While the film is a blend of camp and goth Schumacher manages to make this an enjoyable action movie with Val Kilmer in the lead this time. Kilmer does a decent job as the bat and along side him is Robin played decently by Chris O'Donnell and the sexy Nicole Kidman. The downside of the film is Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Carrey plays an evil Ace Ventura and Jones plays the Joker. I'm very disappointed that Billy Dee Williams couldn't reprise his role as Two-Face and Schumacher didn't allow the split personality to be a major element.

I loved the villains in this film. Tommy Lee Jones is crazy as hell as Two-Face and I love it. Jim Carrey really shine as the Riddler. Val Kilmer was a decent Batman but he's no Christian Bale or Michael Keaton. I really liked the crazy lighting that Tim Burton brought to the movie. The sets were awesome and colorful. The costumes were crazy as can be. I did like the story line. You could even make parallels to today. It was a little weird but I enjoyed it. Now let's get to the bad.
So what I didn't like about this was certain camera angles and some aspects of the editing process looked a little weird to me. I don't think Bruce Wayne, played by Val Kilmer, was brooding enough. He wasnt cheery but Batman is usually pretty brooding. And in certain parts I felt that Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey over acted the craziness a little bit.

Its a great entertaining, PROPER batman film, not some pseudo-crime drama borefest like the new ones are. i hate the new movies frankly. hate to break it to ya nerds but new movies are boring, older ones are more entertaining as batman films. this is a fact, not opinion. Forever is NOTHING like Batman & Robin. despite what a lot of jaded cynical ""adults"" say, this is actually a very good batman film. I perhaps am a bit biased because i LOVED this film when i was 7 and i still think its good today. Its exactly what i believe a batman movie is supposed to be, fun, cool, dark, brooding, colorful villains, cool car, etc. not sure what people mean that the older films aren't ""serious"". yes they are, they we re done seriously. If the villains didn't have any humour, the movies would be dull as hell! Just look at the new ones, the villains are as dull as dirt. Its got it all, and is the first batman to focus more on Bruce Wayne/batman. not as much as Nolan's films, thankfully. i never found batman as interesting as his villains. sure batman is cool and all, but once you discover that his parents were murdered in front of him and that that is what drove him to become a crime fighter, there really isn't much more to say about him. his villains however, always seem to have some crazy back story that makes them what they are and they are also typically the most fun. however in this film, while they do focus more on batman, they don't have that overtake the film, like in batman begins. i never liked ""origin"" movies anyway, they are too much like biopics and batman begins is no exception.Jim Carry....LOL. what can i say? he steals the show, a lot like how jack Nicholson and Danny devito stole the show in there batman films. but this makes sense since riddler is the main villain. two face is also played rather psychotically by tommy lee Jones, but still manages to be funny in a joker-ish way. I'm not the biggest robin fan, but they really managed to make robin work for a film and not in a stupid campy Burt ward way. hes done seriously for the most part, except for that one line where he says ""holy rusted metal batman!"" lol but it was still fun to see a little nod to the 60's show. unfortunately the sequel did A lot of what the 60's show did, and that is where it started sucking. but Forever was sleek, loud fun and is still 16 years later, one of my favorite batman films. the first 3 were great, and to me they make a really great trilogy of batman films. i wouldn't really say that this movie is a real true ""sequel"" to Batman Returns, but if you had to put them together, it makes sense as a trilogy. first one is a awesome adventure movie, the 2nd one is the dark brooding 2nd chapter, and the 3rd is the light but still fun more family friendly film, much like they did with star wars and Indiana Jones. too bad B&R mucked things up.the vehicles are cool too. i always loved the bat mobile in this one, with the blue lights, and the bat boat and bat plane. it was familiar, but fresh and new and the bat cave was HUGE this time. the music score is cool and exciting, but lets face it, Danny elfman is the bat master when it comes to scoring batman films. Hans zimmer....lets not even go there. the guy is a hack and cant write batman music to save his life, just sound effects. but Elliot goldenthal did a great job bringing the ""fun"" to batman, and a worthy score for this film.from what i gather from history, this film did tremendously well at the box office. it was a movie that the audience wanted at the time. this was before comic book films got ridiculously superficial and ""emo"". this was back when comic book films were still allowed to be loud and fun and even a Little over the top. these are the batman films i miss. why did they have to change? sure one can say this film was made for the kid, but honestly, this is a film where ""everyone won"", as Schumacher put it. the movie was indeed a lot more kid friendly, featured many more ""neat"" looking bat gadgets/vehicles/suits etc, and was obviously very commercial but at the same time, it was a good story adding new takes on the characters, a new look and just dark enough to be taken seriously while being incredibly entertaining. the audience loved the movie and it was generally well received. the focused more on the hero, the villains were hilariously great, and Nicole kidman added some needed sex appeal to the movie. count in the cool soundtrack and you've got a winner. and i can see why. I'm not a critic and i don't pretend to be. if i like a film, i like a film. and batman is my favorite superhero. someone once said you have to have to heart of a child to enjoy this movie. perhaps so. either way, its a cool movie, even if you didn't watch this as a kid in the 90's, its still a awesome kickass movie to me and always will be.",Batman Forever

290,mhajs,"Burton's not here. Keaton's not here. But yeah, it's still good anyway.",7,20 June 2005,"*** out of ****Many people find Batman Forever a less good movie than the previous Batman movies, or even a horrible movie, maybe because of some changes in the production like Tim Burton and Michael Keaton's departure, or because of Tommy Lee Jones' character Harvey Two-Face, which is definitely a clown and not so evil as he should have been or even because of the fact of Val Kilmer replacing Keaton. My opinion of this all is that if you can tolerate these things (and maybe other things as well), this movie actually can be entertaining! First of all, let's discuss about Keaton's replacement with Val Kilmer.Michael Keaton in my opinion was the best Batman so far. By the time I wrote the review about Batman Returns, I haven't seen Batman Begins yet. Now writing down about Batman Forever, I did watch Begins. I guess I still find Keaton the best of them all, but I must say that Christian Bale did a very good job! I'll still write down about Begins. But Kilmer! He did a very good job as Batman/Bruce Wayne too! He's dark at times, polite at others (like when he's trying to teach Edward Nygma that his evil plan won't work because it'll raise too many questions) and even romantic at times when he is with Nicole Kidman.I guess that the problem in this movie is not Batman himself at all. It's Robin (Chris O'Donnell) and Two-Face (Lee Jones). For a moment I liked Robin. But there are scenes where even after he's lost his parents in a tragic accident he shows himself to enjoy his new life, by showing himself to Alfred and to the gangsters in town. He takes Batman's car and goes to the streets to beat some bad guys and even finds a girl, who after is saved, asks for a kiss. What an artificial scene. About Lee Jones, I liked his performance, and even though he's not as evil as some people said he should have been, the main problem in my opinion is that he's kind of an imitation of the Joker (played by Jack Nicholson in the first Batman).But the worst scene of the entire movie in my opinion is when Batman and Robin try to climb that sort of island where Nygma and Two-Face are headed. Robin speaks like he's the same Robin of the old series calling Bruce whom he knows as Bruce, Batman. While the Batman from the movies has been completely adapted for them, Robin did that job also, but in that scene, it lacked that feeling.The rest of the cast includes Jim Carrey, who may be annoying sometimes but in here we forgive him, since he's a completely crazy villain, and even Drew Barrymore. I haven't seen other Joel Schumarcher movies, but this one, we may say, have passed. If you can be tolerating, of course.",Batman Forever

Val Kilmer, although not Michael Keaton at all, is still better than Clooney as Bruce Wayne/Batman (Clooney was just the guy from ER in a Bat suit, that's all!), does what he can with the role, and does pretty well. Although I've never been a fan of Robin, Chris O'Donnell presents the role very well, making me actually care about him. But the villains steal the show here. Carrey as the Riddler? Just plain rocks, that's all I can say. Tommy Lee Jones is normally a serious actor while the character of Two Face is normally a serious one, but Tommy has a lot of fun portraying this character and so do I!And the other thing I enjoy about this is how well it balances the darkness and the humor. Batman should always be dark, (OK, we'll cut the Adam West show some slack) as he became that way because of the murder of his parents and same way with Robin. The scene where Bruce stands in front of the picture of his parents with the flashbacks of their deaths really stands out. And same way with Dick Grayson, with his wanting revenge on Two Face (what happened in the next movie, Chris?). Schumacher is pretty damn good when it comes to mixing these elements together (Lost Boys, anybody?)So while it is not Batman Begins (or the Dark Knight, which I know will be awesome), give it a break since it's not Batman & Robin",Batman Forever
293,zwjonas,Bad Movie,5,16 September 2021,Val Kilmer does a great job. Overall this movie is riddled with plot holes and ultra cheesy dialogue. Super suprised Tommy Lee Jones agreed to this role it really does not fit him. Jim Carrey overacts pretty hard. Worst batman movie i have seen probably.,Batman Forever
294,nutz4n64,Best of the series,10,15 January 2000,"I don't know why people are bashing this movie, but I thought it was very good.  Val Kilmer was good.  Tommy Lee Jones played his part of Two Face very well, but Jim Carrey is the one that truly shines.  His performance makes this one worth seeing as he adds a lot of humor.  I see people complaining that this one isn't as dark as the first two.  I in no way see that as a handicap.  It seemed a bit more glorious, and Batman had a very good image, but still had the flashbacks of his parents' death.Great movie.",Batman Forever
295,Reel_entertainment,Decent flick with too many characters,5,3 January 2002,"Ok...the movie wasn't horrible, but could have been better. First, there were too many characters & too little storyline. Tommy Lee Jones, who rarely does comedy, shines as Two-Face. He was terrific in this role. Jim Carrey, who usually tries & steal the spotlight, does in this movie as well. He gets quite annoying early in the film. Maybe this is one reason why I couldn't get interested in the movie. Nicole Kidman was good in her role, which was supposed to be a copy of Kim Basinger's role in the first 'Batman' movie. Chris O'Donnell wasn't bad as Robin; you do get to see his character take form. And finally, Val Kilmer...all I can say is, this movie makes you beg for Michael Keaton back as Batman. I couldn't tell if Val Kilmer was bored in this role or didn't want to be there. This is a very weak installment of the series, & hopefully the new 'Batman' movie in 2003 will be better. At least Joel Schumaker isn't doing the films anymore.",Batman Forever
296,Chris-999,"Better than the last, not as good as the first two.",5,13 August 2000,"Val Kilmer is not bad as Batman/Bruce Wayne, but no match for Michael Keaton but much better than George Clooney. Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, and Chris O'Donnell are perfect as Two-Face, The Riddler, and Robin. Nicole Kidman is wickedly sexy as the psychologist who falls for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The two villains, Two-Face and The Riddler plot to destroy Batman, but this time he has a partner, Robin, to help him. Not as good as the first two, but definately better than the last one. Good special effects and the villains naturally steal every scene they're in.",Batman Forever
297,grenmonkey,Train wreck,2,26 May 2009,"Just think for a second; what would have been the outcome if Tim Burton had directed the film (and would have had enough creative freedom with it) and the script had been re-written to suit more along with the first one and ""Returns""?I mean, what you have here is great actors: Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Val Kilmer; great villains – and probably the best one there is in the Batman -universe: Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent; and a production studio shooting money at you faster than you can spend it. It would've been golden.Instead, you get a lousy script that doesn't even try to be anything more than an episode in a day-time TV-show and a director who just isn't right for a franchise that has build it's success to a gloomy, Gothic-like atmosphere. Seriously, there weren't anyone else available other than Joel Schumacher at the time? Adding Robin to the story was kinda dumb and unnecessary (not much substance in his storyline) move and Bruce Wayne got pushed away to a... psychiatrist? In a way a nice idea but done horribly wrong.Making Batman ""cool"" (i.e. with Batmobile going alongside a wall of a building, cheesy one-liners) wasn't entertaining then and it isn't that today, the villains also were reduced to power-hungry lunatics on a quest for world dominance, not much depth in there...The film had a lot of potential prior the production began but in some point of the journey it just got pushed on the wrong track and we were left with the train wreck we all dream to forget about. 1/4",Batman Forever
298,schultzclan6,Decent,5,13 January 2006,"If you liked the first two films, you will be disappointed by this one. Let me start this out for you. It started out perfect. Batman gets ready, that scene was okay, and then we see the coin of Two-Face flip in Thea air in slow motion. SECOND BEST PART OF THE FILM. Then, we see Two-Face's full face. I liked it, but when I saw what he's really supposed to look like, I was disappointed. Then, it got corny. There were some bad action sequences, and then we meet Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey). He is one of the greatest characters of the film. Later, he kills his boss(excellent scene), and then things begin to heat up again. Eventually, Bruce takes Chase Meridian to the circus. Some corny moments, but good. Then, Two-Face takes over the circus. Perfect! His thugs take out machine guns, close up the place, and the Grayson family makes a plan, while two-Face starts a bomb. The bomb stunk, but it was a great sequence. Robin's parents die, a very good moment. Batman takes him in. Then, the movie seems to become slow-moving, until Edward becomes the Riddler. Very good! He meets up with Two-Face. This is one of the best scenes of the film ,and then it drops again, with some stupid robberies, and some more action scenes. Soon, the Riddler makes an invention(which I loved), and it begins to heat up again. Soon, Robin joins Batman, and it becomes great from this point on. The showdown is the best of the entire Batman series, and Two-Face's death is perfect. Then, the Riddler sees the bat from Bruce's nightmares. The music stops, and he screams. BEST PART OF THE FILM. Then, Chse leaves Batman, and leaves to Arkham, where she talks to Edward. This scene is a classic, and is great. Soon, the movie ends. It could've been a great film. It had spectacular moments and just some stupid moments. There's a part when Edward destroys the Batcave(awesome), and his first Riddle drop-off as it zooms in is a classic moment. It was a weak film, barely supported by Jim Carrey. Had Jim Carrey not been in the film, the movie would be worse than its sequel.",Batman Forever

Over all this movie wasn't too bad, some parts were kinda dumb, but overall i'd give it a 7\10.",Batman Forever
300,danielloe,"Bad, but still remarkably entertaining to watch",5,27 July 2015,"*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Let's be honest, this movie is bad. Seriously, this is just plain bad. But, as bad as this is, it's still funny. This isn't like Batman & Robin awful, but it's pretty bad. Anyway, this film completely throws out nearly everything Burton had accomplished. Batman had become synonymous with dark and brooding, both the character and the stories. The character of Batman is still dark and brooding, as he is now played by Val Kilmer, who does an adequate job. Sure, he's stiff, but at least he delivers an okay performance, and even seems to be genuinely good in a few scenes here and there with Robin. Speaking of Robin, Chris O'Donnell plays Dick Grayson, orphaned circus acrobat turned crime fighter, Robin. Now, the thing is, I actually kind of like his character. Robin's just a like able character, he's young, he's headstrong, and he livens things up a bit. The problem I have with Robin is that the movie's never sure if they want to have him be a funny guy, or another brooding vigilante. He changes in the middle of scenes, and it's really hard to get invested in his character. However, when he does get to portray a damaged young man, he does pretty good. Michael Gough still delivers a good performance as Alfred, despite the quality of the script. And then... there are the villains. Now, I can't lie, watching Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones overacting so much in a movie, is very entertaining. But... those two as Riddler and Two-Face? No way. First of all, Jim Carrey goes way too far over the top. Sure, it's funny, but that's not how the Riddler should be. At least not how I understand the character. And Tommy Lee Jones, though entertaining while screaming 'BLAST 'IM' at the top of his lungs, is utterly wasted. He's a great actor, and I can only imagine how good he would be as a villain in a good Batman movie. Oh, and I can't forget Nicole Kidman as Chase Meridian, the psychologist who's into Batman, not Bruce Wayne. She somehow manages to turn a Batman movie into both a romance movie, and stupid psycho babble, which is really impressive when you think about it. While I expressed issues with Tim Burton's directing in my reviews for his Batman movies, Schumacher decided Batman needed all the garish colors and bizarre buildings he could throw onto the screen, and wants the whole thing to be a comedy routine apparently. Also, I can't even get into the action really. I remember when I first saw Batman with having no knowledge prior aside from the Adam West movie, I was like 'Wow! This is great! It's so much more realistic than the other superhero movies, it's about physically normal people!' Well, something like that. The point is, this movie throws realism out the window. Oh, and remember how Michael Keaton would get into some pretty cool fights with the goons in the previous movies. Val Kilmer just kind of spins around, and people fall over all around him. Two-Face doesn't even get a real fight with him! Speaking of Two-Face fights, why did the final battle with him just involve Robin punching him in the face and him falling backwards. Seriously, just repeat that, and then you have the fight. That would've worked as the finisher to the fight, but the whole thing? No! Anyway, if you can enjoy a movie just because of how over the top and bad it is, than you should absolutely watch this movie. For that purpose, it's great!",Batman Forever
301,shadow-54,BATMAN TRULY FOREVER!,9,8 July 1999,"This is the first Batman I saw on the big screen, back in 1995 and the best of them all! One of the best movies of that year.Joel Schumacher is a far better director than Tim Burton. The original Batman was excellent, but Batman Returns was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. But when I saw Forever, I was astonished. The new special effects and lighting were perfect. The new Bat-Mobile and Batman's outfits were also excellent.This movie featured the best cast ever! Val Kilmer was the best Batman actor. George Clooney was good, but lacked Val's talent. I never liked Michael Keaton. Michael Gough continued his life-long role of the incredibly devoted Alfred. Nicole Kidman was the hottest actress of a Batman movie. Even better than Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman! Chris O'Donnell was excellent! It was about time Robin joined Batman in the big screen! Jim Carrey was the best villain I've ever saw as he elevated The Riddler to new levels of excitement and joy. However, I was a bit disappointed seeing Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent. He's a very good actor and did a great job, but...Billy Dee Williams should have been the one. After all, he did play Harvey on the original Batman.The story was great. Bruce Wayne took a painful look into his dark past and subsequent destiny. Now the same has happened to Dick Grayson. It was tragic to look down the circus tent and watch his family dead on the floor. While I was prepared to hate Batman after wasting 130 worthless minutes watching the dreaded Batman Returns, Forever brought back all hope and everything that makes Batman the best!The movie soundtrack was the best I've ever heard in any movie. The songs at the end of the movie included Seal's Kiss from a Rose. Fantastic!Fantastic job, Warner Bros!",Batman Forever

304,davidhutch007,"Was that over the top, i can never tell !",7,17 January 2005,"In some cases yes it was a little over the top, but this still had some minor qualities that the original two batman films had and that is thats to Tim Burton who remained as producer for this other wise we would have had a Batman & Robin on our hands and thankfully that didn't happen here. Joel Shumacher came on board and totally changed the look to the franchise which in many ways made this film stand out from the originals but he didn't get too far into campyness just yet!!!The story, well yes there is some sort of a story which i think is defiantly better than the one we were reduced to seeing in Batman Returns. Bruce Wayne is fighting the demons in his head about his parents death while as the caped crusader the tow deadly demons Two-Face and the riddler which was great casting and up to this film had always been great casting.The best or should i say outstanding performances in this bat flick was definitely Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The riddler, Nicole Kidman makes a great Wayne Chick and Val Kilmer is a great Batman but a little too over the top with Bruce Wayne and finally the character i despise the most, Chris O'Donnel who made a rubbish robin and to me it didn't make me feel sympathetic for the character it just made me loath him more.My overall opinion on Batman Forever is that its a great entry in the Batman Franchise and does it justice but in some places too campy by far and a bit over the top but Joel Shumacher gives some good direction but in some places very little.So why watch this movie, well its a great film to sit and watch on a Saturday night with a takeaway and a beer and its great, i'd just like to add though that i think Tim Burton was right to jump off the band wagon when he did.******* OUT OF **********",Batman Forever
305,xodanielcasterox,Not terrible...I like it. Is that a crime?,6,17 March 2012,"I admit this movie was cheesy and over the top, and it is so not Tim Burton. But I have a soft spot for this one for a couple reasons: The style of the movie was a little too colorful but I like it anyway; Val Kilmer was a decent Batman but not a Michael Keaton, that's for sure; the music isn't bad it's actually cool; Nicole Kidman is sexy of course; but ultimately why I like this movie. Jim Carrey. Yes he was goofy but that's okay. He wasn't funny through the entire performance but at some times he was, and he plays an excellent psychopath without being funny if you think about it. And I like the fact that he is the leading villain.Now on to the things I don't like: Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, too goofy and wacky; Tim Burton did not direct this; Danny Elfman did not compose the music, they didn't even use the old theme of his which was classic and brilliant; not dark and Gothic like the first two; and of course Michael Keaton is not playing Batman again which is total bullshit!All in all, I liked it but it could have been better. I give it 6/10",Batman Forever
306,Scarlet-22,"Not the worst, but not the best, either",5,24 April 2002,"BATMAN FOREVER is the third installment in the series of films Tim Burton began in 1989 with BATMAN and continued with BATMAN RETURNS. It is the first of these BATMAN films not to have Tim Burton in the director's chair, and also the first not to have Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. Although the film is a Tim Burton production, it is directed by Joel Schumacher (THE LOST BOYS), and Val Kilmer (TOP GUN, WILLOW) wears the cape for this installment. Other new characters include: Chase Meridian, a criminal psychologist, played by Nicole Kidman (DEAD CALM); Dick Grayson/Robin, a young man who has fallen under circumstances similar to young Bruce Wayne's own, played by Chris O'Donnell (SCENT OF A WOMAN); the villains, Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent and The Riddler, a.k.a. Edward Nygma, played, respectively, by Tommy Lee Jones (THE FUGITIVE) and Jim Carrey (THE MASK). Veteran character actor Pat Hingle returns to the cast as Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, and Michael Gough also returns as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth.This movie is difficult to place in terms of how I would rate it among the four pre-BATMAN BEGINS BATMAN movies. It is not the best, certainly; the original BATMAN wins hands down, for reasons that factor into my review of FOREVER and which are explained below. But whereas the second movie became obsessed with Burtonesque cinematic vision and a dark, gruesome mood that was definitely not for the children the advertising was targeting, BATMAN FOREVER told a story that, although more acceptable for young viewers, failed, in my opinion, to be a convincing part of Burton's BATMAN mythos at all.First, this is a very fast action movie. I had trouble following some of the action scenes, they went by so rapidly. This was accompanied by a dizzying way of moving the cameras that shot these scenes. It was disconcerting and dizzying, and a great many times I lost track of what was going on visually altogether.Speed was also a damaging factor in character development, especially that of the villains. I was annoyed to find that certain scenes crucial to the establishment of Two-Face's character were cut out somewhere between the publication of the publicity comic and poster books and the release of the film. Two-Face is suddenly dropped on us as a villain Batman is fighting without even a polite explanation of how the actor had changed from Billy Dee Williams to Tommy Lee Jones.I also had a problem with how Jim Carrey played his role. He played The Riddler/Ed Nygma in a way that made him scarcely discernible in voice or mannerisms, to my observation, from Ace Ventura or The Mask. I noticed something strange: I was remembering a very funny line Carrey had delivered (he is quite comical and had me laughing numerous times), but I could not remember for the life of me whether the character who spoke the line was The Riddler or Ace Ventura. And the worst part was, it really did not matter. I had no reason whatever to be interested in the villains, other than for the fact that they were endangering Batman and Gotham City. This was a far cry from Nicholson's Joker, and also from DeVito's Penguin and Pfeiffer's Catwoman.I was also disappointed in the FOREVER music. I listened to the orchestral music that underpinned most of the movie and found myself wishing profoundly for Danny Elfman's work. That was another difference I did not like.But it's time to say a bit about what I did like about the movie. Not all the film was too fast. The scenes where Dick Grayson is taken in by Bruce at Wayne Manor and he discovers himself and decides he wants to help Batman after his parents are killed under circumstances similar to Wayne's own loss are done well and paced just about right. Also, the scenes where Chase Meridian wants to unlock Bruce Wayne's bad memories about his parents' deaths are slowed down to a point that they are believable, despite the fact that Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton, and Nicole Kidman is no Kim Basinger, in terms of acting skill with such scenes. Schumacher pulled those scenes off well.The stunts themselves were pleasing and plentiful. One such stunt involved the Batmobile using a grappling hook to ascend the side of a building with as much ease as its driver normally would. This stunt was needed, in my opinion, because for all the look of the new Batmobile's design, it did not seem as functional or stylish to me as the models in the previous movies. But it was used rather well, as was Batman's silken cord, which he used in an amazing rescue where its strength was used to support a bank vault. When the aforementioned pace and camera technique did not leave me totally lost or with a dizzy headache, the stunts and the special effects were quite a bit of fun to watch. At times they seemed to take over, but usually this was again the fault of the film's pacing.BATMAN Forever was not terrible. In some ways, it was quite good. It succeeded as a suspense-filled modern action film, and it has a decent amount of kid appeal. I would have no qualms about taking a child to see this movie; the youngster would have a ball. To me, ultimately, its failure was that it was not much more than that. It made me miss Burton's touch. Unfortunately, the franchise would not learn from this lesson, and we got another movie's worth of dreck afterward. I sometimes wonder if this film was the beginning of the end.",Batman Forever
307,clck2001,"A movie that has an outstanding and very big cast, and the villains are delightfully over the top, but it is the movie itself that is a little too over the top.",7,6 August 2007,"One of the best Batman movies. I would rank it right up there alongside ""BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM"" and ""BATMAN BEGINS"". I have not seen the sequel to this, again with O'Donnell as Robin and again with Schumacher as director, called ""Batman and Robin"", but I have heard a lot of negative things about it. One of these days, I hope I get the chance to see it, just to see what it is like. The cover and the trailer to it are pretty good, though. I liked this, I LOVED Mask of the Phantasm, and I LOVED Batman Begins. However, I think they overdo it a bit much at some parts, such as the nipples on the Batsuit, and the shots of Batman's butt?!? Who knows why they put that in there. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey I usually considered over the top. I thought Jones and Carrey were excellent. Every time I watch this, I am always surprised at Jones' incarnation of Two-Face, compared to his roles in The Fugitive and Lonesome Dove, which are the only other things I have seen Jones in. Carrey leaves nothing to be desired, because he gives you everything you would ever want out of a villain role. Of course, Carrey rarely deviates from his unusual ""different"" character with an eccentric twist. But he done himself proud when he deviated from that ""unusual sort of character with an eccentric twist"" to be a unusual, villainous character with an eccentric twist as The Riddler in BATMAN FOREVER.",Batman Forever
308,Zombie-Kermit,A Fun Flick.... Just Not A Batman Movie.,5,13 May 2008,"If you were to watch this movie knowing nothing of how Batman is meant to be, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you are a Batman fan (as I am) you will probably hate this. I did not though.I wouldn't call Val Kilmer a bad Bruce Wayne/Batman, it just wasn't a performance people will ever rave about. He was actually an alright Bruce Wayne, and wasn't that bad as Batman. I didn't think Chris O'Donnell was that terrible as Robin, his character was just a little lame. I'm sure Batman fans never wanted to see a movie where a character plays Extreme Laundry. He was just given some really corny lines that just didn't belong. Although I'll admit, I liked some of them. One of the reason I enjoy this movie is the presence of Jim Carrey... who I am a huge fan of. He has a lot of great lines and basically makes the movie a whole lot of fun. Two Face could have been worse, but he also could have been better. As before you won't mind if you are not a Batman fan. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in the movie was not his best.This movie fairly camp. Nowhere near as much as Batman and Robin though. This still retains some dark aspects similar to the Burton movies. It's part of what keeps it from becoming awful. I'll give the film some credit in the way it tries to give Bruce some character growth, for example the fact that he is having nightmares about his past, and trying to get therapy over it, and also the fact that he has suddenly become responsible for a rebellious teenage boy. Of course he is also given a love interest, played by Nicole Kidman, who sort of has a Lois Lane story going on.The special effects aren't really anything amazing, but far from awful. Basically just standard stuff for 1995. All in all this movie isn't great, but it certainly is not completely without its charms. Worth a watch. It's not faithful to the source, but if you can get past that you may be able to enjoy it.6.5/10",Batman Forever
309,Eightiesjunkie,Almost great...almost!,6,27 March 2014,"So after Batman Returns, I wasn't exactly anticipating another Batman movie. However, when I heard that Tim Burton had been given the boot as director, and that they were taking the series in a new direction, my interest was somewhat piqued. Now don't get me wrong I like Tim Burton, When he's good, he's great, but when he's bad, he's awful. Apparently, many other people agreed with my opinion that Batman Returns was a dud, including Warner Brothers. Joel Schumacher was hired to replace Tim Burton, and Val Kilmer was chosen to replace Michael Keaton. Keaton reportedly did not like the new direction the series was heading, and decided not to reprise his role. Although I respect his decision, I was disappointed that he wouldn't be returning. The character of Robin finally makes his appearance in the series, which I really liked. Robin has always been one of my favorite characters in the Batman comics, and I thought Chris O'Donnell played the role rather well, and I give the screenwriter credit for putting characteristics of all three Robins from the comics into this film's robin. But in the film, he's not given much to do. Jim Carrey portrays The Riddler, and he's the highlight of film! He's fun to watch, and you can tell he's enjoying every minute of the experience! Val Kilmer portrays The Dark Knight this time around, and while he does very well with the character of Bruce Wayne, he doesn't bring anything new to the character of Batman. Then, there's Tommy Lee Jones as Two-face. He's one of my favorite villains from the comics, so I was excited to see him in the film, but Jones doesn't even come close to capturing the character's essence or complexity. However, I can't put the blame all on him, Schumacher seems to only understand the bare minimum of the character. He's scarred on one half of his face, he wears clothes with two different colors, and he flips a two headed coin that's scratched on one side. This film's Two-face just sucks! What really kills the film for me, is that the film feels incomplete and uneven. Several scenes were cut from the film that shouldn't have been. These scenes elaborated on Bruce's interior struggle, and supposedly delved deep into the psychology of Batman. From what I understand, this was the film's intended goal. I hope one day we'll see a director's cut of the film. Maybe then, we can finally see Schumacher's original vision, But as the film is, it's just so-so. In my last review, I said that going from Batman to Batman Returns was like chasing champagne with sewer water. Now we've gone from sewer water to diet soda, it's much better than sewer water, but it's definitely not champagne.",Batman Forever

315,jrm23july@aol.com,"Carrey, Forever The Great Comic Actor, Isn't Able to Make this Film Spectacular- Just Noisy!",6,24 March 2006,"""Batman Forever"" is the third of a series of Batman movies. It follows ""Batman"", and ""Batman Returns"", both movies with Michael Keaton in the lead role. In ""Batman Forever"", Val Kilmer takes over the lead role as the Caped Crusader, and Chris O' Donnell is introduced as Robin, the boy wonder.Two Face, (Tommy Lee Jones) teams with the Riddler (Jim Carrey) to wreck havoc upon Gotham City. Dr. Chase Meridian, played by Nichole Kidman is Batman/Bruce Wayne's love interest. Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor. But somehow I don't feel he is right for the role of the diabolical and pure evil- Two Face in ""Batman Forever"". He is better suited for more serious dramatic roles, like U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerard in ""The Fugitive"". I don't like him at all in ""Batman Forever"" and I think that he ruins the movie. Nichole Kidman has the same type of role that Kim Basinger has in the original ""Batman"". She is not bad, but very ordinary. Her part in the film may be a necessary one, but anyone here could fill Kidman's shoes. Not many actors however could fit the shoes of Jim Carrey, who is outstanding as the Riddler. He is skillful, clever, funny, charismatic, and somewhat evil in a goofy sense, which is what ""Batman"" is supposed to be all about. No one could play the role better than Jim Carrey, whose performance beats out all of the 60's TV villains including Frank Gorshin who played the Riddler on the high camp- ""Batman"" 60's adventure show.I also think that Chris O' Donnell is perfect for the role of Robin, the boy wonder. He is more believable as a comic book hero than the Robin in the 60's television ""Batman"", who plays less like the role of a superhero and more like a damsel in distress. Chris O' Donnell's character Robin also doesn't tease or tantalize us with all of his ridiculous puns, five minutes before he gets captured by the Riddler's goons. ""Batman Forever"" is, however written in the same style as the '60s TV show is written; high camp, satirical, and deliberately overacted. This is a better movie than the sequel, ""Batman Returns"", which is too painful and gloomy to be appreciated by young Batman fans. Very good special effects and stunt work bring this fantasy to life. ""Batman Forever"" is a big budget film with a very creative set design, great art direction, and original costumes. That's the good aspects of this film. Now let's look at the bad.The movie, like the first two ""Batman"" films in 1989 and 1992 has too many adult themes, like Dick Grayson's painful loss of his parents. There is also too much violence for a ""Batman"" picture and the plot is not dramatic enough. By dramatic, I don't mean that it has to be taken seriously. But it should be more engrossing, and edge of your seat action, not as predictable. The action sequences are high in number but not in quality. The action sequences are loud, difficult to follow and distracting from the plot. This would be a two-star movie if not for the great acting performance by Jim Carrey and lavish special effects. However, acting and special effects are very important, and often all a movie like ""Batman Forever"" needs to succeed at the box office. Somehow high quality, in depth screenplays, the ones in the original two Superman movies don't seem to matter anymore in big budget Hollywood.",Batman Forever
316,nickkulstadis,"Horrendous ""toy centric"" piece of trash",1,8 November 2021,Where to start with this trainwreck? It was so awful. Tim Burton made 2 enjoyable Batman movies that had the right balance of being serious and being pulpy. WB got greedy and didn't like the more dark style Burton infused his movies with despite it suiting the property well. It wasn't really too dark but it wasn't as easy to sell toys with either. So they decided to fire Burton because he refused to make a garish and overly campy piece of trash like this so they brought that hack Joel Schumacher in to make movies that had the top priority of selling toys over being anything resembling good Batman movies. This was an utter farce and is practically unwatchable anymore. Val Kilmer was robotic and stiff and wasn't good as Batman or Bruce Wayne. Michael Keaton was WAY BETTER. I don't blame him for quitting. I'd probably rather quit than star in an utter travesty like Forever. Jim Carrey was playing Jim Carrey in an utterly ridiculous spandex onesie with ? Marks emblazoned all over it in case you forgot he was the riddler and Tommy Lee Jones was bad as Two Face. He was imitating Jack Nicholson's Joker rather than playing Two Face and the rubber prosthetic was extremely embarrassing. Robin in this movie was grating and made an already terrible movie worse with his incessant whining and stuck up attitude. The pacing of this movie was glacial and the storyline was stupid and boring. This movie and Batman And Robin are among the worst superhero movies ever made and are an total insult to the Batman series. WB should've been ashamed for these 2 utter embarrassments.,Batman Forever
317,wwefreakjon,Batman Series Review,6,20 July 2008,"OK, I finally got my chance to see The Dark Knight and I'm very happy to say that it's the best of the series. But before I do my review of the best I'm going to do my review of the worst, Batman & Robin.No matter how good Uma Thurman looked has Poison Ivy there's no disputing the fact that not only did Joel Shumacher really butcher the directing but Akiva Goldsman made the worst script in his career; a complete 180 from his brilliant ""A Beautiful Mind"". George Cloony was the worst Bruce Wayne (yes he was worse than Adam West) Chris O'Donnell as Robin wasn't much better and Arnold Schwarzenegger became the worst villain of all time as Mr Freeze. I give it a 3/10 for the pure fact that it can be enjoyed if you really have no taste.Next worse is Batman Forever. Even if it had the most Oscar Nods of the series so far Tommy Lee Jones and Chris O'Donnell doomed the movie from get go. Although Val Kilmer wasn't bad as the caped crusader he just didn't fit the role like Michael Keaton did before him. Another problem was that Joel Shumacher replaced Tim Burton which pushed the comic book appeal way over the top. I've got to say that Nicole Kidman was really good in her role and that she did bring the film up a few notches, but the true star of the film was Jim Carrey. He was so funny and yet so insane in his role has Edward Nigma/the Riddler. I give this a 6.5/10 for not being a total flop.Now the series begins to get better with Batman Returns. Although Danny Devito wasn't great as the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer brought the real villain to the film. In this instalment Michael Keaton and Tim Burton return to their respective roles has Batman and Director but they definitely lost the magic after they switched the villains. I give this a 7.5/10for not butchering the series.In 3rd Place the original Batman movie which was fantastic. Jack Nicholson was great has the comical Joker and if I were judging this on awesome cartoony flavour than this would be #1 but since I'm not I put it at 3rd. Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson play off each other so well and there's very little more to it. I give this a 8.5/10 for being the best original and the best Joker until TDK.In 2nd place Batman Begins reboots the series with a fresh new cast. Christian Bale completely renews the character of Bruce Wayne with a new sense of confusion and bringing a real anti-hero play into the role which is a great spin on the character. Michael Caine does a fantastic job as Alfred and completely blows Michael Gough out of the water. Bringing Morgan Freeman into the movie was a great idea all together. Liam Neeson was a refreshing change from the cartoony villains from the earlier movies and has a great heir of arrogance. The only bad part was Katie Holmes playing Rachel Dawes, she was just a bad choice for the part but luckily she was replaced for the latest instalment. I give this a 9/10 for reviving the series.Finally in 1st place is The Dark Knight. The film is not only the greatest Batman/ Superhero film of all time it's also one of the best films of all time. Director Christopher Nolan brought back the realism he used in Batman Begins as well as the actor's. Christian Bale completes his turn to the anti-hero and is so real in the role, but the real star of the movie is the late Heath Ledger. The darkness he brings to the role rivals Hannibal Lecter as a villain. He is so evil and you just can't deny liking him no matter how much you hate him. His plans, or rather lack of plans makes everything very suspenseful. Another star of the film was Aaron Eckhart has Harvey Dent/ Two Face. He brings the knight in shining armour feel to the movie to contrast the anti-hero Batman which is nice until he snaps. I'm not going to give away how or why he snaps but when he does he plays a villain that reminds me Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars 3. He's good but just snaps. Next Maggie Gylenhall plays Rachel Dawes with a much more commanding and sincere character than Katie Holmes did. Gary Oldman is spectacular has Capt. and later Police Commissioner James Gordan. He never loses his trust in our caped crusader even when the world has turned against him. The final stars of the film are the mob boss Maroni who is a new kind of boss instead of the same Old Italian wacko. There is one thing you can't forget which the design for the latest two movies is. To be short and frank are amazing. The Batmobile is so much cooler now than it was and then the Batcycle is even cooler. I give this a 10/10 for bringing the superhero movie into the category of Oscar worthy Drama.To end off I just want to say that I love all the movies (except Batman & Robin) and can say It's one of the greatest series in movie history.",Batman Forever
318,marcusedenellis,Above average,7,31 July 2006,"Like Warhol's famous ""fifteen seconds of fame for everyone"" remark, eventually, all Hollywood actors will play Batman. In this film it is Val Kilmer's turn. This time he gets a new girlfriend and a new sidekick, Dick Grayson (played by an ever so wooden Chris O'Donnell). Actually, I am probably being a bit unfair on O'Donnell who does turn in an acrobatic and workmanlike performance  but he is just a bit bland.After all the Gothic doom and surreal gloom of Burton's take on the Batman character this film is definitely lighter in tone, with some nice touches of humour and a bit of colour. Batman has acquired a new girlfriend as well; Dr. Chase Meridian played with sultry effectiveness by the ever-beautiful Nicole Kidman. Kidman's character is a psychiatrist who is an expert in split personalities  which is handy given that both villains suffer from that very disorder.And the film's principle strength is the two villains for the price of one: Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma  the Riddler (e-nygma  geddit??) and Tommy Lee Jones as the deranged Two-Face. Both performances are wildly over the top with huge amounts of scenery chomping going on but they are good value for money. The ""riddles"" hark back to the heady days of Frank Gorshin's take on the character in the 60's TV seriesI am not going into the plot here  it's almost throw away; needless to say that both dastardly villains want Batman dead for different reasons. The story flits about and there are plenty of strands to keep you occupied but the direction is solid and linear and there some nice romantic triangles in which to indulge yourself involving the Bruce/Batman/Chase relationships.Schumacher's directorial take is a very different one to Tim Burton's and, as I previously mentioned, he has brought a lighter tone to Gotham. It feels more like a real city than the dark fantasy world of the previous films. As far as Kilmer is concerned; he makes a better Bruce Wayne than Keaton but under the cloak and mask  it could be anyone.A 7 rating for an entertaining couple of hours.",Batman Forever

320,David198,A great film struggling to get out,6,23 February 2004,"This could have been a great film.The sets are amazing: Gotham City's towering, entangled, crazy skyline - the setpieces are fascinating: the weird circus, the vast public celebrations that you just know are going to end in mayhem - and the film does examine the dark side of Batman (and Robin).  In total contrast, the witty one-liners are a welcome relief after the ever-darker first two films.Jim Carrey manages to outdo Jack Nicholson in over-acting as the villain, and, despite some reviews, there is 'light and shade' in the film, with quieter moments interspersing the more manic ones.But there is also a lot wrong.  Two-Face really has nothing going for him compared to the Riddler - just flipping a coin is hardly fascinating.  Val Kilmer is totally miscast as Batman (and Bruce Wayne), and makes the role uninteresting.Nicole Kidman is brilliant as usual, but has to act within the limitations she is set - the greatest being that she somehow has to avoid realising Bruce and Batman are one and the same: a common flaw in superhero/secret identity tales.All in all, good escapist entertainment - but it could have been so much better!",Batman Forever
321,pioneerlythere37,"After ""Batman Forever"", I am glad this Batman series doesn't go on forever",5,14 August 2016,"The first two Batman films, helmed by director Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton as the Batman, were moderately entertaining. As many objections as those films could possibly raise, they were better than Schumaker's first installment, ""Batman Forever"", in just about every thinkable way. Yes, Michael Keaton is in no wise the ideal Batman/Bruce Wayne, and yes, the overall darker theme doesn't always clash with the moments of humor the films attempted, but neither film was so tonally inconsistent, inconsistently melodramatic, or melodramatically ridiculous as ""Batman Forever"".One thing I should give it credit for is being funnier than either of Burton's films; in fact, it wasn't until I saw that it was nowhere credited for being a comedy that I realized the humorous moments weren't intended to be amusing. No, I didn't laugh whenever Riddler said something like ""Big Kahuni"", but rather during Batman's banter with Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychologist who has an obsession over our caped crusader. ""I haven't had much luck with women,"" Batman confesses, to which she responds, ""Maybe you just haven't met the right one,"" to which Batman responds...well, he doesn't respond, because all of a sudden she's leaning in for a kiss, and Batman's face is practically screaming, ""Oh, yeah, baby!"", completely forgetting to be the mysterious vigilante more modern interpretations have led us to expect from him.Val Kilmer is the new Bruce Wayne/Batman, after Michael Keaton wisely dropped out, realizing that Schumaker's interpretation was...problematic. Although Kilmer is more believable as a butt-kicking vigilante, his performance lacks any emotion or volume and he speaks his lines as if reading them from the script, resulting in a near-monotone Bruce Wayne. As for the rest of the portrayals, multiple objections can be raised for each, except for perhaps Nicole Kidman as Dr. Meridian, who did her best with the nonsensical characterization provided to her by the screenwriters.Tommy Lee Jones is a major letdown, especially after all of the films he's been in (""The Fugitive"", for example) that have set our expectations high. He portrays Two-Face, once known as Harvey Dent, who was a district attorney until a crime boss threw acid on half his face, splitting his personality in two; though the only half we really ever see is the demented, maniacal side who jumps up and down and claps his hands like a five-year-old at Christmas whenever something explodes. Of all the characters, Two-Face is the most irritating, and overall inconsistent, giving us no insight as to his motivations. I have a feeling that if the Two-Face of the film were to be asked why he wanted Batman dead, the answer would be, ""I don't know, that's a good question,"" and perhaps he would have abandoned his mission altogether; I would've even been slightly more satisfied if the film just answered that question with a, ""Because I want him dead,"" but instead Two-Face is immediately inserted into the film as a villain, no legitimate explanation provided. There is also the fact that his character seems reused from Nicholson's Joker, only made worse.Then there's the Riddler, the second villain, hardly developed any better. At the beginning of the film he's a scientist, conveniently named Edward Nygma, who is inventing a new way to view television and is fully invested in his undertaking, but his project is turned down by his idol and employer, Bruce Wayne. ""You were supposed to understand,"" Nygma weeps as Bruce walks away. ""I'll make you understand."" And from then on he's a completely melodramatic, giggling, totally insane...well, simply Jim Carrey-esque villain whose apparently trying to make Bruce understand, so he teams up with Two-Face, and they wreak havoc, and...ultimately achieve nothing, but who cares, they never were trying to achieve anything, or anything remarkable, in the first place, so in a sense the succeeded in the end, even with Batman prevailing! Yippee! Everyone's a winner! Oops, I almost forgot the newcomer superhero vigilante sidekick, Robin! Now I almost wish I wouldn't have remembered him. Although his presence in the movie may not be as degrading as the others', Robin is once again an example of bad acting (Chris O'Donnell delivers his lines with unconvincing emotions, similar to actors in soap operas) and clichéd, empty characterization. He's the recycled rebel/smart-alek super-talented apprentice...which I guess is what Robin has been for a while, but ""holey rusted metal"" it's getting old.Among the other problems are the disastrous script-writing, and dialogue that tries way too hard, making it largely laughable. When the film tries for sentimentality, in the form of Bruce's tormented past and resurfacing repressed memories, it ultimately falls flat and only manages to enhance the disconnect the viewer feels from the film. ""Batman Forever"" is a muddled, confusing, inconsistent mess that showcases decent cinematography and visual aspects, but lacks considerably in the essentials. At least it made me laugh!

322,evangeline,I don't like Joel Scuzzmaker's butchering,8,18 July 2008,"but I love the cast of this film more than any other Batman. Tommy Lee Jones, Val Kilmer, Jim Carrey, Debbie Mazar- what's not to love?!I am getting tired of people bitching and disparaging Batman Forever or the Tim Burton movies for the sake of the current crop. They were very well-liked when they came out and as I recall there was a buzz and excitement about them just like there is now.In 10-15 years when the current taste in film aesthetic is no longer around, the current Batmans (Chris Nolan) will be discarded just the same as older ones are.

323,mt7176,Bat Glitz,9,22 May 2007,"Before Tim Burton's Batman I had little care for the character. I was always a movie kid and never cared much for comic books. Yet when I saw this imaginary, dark and brooding world open up before my eyes I was instantly hooked in. So you can imagine I was down right near distraught over the news of Tim Burton not directing a third movie.Initially when I saw this film I knew it was an entertaining film...in some ways more entertaining than Batman Returns. However, that doesn't mean better. Batman Returns try to be something unique and therefore has more beneath the exterior. Forever is really a sugar filled bat-suit. In many ways it has little to do with the previous two installments in the series but still has enough of the Burton influence or common sense to keep in mind the success of the Batman films comes from the darker, more adult material, not featured in previous super hero incarnations.I think its interesting that the Warner Bros. studio left out the story line about Bruce's guilt leading him to be Batman. It could of ultimately have given this film the depth it was lacking. Plus this theme is touched on by later films such as Spider-Man as well as Batman Begins. Alas the third film in a series such as this, seldom, gets the story treatment and character development audiences deserve.Still however its an overall enjoyable film. I prefer the darker, sharper world of Burton's Gotham but Forever's Gotham has its fun places to visit. Unfortunately its not a place you want to stay in for too long or you might get trapped in the horribly over the top, cheesy world of Forever's sequel Batman and Robin.",Batman Forever
324,maryolalov,Not the best Batman movie but still an entertaining one,5,22 January 2019,"What I can say about Batman Forever is that it is getting too much hate. It is definitely not a good movie but it just isn't as bad as everyone is saying.One of the things that ruins this movie is the awful script. While the plot is not that bad, the script is just plain awful. It's filled with unfunny and dumb jokes and poorly written dialogues. I'm aware that this movie is comic based and so I shouldn't expect much from it but this horrible script makes it look more like a parody.The casting was also not very good. Val Kilmer as Batman was ok (if compared to Michael Keaton), Jim Carrey also did a quite good job as the Riddler. But Tommy Lee Jones's portrayal of Two Face was terrible. Two Face is a character that suffers from split personality, but the movie didn't show that. Tommy Lee Jones was playing a role that was closer to the Joker. All these ""insane acts"" that he was doing throughout the movie made me think that this is actually the Joker who for some reason got half of his face burnt.Of course there are many reasons why you might enjoy this movie. The plot is not bad and even interesting at some points. If you are a fan of Jim Carrey movies you'll surely like Batman Forever not only because of the unique performance that only Jim Carrey can give but also because this movie is way more colorful than other Batman movies.For conclusion I can say that Batman Forever is a kid friendly movie that is excellent if you have time to waste. It is definitely not a good movie but still doesn't deserve to be called the worst",Batman Forever
325,mrkramer,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,16 January 2001,"This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The first Batman movie was a fairly decent film. The series lends itself to having the possibility for some great performances in the Quirky Villain category. Jack Nicholson is a case in point. But this one had no apparent plot, it was horribly loud and boring, and the only reason I didn't get up and walk out was because I was there with some friend.

328,VenomX,This one could have been better,7,11 August 2002,"When the first Batman came out, it was met with a huge marketing push and a large amount of hype, and succeeded because it was a good movie.  It had the wise direction of Tim Burton, the nice acting by Keaton & Nicholson and stood out as a great comic-to-movie translation.  Three years later, Batman Returns came out, and suffered a mixed reception from audiences.  Burton decide to take a film noir approach with that one, which made it a very dark film that was much more violent and disturbing than the first (which is one reason I didn't really like it).  So, after three more years, Warner Bros. decided that that approach wasn't a good idea, so they went for a lighter, more comedic atmosphere.  They demoted Burton to producer and brought in Joel Schumacher as director, that's where the problems began.I remember when this film came out in the summer of '95, I was only ten years old, but this movie was the first ever title were the ""I can't wait"" feeling came over me.  I was really excited about this movie, the hype got to me, despite the fact I didn't watch the first one until four years later (will be explained later).  I did watch Returns, but didn't really like it. One of the reasons I was excited for this title was Jim Carrey, back then he was my favorite actor, I loved his comedies and knew this one would be good with him in it.  Finally, after seeing it in theatres, I was amazed at how good it was, I loved the atmosphere, the actors, villains, pretty much everything.I saw the first Batman in the summer of '99, after renting it; I didn't really know what to think of it.  I didn't think it was as good as people said, but wasn't a bad watch.  I also witnessed the series falling apart after Batman & Robin, which I had indifferent feelings about (I didn't hate it, but didn't like it).Flash-forward several years later.So one night a few months ago I decided to pop Forever back in and take a watch, since there was nothing really else to do at that points.  Now, I haven't seen this movie in at least 3-4 years, so I was a little curious about it as well.  After watching it, I was stunned.  That movie was incredibly weak, the acting spotty and the direction misguided.  I must have matured greatly in those last seven years, because I saw it with a new opinion.  The problems I hadThe plot was a mess, the original script, which I read, was a lot better; the final one used in the film was riddled (sorry about the pun) with plot holes and dumb action-movie one-liners (""Chicks dig the car"").  The action scenes themselves were ridiculous (Batmobile driving up walls? Come on.), plus the bright neon lights and insane architecture (a giant neon blender for Riddler's lair?) got distracting after a while.The acting was mixed; Val Kilmer made a great Bruce Wayne and a terrible Batman (his voice was too wooden); Chris O'Donnell was too old and acted too immature to play a likeable Robin; Tommy Lee Jones was great as Two-Face, but I wish he was a little more secluded and not a Joker rip-off; Jim Carrey was hilarious as The Riddler, but a little too predominant in the script; while Nicole Kidman was just OK as Chase Meridian.I believe Schumacher went for the 1960's Batman campiness when making this movie, as well as making it more of an action flick than a dark, character-driven title, like the comics were.  Overall, a decent flick, rent it once, watch it, forget about it.6.5/10",Batman Forever
329,avsroxbronxfan,"Too silly, and that's REALLY bad for this type of film",1,17 July 2012,"If you watched either the 1989 Batman film, or the Batman Returns movie, they have one thing in common. They're very dark films, and that's good for Batman. He's a dark superhero, and that shouldn't change. Apparently Joel Schumaker disagreed with me. Batman Returns was considered too dark, so you could tell Batman Forever tried making it more kid-friendly, which I find very ironic since it was rated PG-13.Anyway, the film is about the Riddler, played by Jim Carey, who wants to steal brain waves from every TV in town and enlists the help of Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones. While Batman tries to stop them, Two-Face kills Dick Grayson's parents, and gets adopted by Bruce. Two problems with that, however. One is that Two-Face didn't kill Robin's parents in the comic, Tony Zucco did. Second problem is that in the comics, Robin was a kid. In this movie, he's like 25.After Dicks' parents get killed, he wants to kill Two-Face, but Bruce tells him why killing is not the answer, and I really like how he says it.Anyway, my biggest problem is that the movie tries to be funny, and it's not. You see this scene at the beginning where the music is cool and intense, then gets interrupted by, ""Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you sir?"" ""I'll get drive thru."" There's also one part when the Riddler is destroying the Bat Cave and there's this baseball theme music playing for some weird reason. How on earth is this funny? T There's also this one scene where Batman is being chased, and you see this woman pushing a baby cart down the street, but it turns out to be Two-Face in disguise. Not only is this unfunny, but it is completely pointless.Another problem is that the acting is either boring or over the top. I would mainly say Val Kilmer is boring, while the villains are over the top. Especially Tommy Lee Jones. He's not a bad actor, but this wasn't his best film. You would also notice he smiles all the time, even after something bad happens. I also hate his costume. Why is the other side of his suit all red and striped? And why does half of his tie have black polka dots? Completely random if you ask me.Anyway, the film is too silly for a great, dark superhero like Batman. I hate this movie, but not as much as Joel's next film, Batman and Robin.",Batman Forever
330,goey312,Goey Rating: GM (Good Movie),7,28 June 2005,"A nice addition to the batman franchise this is the first movie to introduce Robin. The unique story, and a different feel then the other Batman movies this one isn't quite as dark. Again as in the other movies there are multiple characters to try and keep track of. i really enjoyed the addition of Robin because it brings a younger face to the movie. The storyline for this movie was a little weak but over all not disappointing. The addition of Robin creates a special atmosphere as to having another character trying to keep the identity of ""Batman"" secret. It amazes me how easily Bruce Wayne seems to find girlfriends yet can never seem to keep one between two movies. This movie is a definite watch for everyone who's seen the other Batman movies, and for those interested in the new one ""Batman Begins""",Batman Forever
331,pfsombrero,Very bad...,5,17 May 2019,"Unfortunately Tim Burton decides to leave the post of director, passing the baton to Joel Schumacher, who in two hours of movie manages to destroy all the work done by his predecessor; starting the cinematic decline of the Batman character. Schumacher abandons the dark and dark tones used by Tim Burton, proposing a Batman that is less complex and less attached to the past, which after all more faithfully follows the classic comic strip. But the problems of this film are quite different: the scenography used by Tim Burton was beautiful, here Schumacher opts for a digital, which also for 1995 could be considered horrendous, the plot is rather banal, the script is terrible and disgusting, the Lighting during the scenes is ridiculous, the special effects bad and Val Kilmer is perhaps the most annoyed Batman I've ever seen. Almost nothing is used by the performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey, who, however good, do not help save this poor film. I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially to fans of films directed by Tim Burton. A movie too childish and full of errors, which will touch the bottom in its sequel: Batman & Robin, but of the latter we will talk about in a future review.

332,fritz2525,Viva Gotham City,10,5 August 2002,"(.o.) This movie is really good. I've seen this movie a bunch of time and I never get tired of watching it. It's kinda nice to see Batman with two enemies not just one, 'cause if there's more than one. There is a lot of suspense, you just never know what will happen, if those two villains will be in the same thing or just go their separate ways but still one goal which is to kill Batman. Unlike the two previous movies, this time he's got a partner. Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell. They picked the right person to play Robin. The acrobats he did is really cool. Tommy Lee Jones did a wonderful job being the TWO FACE guy. The question mark person/the whacko one, Jim Carrey is really funny. He's a great actor who can play the good or the bad guy and still his funny side has never disappeared. He is one of my favorite actors and he really is unique. Drew Barrymore didn't do a lot of stuff in this movie but that still made the movie more better. The more stars in it, the more people will watch it. Nicole Kidman's part is a little boring but that's okay I don't really care. The special effects were great, the crew did a wonderful job and I hope they make another movie ""Batman & Robin"". For all Batman fans, this movie should be on your list. Buy it or rent it, it's worth it. I give this movie a perfect 10.",Batman Forever
333,Griever_2112,Not Bad... but far from good...,5,17 June 2015,"Now... in my personal opinion when making a Batman movie, the main actor needs to hit 2 points... 1) Gotta nail Bruce Wayne 2) Gotta believe he is Batman. Now I love the Tim Burton movies, Michael Keaton was good, He was a great Bruce, but a passable Batman... In Forever, Val Kilmer was a Good Batman, he was spot on... but he was a terrible Bruce Wayne. I'll explain that, what I thought of the characters, then the story...(Spoilers incoming) Now what do I mean by that... well as Batman, he seemed dark and brooding (which is expected) The fighting was good, even the deep voice wasn't bad. But as Bruce Wayne... he was still dark and brooding... going after Chase (the doctor) seemed forced, like he only liked her cause it was in the script (which I'll touch on later) and HOW COULD YOU FORGET WHY YOU DRESS UP LIKE A BAT!?!?! The whole psychological, repressed memory issue he is dealing with felt like such a stupid shoehorned maguffin it made me want to cry... He is Batman, he watched his parents die in front of him... I think if he would repress it would be at age 13 not 33. You wouldn't be a master detective fighting crime in a costume and all of a sudden not remember why your doing it, unless he developed Alzheimer or dementia. That is why he was a Good Batman but a shitty Bruce Wayne, and that is why I can't back this... now onto the rest....Robin... Need I say more... oh, I do... OK then... Chris O'Donnell looks 25 and acts like a 12 year old... He acts like an angst filled teenager, but he looks like he skipped college to join the circus. He takes the Batmobile out for a joy ride, having a grand old time, then tries to rescue some random girl, being all bad ass... and then upon seeing Batman, turns into a sniveling crybaby. I know he blames him for what Two-Face did... but I would have been waiting in the batcave for him to show up and beat the snot out of him... not steal his car and think it is the coolest thing in the world... the only saving grace was the rusted metal joke... well played.Riddler... Jim Carry was a good choice, he had the goofiness that the Riddler needed, But they made him a little too goofy... comparing him to Riddler from... lets say the Animated Series (best example given the time frame) Where the Riddler was calculating, cunning and serious at times. Carry played the character more like Frank Langella in the old 60's series, A big goofball. I did like moments of his, but over all it felt like he was playing the Riddler trying to be the joker.Two-Face... Tommy Lee Jones... why? Yes the character does have a personality disorder, he relies on the coin for decision making... but again... he played it like such a goofball... when ""Harvey"" was talking he was calm, when ""Two-Face"" talked, it was like Tommy Lee dropped acid... too wild, too rash, too unpredictable, which his NOT how the character is... I will give credit, the makeup and costume were cool.The Story... it was a interesting one... If the characters had been more believable, it could have passed for a better story... who am I kidding... a Bruce Wayne who have some psych issues that NOW surface, an holo-projector that sucks the brain waves from all the viewers... AND...that single product becomes a rival to Wayne Enterprises... really...",Batman Forever

335,mst86,TERRIBLE SEQUEL!,2,1 January 2000,The third installment in the Batman series trashes everything Batman had been up until then.  Everything is different.  The Batmobile looks totally different and totally bad.  The Batcave's renovations were for the worse. The only reason it was made was to give an out-of-work commedianne a job (Jim Carrey).In this sequel Batman teams up with Robin and they fight Two-Face and the Riddler.  A bunch of other stuff happens but I don't care about it I am too disappointed with this film.Why was comedy such and important element in this film?  The comedy isn't even funny.  It isn't as bad as Batman & Robin.2/10 stars(THIS MOVIE IS SO MUCH LIKE THE THIRD INSTALLMENT IN THE SUPERMAN SERIES IT IS SCARY!),Batman Forever
336,EricVierthaler92,Decent Batman movie.,6,8 July 2009,"A pretty decent Batman movie. Val Kilmer made a killer Batman and Bruce Wayne! Robin was okay in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones was an okay Two-Face but the actor who played Two-Face in 'The Dark Knight' was much better because his was more realistic and much more scary. Tommy Lee Jones was to much like the Joker from the 1989 movie, Jim Carrey how ever made a good Riddler! The story is actually watchable. But one thing that bugged me really bad was when we saw shot's of Batman and Robin's butt cheeks and there suits had nipples on it. What the heck??!!??!!??!!??!! I really wish Michael Keaton and Tim Burton returned though. Joel Schumacher ruined the Batman series with the nipples and the fourth movie he made in the franchise. So having Joel S. as director was a big mistake. Should of gotten somebody better like Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, Rob Reiner, J. J. Abrams, Chris Columbus, etc. And why did the Bat mobile suddenly change in this movie? All in all it's a decent Batman movie. Would have gave it a 7 if Joel Schimacher didn't give us the show of Batman's rear end when he was suiting up and the nipples on the Bat suit. Even Bob Kane the creator of Batman didn't approve of that!",Batman Forever
337,tmieczkowski,Right before Joel Schumacher killed it,6,25 March 2003,"Joel only began to show his intent to completely destroy the Batman franchise with this movie. Robin is an incredibly annoying addition, but we could stand it.  Two villains is a bit much, but we saw this with Pen and Cat in the last movie.  But what the hell is all this camp? We're not watching Adam West here, Joel. The big-budget action is good, Jim Carrey is insane, and Val could have made a greater Batman if he had been given a much better project.  Thank god Michael Keaton didn't besmirch the first two films by appearing. My major problem is this: Why is it that Harvey Dent was played by Billy Dee Williams in the first movie (a black man), but all of a sudden, Tommy Lee Jones plays him in this one, but now he's suddenly become Caucasian?  Well, here's to plot holes.6/10",Batman Forever
338,andres_ge88,Heavily under-rated,7,1 June 2020,"I highly disagree with this rating. Val Kilmer did a very good job as Batman, this is a classic. This movie has a great soundtrack.

339,DangerAwesome,Jim Carrey shines in an otherwise very poor Batman outing,5,6 November 2013,"The series received an overhaul before Batman Forever. Director Tim Burton was replaced by a significant downgrade in Joel Schumacher, a man best known as the guy who ruined the 90's Batman series. This, however, is not the low point of the series. It is clunky and contains some huge gaffs but ultimately isn't too disappointing.Val Kilmer replaced Michael Keaton as Batman. His Batman is tougher and with less personality. His Bruce Wayne is the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd have been much happier not recasting or changing the title character between movies.The clunkiness of this movie is what is going to turn off most people. The problems with it are massive. From Batman cracking a safe with a hearing aid in a bank vault filling with acid (why acid?), to a nonsensical Batman diving across a courtroom in a brief TV flashback, to bat nipples, to a random shot of Batman's butt, the movie's problems are often laughable.It is Jim Carrey's Riddler that keeps it watchable. His over the top comedic acting fits the role perfectly. In fact I can't quite be sure if Carrey was perfect for the role or if Carrey made the role perfect for him. Either way he was highly enjoyable, and one of the few things I think this previous series has over the newer Batman series. They never would have been able to pull off such a silly villain the way that Batman Forever does.If you want to laugh at Jim Carrey, and to laugh at a dozen other huge problems with the movie, go see Batman Forever. Though you might consider fast forwarding through the stuff with Dr. Meridian.",Batman Forever
340,Jdmaxgaming,"Campy, Boring And Just Strange.",5,4 August 2015,"Batman: Forever, directed by what's his face, and staring what's his face. Now, let's get one thing straight, this is not as bad as most people made it out to be. The acting is pretty good, and overall dialogue is decent. What really fails here is it's campy-ness, holy crap. Gotham is a futuristic, totally different cyber city, which doesn't look anything like the previous films at all. In fact, this whole film is nothing like the original films by Tim Burton, even though strangely enough Tim Burton produced it. The actual plot is pretty bland, two villains, your hero, and the cliché love interest. Nothing new here. The CGI in this film is actually horrible, considering this was done in the 90's. The characters are also just not developed right, you never actually care what's going to happen to these characters. If Batman himself died I probably wouldn't give a crap, it's that bad. However, Val Kimmer as Batman is not bad, not at all. Jim Carry is well...Jim Carry. Tommy Lee Jones is a complete idiot. Not resembling Two-Face at all, and Nicole Kidman is just your cliché woman in a super-hero movie. Overall, this movie is bearable, and it's know where near the mess that was Batman and Robin, but at the end, this movie just isn't worth your time.",Batman Forever
341,stakes,good cast keeps it afloat,7,17 July 2000,"What starts off as a really promising film, ""Batman Forever"" ultimately degenerates into the campy sillyness that marred it's follower, ""Batman & Robin"".  Still, the cast fits perfectly for this movie, and their performances keep it interesting.  Val Kilmer is perfect as the stone-face, emotionless Bruce Wayne.  Nicole Kidman pulls off the sexy superhero's girlfriend role perfectly.  And the villains are great fun to watch:  Tommy Lee Jones cackles manically throughout his role as Two-Face, (remincisent of Jack Nicholson as the Joker in ""Batman"") and looks like he's having the time of his life.  Jim Carrey, meanwhile, steals the show as the nutcase Riddler, doing it as only he can.",Batman Forever
342,Matt-162,Better...but not by much,4,24 December 1998,"This installment to the Batman franchise introduces a new leading man and director. Val Kilmer proved a more physically believable Batman (with the help of a more streamlined costume)and Chris O'Donnel was a nice addition in the role of Robin. New director Joel Schumacher attempts to take the franchise in a more fun/campy direction, and succeeds in all too annoying a fashion. The storyline is confused and meandering, and the character development of Batman takes an inconsistent turn as well - Kilmer more a comedian than the melancholy character from the first two movies. In the end, the movie devolves into a high budget Jim Carrey promotion, and the rest fades into his shadow.Overall, Batman Forever is an improvement on its previous installment, but give me Burton over Schumacher anyday.",Batman Forever

344,hanifmuhammad92,the first step in the completely wrong direction.,3,26 August 2012,This movie is directed by Joel Schumacher. The first of two that have been changed completely from Tim Burton vision of Gotham city. Unfortunately Joel Schumacher changed this series for the worse instead of for the better. I applaud him for trying to make this movie different than the previous two batman films and I actually have no problem with him trying to make this movie for kids but sometimes too much is just too much. Val Kilmer is not very convincing in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman and Nicole Kidman is wasted in this movie and is merely a very pretty face. Robin was actually better handled than he could have been. Robin is not what ruined this movie. The neon lights are not what ruined this movie either. Heck even the bat nipples on the costume didn't even ruin this movie. the overall generic plot that had the potential to be interesting is what ruined this movie. instead of exploring the villains they devour the screen with their over the top silliness. Jim Carry plays the riddler like every other film he has ever been in like the mask. Jim Carry is cool but his over the top performance becomes tedious and annoying. I hated Tommy lee Jones as Two-face in this movie. More like the Joker than Harvey dent. All he does is laugh the entire time he is on screen. what a waste of a good actor. I would rather watch Tim Burton's batman over this movie any day but this movie is heaven on earth compared to the monstrosity that followed it.,Batman Forever
345,namideo,Director foils Batman's efforts to save Gotham City,4,21 August 2008,"In my opinion, this is the worst Batman movie.I'll start out with some of the positives...Val Kilmer, in many ways, is a suitable replacement for Michael Keaton. He does well as the intelligent billionaire Bruce Wayne and succeeds with a somewhat dark tone as Batman, even employing the low raspy voice in a similar manner as Keaton. Chris O'Donnell isn't a bad Robin, and in fact, made me actually like the character somewhat. Rather than being the annoying, child-like, ""boy wonder"" of the comics, he brings a sense of coolness and a rebel without a cause-like approach to the character, and it works. And he and Val work well off one another. Michael Gough returning as Alfred is also a plus.Okay, that's all the good things I have to say about it. Not much, right? The Bad...Let's discuss the villains. I can't grieve enough over Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. I like both actors in general, but I can't stand either of them in this film. It's as if they didn't even do any character research. This is the only Batman film I've seen where the villains bare hardly any resemblance to their traditional portrayals. Jim Carrey is really just being himself. He seems more like Ace Ventura dressed in green tights, while Tommy Lee Jones gives us his best Joker impression. He is a hyper-active, laughing maniac, always making a joke out of everything. Again, that's what the Joker does. Who knows? Maybe Jones would've made a convincing Joker, but it's completely unsuitable for Two-Face, who is traditionally a much more conflicted character, absent of sense of humor, cold and dark.I think the issue with the villains was derived more from this film's over-the-top approach in general. Everything is needlessly exaggerated, from the glowing batmobile to Two-Face's lair and Riddler's outer space-like gadgetry. It just doesn't seem to fit in the Batman universe.Overall, this movie has a hint of entertainment value but fails to live up to creativity and fun of it's two predecessors.",Batman Forever
346,Fred_Maxwell,What If... Tim Burton Did This One,6,1 October 2008,"So Tim Burton was a co-producer? We have just a faint whiff of what made the first two five-star features. I intend to buy this one on DVD, if only to grasp a fragment of what Batman was, and luckily the newest director, from what I've heard, has breathed more life into the franchise. I submit to you this, though... had Tim Burton directed the third movie as his last, how about Michael Keaton still as Batman, Robin Williams as the Riddler, and Billy Dee Williams, as he should've been, as Two-Face. How about, no Robin? Or Robin, if you must, in the last five minutes of the film? That version of the film still plays in my head.",Batman Forever
347,davidking,My favorite of the Batman Films,9,13 July 2001,"Batman Forever's first spoken exchange is a hilarious joke, and the filmfails to disappoint on the humor end afterward.  A cast of people withgreat skill in being funny does Batman Forever a great service in myopinion.  I loved Jim Carey's Riddler, although I've seen few otherfilms I enjoyed him in, and Tommy Lee Jones was a great pick forTwo-Face.The other big thing I liked about Batman Forever was the way thechemistry worked between the Batman and Robin.  I appreciated the waythey introduced Dick Grayson, remaining somewhat true to the comic bookseries, and the way the two actors worked together was admirable.I had a lot of fun watching Batman Forever, it included great comicrelief to break the tension in the most frightening moments.  I wouldn'tsay it is a great conversion from comics to film, but it was not badeither.",Batman Forever
348,bass-player-blues,Unfairly criticized but becoming a classic,7,13 January 2021,"Batman Forever may be the most unfairly criticzed super-hero film ever made. It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson.",Batman Forever
349,canadianfreak_17,A letdown from the original two but still decent,6,2 July 2005,"Batman Forever was the first Batman I ever saw so I really had nothing to compare it too when I first saw it in theatres on my 10th birthday :) and I loved it but you know I was young and just payed attention to the eye dazzling visuals and the comedic elements of the riddler and stuff like that. Now that I am older and have seen all of the Batman's several times I realize that Batman Forever while still decent was a major letdown from the previous two. Val Kilmer comes in and manages to pull off Batman but Bruce Wayne not so much. The chemistry with Nicole Kidman, wait a minute there was no chemistry. Nicole Kidman was awful in this movie and really was not needed. The best acting came from Jim Carrey who portrayed the insane and obsessive Edward Nygma/The Riddler but was a little over the top. Tommy Lee Jones was way over the top with his portrayal of Harvey Two Face. The show was much more lighter and humorous than the previous two but most likely because of a different directorial interpretation of Joel S. I still watch it from time to time and it keeps me entertained. Much more substance than story but still an OK watch.**1/2",Batman Forever
350,tombiddy87,Poor direction leads to failed potentials,6,21 August 2013,"Batman Forever saw Val Kilmar make his debut as the Dark Knight and also a new director as Joel Schumacher comes on board.When Warner Brothers decided to replace director Tim Burton for a more slapstick style for the third installment of the franchise, many wondered if Joel Schumacher would match the award winning Batman Returns. Sadly more question marks surrounded Batman Forever then the latest Riddler outfit.In Batman Returns we had Michelle Pfeiffer in her charismatic role as Catwoman and Danny Devito as the scheming Pengiun. Now we are supplied with a over the top performance from Jim Carrey as he takes the role of the Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones gave a creditable performance as Two-Face although you wonder if he was what character he was playing as on a few occasions he reminded you more of the Joker, although it is fair to say this was probably caused by how the film was scripted rather then a actor's input. If your looking for a non stop action entertainment flick this will not disappoint but for those who are looking for more the same of Burton's earlier work it's best you give this one a miss.",Batman Forever
351,manwithaplan42,Holy contributing to the death of Batman Batman!,4,26 May 2006,"I admit this movie is not as bad as Batman and Robin, but it sets the franchise on the slippery slope to Family B-movieville. For one thing, the movie is almost completely miscast, Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton, not pulling off the whole haunted recluse vibe as well as Keaton did. Tommy Lee Jones is not suited to the over the top villain archetype and it shows. Jim Carrey as The Riddler may seem inspired, and for a while it works, and about halfway through the movie you feel that the Riddler is wearing a bit thin. Chris O'Donnel is more of a publicity stunt, pandering to the younger audience as the sort of toughguy but also goodguy character. The only cast members that really work are Nicole Kidman, who has the perfect soothing voice and eyes that make her a very convincing love interest. And good old Michael Gough, he was always good as Alfred. In this film we can see the one liners that marred the fourth film begin to creep in, Forever walks a very fine line, and came so very close to falling on the wrong side of it.One final thing: Did we ever need Robin?",Batman Forever
352,alexis_240,"Forget quality, lets turn commercial!",2,7 October 2006,"Batman forever could be called a thrill ride but it's not even worthy of standing next to the first two movies. Batman and Batman returns gave us complex villains who had a reason for doing what they did e.g. the Joker a psychotic criminal being deformed after having fallen in acid takes his anger out on the city of Gotham. What does Harvey two face have against Gotham apart from his grudge with Batman? But of course, lets give the audience some action and they'll forget all about the plot hole.Secondly Joel has been called a visual director but oh! brother what did Gotham city ever do to him to make him turn it into a wonderland? The colors added to the city are not at all atmospheric neither do they correspond to the Batman legacy. Gotham is supposed to be a city ravaged by crime that needs Batman. Where does a theme park look fit into all this?The characters are not better of. In the first few minutes we are introduced to probably the horniest or most desperate kind of female character I've ever seen depicted on screen: Dr Chase Meridian. ""Hot entrance"" she says with a dropping jaw and Batman (no offense but the bat suit turns out to be too big for Val!)responds! How about that! Suddenly it's I am out to fight some bad guys but I'll look around for some dames too. Recall a similar scene from Batman returns: Catwoman saying something like the great Batman we meet at last?. Batman does not answer he simply walks away. He is a masked crusader without a love life.That's Bruce Wayne's area. It's amazing how one little line can spoil something so much.The Robin character and the Riddler are equally badly and shallowly written. If the studio was aiming for a lighter Batman then I am all for it but for God's sake do not turn it into a popcorn trashy entertainment piece of junk.A good and deep story will always be appreciated a lot more than a bunch of colors cool cars and battles. Finally I feel that I need to congratulate Joel for topping his bad Batman movie with an even worse one answering to the name of Batman and Robin. Critics thought that Batman forever was a fatal blow to the franchise but oh boy they had another thing coming!",Batman Forever
353,haxleyandrew,"Batman Forever is a great film, Great plot, And better story,",10,5 February 2012,"When i had exceptions to see a Batman flick. I wanted to but that awful Batman & Robin franchise which was ruined by Joel Schumacher was not my favorite anymore. Despite the certain changes and lame dialoge in it. But when i had a chance. I saw Batman Forever with my sister and it was awesome.Batman Forever is a completely different Batman film not because of the way it's made or designed. But because of the way there is no jokes involved and of course how good it really is. But the way Joel Schumacher did this movie is great. I give him praise and respect for being a great director. Plus the script as i would say would count at least for this film too.But most importantly we have both new villains here and one is The Riddler played by (Jim Carrey) and the other is Two-Face played by (Tommy Lee Jones) and next we have Batman played by (Val Kilmer) and of course Robin played by (Chris O' Donnell) Of course Val Kilmer is better then George Clooney was in Batman & Robin. And who could forget that actor anyways. Trying to be better then Val Kilmer. Well i have 2 words for George Clooney, He is not better, Nor does his performance entertain. It's horrible and because Val Kilmer is better then him I'm not gonna talk about George Clooney anymore or Batgirl for that matter.The Riddler and Two-Face are loose in Gotham City. Batman and his sidekick Robin must stop them before they escape. However The Riddler is obsessed with riddles and Two-Face must exact his revenge on the city. With their plans and challenges for the heroes Batman and Robin. Nothing is gonna stop them and they will make both heroes pay.This film's special effects are awesome, A lot of times we don't get to see what actually happens. But then there is something going on. And the CGI was awesome too like in the fight scenes which totally makes this film a great film in my case. So apparently nothing is missing from the effects so it's all good. Because i like it that way.Two-Face played by Tommy Lee Jones in this film is scary, Yet violent, In this film he deals with both justice and revenge against the boy wonder and in a way. Robin the boy wonder wants his revenge on Two-Face but yet confusing here is that Two-Face has henchmen at his side who wear the same red and black Two-Face masks. I don't get it. Does it simply mean that they were burned or did they really have to wear them. Also why do they use guns that look like lazers. I don't get this either, Is it like they could zap someone with them like Batman or the boy wonder Robin. Because that is some evil henchmen that Two-Face has got.Also The Riddler played by Jim Carrey is indeed among funny. He has starred in movies like Ace Ventura Pet Detective, The Truman Show, And many more of his films. He recently did a good job in Batman Returns because he would always give people riddles and questions about how evil he is and what he's thinking. So he is smart and he does want to get rid of Batman in order to become evil. But what will it take him and why. That's only up to someone to decide weather his plan will be put into action or not. But still it's amazing too.Also this film has funny scenes all throughout it. Like some where Batman is taking out the bad guys and also hurting the henchman is amazing and is something to laugh at.Also if you are a fan then get Batman Forever, A great film for the Budget! Yet this is the best Batman film out there from Joel Schumacher and better then Batman & Robin. A great storyline, Plot, And concept makes this the ultimate film to see of all time.",Batman Forever
354,tbuchalski,"Batman Forever: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",7,25 May 2019,"The Good:
Schumacher hits on something that Christopher Nolan prioritized with his films that injects some realism in an otherwise overly stylized film trying to hard to shed the dark tone of the Burton films and refocus on the aesthetic of the lighter tone comics, and tv and movie appearances that came in the 60's and before. More exterior location shots appear in favor of the nearly exclusive use of sound stages in Batman and Batman Returns. In taking the film out of the studio for small bits here and there and into the real world Schumacher reminds us of the outside world, and posits briefly that Batman could exist in that world alongside us. That is, rather than in the excessively ordained and colorful world of the film when Bruce Wayne puts on the mask and we're drawn back into the Expressionistic production design still popular for these films through the shift in directorial talent.The Bad:
Above all else Batman is an action hero. He doesn't have the alien biology granting him super powers. He hasn't been infected by some chemical or radioactive element that enhances his ordinary abilities to superhuman status. He is a well trained and highly educated warrior that relies on his physicality to accomplish his goals. His films should reflect this in their focus on the action set pieces by showcasing well-choreographed fight sequences, seamlessly staged car chases, and special effects that leave the audience in awe as they conclude and the story resets for the next stanza. This film poorly puts together a story that moves from one dangerous predicament to the next. And, the action awkwardly connects to the narrative that is, on its own, poorly conceived. In shedding the darkness of Tim Burton's earlier Batman films Schumacher's first iteration concerns itself more with visual titillation than with an exciting story that makes sense.The Ugly:
It's difficult to land on a film that does it better than this one because there aren't many other films, if any, with similar content, tone, or intent. There are, however, several super-hero films serving as the third installment of a series on a particular hero, or hero groups. The various films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that fit that category fail because they rely too much on their interconnectivity to one another, and by telling partial stories to be concluded later. They fail in that they draw audiences based on some false sense that you can't miss one or you've somehow missed them all. In the end the film that does it best, is Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Paling in comparison to its direct predecessor The Dark Knight (2008) it does what Batman Forever could not. It tells a more cohesive story.

So I'm just going to cut to this one, I do looks at this particular film quite interesting which lead to me wanting to talk about it. This film, eh. As just a movie, it well entertaining, got ton of mostly great action, a decent story, and overall just a good flick, but all of that makes this movie's score completely boiled down by the fact it's a batman film, as being a PG-13 rated film like the first two, but with a whole different director (Joel Schumacher) and a new style, it just easily ruins some things here and there, but yet at the same time there are some general praises I'll give to this film.Basically there much to say about the story that there's a new villain in Gotham, calling himself Two-Face, who use to be a District Attorney named Harvey Dent, who just basically causing chaos in Gotham, for pretty much no reason, I guess Insanity, and of-course it up for Batman to stop this like always. Meanwhile, there's what will eventually be another new villain, Dr. Edward Nygma, is on a revengeful mission I guess, by completing ending-up losing his mind, and then became the ""Riddler"" and decide to joined Two-Face's range of terror in Gotham, as like his partner-in-crime, and it up for Batman, and eventually later, Robin, to stop these Lunatics. Yeah, it basically that.I really to start this off with the Characters by talking about Two-Face, who I really despises the most about this movie. Now Two-Face is one of my favorite batman villains, just his concept I always seems to like, and he's actually one of my favorite characters from the Animated Series, due to the fact he was just a deeply emotional character. Here however, he not that Emotional, and he's basically like some Joker knock-off, it just pretty much ruins his character. He showed acting like a Idiot, which is nothing like Two-Face from the comics or the cartoon was even like, he was more intelligent than this. There one scene in particular, that totally makes me just disappointed with how they made him in this, he flip his coin, gotten to the normal side, and decide to flip it again to the mess-up side, just what the hell, he already made-up his FREAKING MIND!!! I thought the decide of his burned face was just sloppy, like they hired some bum who is a terrible artist and being the lazy low-life he is, just butchered it. Riddler on the other hand, I honestly kinda like in this movie, I totally think he would be this fun anyways, like I like the fact they turn him into like how you imagined a Psycho would be like, laughing insanely, all of this world he developing it just great, going back to how this is fun to watch as just a film, not a batman film, this is one of the reason, and I thought comedy legend Jim Carrey, did a well-done job, I love his first scene in this film as just blain Edward Nygma, just a good emotion he shows, better than how Two-Face is seen, my god. Batman I thought was kinda okay in this, now I like they kinda at least tries their best at making Batman kinda of a menacing guy to Criminals, and they did their best, so does Val Kilmer, but he's no Michael Kenton, I like however they actually made a better batman costume than the one in the first two, because it was just might been hard to even moved that around if you can only imagined, especially in Action scenes, but here they finally put acts together and decide to made a brand new with better speed with it, although I'm not really a big fan of the suit shown at the end of the movie, which was just unnecessary. Robin in this movie, I don't know why they could've cast a much younger, like a actual teenager, it not like Chris O'Donnell did a terrible job here, it just makes more sense that they could've cast someone younger, one big reason is that Bruce Wayne adopted him after his parents dies, which is weird because he looks about in his 20s, but oh-well. His origin story was kinda good in this, I was glad they didn't butchered him here either, well until the next movie. And last and not least, the sexy criminal Psychiatrist, Chase Meridian, played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. Now I found more of a interesting love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne than Nicki Vale from the first movie, despite she was well-attractive. It just about Meridian's personality and her relationship with Bruce Wayne and Batman was just amusing and at the same time interesting to see.So overall, as there quite a-bit of problems like the new design of Gotham, boy don't get me started, all I'm going to say it just not fitting to the name, and yeah, but I said its an entertaining film, but as a batman movie, no. So if you want to entertain yourself with something, like maybe a guilty pressure, I would recommend you checking this out, but if you want to see a good well-done Batman movie, stay away from this.",Batman Forever
356,ByeTillNextTime,The Dark Knight Eternal,3,10 November 2021,"Joel Schumacher had very large shoes to fill and he failed miserably.Nominally a continuation of the two Burton movies, Michael Gough and Pat Hingle reprise their roles as Alfred and Gordon.Hypothetical question, if Gary Oldman were to play Gordon again in some future DC movie, would that make it a continuation of the Nolan Batman movies? Yeah, didn't think so.For all intent and purposes, Batman Forever is a ""soft"" reboot, before such a term was invented. A godawful reboot, but a reboot nonetheless.This is a micro-managed product where the director is just there to nod and say ""Yes"" to every studio demand.Two-Face and The Riddler are like: SOMEBODY STOP US!!!Tommy Lee ""Why did I sign up for this?"" Jones has such contempt for the material he was given to work with and for his co-star Jim Carrey, that you can tell he'd rather be somewhere else. The famous story of Jones being so annoyed by Carrey's antics and his inability to sanction Carrey's buffoonery is on glorious display. Jones opts for the ""If you can't beat them, join them"" approach. He tries his very best (or worst, depending how you look at it.) to outham Carrey in every scene they're together.Jim ""Are we filming The Mask 2?"" Carrey is there to entertain the kids with his shenanigans.Val ""I'm just here for the paycheck"" Kilmer is phoning it in. He looks utterly bored with everything that's happening.Chris ""I will be a huge Hollywood star"" O'Donnell tries to add some depth to his character, but the script isn't giving him much help.Nicole ""I totally don't look like a live action Jessica Rabbit"" Kidman is nothing more than eye candy and hey, I'm not complaining.The audience liked all the zany over-the-top performances and humour and in 1997 they were given more of the same.",Batman Forever
357,teppo-2,"After dark, there comes light...",4,7 October 2008,"And sadly, that's not always a good thing, such as in the transition from Batman and Batman Returns to Batman Forever. Having watched the first two just the previous day, this third movie simply doesn't match up to them in any way.They've gone more the comedy route this time around more than anything else. Unfortunately, it feels more like a bad parody. And while Burton's Batmans were visual masterpieces with a soundtrack to match and an uncanny intense feel to them that kept you glued to the screen, Schumacher's go at it is shallow and uninspired both visually (the city, the way it's directed, everything) and music-wise, and makes you think your time would be better spent doing something else.Also, despite numerous quite respected and popular actors, the acting just feels off. It's probably just due to the whole trying-to-be-funny- but-is-not-even-close thing that's going on. I've never been a fan of Jim Carrey, his performances are too often one-trick ponies, and that can be said of this one. Even worse, there's nothing about Jones as Two- Face that would be any better. And that's not even the end of it - I just don't feel the chemistry between Kidman and Kilmer. The romances weren't the strong part of the earlier movies either, but when nothing else works (hell, even the new Batsuit sucks), one would hope that even this one thing would've. Kilmer comes out as more of a ""Playbat"" than Batman, and more Kidman as a pushy vixen, though thankfully less so as the movie progresses.The whole dark fairy-tale kind of feel was what made Burton's Batmans as good as they were. It was simply art-like in its style, all-around. There's not many movies I'd use the term ""art piece"" of, but Burton's Batmans qualify. The drastic change seen in this movie is definitely a step in the waaay wrong direction. Granted, the fourth movie is even worse, but that doesn't excuse this one. I think the error was realized later on and thus Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are again indeed dark in theme and style, even though in a different way than Burton's movies.It just feels this third movie was made with dollar-signs clouding any and all judgment. There's just no heart in this movie. Overall - there's something to be said about Bats being creatures of the night and dark, not clowny performers in a neon-colored circus.",Batman Forever

The series got even worse after this film (Batman and Robin was atrocious) but this film was really bad itself. A stupid story, dumb characters doing dumb things, hammy over acting, stupid direction, awful writing. This movie stinks.",Batman Forever
359,CrowBat2005,Give Some Attention,8,6 August 2005,"When I saw the 5 out of 10 stars for this movie on this website, my jaw dropped. In MY opinion, this is my favorite Batman movie. Val Kilmer definitely needed more soul for the film (but in his defense, he was OK), but besides that, the villains were top notch. Tommy Lee Jones really played with insanity in an almost Nicholson way. No one can replace The Joker, however. I've loved this movie ever since I was young and I feel I must defend it. There's so much intrigue, darkness, and imagination to be taken into consideration. This movie really has the Batman feel. It may not be as great as ""Batman Begins"" (which I've yet to see), but it really has heart that needs attention. For those who haven't seen it, I hope you're not disappointed.

360,skyblueangel-1,It's Batman! Forever!,8,12 July 2005,"Finally! Batman done almost right!!! Starting with the action right off. Val Kilmer was a great Batman, and was better at pulling the handsome, billionaire, playboy role off. Although, I didn't like how he fell for another weak woman in this one. What was the whole point of the Dr. Chase thing? It seemed to me that Batman had the whole Two-Face psychology thing covered. That was so obvious right from the start.Tommy Lee Jones was a perfect Two-Face. He really pulled off the altar-ego thing real well. And, Jim Carey as the Riddler!!! Don't even get me started.... He was great!!! Jim Carey was born to play the Riddler! Hello! He brings in the quirky lines (ie- ""Tell the Fat Lady... She's on in five."") and the hilarious attitude (ie- the baseball thing in the bat cave) that makes him perfect as the Riddler.In fact, everyone cashed in on the funny puns. Batman's smile as he leaves the doctor's balcony is awesome and his ""Try firemen, less to take off"" kind of quick one-liners were good.The only thing wrong with this Batman, aside from the Dr. Chase stuff, was the Robin stuff. I dying to know, ""Why the heck does Batman need a 'partner'?"" A butler, yes. A sidekick, maybe when he gets older. But, a partner!!! Why the frump is Batman, one of the greatest heroes of all time, the Dark Kinght, the Winged Avenger, the Protector of Gotham, reduced to needing a 'partner'??? I just can't comprehend it...Otherwise, it's an all around good movie.Batman, Forever! And Robin, Never!",Batman Forever

362,xguy8,For shame: The Worst Comic Book movie ever,1,8 September 2002,"I actually dislike this even more than ""Batman and Robin"" to be honest. Everything with this movie is wrong...Before I start ripping it, I'll say that Nicole Kidman looks as hot as ever in this and it's too bad Val Kilmer couldn't play Batman in a good Batman movie because for all the problems this movie has,he actually does make a good Batman. It's also a shame that 2 really great songs (Seal's ""Kiss From a Rose"" and U2's ""Hold Me,Kiss Me,Thrill Me,Kill Me"") couldn't be on soundtracks of better, more deserving movies.What's wrong with this movie? Plot,casting of villains,production design,and the details.I have no idea what the hell this movie is about! The Riddler has some TV thingie that sucks brain waves? What the bloodly hell is that about??????? And one thing that bothered me is that Two-Face AND the Riddler are always trying to be played for laughs...it's just stupid, and never do I take the Riddler and Two-Face seriously or see them as threating.All the sets look like night clubs,neon lights and all...The problem with the first 2 Batman movies is that there is no color.The problem with the next 2 Batman movies is that they O.D. on color! Why not just make Gothum look like a normal big city? Tommy Lee Jones should of done better here,but he quite frankly sucks as Two-Face.But what REALLY bothers me here is Jim Carrey as the Riddler.It's not that I don't like Jim,it's because I love him. Jim should never,never,EVER play the villian again.I love Jim in ""The Mask"", ""The Grinch"",""Dumb and Dumber"",the ""Ace Ventura"" movies and I even like his dramatic work in ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic"". This and ""The Cable Guy"" are the 2 movies with him I can't bare to watch.The Riddler should of been weird, psycho and a creepy villain, (much like Two-Face should of been menacing),but Jim tries to do that and still be funny,and it just fails hugely...and it doesn't really matter anyway because even if he did a good job here,it doesn't matter because I don't want him to play the heavy.Jim Carrey has no business in this movie.Someone around the lines of Edward Norton would of done better.This movie is a flat out disaster,and by the end I just don't care.

For a mega-budgeted,Warner Bros. production,you'd think they could whip up some better effects than the ones they did here. They look cheesy and fake...there are plenty of great movies that have great special effects,there are some bad movies with great special effects,and there are some great movies with sub-par special effects.

364,rockdude,Why oh why did they let Schumacher at Batman?,5,11 May 2003,"This film has singlehandedly destroyed the Batman movie franchise for any serious fan. Tim Burton's films retained the intrinsic darkness and Gothic setting that Batman needs to make any sense. The film is cartoony; perhaps suitable for a lighter movie on a character such as Superman or Wonder Woman but completely wrong for Batman. Deconstructing Batman/Bruce Wayne psychologically makes no sense when all that epitomised Batman has been removed. The villains are ridiculously overplayed as the kind of dancing villain you might see in a kiddie's TV show. Two-Face (played by a woefully miscast Tommy Lee Jones) is so departed from his comic-book character as to be unrecognisable. He flips the coin until he gets the result he wants instead of following blindly the coin's ""decision"". Batman is now Val Kilmer, who doesn't nearly fill Michael Keaton's armoured boots. The plot is so contrived as to be ridiculous.
The Riddler (played wonderfully by Jim Carrey) is perhaps the only good thing about this film but that's not saying much. When you consider that we have seen Jack Nicholson's maniacal Joker, Danny DeVito's calculating Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's sultry Catwoman, you see that the calibre of villains has taken as much of a nosedive as the setting and the scripts.Overall, I did enjoy this film as light entertainment not intended to provoke any kind of thought in the viewer (what can I say, I'm easily pleased) but cannot bring myself to call it a good film. As a fan of the comic-book Batman I simply can't imagine how Schumacher managed to get away with this travesty.For someone who knows nothing of Batman and enjoys a film with action, bright costumes and hammed-up villains, this film is perfect. To anyone else, especially anyone who knows anything of Batman or enjoyed the first two films, STAY AWAY.",Batman Forever
365,davidrulesyou,The Joel Schmacher era,5,17 March 2009,"I watched this film today and I thought it was good, but nothing like the two previous ones (the ones directed by Tim Burton).Joel Schumacher has taken over from Burton for the director's chair (although Burton did produce this movie). It's a bit of a shame that Schumacher was taking this into the campy direction of the 1960s TV show (although I happen to like that TV show). Val Kilmer also did a good job on playing Batman/Bruce Wayne, but I have to admit his performance was nowhere near the way Michael Keaton portrayed him.I also thought Chris O'Donnell did a good job playing Robin as well. I liked that scene where he fought all those bad guys out in the street when they were picking on a girl. I also thought Nicole Kidman looked great in her role as Dr. Chase Meridian, and Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey did good in their roles (as Two-Face and The Riddler) as well.Not as good as the two directed by Tim Burton, I rate this 5 out of 10. I'll be watching the next movie Batman & Robin some day later as part of my opinions on the Batman movies.",Batman Forever

I grew up watching this wacky Batman film. Jim Carrey provides an awesome performance as my favorite Batman villain, The Riddler. It is Jim Carrey that keeps me interested in this film today. Jim Carrey was channeling the late Frank Gorshin here and it worked.Along with Jim Carrey the other cast was also good, but none were used to their full potential. Tommy Lee Jones fit the image of Two-Face great, but having Two-Face crack jokes and go crazy made him feel more like Cesar Romero's Joker rather than Two-Face. Tommy Lee Jones and Two-Face were completely wasted here. Val Kilmer was a good Bruce Wayne/Batman. Kilmer did well with what he was given. Chris O' Donnell as Robin wasn't too bad. Nicole Kidman is great but her talent was wasted here as Dr. Chase Miridian. Seeing her make a move on Batman throughout the film was just disgusting. Instead of rubbing Bat nipples she should have been used to play a more likable and more fleshed out Dr. Chase Miridian. She could have been great! Batman Forever had amazing cinematography and the music score was awesome. It's art style and colors and it's larger than life sets were so great! If for nothing else you could watch this movie for the eye candy and fantastic special effects. Batman Forever also has my favorite Batman costume. The costume is very cool looking and it appears to be easier to work in than the ones in Batman and Batman Returns. I also love the fight choreography in Batman Forever. The fights here are a huge improvement over the fights in the first two. The plot for Batman Forever was nothing special. I used to think it was the best thing ever but now I look back on it and it really isn't. There are a few ideas in this movie that are never expanded upon such as Bruce Wayne's psyche and Dr. Chase Miridian's character. We get hints of what's going on in Bruce Wayne's head and how his parents death effected him, but it really didn't lead to anything big. Dr. Chase Miridian could have been an interesting character but instead ends up being nothing much more than a bad romantic interest and damsel in distress. I also think The Riddler and Two-Face could have had some more fleshing out, but at least The Riddler had a bit of character development. Looking back at Batman Forever it's got problems and it's even boring at times. It's just not as awesome as it was when I was a kid. The thing is though Batman Forever is good fun. People complain that it is too campy and that it got away from the dark tone of the first two movies, but personally I like what the writers and Joel Schumacher was going for here. They were obviously going for a more 50's/60's style Batman where anything can happen and everything is colorful and fun. Batman Forever is just one of those movies that is far from great but is still a good piece of entertainment. I still love Batman Forever and I always will.",Batman Forever
367,askewglasses,Forever a Failure,1,14 June 2012,"I have a major bug with this movie. And here the seven main reasons i dislike this movie. First, Kilmer, he's okay as Bruce Wayne but I can't see him as Batman. Second, the score, from a musicians point of view the score by Danny Elfman from the first two films is well blatantly, music to my ears. Here its boring, forgettable, and filled with too many cartoon sound effects. Third, the Batmobile, it looks like a roller-skate. Fourth, Two-Face, boy is this performance bad. Two-Face is supposed to be a depressing tragedy of a mans life. This is just a joke. Fifth, The Riddler, one of my all time favourite Batman villains, and Jim Carrey ruins him by playing Jim Carrey which is good for some movies but not Batman. Sixth, Robin, again another character study full of tragedy, but he's too old and bland. Seventh, Gotham, it's too bright and cheery, and what's with all the giant statues around? It hate this movie even more than the next one. It ruined the series and led to the disgrace of it. Don't watch this and save yourself 2 hours of your life.",Batman Forever

369,iam_moriya,Schumacher on Batman,3,6 August 2007,"I've decided to give you mine opinion on all the old Batman movies. Starting with Batman from 1989 and ending with Batman & Robin.After Burton left the franchisee Joel Schumacher got to direct the third movie. Gone is Keaton as Batman and he has been replaced by Val Kilmer. The villains of this new movie are Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, a very scary character. While in the comics he is a tormented soul fighting with his dark personality here is a totally mind blowing evil villain. Jim Carrey as the Riddler is a great performance. Gone is the boring suit and instead he wears a real villain costume. Batman also get's some help from Dick Grayson, aka Robin. Played brilliant by Chris O'Donnell. Schumacher version of Batman is more action and one of the greatest comic book movies ever made.And for those of you who didn't realize it I was being sarcastic.Two-Face is one of Batmans best villain, but here he is nothing but a lousy clown. Gone is the tormented Harvey Dent that blindly obeys his coins every decision and instead we get corny bad guy who doesn't take anything serious. The other character Joel destroys is Riddler. Carrey runs around being very annoying. Sure, he gets a few laughs here and there but I think Jim went over the top with this one. Oh, and I forgot the worst part: He is wearing a f-cking pajamas. Neither Two-Face nor Riddler seem like a threat to Batman so there is no need for him to have Robin by his side. Who is, by the way, awful. Read Jeph Loebs ""Dark Victory"" or watch the animated series episode Robin's Reconning instead. There is a good origin story for Dick Grayson. And now we'll have a look at what Joel did to our beloved Batman. Let's see. He put nipples on the batsuit. Further words are a waste of time.Schumacher shouldn't be allowed near Batman for any reason at all. This movie isn't worth your money or your time. During it's better moments it's like watching the old Batman series (with Adam West), just as ridiculous. A sad excuse for a movie. Still, it could be worse.

The acting is forced.  The directing...Joel Schumacher isn't really a director - he is (literally) a set decorator, which is why Warner Bros. loves him so much... he makes the sets look good.There's too much of a reliance upon special effects in the movie, and not enough on plot and character... this is an unfortunate Hollywood mistake, where they believe that for some odd reason, F/X do more for a movie than plot and character ever will.  F/X can *enhance* a movie when it has good plot, story, and characters... but F/X alone cannot make a good movie.Camera work in this is poor - odd angles, dark shots.  Poor scripting - character's lines sound like they're being read right off the page, not acted.Carrey and O'Donnell are probably the two best parts in this movie... both Kilmer and Jones come across as very wooden, very stiff... uninteresting.

But this installment in the Batman Film Series that began with the Tim Burton Film from 1989 and working it's way up to when the Christopher Nolan Series started was questionable for me at first.Val Kilmer, Tommy Jones, and Jim Carrey all come together in this film in 1995 to bring us something new to the Live-Action fil series that somehow did impressively well during the 90's. But of course, 2 years would pass, and we'd lose almost all hope in Live-Action Batman films, thanks to George Clooney.

373,Diamond_Dog7,Bye bye Burton....Hello Schumacher.,8,8 February 2011,"Batman Forever. Personally, i don't like this title. Sounds...well....crap, and lame to be honest. Sounds like a kids movie. And guess what, it IS a kids movie. Before i lay into this film, I did find it entertaining. Both as a kid, and as an adult. But i didn't like it as a Batman film. It just doesn't capture the essence of what Burton created. In fact, it completely ignores it. It acts as more of a re-boot in a way. But the bottom line, its entertaining. Thats all that saves this.I don't understand why they got rid of Burton. His vision of Batman was brilliant. I also don't understand why they chose Joel Schumacher as his replacement. And i don't understand why they ruined a tremendous character in Two-Face. And I don't understand why.....you get the picture. Val Kilmer. Great actor. See The Doors for his best performance. See Batman Forever for his, well, not as good performance. Don't get me wrong, he was a good Batman. He's no Keaton, but he did well with what he had to work with. But none of the actors really shone in this. Nothing shone in this. Except the flashy neon signs in an equally flashy Gotham City. So, Schumacher thought, ""Ok i'm making a Batman film. Great. But how do i ruin it? I know, i'll put nipples on the suit. Yeah that'll do it. Oooh, and i'll make Two-Face a cheap Joker rip off. I know, i'll get Jim Carrey to dress in spandex and dance around and basically be...Jim Carrey. Oooooh, i'll also include a stupid sub-plot love story. I think thats it, i'll save my other ideas for the next one. Right, lets film!"" So they filmed. And here it is. Two-Face is a great, tragic character. Who rose to greatness, and then fell to tragedy. He isn't in this. He's a laughy stupid gimmicky character. Who jumps around in hysterics whenever there's an explosion. He's after revenge against Batman, because...well... no idea why. Batman didn't really do anything. So anyway, he teams up with The Riddler, who wants revenge against Bruce Wayne, because....he got fired from his company. How pathetic. Carrey and Tommy wasted their talents on this film. As did Kilmer, O'Donnell, Kidman, etc. Furthermore, Riddler aims to be the smartest man in the world by sucking up everyones brainwaves. (Cringe.) Anyhow, Batman must save the day. With a sidekick...Robin! I'm not a big fan of Robin. But i think the way they worked him into the film was pretty good. He's a young, troubled man who wants revenge. He's someone who Bruce can relate to. And tries to save Dick Grayson from choosing the path he chose, as during the film, he starts to regret, and wants a normal life. Which is another OKish moment in the film. I suppose.Overall, this film isn't particularly great. And i gave it a 6 mainly because i feel nostalgic when i see it. And its also entertaining. I wasn't bored when i watched it, then, or now. But I'll repeat what i said, I don't like it as a Batman film. You want Batman, check out the first one. That IS Batman.",Batman Forever

I swear, only in ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" is he any worse.  He seems like he's half asleep in this movie.They pretty much threw out anything that made the Tim Burton Batman movies worth watching.  It's the silliness of a cartoon without any of its redeeming features.Only thing that makes this movie worth watching (and why I have it a 2, instead of a 1) is Jim Carrey.  Jim Carrey is a constant over-the-top living cartoon, but as the Riddler, that works.  Quite entertaining to see.  He utters his best line in any movie role he ever had here, ""Was that over the top?  I can never tell.""  If that's not a perfect summanry of Jim Carrey's entire acting career, I don't know what is.",Batman Forever

Gone is the completely dark Micheal Keaton Batman, and in comes Val Kilmer who, as Keaton did, provides a great Bruce Wayne, but isn't a good Batman.One of the main reasons I like this movie so much is Batman is finally a hero. He seems more heroic. The fighting is more outrageous but fun. Also I think Jim Carrey is the greatest of Batman's villains. Sure he steals the screen from Batman every time but still, I liked it. Besides Carrey, I was finally relieved to see Bruce Wayne and Batman be the main characters of this film and let the villains take the side stories.The biggest problem with this movie is Robin....I HATE ROBIN!!! I don't always. The comics I really enjoy him being there to back Batman up. Does anyone else notice he just gets Batman into more trouble? It's pointless to let Robin into the live action series because he takes some of the spotlight off of Batman/Bruce and bores me with his story.",Batman Forever

Val Kilmer brought heaviness to the character, Chris O' Donnel brought lightness to that. Jim Carrey at times really over did the campy, circus like jokes. But he has some impressive acting moments in the movie. Nicole Kidman is beautiful and charismatic. However, Tommy Lee Jones was insufferable for me and annoying. His Harvey Dent/Two-face is unacceptable. Which is why at times The Riddler takes over him.

381,timbasa77,"Unfairly panned, given the film's intent",8,27 July 2008,"It is quite simply wrong to fault this movie for a lack of fidelity to the comics. As painful as it may be for Bat devotees to admit, there was a very long period in which Bill Finger's bat stories were as light, saccharine, and improbable as the most egregious of the live action series' offerings. This film, with its gaudy set-pieces and over-the-top deathtraps, complete with choreography so telegraphed and exaggerated as to eliminate all sense of danger and tension in favor of good old spectacle, pays a perhaps even too respectful homage to these simpler days of bat-lore. If anything, Batman and Robin is the more faithful of the Schumacher films, though far more sloppy in its execution. Even though the overall tone of the film is strictly for the kiddies, for which one cannot fault the piece coming as it did after the sadistically macabre Batman Returns, Schumacher's only worthy effort in the Bat series manages to offer some meat for the adults. Bruce's psychological dilemma is handled more effectively than it ever had been for the screen, thanks in large part to Kilmer's excellent understated performance. The kiddies were no doubt willing to dismiss him in favor of the flashier performances, coming quite delightfully from Jim Carrey and less so from Tommy Lee Jones, who is obviously just trying to maintain the little ones' attention. Carrey warrants praise for the sheer gusto of his performance, even if it never even comes close to making any kind of sense in terms of characterization. Kilmer's dark corner of the movie almost seems tonally out of place in blaring neon light of the popcorn entertainment Warner Brothers intended. Still it remains as the only performance one can truly call an effective portrayal of Bruce Wayne/ Batman this side of Christian Bale. Nicole Kidman is sexy, but little else as the irksomely unprofessional psychiatrist who is Bruce's obligatory love interest. Chris O'Donnell hardly embarrasses himself, despite his dialogue's best intentions (Holy Rusted Metal Batman? More like holy jarringly awful punchline.) Among the supporting cast, only Michael Gough's warm, sardonic butler and Drew Barrymore's sumptuous good looks are worthy of any note. The film's true stars are the stunning production design, which revels in its bloated, blaring, busy style, daring your eye to rest for even a second, the special effects, and the welcome out of place performance from an actor incapable of succumbing to the gleeful idiocy around him. Leave your brain as far from potential contact with the rest of your body as possible, but maintain hope for at least one effective performance.",Batman Forever
382,bendy392,"Riddle me this, riddle me that. Was it really that bad?",6,14 October 2014,"After the success of Batman Returns, there were repercussions for it. BIG repercussions. Batman Returns was criticized for being overly dark and depressing, which upset many parents, in contrast to the first '89 film. Warner Bros. wasn't satisfied with having Batman being in a mature rated atmosphere and wanted a much lighter film. So, they kicked Tim Burton out and had another director to hold the reins for the next film, Joel Schumacher. Schumacher was set to direct Batman Forever, while Burton was demoted as just a producer. So, with the changes, how did the movie hold up? Audiences saw that it was a big step backwards from the dark and complex Batman that Burton captured and reduced to a more kid friendly version. As for meeeeyeah, it's corny and cheesy, buton the other hand, there's some REALLY good things about it.So, what's the story? Batman, played by Val Kilmer, returns to fight crime in Gotham City once again. The mastermind this time is Two- Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Eventually, a man named Edward Nigma becomes the The Riddler, who teams up Two-Face to bring down the dark knight. Meanwhile, a young man's parents are murdered by Two-Face and seeks help from Batman to hunt down and kill Two-Face for retribution and he eventually becomes Robin. Meanwhile, there's a female criminal psychologist who wants to get in Bruce's head as well as his pants.Yeah, sounds like a lot going on, doesn't it? Well, on the other hand, I do give credit that this film really dives into the psychology of Batman and how much effect it's had on our tortured hero. I like the talk that Bruce gives to Dick about revenge being the wrong path and how messed up he'll be if he kills Two-Face. That's another fascinating thing about this movie. The psychology is more drawn out. The other two films left it to mystery, but this one makes it fully realized. That and it shows more about Bruce's past as if our hero's journey comes full circle of why who he is today. Also, Batman actually comes closer to defeat than the other previous movies! So yeah, I think that was really interesting.Buuut, yeah it does have the problems everyone's talking about. Like, yeah Two-Face being a Joker wannabe is stupid. The Riddler being played by Jim Carrey is exactly what you would expect. Batman having rubber nipples on the suit, yeah that was odd. The fact that there's no connection to the first two movies is REALLY distracting and the fact that Catwoman makes NO appearance, despite that ""sequel friendly"" ending from Returns. I also miss the Danny Elfman theme. And I think the biggest change overall is the atmosphere of Gotham City. In the first two movies, the setting was perfect. Gotham City was dark, gloomy and depressing like. Tim Burton was excellent at making settings like that. That's why it was perfect because Gotham is meant to be like that! Here, it's like Las Vegas, having neon lights everywhere and being colorful instead of being all 1940's style getup. Hell, even the gangsters are wearing glow in the dark war paint! kay?So yeah, this review is kind of all over the place, but that's what I really thought of it. I guess you could say I have a soft spot for it. Yeah, it's unbelievably stupid at times, but the good stuff is REALLY good. The dark and slow moments kept me interested and I wanted to know more about it. While it's not as good as the previous two, I'd say give it a viewing and judge it for yourself.",Batman Forever

Two face should been done better though. Two face should have talked to himself like in the comics. Tommy lee Jones probably should not have played him either. Michael Douglas or Roberty Deniro would have been a better Twoface i think. Batman is the best and then probably batman returns. They never explained what happened to catwomen they should have.

385,nik963,No No No No No!,1,30 July 2008,"No wonder Batman did not resurface for 8 years. Batman Forever and Batman and Robin are so bad it's laughable.The worst thing about Forever is that Tim Burton was producing. Batman and Returns are fine films with good acting, action and real story that connect with the audience. As for this rubbish there is nothing. Joel Schumacher directed tight and tense movies like Falling Down and Phonebooth so where did it go wrong? Lets begin...For starters Val Kilmer. Why? Terrible feminine jaw and lips, no mystery or darkness whatsoever. Michael Keaton and Christian Bale wipe the floor with him. He has no charisma and is totally miscast. As for Michael Gough (Alfred) lets just say Michael Caine is preferable. It gets worse though, Jim Carrey is okay at first as the Riddler but then descends into OTT syndrome. As does Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face. Both become laughable and moronic as they try to out-do each other in overacting. They fall into caricatures after awhile and the strange homoerotic tension between them only adds to the farce. I assume they are meant to strike fear into the viewer but they just irritate. Plus Two Face is just one face as he seems to lack any sort of good in him. Keep an eye out for the comical altercation which caused his facial disfigurement. Oh and the costumes are just awful, tight green lycra covered in question marks? Wrong, wrong wrong!Nicole Kidman sexes things up a little (surprisingly). She sizzles and is the only thing good about this movie. Drew Barrymore embarrasses herself by playing a pointless role.The real reason for the 1 rating though, is...Robin...yes...Robin! Why? Chris O'Donnell will be hated forever and well he deserves it for agreeing to bring back the worst character in Batman. The Dark Knight works alone not with some acrobatic moron. And to add to the mess they give Robin a suit and symbol similar to Batman. What's more is the terrible depiction of Gotham. Batman and Returns have Gotham as a city like any other but more Gothic and darker. Joel Schumacher decided to create a freakish city full of clowns, fluorescent colours juxtaposed with Wayne manor in the lovely countryside yet is close to the city. Nothing is realistic. Batman Forever destroys the previous two Burton films by creating a comic book horror show without any sort of danger, mystery or intrigue. The plot is pretty dull and predictable, villains team up and fight Batman and Loser Robin in an overlong and poorly done action finale. Jim Carrey is unwatchable and Lee Jones must weep when he replays this disaster. Well that sums it up, a horrible mess which nearly destroyed a legend. Well Shumacher did that in the sequel. Thank god for Christopher Nolan!One more thing. I challenge you to watch Kidman and Kilmer in one scene and not laugh (it's in the bedroom and Kilmer does the most cringe inducing smile ever seen on camera!).",Batman Forever

Val Kilmer also accepted the cape and cowl after Michael Keaton quit the franchise, and he nailed the role in outstanding fashion in what is arguably the most under-appreciated performance in a superhero role since Terrance Stamp's ""General Zod"" in Superman II. The Joel Schumacher-directed and Tim Burton-produced ""Batman Forever"" is a welcome addition to the series.

In a sense, it was necessary to the Batman movie saga since Robin HAD to be introduced at some point.The acting isn't too bad, although sometimes Val Kilmer's attempt at Bruce Wayne seems kind of wooden. Still, he does make a reasonably good Batman AND Bruce Wayne, much better than Michael Keaton.Perhaps one of the problems people have had with the film, is that it is far to camp. That can be true - Jim Carrey's interpretation of The Riddler, is certainly an example of this.The film's ""camp"" style is not overwhelming, however, as it was in Batmanand Robin. There still is something very Gothic, dark, and 50s about the portrayed Gotham city, and that is what the film's main redeeming point is.Overall, it's a film that's watchable. However, if you're a fan of Burton's take on Batman, don't watch it.",Batman Forever
389,Kit-48,Wasted potential,4,22 March 2000,"This movie could have been good. The script is of a fair standard; it utilises two traditional foes of the Batman, Two-Face and the Riddler, with a lot of dark potential between them; and its stars are actually quite competent actors in their own ways.But, no, Warner Brothers executives were apparently unhappy with the dark, adult direction that Tim Burton took the franchise as director of ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns."" So, rather than continue with a style reminiscent of the way the Batman was always meant to be, we have Joel Schumacher's hideous attempt at an homage to the camp Sixties television series.The one saving grace of this movie is that Schumacher apparently didn't feel confident enough to completely depart from the dark vision that Burton established. Thus, although there are definite overtones of jokey campness, the baseline for the film remains dark.Performances are adequate. There isn't anyone who gives a stellar performance, but they are all talented enough to turn in a decent job without really trying. It's enough to say that Val Kilmer as the Batman and Bruce Wayne is good here, but could have been awesome under Tim Burton, had WB insisted that Michael Keaton be replaced. Kilmer is an actor who needs discipline; Schumacher can't give it to him.Similarly, Tommy Lee Jones (Harvey Dent, Two-Face) does very well, but not as well as he might have. About the only one whose performance might not have been improved under Burton is Jim Carrey (Edward Nygma, the Riddler), but then Carrey is pretty much a force unto himself in this kind of role.I actually think this film is worth seeing, if only to see exactly how the franchise began its decline and produced the abomination that is ""Batman and Robin."" Watch, and think of what might have been.",Batman Forever

391,jrf2,Burton's Gothic delight departs and Schumacher brings in the circus,6,25 December 2005,"1992's Batman Returns was deemed ""too dark"" by many, as Burton was given complete carte blanch and certainly took advantage of it. So Batman as a film franchise was to go a different direction, as Yoda would say, down a dark, dark path. Joel Schumacher's first Batman film isn't terrible by any means. It's such a departure from Burton's work that it overwhelms you upon first viewing. Val Kilmer actually steps into the shoes of Bruce Wayne with gusto. He's a much more traditional Bruce Wayne, a square-jawed playboy, rather than the reluctant, Norman Batesish character that Michael Keaton played. As Batman though, he's not quite a menacing as Keaton, as exemplified by the uncharacteristic of Batman smile that Kilmer gives. Continuing with the tradition of two villains Two-Face and Riddler team up. Two-Face had real potential as a tragic, psychologically interesting villain and with Tommy Lee Jones taking the role one would think that potential would be realized, not so. Jones's Two-Face is a one-note maniacally laughing psycho and second fiddle to Jim Carrey's nutty Riddler. Carrey fits this role like a glove. It feels right for him to be an energetic, over the top hyena, whereas for Two-Face it feels wrong and forced. Nicole Kidman's Chase Meridian is a solid love interest, though not as good as Michelle Pfeiffer. Chase's triangle with Batman AND Bruce Wayne is fairly interesting as is this film's attempt to delve deeper into Bruce's psyche...While neither strand is completely successful the film has merit for exploring those avenues...Ultimately this film's downfall is its bigger, flashier, tackier, and painfully over the top execution. Half the time its fun, half the time you do a double take to make sure you didn't accidentally stick in an episode of 60's series. A redeeming factor is Elliot Goldenthal's score, which successfully find a new theme for the series and stays true to the spirit of Elfman's work. Robin's introduction is an obvious parallel to Bruce's own pain...Both men seek vengeance and it drives them to be more than ordinary men...Chris O' Donnell was a weak choice though, and didn't fully convey the weight of what happened to him. All in all, this is a decent entry to the Batman series and a guilty pleasure, and certainly does not deserved to be lumped in with Batman and Robin, though it will always be remembered as the beginning of the end.**1/2 out of ****",Batman Forever

And by bright and cheerful, I mean dark and dreary. First of all, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SETS? Neon, purple and green gas, and something that looks like a Chinatown replace the dark and moody Gotham of the first two films. Plus, based on the technology seen in the movie, it feels like it takes place in 1995. The first two did not have that feel. They felt like they took place in 1945... or was it 2005? And the acting leaves you thinking your kids could do better. Val Kilmer seems bored as Batman, and Chris O'Donnel is pure annoyance as Robin. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is going to take me forever to complain about. First of all, Billy Dee Williams could have and would have been happy to play that role. He even signed a contract about it. But no, Joel Shumacher says ""Let's use Tommy because he's more famous."" Billy could have done much better in that role. Plus, the switch of actors causes the infamous goofs: 1- How did Harvey Dent go from black to white? 2- How did Harvey Dent go from young to old in under 3 years? The Bat-Suit is, like the one in ""Batman"" overly muscular, and when you see Kilmer without his shirt on, you can see he's not even close to being that muscular. Plus, Kilmer is blond, and thus, he looks nothing like Bruce Wayne from the comics. The only light at the end of the tunnel is Jim Carrey as the Riddler. He is funny and witty. Love watching him! And the score is over-ridden with music videos plus the horrible new themes composed by Elliot what's-his-name. Plot is stupid and has so many plot holes, too.

394,PhillipSimons,Nice failure,4,30 December 2005,"In 1995 we all awaited the new Batman, after a thrilling and breath- taking original in 1989 and a satisfying sequel in 1992, Warner Brothers decided to swap director Tim Burton with Joel Schumacher in order to make the movie more acceptable for kids. This decision caused other crucial changes- the already prepared script was re- written. The cast, although some supporting roles like Michael Gough(Alfred) and Pat Hingle(Commissioner Gordon) sustained, suffered important substitutes- Billy Dee Williams who was in Burtons vision supposed to be in the role of Harvey Dent/ Two-Face(after all he was introduced in the first movie), was released and Warner appointed ""The Fugitive"" star Tommy Lee Jones. His performance was in general all right but his character remained trivial and turned into a psychotic lunatic killer. This extremely disappointed the Batman- comic books fans. On the other hand Schumacher introduced the character of Robin. In the assortment of the role he picked Chris O'Donnell, as a more brighter and boyish Batman sidekick. Finally, Bruce Wayne/ Batman actor Michael Keaton abandoned the series because of Burton as well as he realized in time that the series future doesn't look bright. As his replacement youthful Val Kilmer was called, and made a solid performance as Batman but displayed a unconvincing Bruce Wayne. Schumacher tries to explore and present Waynes/ Batmans psychological side in some occasions- the dialog with Chase Meridian and the relationship with Dick Grayson/ Robin and actually succeeds in this attempt. Schumacher applied Burtons already proved concepts of two villains facing the Dark Knight simultaneously, the all- star cast(including Nicole Kidman, Jim Carrey, Val Kilmer,..) and parallel stories which follow on one side Batman on the other the emergence of Edward Nigma(Jim Carrey) and his transformation into the Riddler. This transformation is featured with some intelligence and energy yet does not reach the level of the two earlier parts. Carrey as Riddler also represents the strongest link in this movie as his performance is both entertaining and spicy and in the same time keeps a distance to the related Joker character. Schumacher also adds his more grotesque vision of Gotham City marked with fire, tons of neon lights and kitsch design. The plot is basically very simple, naive, with many ridiculous action scenes and childish jokes. All in one, this is a nice try to refresh the series but will finally lead to its destruction finalized in the form of the fourth ""Batman&Robin"" movie.",Batman Forever

Watching again the other day after a year or so really opened my eyes to the countless touches of style heaped upon this film by Joel Schumacher.  The costumes, the sets, the atmosphere...all improvements on the themes established by the first two movies in the series.  My chief complaint with the first two movies is certainly addressed here as darkness is merely a component of the setting rather than the setting itself.  Witness ""master Dick's"" first encounter with some hoodlums--black-lighted, neon wonderland. A film cannot be carried by style alone, therefore a killer cast was assembled to finish things off.  Val Kilmer is every bit up to the task in playing Bruce Wayne/Batman; Nicole Kidman steamy as Dr. Chase Meridian who would happily have a three-way with Wayne/Batman were it physically possible; Chris O'Donnell respectable as Dick Grayson/Robin.  But, as always in these Bat-flicks, the villains are the raisons d'etre...however, Forever only bats .500 in this respect.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as The Riddler/Edward Nygma, going completely over the top as I'm sure he was directed to do.  Tommy Lee Jones, on the other hand, comes off as simply making a valiant attempt to be over the top, an effort that reminds one of how someone would act were they trying to imitate Jack Nicholson's performance in the first installment of the series.  Though his performance is credible, it is not nearly as entertaining as Carrey's.

398,Chandler81,My eyes! The goggles do nothing.,3,20 April 2003,"In terms of production design and cinematography, Tim Burton's adaptation of Batman (1989) is easily one of my favourite films because its combination of gothic, industrial and mobster imagery is absolutely brilliant.  The sequel (Batman Returns, 1991) was also a Burton film and despite shortcomings in its plot, it thankfully retained a similar style to the original which helped it immensely.  Joel Schumacher took over the series at this point, helming Batman Forever (1995) and its appalling sequel Batman and Robin (1997).  With these additions to the series, Schumacher all but spits in Burton's face, blowing off the brilliant visual style of the first two films, and replacing it with ridiculously over-the-top techno sets and a dreadful lighting design that places far too much emphasis on neon lights.
Batman Forever does to some extent retain the dark look of the earlier films - after all, Batman is well known as 'The Dark Knight' and to shoot him in entirely bright surrounds would not be effective.  However, as though feeling the need to differentiate his Batman efforts from Burton's, Schumacher turns away from the style mentioned above and creates his own 'New Gotham', featuring outrageous sets that are almost always lit with fluorescent lights and bright colours.  Not even the new Batmobile (with it's dodgy-looking dorsal wing that wobbles and bends) is immune to the neon insanity.  The style on display here is not nearly as effective as that of the first two films and does not serve the narrative as effectively as Burton's brilliant vision of Gotham.It's hard to say whether Val Kilmer is worse in the title role than George Clooney in Batman and Robin; it's a very close call.  He gives the gruff Batman dialogue with enough cool toughness to make him an appealing caped crusader, but his portrayal of Bruce Wayne is rotten.  His delivery of dialogue is too stiff, and while its obvious he was going for 'Upper-class with a Dignified Air', he instead manages merely 'Dull and Wooden' - he fails miserably in comparison with Keaton.  Likewise Keaton's agony over telling Vicki Vale of his double identity in Batman was excellent and beautifully sincere, while Kilmer's similar angst is brushed over briefly by director Schumacher and lacks the sense of fear and anxiety that should be associated with Wayne letting anyone in on his secret.
When looking solely at the scripts for the four Batman films, Bruce Wayne is at his most tortured in Forever, and the audience comes closer to understanding his motives, his torture and his misery than ever before. Unfortunately Schumacher's direction mostly fails to give these scenes the sufficiently gentle, yet dark touch they require, and Kilmer's acting serves only to bring them down further.  This is an opportunity sorely lost, as it held an opportunity for some wonderful emotive scenes that could have at least dragged the film up to the level of Batman Returns.  Still, these scenes are easily one of the film's highlights because they bring more of the Batman/Bruce Wayne conflict to the screen than was managed in any of the other three films.  Wayne's relationship with Dick Grayson, who's personal dilemma mirror's Wayne's own is dealt with surprisingly well and is another of the film's strongest elements.  O'Donnell puts in a solid performance as Grayson.Nicole Kidman has very little to work with in her role, and the two villains are pretty silly (as if Danny DeVito and his army of rocket-armed penguins in Batman Returns wasn't silly enough) and feature some colourless and uninteresting back-stories.  Thankfully, Two Face and The Riddler don't reach the point of becoming absolutely ridiculous - Schumacher was holding that ace up his sleeve for his sequel.  Tommy Lee Jones is reasonable as Two Face, but he's got nothing on The Joker (a very similar character) in terms of being a psychotic, bloodthirsty villain.  Carrey's Riddler seems a little too much like his zany character in The Mask (1994) and while his screen presence is strong and his delivery of dialogue generally appealing, the character is too over the top.  Like Nicholson's Joker he is insane and outrageous, but unfortunately he is also not even remotely believable, and his plot to steal the brain waves of Gotham's residents is just plain stupid.The same goes for the set action pieces which, while I'm sure are looking to emulate a comic book's style of unbelievable situations overcome by the hero's power, come across mostly as stupid and contrived.  You're looking at the likes of the Batmobile driving up a wall in this film - all up it's pretty dumb.  Indeed, Batman Forever is studio film making at its most gross and negligent.  ""Here we have two films that did well at the box office, let's make them bigger and flashier with more ridiculous set action pieces and a well known hunk actor and the audiences will come in flocks.  Who cares if we're making films that are absolute crap?""  I do, for one.  The set action pieces, poor script and casting and new visual style really hurt Batman Forever.  Long after my first viewing, my most dominant memories of the film were the overwhelming and off-putting use of bright colours and the stupidity of the brainwaves plot.  Not exactly the way directors hope their work is remembered.People often remember the 1980's as a decade that was responsible for many crimes against fashion, particularly for the garish colours that made their mark on the fashion of the time.  It's as if the films of the Batman series found themselves in a strange time warp, and the Burton films, a product of the 80's, were stylistically brilliant, while the Schumacher films, a 90's product, found themselves unfortunate victims of 1980's excess and unsightliness.",Batman Forever
399,MrLuthor89,Flawed but ultimately enjoyable Chapter in the series.,10,16 October 2005,"After ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" made over half a billion dollars combined at the box office, it was clear it wouldn't be long before Warner Bros. green lit a third installment to the Batman franchise. After Tim Burton was released as director...due to the sexuality and violence of ""Returns"" not being marketable enough for big sponsors like McDonalds, Joel Schumacher of ""The Client"" and ""The Lost Boys"" was given a shot at the directors chair. Schumacher was hired primarily for his unique style and ability to balance the light and dark in a film. Michael Keaton decided not to take the reigns as star for a 3rd time around, so he was replaced by Val ""Iceman"" Kilmer. And Robin finally gets his first appearance as batman's sidekick. Here played by Chris O'Donnell, respectively. While the film may be flawed in terms of a few plot holes and a bit of overacting, it stresses a larger point to the Batman legacy, as did ""Batman Begins"". ""Begins"" teaches us why Batman is, and ""Forever"" teaches why Batman will always be.The film begins with our hero (Val Kilmer) hunting after his prison-escaped nemesis, Harvey Two-Face (Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones), the once crime fighting D.A. Harvey Dent. After failing to bring Two-Face to justice, Batman faces another challenge in the forms of Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is week in the knees for bad boys, and Edward Nygma, a maniacal employee of Wayne Enterprises. After Nygma proposes a new device that can allow the viewer of any television program to become one with the show, Wayne refuses, denouncing the idea of mind manipulation. Nygma, now rejected, vows vengeance. After receiving several disturbing letters in the form of riddles, Bruce Wayne engages the help of Dr. Meridian. Bruce, infatuated by Chase, asks her to join him at a Grand Circus, featuring all of Gotham's ""well-to-do"". Whilst there, Two-Face crashes the party, armed with 200 sticks of TNT. Threatening to leave the place in ruins unless Batman's identity is given up, the acrobatic stars of the circus, the Graysons, attempt to stop the bomb. In their gallant attempt, Two-Face executes them. The only surviving son, Dick Grayson, managed to escape that very fate to dismantle the T.N.T. Dick, now alone and orphaned, is taken in by Bruce. Having gone through a similar situation with the murder of his parents, Bruce takes Dick under his wing (forgive the pun). Eventually, Nygma transforms into an alter ego known as The Riddler, and joins forces with Two-Face. After establishing himself as a brilliant tycoon as Edward Nygma with the release of his 3-D Box, he takes advantage of all the images and information being sucked out of Gotham's brainwaves. He would eventually devise a way to read men's minds. Between the Riddler and Two-Face discovering his identity, Chase's infatuation with Batman, Bruce's true love for Chase, and Dick Grayson's wanting to exact vengeance on Two-Face, Batman has his hands full. These conflicts all culminate in a raid on Wayne Manor and then a final battle on the Riddler's Claw island fortress, in which Robin makes his first venture in heroism.Between the dazzling special effects, the newly written musical score by Elliott Goldenthal (no where near as effective as Danny Elfman's haunting score, but still damn good), and the new and fresh performance as the Dark Knight/Bruce Wayne by Val Kilmer, this film is sure to please anyone who was disappointed with ""Batman & Robin"" or ""Batman Returns"". My final comments will go to the cast. While Kilmer was effective as Batman, giving us something both new and something we have seen in Michael Keaton's portrayal, I was surprised to see how well he fit into the role. His voice, his body movements, and especially his billionaire, corporate C.E.O. version of Bruce Wayne that Keaton had not shown us, are all pluses for his performance. Tommy Lee Jones was only given one side of the personality of Two-Face. Thus giving us a wildly over the top, hot headed, but ultimately cool Two-Face. From the first shot we see him to the final confrontation between he and the dynamic duo; Jones gives to Two-Face what Nicholson gave to the Joker, an unrelenting dose of delicious evil. Jim Carrey was the ultimate choice for the Riddler. His tall, thin structure and extraordinarily comical body movements gave the Riddler what Frank Gorshin had done in the 60s with the same character. From the twirling of his golden , question-mark-topped-cane, and the skin tight green suit encumbered with jet black question marks, Carrey proves one of the best of Batman's on screen adversaries. Kidman was sexy and refreshing. But, if people think Two-Face is over the top, try a criminal psychiatrist who is turned on by ""the wrong kind of man"". I kind of buy it, but over all I thought the best part of her character was when she decided to grow up and fall for a normal man (if you consider Bruce normal). Chris O'Donnell did hear what he should have followed up in ""Batman & Robin"". And that is to keep the bad boy image going, and abandon any Burt Ward impersonation. Luckily enough, Burt Ward is no where to be found in this film. This film shows us why Batman will always be, as ""Batman Begins"" showed us why he is. Wayne in ""Begins"" confronts what he must become, as Wayne in this, must confront why he must continue. Overall a good chapter in the series. 7.5/10",Batman Forever
400,Mattster99,No where near as good as it's predecessors,6,3 April 2010,"""Batman Forever"" really was a bit of a let down in the ""Batman"" series, it is silly, ridiculous (at times), and most of the time is a flashy - colored light show, Joel Schumacher really let a lot of eager fans down, and everyone really missed Tim Burton's dark and creepy style.Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer), has to try to save Gotham City again from two evil Villains, Two - Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey) who are working together to use brainwaves as a source to get in to peoples minds and hear all their thoughts while they become mindless people staring at their TV screen, and alongside Batman is Dick Grayson/Robin (Chris O'Donnell) who's parents were killed by Two - Face. During all this trouble a beautiful phyciatrist named Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) tries to discover who Batman is and tries to help Bruce with horrible memories of his Parent's death, and discover why they are coming back to him while trying to help him try to forget about it...Val Kilmer is nothing like Michael Keaton, Tommy Lee Jones was a very weird choice for ""Two - Face"", and Jim Carrey is just plain silly as ""The Riddler"", and Nicole Kidman is OK, but is just a boring character, that has nothing to do, Chris O'Donnell has some of the most corniest and cheesiest lines in Cinema history as Robin.This film really let a lot of people down, the dialogue is so corny at times, you laugh, the acting is OK, Val Kilmer still pulls Batman off well, in my opinion. This film is not for hardcore ""Batman"" fans, but if your looking for a corny superhero/action movie, than rent this, or buy it, but not for hardcore fans of ""Batman"".",Batman Forever
401,ninasalo,Not Bad Not Good,5,1 May 2018,Better than Batman and robin but still mediocre film. It tries too hard to combine Tim Burtons characters with their campy earlier versions. The result is unsatisfying movie thats more of a product than a actual piece of decent scripting!,Batman Forever
402,TomAyles,Jim Carrey saves an otherwise worthless movie.,4,26 April 2001,"I went into this movie skeptical of Joel Schumaker, who I had heard wanted to take a lighter approach to Batman after Tim Burton's film noir movies, but excited about Tommy Lee Jones who seemed like he was made to play Two Face.  As it turns out, I was right to be skeptical of Schmaker, but wrong to be excited about Tommy Lee Jones, who played Two Face as an oaf instead of a brilliant former D.A. gone mad.  Fortunately, Jim Carrey's over-the-top interpretation of the Riddler, one of my least favorite Batman villains, was enough to make me enjoy an otherwise trite, campy, and generally bad movie. There were too many characters, of which only the Riddler had any depth at all; too many flashy action sequences; and too little plot or character development.If you didn't care for Tim Burton's dark vision of Batman, maybe you'll like this instead.  But I would instead recommend seeing the animated Batman: Mask of the Phantasm -- which finds an excellent balance between presenting a Batman fit for both kids and adults, while still capturing the essentially dark, obsessed nature of Batman and his nemeses.",Batman Forever
403,tdkrbatmanfan,Ehhh... Could've been better,5,11 July 2011,"This one could've been so much better. The whole thing is ridiculous, and is just plain unrealistic. The first two were very real except for the fact that the penguin has two flippers. I'll list off flaws real soon here.Big flaw: Plot. The whole concept is a crazed Wayne employee uses his invention to steal Gotham's intelligence. Along the way, he acquires the help of Two-Face and robs all the big stores. They are also trying to find out who Batman is. The Crazed worker is the Riddler, and he enhances his invention to read minds. It's just stupid.Second Flaw: Acting. Val Kilmer isn't as bad as Clooney, but he sure is bad. Just awful. Jim Carey is always over the top and in this one he is over over the top. He is annoying. Tommy Lee Jones is a terrible Two-Face. He is annoying and just could not pull off the role! Not all was awful though. O'Donnell is good as Robin, because he pulls off that annoying zing Robin has. As for Michael Gough, he will always be the best Alfred. Nicole Kidman even gave a good performance Third Flaw: Campy. The TV series was good because every episode was campy. But for the movie series, the first two were very dark and brooding, but this one makes Gotham look like an art museum.Overall, not very good. Mildly entertaining, but terrible story.",Batman Forever
404,thedudejh,Batman Forever isn't as horrible as some make it out to be. It is fun popcorn entertainment,7,9 February 2014,"I don't really see why people bash this film as much as they do. It's not nearly as horrendous as Batman & Robin. Sure Val Kilmer is stale most of the movie and there are a few moments in the film that are really not needed. And some people bash Tommy Lee Jones' over-the-top performance as well as bashing the over-the-top feel of the movie; it's a comic book movie. You cannot take it too seriously. It's meant to be fun. It is certainly not taking itself serious like Tim Burton or Chris Nolan's Batman films did. Have fun watching it. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones give maniacally tasteful performances and it's quite a sight of awesome special effects, colors, lights, story, production design, and music.",Batman Forever
405,megan-274-222932,Cartoonish,6,19 August 2020,"Very obviously focusing on much more of the comic book side of Batman, all cleverly OTT.

406,sarakitty05,The best one yet!,9,31 July 2012,"Honestly, I don't know why people ripped on this movie.It packed the most action, it packed some really great actors and it had the most comedic scenes yet.Val Kilmer was yet another great Batman. Although I think I prefer Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne, I think the prize for the better Batman goes to him. He had some very great lines! Chris Odonnell...man I love that guy. I found he played a great rebel, someone who didn't follow the rules, someone brooding and angry. I'm excited he's Robin. This is one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoy the next Batman film.Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face were pure comedic gold. They gave me many many laughs and I loved their little bromance. Epic part of this movie.Nicole Kidman was alright. Although I do think I prefer the first two females more.Finally, the makeup and costumes were great in this film. A+! Don't listen to the negative critics. Watch it first.

407,ZielinskiMichal321,Best of the series (almost),10,3 April 2016,"Holy rusted metal Batman!......Something in me makes me like this movie more and more as I get older, but then I am only almost 18. Being a big fan of Burton's and Nolan's adaptation of Batman this movie directed by Joel Shumacher has a special place in my heart. I love Batman comic-books and this movie brings a comic book into a real life world that has the mixture of both light and dark atmosphere. Now some people will not like, some people very much will like me. The negative of this movie grew only because it was connected Batman & Robin which is unfair because when the movie came out , it may not have got the positive reception like both of the Tim Burton's movies did, but it still did fine and became a box office hit. According to some source the movie has been praised by some critics back in the day, that is until that very interesting follow up up happened with Bat-nipples. This review might not make sense but what I am trying to say is I really enjoy this movie. 5/5.",Batman Forever
408,MovieLad26,An interesting film with some flaws,6,11 February 2010,"If history has taught us anything, it's that Batman is the best superhero ever! He's dark, creepy, and overall fantastic to either play as in say, a video game, or watch on TV or in a movie theatre. Tim Burton's idea of what Batman should be, took me by surprise as probably the most refreshing Batman film ever. The sequel, Batman Returns, wasn't as good, and so Burton was booted off the bat-franchise. Enter Joel Schumacher, who would direct the third film in the series, Batman Forever.This film certainly isn't the best, but it ain't the worst. It's got hit and miss moments some of which are shown more clearly than others. However, I find it to be a very entertaining film. The colours are a lot more bright, which definitely eliminates the darkness, but Val Kilmer as batman is probably one of my favourites. He delivers straight up and makes you feel like although Michael Keaton isn't in the film, it doesn't seem to do any damage. The villains are silly and quite frankly, over the top. Jim Carrey acted like...Jim Carrey and didn't quite pull off a believable performance as the Riddler. Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is also very silly, and isn't what you would expect. Overall, this film is OK, and I recommend it to people who don't watch these films for realism, but rather entertainment, and a good weekend movie. Check it out.",Batman Forever
409,Century_hades,Bad superhero movie,4,3 April 2014,"I was out at my local grocer the other day, and found in the cheap bin. Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin for 5 Canadian dollars. So what the hell I'm a Batman fan I decided to pick them up.Then I watched Batman Forever. Well first thing is first, Val Kilmer in my opinion didn't make a good batman. He was too stiff, and wooden.Next the whole character of Chase Meridian, served to logical function in the movie except to give a Batman a love interest. Which I don't know why they always insist on this. Batman only cares about being Batman.Her using the bat single to summon batman so she can seduce him. I thought was totally cheesy, and Ridiculous.Then there are the villains in the film of two face, and the riddler. Which are done way too over the top. That it is hard to watch them without feeling embarrassed for them.Then the whole robin thing doesn't work at all. Which I think that the whole idea of Robin is an out of date one. I was cool in the 40's, and 50's. These days it just doesn't work, and makes Batman lame. It really does not work in the movies at all.Then the whole idea that the riddler got his mind control blender in the house of every person in Gotham, and built a huge glowing fortress in the bay within a few days. Was totally stupid.This movie follows almost no logic at all.Also Commissioner Gordon, and the rest of the police force has been reduced to stupid, and useless. The relationship between Batman, and Gordon is something The 80's, and 90's Batman films would completely miss out on.So if you like bad superhero movies than this one would make a great addition to your collection.",Batman Forever
410,lebezki,Gets an A+ for effort,6,5 March 2005,"For those who saw this, we can all agree that it is very bad. But I'm going to try to ignore the thousands of people who utterly despise this movie and focus on the positives. Joel Shumacher tried very hard to capture the colorful, if campy, nature of the original TV series. He abandoned Tim Burton's Gothic metropolis for a Las Vega-ish carnival with bright, flashing lights. Val Kilmer is, I admit, awful in this movie. He seemed completely dead in his performance. Chris O'Donnel actually puts in a good performance as Robin. (""Holey rusted metal, Batman!"") While Tommy Lee Jones was just too over the top. He played out more like a Joker. Jim Carrey is funny AND over the top, as usual. He is one of the movies very, very few saving graces. His costume was a tad bit over the top in the finale. Despite their best efforts, they have created a movie that will be shunned forever, by moviegoers everywhere.",Batman Forever
411,IndiePhlem,"A smart, stylized approach to Batman.....I like it!",10,24 June 2005,"Most of the fans say that it's a bad light-hearted approach to Batman, but (not being a fan of the comics) I loved it. The stylization gives it a taste like candy, not the doom and gloom of the other two movies. Keaton is great as Batman as in the other ones, but Val Kilmer is very sexy, and every bit as dark as Keaton. One thing that set this film apart from the other ones is the villains. The Riddler and Two-Face where hilariously sinister together, and there are great lines in the entire thing (I am Batman! Black rubber. Try firemen, less to take off. Holy rusted metal batman! If you kill him, you won't learn nothing'. Etc.) OK, I'm not ripping on Michael Keaton or anything, I love those movies, but for different movies. I love those for the darkness and evil that they involve, but this, I love this one because, because I had FUN watching it. They other ones I didn't exactly have fun. I enjoyed those very much, but on the fun and laughter scale.....ziltch. This one had comedy, drama, and a tad of romance, enough to factor in with the story but not interfere with the whole Batman transition.First off, VAL KILMER! Sexy in the suit. The reason why he is such a good Batman is that he has such a great voice. I think that is vital to a Batman. Second, in this movie you like Batman/Bruce Wayne as a person. He's much more deep and humanized in this film. You come to like him and Robin/Dick Grayson as a team, and understand the reasons why they are a team.Second, Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones! Great villains! In Batman Returns(1990), I was really disappointed in the villains. They wanted to kill Batman. The End. No reason, no vengeance, no anger. We get the fact that The Riddler is a control freak who is peeved that Bruce Wayne woulden't listen to his ideas for mind-control. We understand that Two-Face wants to kill Batman because.........that's self-explanatory. I'm not a fan of Jim Carrey, but his character is funny, and pshycotic. Tommy Lee Jones is a great Two-Face, hilariously flipping his coin and being generally homicidal. These two as a team are great, playing off each other, and being humorous by themselves as well.Third, Nicole Kidman. OK, OK. I'll admit that she makes unorthodox choices in the movies she makes, but this, ah this. She has some good lines, and gives a good performance as someone who is obsessed with Batman. She adds sex appeal, and that helps along the Bruce Wayne/Batman acceptance.Fourth, Chris O'Donnell. He's good for the character he plays. Dark and angsty. Good for the movie.All and all. It's a highly entertaining film for the people who don't read the comments. Come on people, how many times are you going to hear Nicole Kidman say ""Black Rubber.""? Or see the blender lookin' mind control device? I recommend you see it at least once. (NOTE TO SELF: Buy DVD.) It's the most fun you'll have with a superhero movie.The Popcorn rating: Nineteen good popcorns out of twenty.Notes: -Jim Carrey, while having his knowledge sucked out: ""Bummer."" -I think it's good that Nicole Kidman didn't pick Batman. How do you introduce that to Mom and Dad? ""Mom, Dad, meet my boyfriend, Batman."" ""What do you do for a living?"" ""He fights crime."" AWK-ward.-The Riddler's hair after all the explosions. Like a pancake, man.-It's very hard to be a summer an a winter. But you pull it off nicely.-I agree with Nicole Kidman on the ""Black Rubber."" comment. Hawt.-The ""Brain Drain"" looks more like a blender with fins.-I AM BATMAN!",Batman Forever
412,funkyjuju,"An original, entertaining homage to the comics.",9,28 December 2014,"The movie starts off with a very daring, suave Batman literally swinging in on a rope and rescuing an innocent civilian from the freshly-escaped psychopath, Two-Face. Being the one who put him in prison in the first place, Batman knows that he will soon be after him but finds time to spend with the alluring Dr Chase Meridian. Two- Face has also teamed up with the Riddler, a new criminal in Gotham who's creating big WAVES. But Batman may know him better than he believesOur Batman is played by Val Kilmer. He strikes a good balance between Bruce Wayne's playful, socialite side as well as his dark, tortured side. What I like about this Batman is that he's not flashy and arrogant with his money (unlike the Christian Bale version). We always see him as a good guy, a guy you'd be friends with. I love, love, love the portrayals of the villains, Two-Face and Riddler, whom are played by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. They aren't the dark, complex characters that the modern Batman films favour (and they are also brilliant), these villains are just silly, entertaining fun. The design of Two-Face is creative, original and wonderful and I love the comedic focus on his two personalities. Jim Carrey, of course, does a fantastic job with the Riddler. You can tell that he's enjoying himself and really hamming up Riddler's insanity and quirks. But not only does he do a great job as a comedian but also as an actor. Edward Nigma's desperate, manic clinginess with Bruce Wayne is superbly done. Nicole Kidman's Dr Chase Meridian is deliciously seductive and intelligent. She's not just a pretty face –the conversations between her and Batman (or Bruce Wayne) are actually interesting and her character is as subtly layered as such a minor character can be. Chris O'Donnell does a great job as Dick Grayson (or Robin) and I think this is probably the only portrayal of Batman's sidekick that isn't kind of laughable. The only thing I didn't believe was that he was supposed to be around 17 (seeing as he wanted to avoid Social Services). I also adored the characters of Sugar and Spice. They were played by the lovely Drew Barrymore and enticing Debi Mazar. They brought a little bit of pep to the movie and their costumes and makeup added to the stylish, punk-inspired Gotham look.One of the things I LOVE about Batman Forever is the way the city of Gotham looks. It's such a compliment to the comics with the narrow, high buildings and the citizens all looking like they just left a rave. It looks awesome and far superior the Christopher Nolan's generic city setting.I also love the way the Batmobile with its badass look and insane tricks. Also I find the nipples on the Batsuit and the ass shot really funny, not the source of outrage of the viewers thought.You have to remember that this is a film made for family entertainment. It's silly and funny and visually cool –don't expect the deep, dark awesomeness of Christopher Nolan's adaptions. This movie was clearly inspired by the comics and is a fun way to spend two hours!",Batman Forever
413,Lott444,Unbelievable,1,11 January 2014,"Have you ever stopped and wondered to yourself ""Will I ever in my life see a major motion picture based on Batman where Two Face and Riddler, played by A-list movie stars, cackle and giggle and hop up and down in place like a couple of drunk frat boys?"" Have you also mused ""Gee, I really liked Burton's previous Batman movies but the atmosphere was too dark and emotional. Why can't we have settings with neon and bright colors all over the place?"" You may also have thought ""Well, I like the Batman comics and mythos but f--- that. I want a movie where all of the characters I know and love act completely different (in a worse way)!"" Well then this is the movie for you! This movie is so annoying. Riddler and Two Face behave like they'd on LSD the whole time. The Dick Grayson character whines and cries the whole time. Despite the fact that the Riddler's alternate identity is world famous and it's stated that he is on magazine covers all over Gotham, nobody seems to be able to recognize the fact that he and the Riddler look identical except for a mask and pink hair - even Batman doesn't piece it together right away and he's supposed to be a genius.I understand that the previous two movies were cheesy to an extent but this movie seems like it turned the cheesy and campy dials to the maximum setting and just went with it. I could go on, but why bother? Watch this if you want to spend a few hours more puzzled than the Riddler's victims.",Batman Forever
414,RobTheConqueror,"Has its moments, but ultimately silly and against the mythos",5,19 January 2016,"The mid-90's was clearly when comic book movies turned into the butt of jokes that still make some people look down on them as mindless trash to this day, and that was because of one big reason. Studios went from producing dark, plausible, serious and character driven superhero movies like the first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's Batman movies and The Crow to making OTT garbage like Judge Dredd, Steel and of course Joel Schumacher's two Batman sequels. Batman Forever and it's successor are time capsules to everything wrong with comic book movies in this time period. Not only do bright, flashy colours replace the eerie and darkly atmospheric Gotham of the Burton films, but Michael Keaton is gone as well, replaced by Val Kilmer. Kilmer, to his credit, is OK in the role. However, he certainly misses the energy Keaton previously brought to the role. Nicole Kidman, like Kim Basinger before her, is sexy as hell, but also bland and forgettable as the love interest. Chris O'Donnell is miscast and borderline terrible as Robin. None of this is the fault of the actors however as the script really doesn't give their characters much to work with except for the ""identity"" story arc that Bruce/Batman goes through. And no, Robin doesn't count, as his only character traits are ""mah parents died"" and ""I love motorcycles"".Meanwhile, we have the villains. And BOY does this film stumble in that area. On the positive side, Jim Carrey gives a brilliant performance as the Riddler and almost carries the movie on his own. But this isn't the Riddler! Carrey simply plays a OTT wacko lune who has invented something insane and dangerous (also silly and implausible). Oh, and he leaves riddles. Well isn't that interesting. I would compare it to DeVito as Penguin in Batman Returns, but at least that different version of Penguin was a GOOD character.And what in the HELL did they do to Two-Face?! Tommy Lee-Jones' portrayal is an absolute butchering of the character and everything good about him. First of all, Lee-Jones hams up his performance to 11, which completely contrasts with his tragic backstory in terms of tone. Not to mention the insulting character assassination of having Two-Face not care about the result of his coin flip and just flip it again. THEN WHY HAVE THE DAMNED COIN IN THE FIRST PLACE?! And why in the bluest of blue hell is he played by a white guy when Dent was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the first movie? Out of all the villains in the series, Two-Face is the worst, even counting Arnold's Mr. Freeze.....oh hang on I forgot about Bane. OK, second worst.Despite all the issues with the plot and characters, is Batman Forever a bad movie? No. It is actually entertaining to watch most of the time, Jim Carrey is a delight, the soundtrack from U2 is awesome and it's clearly written with some thought and effort with its themes of double lives and identity.Unfortunately at the end of the day it's a tonal mess with silliness ramped up to 11 and undoing the great characterisation and atmosphere of the Burton films.",Batman Forever
415,mr-spock,A shame !,4,3 March 2000,"This is a lesson of how to destroy a Tim Burton masterpiece. The Director of this movie, never, a repeat, never read the comic. No way, how could this Director take out the dark, the gothic, the madness, the sherlock holmes way. Batman is serious, and mad. The director doesn't understand that the TV show was a caricature, not the true representation. Avoid this movie. Eduardo.",Batman Forever

With that being said, Tim Burton's Michael Keaton led Batmans were the best. The gothic feeling he gave to those movies was great. Michelle Pfeiffer was AMAZING as catwoman. I want to know what fools cast George Clooney and Ben Affleck as Batman?! Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Freeze?! Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl?! Uma Thurman was well cast as Poison Ivy though.",Batman Forever

418,kabeile,"not the worst BATMAN movie, but nearly...",4,25 July 2008,"No this one is not as bad as ""BATMAN AND ROBIN"" but it comes very close. The only thing I like about this movie (as I am a collector and admirer of the BATMAN comic-books) are the melancholic and darker undertones in the scenes with Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer.Val Kilmer is in my opinion the second-best Bruce Wayne/Batman after Christian Bale. His and Nicole Kidman's performances make the movie worth watching.What nearly made me cry, were the totally silly performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey as Two-Face and the Riddler. I think their (or the director's) approach is an offense to everyone who seriously reads the comic books (and as I have nearly everything that was released in Germany in the last 30 years, I count myself in)!!! I will go as far to say, that Jim Carrey played the Riddler as a totally stupid and laughable character which could also be felt in the following years of appearances of the Riddler in the comic-books. Because of this film no one could take the riddler serious any more.So, if you are a kid, who likes to watch the animated series and collect the related comic-books - this is a movie for you. But if you are into the realistic Batman-Comics (DC/BATMAN/LOTDK/SOTB...) you will despise great parts of this movie and only like a few scenes!",Batman Forever
419,beatlemania909,I'm being extremely generous with 5,5,9 August 2010,"If people go around saying that Tim Burton's Batman's were campy and cartoon-ish, then what are the Schumacher films? REALISTIC??? Not even close. Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" were brilliant and classic, dark and gritty with no cartoon in them. ""Batman Forever"", and it's brother ""Batman and Robin"" are foolish, cheesy cartoon films that have hardly anything to offer. Throwing Robin into the film was a desperate move to keep plot going, and really didn't keep me interested at all. I will say that Carrey was a bit of relief, unfortunately Tommy Lee got some pretty bad and cheesy lines, but I will give one of his lines 4 of the 5 stars I've given the film, his great delivery of, ""Why won't you just die?!"", classic. The other star is for his outfits, damn fine material. You want a good Batman film? Watch the first two by Tim Burton, and of course see the Christopher Nolan films. Hell, watch the T.V. show as well, at least that keeps a viewer interested.",Batman Forever
420,falkar,"Underrated, but not good",7,7 April 2004,"I saw this movie recently after buying the DVD collection, and it's nowhere near as bad as people say, but nowhere near as good as it could have been. The drastic change in style between ""Batman Returns"" and this film is indeed jarring, the plot does have some several large holes and the set design is atrocious.However, Kilmer is impressive, having the charm and intelligence to play Bruce Wayne, alongside the imposing build and ""growl"" to be Batman. Jim Carrey more or less plays himself, and while towards the end his performance grates, I did enjoy seeing him take his energetic acting to the character of the Riddler. Chris O'Donnell and Nicole Kidman are given little to do, although I suspect a lot of their scenes were cut from the film. (What happened to the thing about the diary, guys?) Sadly, the extensive amount of screen time given to Carrey puts Two-Face (my favorite Batman villain) and Tommy Lee Jones (a superb actor) firmly in the shade.""Forever"" is a flawed film, but certainly not a bad one. Hopefully we will see an  SE DVD one day, fixing many of the plot holes.

421,kingromulus,Painful on many levels,3,31 October 2018,"When Heath Ledger died, Jack Nicholson said he ""warned him"" this would happen and then made up a lie about how playing the Joker takes you to dark places and does things to your mind. Now just seeing his flat out stupid performance as a thing named The Joker in Batman 1989 and knowing Mark Hamill turned out just fine, you'd know that's a load of bs. Even more so if you know anything about acting.If I were to believe ANY role could have possibly broken the mind of the actor playing it, though, I'd say it was Jim Carey's Riddler in this movie.I don't even know how to put in words how much this movie was a constant assault to all of the senses. I'm not just talking about Aristotle's five. I mean. Every. Sense. Or how over the top crazy it is from start to finish. Or how even though I've hated this movie for my entire life, rewatching it made me realize I didn't hate it enough.But,ButI also realized something more unsettling than anything else. There were some actually really good parts. Val Kilmer, I hate to admit, did a really good job and probably deserves an oscar for that feat. Furthermore, there's this really powerful scene in The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel where there's a flashback of young Bruce Wayne falling into the bat cave for the first time and seeing the bat fly toward him and feeling as though he was just chosen by some massive force or eternal deity. And there's a shot-for-shot line-for-line perfect recreation of that scene in this movie. FOR NO REASON! It has no right to be that good! The animated adaptation of TDKR didn't even do that. Tim Burton sure as heck couldn't do that. But Joel Shumacher did it in his worst movie and I'm furious.",Batman Forever

There is nothing wrong with the film what so ever. Joel Shumaker took a different approach to the direction of the movie but that in no way made it bad. It made it true, true to the comics. Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns are favorites of mine but they are in deed ""darker"" then the original comic book series. In fact in Batman returns Burton actually has Batman kill a guy. There is no way this can be classified a terrible movie when it obviously had the best villains of all the Batman movies. The way Jim Carey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as 2 face, meshed together was fantastic. I honestly believe this is a must see movie for all the Batman fans, and if you want to see a great film check out Batman Begins.",Batman Forever
424,theriddler,My favorite of the series...,6,5 February 2002,"Despite popular opinion, this movie is my favorite of the series. Though I liked the dark vision and extravagant sets of the 1st and 2nd movie (I absolutely hated the garrish, special effects blowout of the 4th), the change to Val Kilmer as Batman I think was a very good one, and wish he would have stayed on for the 4th to save the series from the horrible george clooney as Batman. Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors and him along with Tommy Lee Jones as The riddler and Two-Face is my favorite pair-up...almsot ever. They have great chemistry and Jim Carrey steals the scene as the maniacally evil, but believable,  Riddler. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good as Two-Face, and I particularly enjoyed his hide-out, very suiting. My overall opinion is that this movie perfected the first 2's flaws in acting, but lost the dark feeling to it, without encroaching on the realm of the 4th, with its cartoonish, extravagant feeling and just plain stupid casting and acting.",Batman Forever
425,0dyssey,Batman gets a makeover,4,19 July 2003,"Batman Forever is the start of the decline for the Batman films. I loved the first Batman film and its sequel Batman Returns, but this movie just went completely down hill. Joel Schumacher totally takes the character of Batman in a different direction. Instead of having Batman as a dark mysterious hero who is seeking justice, Schumacher turned him into an over the top gimmick that is closer to the 60's TV show. This film totally goes against all that is Batman'; we see a different Bat-mobile that looks ridiculous, a new Bat-suit (which includes nipples), a new Batman/Bruce Wayne who seems to constantly look confused, and a totally different Gotham City that includes gangs who wear glow in the dark paint. There are so many unnecessary changes I could go on FOREVER. What was Joel Schumacher thinking? He decided to fix something that didn't need fixing. He made a movie that HE would want to see instead of the fans. I cannot describe the story because much of it I didn't understand myself. But here it goes. Batman is chasing the villain Two-Face who blames Batman for his injuries; Two-Face then holds a circus hostage in order to force Batman to reveal his true identity. While this is going on we see the introduction of the soon to be Robin, as well as the second villain The Riddler. Theirs also some stuff about Bruce Wayne's relationship with an attractive yet obsessed doctor. This all comes together, but by the time every character's problems are solved the movies over. This movie spends far too much time on unnecessary action sequences and only focuses on the characters and story while setting up another action sequence. If you liked the first two Batman movies then brace yourself because this one is nowhere near as good.",Batman Forever
426,Pserious,decent.,7,31 July 2003,i like this movie but there are alot of problems. first off the director totally screwed up this franchise because the cinematography is horrible. for god sake there's neon fire! and what kind of street gang dresses in neon face paint! i mean sure its a little scary but its sure as hell not intimidating! plus at times i think that the lighting crew were using strobe lights instead of regular light! the only thing that might do this movie some justice is the fact that Tim Burton produced this movie.,Batman Forever

But it is better than both Batman Returns and Batman & Robin. And many people will agree with me when the special edition - DVD of Batman Forever comes out. It contains deleted scenes and much more. Val Kilmer is a good follower to Michael Keaton. I don't think that anyone could have done a better job. Jim Carrey shines as The Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two - Face is good. The only problem is that Two - Face is forgotten the minute The Riddler comes on the screen. Chris O'Donnell does a fun job as Robin, and he dosen't overact. The drama in the film is good, and feels real. Nicole Kidman is alright, better than kim Basinger in the first one. I like the change on the Batcave and the car. The music is awful, and so is the bat costume with nipples. not to mention the closeups of the butts on Batman and Robin. OK, there has to be something for the girls to look at to, but the homo erotic - style dosen't belong in a Batman - film.

428,dan_of_the_year,The better one of Schumacher's Batman movies.,7,23 June 2006,"I recently celebrated my 23'rd birthday, when I got the 2-disc Special Edition of Batman Forever. As it is still fresh in my memory, along with the bonus features, I figured I'd write my review.The year was 1995 and I was 12 years old. I went to see Batman Forever and I had a blast. Out of all four movies predating Batman Begins, which is my favorite Batman movie ever, this is my favorite. Fine, a lot of people hate Schumacher's Batman movies and often associate them with bad comic book films, but truly BF is far superior to B&R which sadly was a train wreck.Sure, both of them share a lot of things that made them so hated, such as the nippled rubber costumes and the over-use of neon. Lucky for me, I am a very indulgent person and can overlook this to see the things I did like. I still love the costumes and the production design, warts and all. I have trouble understanding why so many dislike Goldenthal's operatic score, but then I am much of a drama geek myself so I'm probably a bit biased.Some say Val Kilmer has not much of an acting range but as I see it he plays a very cold and tormented Bruce Wayne, a lot better than George Clooney did. The Robin story is played off very well, but I must say I would've survived without the love story between Bruce and Chase. The villains are great, especially Jim Carrey's Riddler, while it's too bad Two-Face doesn't get to do as much even though Tommy Lee Jones succeeds in playing a homicidal psycho. I've even heard Carrey was intimidated by him on the set and if another actor can make him feel uncomfortable he can't be all that bad. Sure, they're both very over-the-top but remember that these characters have existed in Batman's universe ever since the 40's.As I watched the DVD features it hit me that all of the filmmakers got inspiration from their own experiences with Batman, e.g. Schumacher who said he grew up with the old campy comic books. Even if you don't have to like the final result you can't say that their personal views of Batman is wrong, since they're fans just like everyone else.After watching the deleted scenes I wish they would release a director's cut with them included. I especially think of Two-Face escaping Arkham, Bruce's discussion with Dick at the gym and the confrontation with the giant bat in the cave, with some proper editing done to the latter one.Long story short, Batman Forever isn't perfect but still quite entertaining. Many of the mistakes done in this or rather Batman & Robin still haunt a lot of fans, but the way I see it many lessons were learned from that, which is why we got Batman Begins, a portrayal truly worthy of the Dark Knight.",Batman Forever
429,spimpulse2003,how stupid,5,22 January 2006,"this movie was one of Jim Carey's tommy lee Jones' val kilmer's, and Nicole kidman's worst movie ever.The entire movie was just horrible right from the beginning and why the hell was this movie so campy oh yeah thats right Joel Schumacher, and Akiva Goldsman did the movie. the only great team's on a batman have been the Tim Burton, and Sam hamm team, and the Chris Nolan, and goyer team. Goldsman, and Schumacher must be gay with each other due to the fact that i thought it was all around bad acting, and villains weren't as menacing as they should have been and two-face was done horrible, and just the riddler looked like a homosexual at the end of the movie, and just all around the movie was horrible.In the movie Bruce and takes on the new sidekick of robin, but heres the thing two-face had nothing to do with the murder of robin's parents so why did this happen? Another thing is that they screwed up the riddler because he never mastered and i mean never mastered the ability to take out peoples thoughts that was the mad hatter that could enslave the human mind. Face and riddler were never connected as being partners since riddler thought he was too smart to be partnered, but on occasion he may have briefly worked with another villain but did not remain for long. In the end of the movie the riddler becomes a brain dead person, WTF! The riddler never became brain dead, he only became more insane.I recommend to all if you have this movie please burn it, because it may very well taint your homes, and if you haven't seen this movie take my advice and don't see it, because it is just that much of a waste of time.",Batman Forever

I'm not saying this movies perfect (i did cringe in some particular moments) but when you look at the film as a whole, I find it very entertaining.

434,roybrady,"I liked the cold dark Batman, what happened?",5,2 November 2002,"Let's face it: I'm young. I didn't grow up watching the corny ""Bam!Pow! To the Batcave, Robin!"" Batman of yesteryears, and I could care less for them. Doesn't any one think that Adam West is just a little too ""normal"" to be playing a tights-wearing vigilante who does it because his parents were murdered in a dark alley before his eyes (if this isn't the true origins of the original Batman, anyone, feel free to e-mail me)?Tim Burton's Batman was awesome. He was dark, and he did what any person in that Batman's shoes would do: relentlessly hunt criminals, no matter what the cost. I'm not a big Keaton fan, but I must say: Michael Keaton performed the part flawlessly and best yet, looked the parts he was actually playing. While the suit does most of the acting as Batman, he looked like a Bruce Wayne, a person whose innocence was totally crushed at a young age and thus didn't grow up a pretty boy millionaire.  This is the fault in picking Val Kilmer.  While he does a decent job (he's better in The Saint, in my opinion), he just doesn't look the part. On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as Two-Face, though a little overboard in spots in my opinion, but how come Harvey Dent has become so conspicuously white, wasn't he black in the first film, with Billy Dee Williams filling the shoes? Jim Carrey plays an excellent psychopath, but Nigma was more than that, he was also rather ingenious, and that doesn't come across in the flick.The other main problem is the lack of any consistency between the first two movies and the new ones. The old Gotham was dark, dreary and seemed like the perfect den for criminals like  Joker and the others. The Gotham of Adam West was too bright. Abnormal criminals like Joker don't come from normal little towns. These were bizarre demented human minds. Less to say: it was unrealistic, and Tim Burton made it something believable, how these events and people came about. Joel Schumacher, on the other hand, turned Gotham into a Vegas wannabe, what with the behemoth statues bearing highways that seems to stand miles above ground and the hundreds of neon lights constantly surging about. Who was he trying to appeal to? There was already a new fan base with the first two movies that was expecting the same old shadowiness, NOT Las Vegas on the east coast.Not aforementioned is Robin: let's face it. Do we really need a Boy Wonder? Not only do I find Chris O'Donnell repulsive in this film, and in most of his others, the Robin character does not fit into this universe at all, or at least, it wasn't introduced very properly.In fact, the entire setting of this movie is just wrong. While I've already ranted on about Gotham, it's also everything else that just seems so blatantly wrong. Everything: the over-blown usage of Two-Face's split personalities to Nigma's home quarters. The first two films pushed the envelope on certain aspects of believability, but Forever just blows it so far out of proportion that it all goes to crap.Unfortunately, it doesn't get better after this one. Sorry, Arnold! And who thought of casting Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy?! Bring back Tim Burton and Denise di Novi. Their Batman is the best. Over Adam West, and certainly over Kilmer and Clooney. And for God's sake, someone put Schumacher out of his misery. It's time for that horse to go to pasture for the last time.",Batman Forever
435,robert-w-andrews,"Riddle me this, what is the expected outcome of a production with a lack of realism and endless stupidity?",3,11 October 2012,"Considering the indisputable disappointment of the unpromising ""Batman Returns"" the absence of Tim Burton as director of this reboot certainly would have created an optimistic atmosphere, as instead Burton returns as one of two producers. However with Burton's absence Joel Schumacher does nothing to amend the previous films mistakes and instead further plunges the Batman saga into disarray and failure, as ""Batman Forever"" not only provides little justice to the comics or the original 1989 ""Batman"", but somehow manages to offer a production even more unsatisfying and inadequate than its insufficient predecessor.With the potential to deliver an at least enjoyable plot, the prolonged absurd events that transpire throughout result in an unthinkable and preposterous narrative in place of a previously optimistic outlook. In this appalling reboot Batman is forced to do battle with both The Riddler and Two Face, as their criminal agendas leave Gotham City in potential Peril. Unable to take down his villainous adversaries alone, The Caped Crusader has no choice but to converge with an inexperienced and irrational sidekick, ""Robin"". The plot simply fails to offer any suspense or tension due to an undesired collection of ludicrous events that have transformed Batman into something of a comical nightmare.At the centre of the plot, the Riddler's grand scheme to outdo the Caped Crusader along side his criminal accomplice offers little in terms realism and is utterly preposterous, as the dark tone that Burton set within the plot of his original Batman production has been utterly diminished. With a constant feeling of stupidity and thoughtlessness from the start to the thankful finish the inclusion of Robin was a risky decision that unsurprisingly failed to pay off, as his inferior and irritable figure in popular culture transfers over to this painful production and only serves to worsen it extensively. Schumacher's mistakes continue with the disappointing disregard for Burton's original lighting style. Tim Burton's iconic choice of lighting and colour pallet previously had allowed Gotham to be viewed as a hellish and criminally diseased city in chaos, yet with Schumacher's arrival this lighting associated master piece is disregarded along with any potentially realistic and pragmatic events. Instead Schumacher creates a disturbingly luminous and artificial appearance for Gotham City, as nothing in terms of the setting seems genuine as it only serves to add to the lack of realism that is a reoccurring issue throughout. The casting choices do little to amend the films endless failures within its visuals and plot, as the performances from this collection of poorly represented characters fall short of satisfactory quality. Val Kilmer, a casting as surprising as any arrives as the 3rd actor to play Batman and with high standards set by Michael Keaton this only adds further to the second rate performance the viewers are subjected to. Kilmer's performance much like the deteriorated visuals purely lacks authenticity, as despite a satisfactory performance as the masked vigilante his portrayal of Bruce Wayne are where the true faults lie. His dialogue at times seems lifeless, yet the main issue is in his appearance as Kilmer just doesn't strike you as the alter ego leading billionaire which is not surprising when attaching himself to the most unsuited pair of ancient glasses that are constantly at his disposal. The second of the films heroes Chris O'Donnell as Robin delivers everything you would expect of the second class hero, unfortunately not in a positive way. Standing as inferior to Batman, his irrational and narrow minded attitude is undesired to say the least as this leads to Robin being a severely irritable and unlikable character. His dialogue in particular results in disastrous on screen line deliverance that both heroes are equally responsible for. Evenmoreso Nicole Kidman's role as Dr. Chase Meridian is equally as disappointing and fault ridden. The performance simply is unpolished, as her dialogue at times as well as her prematurely developed focus point in the narrative (her role as a psychologist) needed a lot more crucial attention.Surprisingly the villains in retrospect succeed in only just outshining their heroic adversaries. Jim Carrey manages to steal the spotlight in his portrayal of the Riddler, yet despite lacking the initial intellectual side seen in the comics (although it is somewhat attempted), the wacky lunatic approach Carrey adopts at times is certainly comical, not to mention the inclusion of a very creative costume design and dialogue is one of the films guilty pleasures. This performance allows him to stand as the figure head for the style Schumacher has created, despite this being a most likely unwanted title. His villainous counterpart Two Face however lacks this likability as Tommy Lee Jones' performance is a huge factor in branding Batman Forever as an anti climax title. Although Jones' employs a welcoming aggressive style for his portrayal of the coin wielding criminal as well as engaging in a fairly impressive on screen chemistry with Jim Carrey in at least a comical manner, a lot of extensive symbolism ruins a potentially accomplished performance. Not to mention the poor make up design of Two Face is not only inaccurate but visually idiotic. A considerable amount of failure surrounds Jones' performance due to Two Face's absence in the original 1989 ""Batman"". His absence in Burton's first production in terms of Dent's criminal persona evidently caused a high level of anticipation in light of his appearance in this shameful production, as Jones' performance simply didn't live up to expectations set by eager fans. After high hopes were initially set after the failures surrounding Tim Burton's previous instalment, nothing is improved on in its shameful predecessor thanks to Schumacher's unwelcoming style.It is clear that absence of both Tim Burton and Michael Keaton damaged the film extensively, as Gotham City now stands as an artificial wasteland worsened extensively by poor performances and a disastrous plot, as Schumacher's overly imaginative style has ensured Batman Forever's reputation as an utter failure to successfully reboot a deteriorating franchise.",Batman Forever

Batman (Kilmer) finds out that Two-Face (Jones) has escaped and is intent on killing him, blaming him for what happened to his face. Meanwhile in his alter ego Bruce Wayne, Batman must deal with an employee who thinks he is the wave of the electronics future. Bruce turns down his idea and he completely flips, turning him eventually into the Riddler (Carrey), after murdering his supervisor. If this isn't enough for Bruce to deal with he now accepts police chief Gordon's request for him to take in the newly orphaned Dick Grayson who will eventually uncover the Batcave and become Robin (O'Donnell). Ruining Gotham, which is supposed to be Gothic, with neon lights was their 1st bad idea. Then having flashback's to his Bruce's traumatic childhood, which was already explained to us in part one was around 20 minutes of boredom. Batman leaping from impossible heights and landing flawlessly was kind of corny. But it does have a pretty good ending which I will not spoil in case you haven't watched it.

438,scottgodfrey,A film which is more than worth the watch,8,27 December 2005,"Batman Forever works well on certain levels. The film was directed quite well and was very well cast in most places.The story starts when Bruce Wayne/Batman(Kilmer) turns down Edward Nygma's/The Riddler's invention to suck IQ's out of people who watch TV and receive the information himself. He teams up with the mad Two Face(Jones). With the help of Dick Drayson/Robin( O'Donell)and Dr. Chase Meridian(Kidman) this film is a enjoyable adventure that needs to be watched if you are a fan of the lighter Batman series in the 60's with quite a bit of darkness!The Good Val Kilmer played Bruce Wayne and Batman very well, with a don't mess with me attitude and a silent trauma act, that was Award worthy. Nicole Kidman also displayed a brilliant performance (yet again) her deep husky voice was brilliant and her portrayal of a Comic Book Love interest was brilliant. The music was brilliant, yet again, with a theme tune (Kiss from a Rose by Seal) and a very good orchestral soundtrack. The OK Tommy Lee Jones, played Two Face well in some scenes but in other scenes didn't display evilness and greed like Two Face was in the Comics. Chris O'Donell was O.K at playing Robin but the character was whiny and annoying so that put me off the film a tad bit.The Bad Jim Carrey was funny as usual in this feature but it had a little touch of the Jim Carrey show and there is a certain camp feature about the Riddler. I don't know if this was added intentionally but it is a little distracting.Apart from that this film is a very enjoyable Movie with some solid performances and good direction!

Gotham City ain't dark no more, it looks like it has been taken of a comic book which makes it look good to be fair. This movie definitely has a comic book feel into it. Batman is more acrobatic in case of h is fighting abilities and it also the first time we see Bruce fight without the mask.

445,hawks50,Competent though uninspired entry,7,26 July 2008,"Batman Forever is competently put together and certainly watchable, though a touch disappointing after Burton's 'Batman Returns'. Kilmer is all right as Batman and Nicole Kidman brings glamor to her role as Chase Meridian (!). Tommy Lee Jones is suitably hammy as Two-Face, but alas, is mostly upstaged by Jim Carrey (The Riddler). Carrey goes for non stop mugging in front of the camera. While watchable initially, his act quickly becomes boring and he's not good enough to convey any real depth to his character. Schumacher's Gotham is bright and colorful, and much more family friendly than Burton's vision. There are loud explosions and numerous set-pieces, some of which are well put together.Bottomline: 7/10 Competent entry to the series, though Carrey annoys",Batman Forever
446,hsjung,Cheasy,3,31 August 2008,"this film was soooooo gay. Unlike the dark mood of Gotham city from the previous 2 films, Gotham city feels too light. Tim Burton portrayed Batman as a cool fearless but still heroic person but in Batman Forever, Batman has turned in to a sissy, showing fear and pain when beaten. Stunts were also too simple. Previous 2 films did not have Batman simply go into direct fist fight but had him perform dangerous stunts from high buildings. But there's too much fist fight scenes in this film. It's good that they showed the origin of Robin but the costume design for both Batman and Robin were gay. Why show nipples and penis while it could be much cooler flat looking like the costume from 1989 one. This film is Childish, it really is. The director went beyond the real heroic theme. It wasn't heroic at all, it was childish. I say people should never watch this film, it's a total waste of time or money.",Batman Forever

449,perfectunion_2005,The decline of the Batman movies in the 90's,7,12 May 2012,"(I'm not sure if this has spoilers but just in case) While this film completely ruins the atmosphere and best qualities about Batman, there are glimpses of the darkness and no-nonsense Batman sometimes here which save it from being a total disaster.For starters, Val Kilmer is a decent enough Bruce Wayne but only 40% of the time does he keep the brooding and intimidating presence as Batman that made criminals afraid. The other 60% of the time, Batman isn't the reclusive Dark Knight. Instead, he engages in intellectual conversations, cracks jokes, acts like a pop culture icon, and doesn't have the intensity Micheal Keaton or even Christian Bale have in the role.Jim Carrey was not a good pick for the Riddler because he basically acts like a more over the top Joker with silly one-liners and way too much comedy for a Batman movie. The Riddler's actual back-story isn't really that bad but The Riddler has class and elegance in the comic books and someone like that should've been casted. The only time Jim Carrey isn't being goofy and is somewhat legitimate to me is when he plays the alter ego ""Edward Nigma"".I'm not sure where to begin with Two-Face. I think the smart thing to do would've been to cast Billy Dee Williams and actually develop his back-story more so we understand why he is the way he is. Instead, Two-Face is just played like a generic psychopath with a bunch of goons who teams up with the Riddler later on. Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor and did the best with what he was given but he should never have played that part.Nicole Kidman's character could've been written better as a therapist/psychiatrist who has a thing for Batman. Some of the flirtatious scenes between her and Val Kilmer made me take the film even less seriously. Bottomline, as a love interest, she could've worked if her lines and a couple of her scenes with Bruce/Batman were cut.Finally, we come to Robin. Chris O'Donnell actually was a good choice and his part in the story was written well and placed well. The end where they finally team up ""officially"" against the 2 main villains is goofy, extremely far-fetched, and somewhat campy. The reason for this is actually because of how the villains and their plots were written; Batman and Robin were actually the only good part about the end.Tim Burton was only a producer on this movie because Warner Bros. told him to take a hike after Batman Returns when Burton actually was eager to make another Batman movie. Even though ""Batman Forever"" has it's good moments throughout the film, a good film should provide decent entertainment the whole way through. While it isn't a terrible movie like some say, it's not a great movie either. This movie always leaves me thinking, ""What would've happened had Warner Bros. not treated Tim Burton so badly?""",Batman Forever
450,oliverrhodesdopeypandas,Nostalgic Forever--Worthwhile Forever,5,26 August 2012,"Simple. Batman Forever takes a whole new direction of Burton's first two masterpieces that do dominate these. Burton and Keaton aren't in this one. It's all more open for mainstream and basically dulled the characters to less details and less energizing characters I'd expect as Burton and Nolan achieved. The actors don't fit with the rolls, except Alfred who stays the same dude he was even in Burton's films. I can say, this one was very nostalgic and very mesmerizing to me because I remember seeing the intro over and over because of how retro and comic-like it was. It's more comic-bookish than realistic. But I enjoy watching it even though it's dull creativity and lack of effort Schumacher put in. Burton, would've brought this film with his style of course but it would've topped this one off but sometimes, you can't erase what's written in stone--Forever.",Batman Forever

And then it goes downhill from there, in a neon mess. The first two Burton films were great - this isn't even in the same room. It's cartoonish, badly acted and lazily directed. The whole effort is unsure whether or not it wants to be semi - serious or cheesily camp,and as a result it fails badly at both. Kilmer is wooden, Carrey is irritating and Kidman is a pointless romantic subplot. Tommy Lee Jones as Two - Face is a bad Joker rip - off. The addition of Robin was clearly designed to appeal to pre - adolescent boys. Let me just say I was a pre - adolescent boy in 1995 and I thought Robin was, as the Americans say, lame.

452,kane_e87,could of been great,3,27 January 2005,"this movie had potential to be great, didn't live up to its expectations, Val Kilmor could of been a great Batman, he was a letdown not because it was his fault, it was because the director of this film did not give him a good script, lines like ""its the car right"" ""chicks dig the car"", are not lines you would expect from Batman.the villains are not that great either, in the cartoon series the Riddler is smart he doesn't try to be funny, Jim Carey takes his role as the Riddler a bit to fore.What about Two Face hes character is very similar to the Jocker, in the cartoon series he is a serious character, with two personalities, in this movie we hardly see those two personalities, we see him as a funny character.Nicole Kidman isn't flashy as Doctor Meridian, but she is only there to be the love of Bruce Wayne.Chris O'Donnell like Val Kilmor, could of been a better Robin but failed, but still he was better in this one compared to the sequel to this movie.If there were any positives to this movie, i would probably say it had some dark moments in it, and the soundtrack to this movie is great.The music from Seal kiss from a rose is a great song for any movie.overall i give it a 3, a disappointing film.",Batman Forever

Every actor suited their role perfectly. Val Kilmer (Batman/ Bruce Wayne) provides a great performance as the caped crusader (not as good as Michael Keaton). The film has a pretty solid storyline with good music and effects.Cons:Gotham City changes from a gothic-dangerous metropolis to a neon-art deco 90s music video. The films villains are highly over the top. Carey (Riddler) and Jones (Two-Face) would have suited a more serious version of their characters. The film has wacky and corny writing. Lastly, Dr Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) is used as a love interest for Batman and Bruce Wayne with no personality and is a very one dimensional character.",Batman Forever

The only thing worse than the horrible direction, stupid looking neon lights, and wooden performances by Val Kilmer & Nicole Kidman was the exaggerated performance and actions of Jim Carrey. Having not seen this since it was in the theater, I was surprised at how awful it wascartoonish, unbelievable, horrible acting, and a nonexistent plot. It was visually and mentally offensive. In many places, with all of the neon lights and bad face paint, it felt like a high school production gone horribly awry.Quite possibly the only redeeming factor of this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, who really does make for a great villain. Funny everyone mentions Carrey, I believe he was completely outdone by Jones. Don't see this movie. At least ""Batman & Robin"" hit a plateau of bad that it was hysterical.",Batman Forever
458,Quik87,An Improvment from the last,9,2 March 2002,"Batman Forever is probably the most unique film in the Batman film franchise, because it's not too light and too campy like ""Batman and Robin"" it's not strange and wierd like ""Batman Returns"" and it doesn't exactly excell like 1989's ""Batman"" Batman Forever was butchered and taken apart leaving many plot holes, and adding elements to the story that just don't seem to have a purpose (ie The Red Book, which is actually pivital to the film's plot) It seems as if director Joel Schuamcher chose the wrong script at the wrong time. This script, being the best in the series, was written to be dark and meancing, much like 1989's ""Batman"" but after the big mess with 1992's ""Batman Returns"" WB needed to go in a different direction, they chose this script because it was the best not realising that with the right tone, and the right amount of talent infront and behind the camera (which they already had) this could have been the best film in the franchise. The problem is is since WB was wanting a lighter version of the dark knight, most of the scenes that set the darker tone were cut out and replaced with scenes like ""Dick doing his laundry."" It's because of this 1995's ""Batman Forever"" isn't the bestin the franchise,  I'm sure, however my opinion will change if a Specail Edition DVD is released with all the deleted scenes. This movie is great, pick it up, well worth watching.",Batman Forever

Nicole Kidman and Michael Gough also have decent performances. On the other hand, the villains in this film are very memorable but not for good reasons... Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones play their worst roles of all-time as the Riddler and Two-Face. Two-Face jumps straight into the movie with no character development whatsoever. Since he's also Harvey Dent we can assume this film is a reboot of the other two films. The Riddler plays the weirdest character in the history of film in my opinion. Complete randomness surrounds this character. Both villains are way too eccentric to take seriously as villains that plan to take over Gotham City. With these two characters the film is ruined.

I mean Im not saying that is surpasses the Burton series but for what the actors had with a shitty script, it was entertaining. Val Kilmer as Batman/Bruce Wayne was fantastic. He was a very good replacement for Michael Keaton ( who in my mind is the best ). Chris O'Donnel was bit old for Robin but I felt he was a good choice. My only complaints about the film is...1. Gotham looks like Toykio...WTF 2. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face was horrible. 3. Jim Carrey could have been a bit more serious. 4.

462,freddiedeighton,"Riddle Me This, Riddle Me That, why was I not given a better act?",6,3 August 2013,"It's quite sad for me to watch Batman Forever, because it just doesn't live up to the first Batman film (Tim Burton's successful dark noir). Granted though, it is much better than it's sequel, Batman & Robin.An interesting thing I find is that the film is reasonably well cast; Val Kilmer isn't as awful as Clooney - doesn't really live up to Keaton and definitely not Bale - , Tommy Lee Jones was actually a pretty good casting for Harvey Dent/ Two-Face and Jim Carrey is...alright - he plays himself...again. Though I must talk about the Riddler, he is my all time favourite Batman villain. In the comics and the Arkham games, he is a mysterious man - in fact, he's a bit like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise - and has brilliant dress sense, these are the reasons I love him as a character. In Joel Schumacher's attempt, he is compelety the opposite; he is loud and has no panache, he could be slightly mysterious at times; like when he left all sorts of clues for Bruce, however, even then he started shouting about it. Don't even get me started on his attire - a full body spandex suit, true to the early comics but not the Riddler I fell in love with! Nicole Kidman's part was utterly pointless. Where did Vicki Vale and Selina Kyle disappear off to in the last films? Why is it that in every one of the Burton/Schumacher series, Batman has to have a different love interest? Heeesh, it really just riles me up!!!If this film had had a better director, this could have been my favourite Batman film, but it just didn't work. The villains were just copies of Jack Nicholson's Joker, there's a pointless love interest and Robin's origin story just bored me! There's another thing! If this movie wasn't a take back to the dreaded Adam West Batman, Robin's origin would have been amazing. Robin's origin still hasn't been done to my standards, Dark Knight Rises' attempt was a blatant shove-in! They just said his name was Robin! How was that relevant?I think if Tim Burton had directed this, It would have been quite good but he would probably make the same mistake as Schmacher did and just make it a second-rate version of his first film. He did the same thing in Batman Returns, by ignoring source material and just turning the Penguin into a shorter and more disgusting Joker - Penguin is not a psycho, like Joker, he is a criminal mastermind, a bit like Bane only no where near as strong. Though I think Tim Burton would have cast Johnny Depp as the Riddler and that may have had potential but my ideal cast to make this film so much better would be: Batman - Christian Bale (obviously), although it probably be Keaton, I don't think Bale was old enough at the time of the making of this movie. Two- Face - Harrison Ford Riddler - Neil Patrick Harris/David TennantAnd of course, Christopher Nolan should direct!Riddler's objective in this film is a bit ludicrous as well, Riddler wants to get at Batman because he wants to prove that he is more intelligant than the World's Greatest Detective, he doesn't want to take over Gotham! Oh, and he mostly always works alone, so he probably would have killed Two-Face, not asked for his help!The film gets its rating just because the Riddler was in it, though it would have been higher if he was given a better performance.People who will like this: Children under 11, JIm Carrey fansPeople who won't like this: DC Comics fans, Riddler fans",Batman Forever

Nicole Kidman is stunning in her biggest commercial role to date. Chris O'Donnell is delightfully perky as Robin. Jim Carrey steals the show as the Riddler. The stunts are fun, the jokes hit, and the cast has an amazing chemistry. The only poor spot is Tommy Lee Jones, who was horribly miscast as Two-Face.

465,dlr_13,A One-Shot,6,11 April 2008,"If nothing else, Batman Forever is like a cinematic one-shot comic book. For those not familiar with the term ""one-shot comic book"", it means a stand alone story that lasts only for one issue and does not have to be part of the traditional canon. The result is essentially a mixed bag of characterizations, but nevertheless a film that mostly entertains, but at the same time provided a foundation for downfall.This film has Batman (Val Kilmer) contending with both Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and, who are in cahoots in their attempts to get rid of Batman and Bruce Wayne respectively. This goes on as Bruce Wayne, Batman and criminal psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) are going through a strange love triangle. Bruce Wayne also adopts young Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) as his ward after the death of Grayson's parents, and eventually takes him under his wing as his sidekick Robin in his fight against crime.When it was released in 1995, the most surprising element came in the direction the film took. Gone was the dark, macabre playground that existed in the Burton films, but instead, a more campy and light-hearted experience. Schumacher's Gotham City is neon-lit and grandiose, and the visuals as a result are engaging. The tone of the film has far more humor compared to the predecessors, sort of a mild throwback to the 1966 series. The soundtrack is also lighter, as heard in Elliott Goldenthal's score and U2 and Seal's theme songs.Kilmer does a somewhat decent job as Batman and is better as Bruce Wayne compared to Michael Keaton. Kilmer's Bruce Wayne in this film is shown as he should be: a celebrity and socialite, rather than a morose recluse. O'Donnell is more Jason Todd than Dick Grayson, in that he is more petulant and reckless than Dick Grayson should be (just to clarify for those who don't know, Jason Todd was the second Robin in the comic book series who was known as an angry miscreant). Chase Meridian, created for this film, is a mixed bag, but Kidman does a good job of making her as alluring as possible.Carrey is entertaining to watch, but he is far too manic as the Riddler, who should be more calculating than zany. Jones gives the worst interpretation of all the comic book characters, in that his Two-Face is not really Two-Face. Rather than being a conflicted, morally complex foe, he is simplified into a weird manic-depressive and being more silly than menacing. The way he referred to himself as ""we"" was completely off and the scene where he flips his coin repeatedly was completely wrong, as Two-Face would always accept the first outcome of his coin flips. This was particularly disappointing, given that Two-Face is perhaps one of the most tragic villains in comic book history, given his transition from being a legal crusader against injustice (and one of Bruce Wayne's closest friends) into a super-criminal bent on destroying the system he once fought for.The interesting paradox of Batman Forever is that there is sort of an attempt at investigating and attempting to delve deeper into the characters, but that comes at the expense of many of the characters being true to the comic books. In a way, one can sympathize with Warner Brothers decision to make the film lighter, as it is, theoretically speaking of course, better business, given how violent and grim Batman Returns was. This caused the film however to take too many deviations from the comic book to be an effective adaptation. Because it was campy, that set the stage for Batman and Robin to become an atrocity. Furthermore, Schumacher's name with casual and hardcore fans has become synonymous with the sequel to this film, thus hurting the credibility of Batman Forever. As a committed Batman fan, I do feel there are problems with the way the characters were portrayed. However, as a film-goer, I was entertained by what I saw and took it for what it was: cinematic comfort food.",Batman Forever
466,Jes8884,Batmans back in fine form forever!,9,3 July 2005,"After an off the wall sequel Burton makes a fast exit, enter the Schumacher era. This film is a vast improvement over Returns and has a better cast. Kilmer portrays a more darker Batman and O'Donnell is the perfect Batboy sidekick. Kidman in my opinion was the best love interest in the series and the sexiest of all. Carrey was perfect for the Riddler and will make you laugh more then the Joker from the first Batman. The Goldenthal score is no were near as good as Elfmans, but fits good with the neon over the top Gotham city. To me the worst things of this movie is that Gotham may not be the sideshow like it was in Returns, but the neon ballroom look is no better. I wish they would go back to the Gothic look of the first film. Jones is another sore spot for the film as he over acts Two-Face. Two-Face should be a person that is torn not a raving madman.

The batsuit used for most of the movie is the best suit used in the series even with the nipples, the cape actually has a purpose. This movie seems like it was ripped form the pages of a Batman comic book and is fun which is what it should be.Val Kilmer is actually a huge upgrade over Micheal Keaton who was just too stiff both as Bruce Wayne and as Batman. Kilmer makes a believable Bruce Wayne, and is more athletic in the role of Batman.

I thought the original Batman movie (1989) was fantastic, and I know a lot of people actually disliked Batman Returns but I still thought it was a very good, entertaining movie.

471,Hades06,Blasphemous of the Batman property,2,26 May 1999,"Whereas the first two films in the series were moody, stylish, creative, and intriguing, this third trades all of that for senseless eye candy and ridiculous characterizations. Two-Face became a joke-cracking buffoon and the Riddler, a prancing joke. The city became neon and incredibly fake. Scenes were illogical and added merely to showcase special effects (Batmobile climbing the wall- what purpose did that serve?). Batman himself was laughable with  increasingly cheezy gadgets and embarrassing breaks in character (using his alter-ego to further his relationship with Dr. Meridian- never!)I realize that Warner wanted the franchise to be more main-stream after the disappointing box-office of Batman Returns but that is no excuse to make Batman and his nemises a joke. The ridiculous cartoon that these movies have become is truly a shame after the first two installments in the series were such visionary treats. Joel Schumacher should be ashamed of himself for turning one of the world's foremost heroes into a mockery.",Batman Forever

477,BatgirlBegins,Severely underrated,9,16 September 2006,"I really don't understand the criticism that this movie receives. Some people compare it to Batman & Robin, a truly awful movie, but Batman Forever actually accomplishes what it set out to do quite well. The actors (big names like Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones, Val Kilmer, Chris O'Donnell, and Nicole Kidman) fit well into their roles. The plot is quite simple: Batman vs. the duo (or should I say trio!) of Two-Face and the Riddler.Now for a little more about the casting: Jim Carrey is a funny man, and I think that no one else would have been as fun to watch. Sure, he acts the same way in every movie, but you have to like it. How could you not? Chris O'Donnell was likable as Robin. I think the casting directors and screen writers made a wise choice in picking an actor older than the Robin character is supposed to be. I know that this a complaint among fans, but it made a lot more sense and actually helped the film. Two-Face was not portrayed in this movie like he is in the comics, but I still liked Tommy Lee Jones in the role. Nicole Kidman adds to this movie as well. She had the right look. She reminds me of a living comic book character, even though she was not in the Batman comics.Val Kilmer gets his own paragraph because he's a bad ass. I think that he was perfect for the character. He was actually believable as Bruce Wayne, which I think Michael Keaton had a harder time with. Though I probably like Michael Keaton's Batman better, I like Val's Bruce Wayne better. Val has such a low voice. Specifically when he is yelling at Robin in the bat cave. Val Kilmer is so cool! He can do no wrong! I think the reason that this movie is set apart from other movies is the unique look that it has. Many people hate the colors, but I think that they makes it look like a living, breathing comic book. There is still a gritty sense of darkness in Gotham, but it is a unique world that you cannot figure out. It's surreal.Watching this movie is a feast for the eyes. I actually like to pause this movie at points and just stare at the scene. Some shots are just so beautiful. There is one scene in particular that sticks in my mind. It is when Batman and Dr. Chase Meridian are talking next to the bat signal on top of the building. I love the colors behind them. The look is unbelievable! This alone makes the movie worth a watch.Anyone who tries to take this movie too seriously is going to be disappointed because Batman Forever is not meant to be dark, tortured, or sad. It's supposed to be triumphant, a little over-dramatic, and somewhat loony. Despite all of this, I don't think that you can say that this is a kids movie. It can be enjoyed by all ages. It has a mass appeal that the other Batman movies were not able to capture. If you ask hardcore Batman fans what their favorite movie is, they'll most likely say either Batman 89, Batman Returns, or Batman Begins. However, if you ask any random person on the street which one they like the most, they are most likely to say Batman Forever.The moral of this story is that people who are huge fans of the Batman character don't immediately gravitate towards this movie, but the general public appreciates it more. I think that sums up the movie. It is a piece of pop culture that has style as well as edge-of-your-seat action. But don't immediately write-off Batman Forever as a dime-a-dozen action film, because there is so much more to be enjoyed. For example, the costumes, sets, and props are top notch.If nothing more, this movie is an entertaining way to spend two hours. I've seen it at least fifteen times, and it is still as good as the first time I saw it back in 1995.",Batman Forever

480,soontobedeparted,Great Cast - Just went wrong...,7,12 February 2008,"This film had an amazing cast. All 5 lead roles had proved track records, seemed perfect for what would be such a popular film at the time.Sadly, the film's target audience was wrong, trying to appeal to young teenagers and children, and ultimately the film flopped due to Tim Burton's two efforts.Carrey's Riddler character can be considered too similar to the Joker due to their interest in laughter, whilst Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones)is similar to the Joker too as both men's faces lead to their madness and evilness.Ultimately, the film is dark, yet not dark enough. Batman is made out to be a great hero in this and 'Batman and Robin' when he really is searching for revenge - shown by Burton in the first two films.This is a good film, with Carrey's being the best performance. Kidman wasn't needed as the female role was just too simple. I guess, even if the film is a bit cheesy, and essentially a young person's film, big names are drawn to be Batman, the villains and the heroine. It's a disappointment, yet an enjoyable film.",Batman Forever
481,silent_watchman,The Descent Into Failure,5,4 August 2002,"After seeing this movie, I can see why so many people wanted Schumacher's head on a stick.  This movie is almost a comical farce compared to the gems Burton had produced with the previous two films.  Gone is the dark tone and in with some sort of lighthearted tone which Batman does NOT need!  This is a dark story, not a fun romp through the field.  Why were Batman fans cursed with Schumacher's input I'll never know.While Kilmer's performance was not up to Keaton's, it does serve as a poor man's alternative.  Nicole Kidman does her part well with no real blemishes, which only makes me feel more sympathy for her, as she's stuck in a movie like this.  Chris O'Donnell's motivation was probably to look pretty for the ladies, as he puts on a attitude reserved for high school students.
Tommy Lee as Two-Face was the best of the two villains in the movie and probably the best of all the performances, although his character not only contradicts what was set in the first film (Harvey Dent in the original was played by Billy Dee Williams) but also how Two-Face acts in the comic (Two-Face does NOT use third person when talking about himself in the comics).  Although the award for worst villain in the movie and possibly the whole series (Arnold and Uma at the top of the list) would have to be Carrey's annoying portrayal of The Riddler.  While Carrey's comic attitude and animated performance would go well in another movie, they do NOT belong in a Batman movie.  His whole outlook on this film in general is one big game.  When he appeared and spoke for the first time, I knew that this film was doomed.  Carrey simply does not belong in a movie like this.
Schumacher's 'dream' was every Batman fan's nightmare.  Anatomically correct Batman and Robin suits, cheesy special effects, annoying characters leave many people wondering why Schumacher was allowed to direct this film at all.  The film doesn't totally disappoint, as is does make an okay way for you to waste two hours.  The costumes are top notch (sans the nipples) and the young ladies get Chris O'Donnell.  Yay.  Hopefully the upcoming Batman: Year One will put this series back on track.  In the meantime, stay away from Schumacher's steaming piles of crap in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  They belong in a dumpster, immolated and made into paperweights. Burton should've directed this one.  One wonders why he didn't step in to save this film.Rating: 5/10",Batman Forever
482,milesfinch,Sparkles of genius amongst some iffy acting and poor scenes...,6,24 March 2019,"Some great, some awful, someone pass the popcorn. This film illuminated the good actors amongst the wannabes and filth. The film has all the elements to be a grand ride but comes up short at the end of the day and leaves you with a void. Val doesn't work well in this role, maybe this was the the point he lost focus and went Eastward. Nicole gave it her best but felt awkward and flat. Chris was dealt the bum hand and was the scape goat for this film.
Tommy shone like a gem and Jim stole the show in a way that only Jim could back in the 90's. Jim was the gold, jewel encrusted crown that, for me, saved the day. If ever a role was written for an actors scope then this was the perfect execution. Oh i almost forgot, I had sleepless nights after seeing Drew in this film. Ohhhhhhh mumma!!!",Batman Forever
483,ZombieShakespeare,Best Batman Of All,10,7 January 2004,"I know a lot of people don't like this movie, but it's one of my personal favorites, so please hear me out.  The movie goes deeper into Bruce Wayne's fractured psyche more than all the other films put together.  Val Kilmer's ""red book"" speech gives me chills every time I watch.  There is so much passion between him and Dr. Chase Meridian (Kidman) that the screen can barely contain it.I always love to see an actor break out of his usual mode, and Tommy Lee Jones does just that.  He usually plays characters that have a very dry wit, but Two Face gave him room to play.  He was a flamboyant, homicidal psychopath, which is quite a departure for him.  Some may describe the Riddler as ""a typical Jim Carrey performance"", this is not the case. Although his utter insanity is seen in other films such as ""The Mask"" and ""The Grinch"", there is something different about this one.  There are a few quiet scenes where Carrey has subtle, creepy moments which are unnerving. Chris O'Donnell also does a wonderful job as the young Robin, hell-bent on vengeance.  The smart script and skillful direction of this film made it a brilliant commentary on the human tendencies of revenge and obsession.I hate it when people confuse this movie with 1997's ""Batman and Robin"". Let me go on record by saying that I hate that movie, but it's predecessor is well worth your time and money.",Batman Forever
484,OrcaCaptain,Cartoon-tastic,5,29 July 2008,"OK, so Christopher Nolan's juggernaut, contemporary Batman incarnation steamrollers on. Impressing even the sceptics....but what about Joel Schumacher's initial vision? how does it fair after 13 years on release? The answer is - not very well.Michael Keaton reportedly turned down 'Forever' due to lack of faith in the direction that Mr Schumacher was taking the franchise (see trivia link on this very page) and rightly so.Forever is akin to a live action cartoon. That doesn't mean it's bad for that reason, but it isn't even a good cartoon. It's alright bordering on lame.This installment of the Batman series of the 1990s signalled the inevitable swing-shift to join the recurring trend all too common in most franchises in the last 20 years (Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Beverley Hills Cop to name a few) from being gritty, dark & edgy to being almost parodical.Val Kilmer gets the cruddy end of the stick here, a wasted talent no question. Had Kilmer been directed by Burton (had Keaton not been available to choose) things may have been different, but that's ancient history. Bottom line is that Kilmer had real potential as the Caped Crusader, shame he didn't get the chance.Tommy Lee Jones as 2 Face was a fair choice, he plays the part in the spirit of Schumacher's vision, but doesn't set the heather on fire by any means.Jim Carrey is the perfect choice for The Riddler here and steals the show with his self confessed over the top antics.What stands out retrospectively is how little sense things make, but because it's a superhero film the audience are expected to just swallow it.i.e. The birth of 2 Face - he gets acid on his face, and all of a sudden he has a half face full of purple make up and purple hair....a renound side effect of acid burns...yeah right.Or the Batboat's launch pipe out of the bowels of Wayne Manor - just how is Batman or Bruce Wayne expected to get the boat back in the Bat Cave when it's 100 feet above sea level.I enjoyed this film back in the day - but it does not really stand the test of time. The special effects are suspect, the story line is mediocre, the visual style detracts from the Burton Gotham, the direction of the franchise is headed the way of Batman & Robin, and unless you have been in hibernation, we all know how that turned out.a generous 5/10 for Kilmer and Carrey",Batman Forever
485,ARhysW,Batman Forever,6,5 October 2005,"While not as dark and as serious as the first two movies, I still enjoyed this one. The movie does have dark moments, which show that Burton still had some control over this film even though he was no longer directing. I thought that Val Kilmer did a good version of Bruce as he was being tormented by his dreams, then another good job as the brooding Dark Knight. I was glad to see that they didn't change the Batman costume too much either and that he still had the nice yellow Bat symbol on his chest. Also Nicole Kidman did a good job as the love interest as did Jim Carrey as the Riddler (even if he was over the top in most scenes but that's Jim for you). Chris O'Donnell did a rather good Robin in my opinion and seemed to fit the role well. Meanwhile Drew Barrymore looked very cute in this movie as sugar, and spice wasn't bad either. To top it off, both the Alfred and Gordon actors gave their usual fine performances.One other thing, the new Batmobile was a nice design and a worthy follow up to the original in the previous two movies. Now below I have listed six points, which I think could have been improved on, and which would have meant a much better movie.1. Nipples! Who came up with this idea? Batman does not need nipples on his suit and thankfully they were absent in his new costume at the end. This one minor detail doesn't bother me much personally, but I know that other fans find it really annoying.2. Gothum is too colourful in most of the film.3. Tommy Lee Jones is too over the top throughout most of the movie, he could have done a much more menacing and evilish two-face.4. Bad sounds effects that weren't needed: Silly popping noise as Batman takes the security guards hearing aid out of his ear, childish electric shock sound effect after Batman beats one thug with a stun type gun and throws another guy on top of the first thug causing more of the effect to be used.5. The band that plays in Edwards's big party really didn't need that entire glow in the dark/florescent stuff, and neither did that gang who fought Dick.6. Holy rusted metal Batman? What the? This is supposed to be Batman of the 90's not the 1960's camp Batman! Yet despite the above 6 low points, Batman Forever is still an enjoyable movie and I accept it as a sequel to the first two, and (in my own opinion), as the final Batman movie of the current series. Also I liked the line ""I'm both Bruce Wayne and Batman, not because I have to be, no, but because I chose to be"", which pretty much sums up the meaning of the movie title ""Batman Forever"" and shows that Batman has finally conquered his nightmares. So this movie gets a 6 from me.",Batman Forever
486,MissMagic134,An excellent movie,9,23 October 2005,"I have no idea why people didn't like this. This was an amazing movie. It brought a fun but still dark and mysterious quality to Batman and I loved it! Jim Carrey was hilarious and Tommy Lee Jones did an excellent job, he was so crazy, you actually think he's two minds on the subject. Chris O'Donnel was OK, and Nicole Kidman was good too, but Val Kilmer was spectacular. He did such an amazing job as Batman. The polite and withdrawn Bruce Wayne is a challenge and I think that the deep quality he brings to his characters, whether he's a swordsman or a punk is fabulous. Also I think they had fun and creative ideas, especially on how Batman came to be. For me I don't need to see him how he first learns and all that stuff, this movie was deep and fun at the same time.9/10 amazing, a must see. Rent this movie, if your a Batman fan or not you'll love it!",Batman Forever
487,adamjackson-91071,The start of the decline.,6,23 March 2018,"When it seemed everyone and their mother complained of the adult material in Batman Returns, it's dark tone, the sexual references, the grossness, (both box office and nature), Warners were quick to change direction of the Batman franchise. When Burton dropped out into a producer role, (how much impact he had on the final film I do not know), Joel Schumacher was brought in as replacement, with the task to make it more easily accessible to kids, and more light hearted. Upon hearing this Michael Keaton also dropped out, meaning the new director needed to sought out a new Batman.
In steps Val Kilmer into the cape and cowl. A decent actor, and more in line with the physicality of Bruce Wayne, would seem on paper to be a deft replacement. But it's what was actually on paper, that let his performance down. 
Everything about this film is a direct contrast to the earlier entries. No longer adopting a broody dark atmosphere, it instead adopts a lighter, more ""heroic"" approach. Gothic architecture also scrapped, in its place a neon drenched super city, utilising far more special and visual effects than maybe the first two films combined. It suffers from this however, the city never feels lived in anymore, just vast and bright, empty. It also looks computer-y in some scenes, namely the exterior of the circus shot, which doesn't help in drawing people into that world. 
Everything about this film is weaker than the earlier entries, which is mainly down to the script. It's widely known there is a darker cut of the film with 40 minutes extra, and it is known to have a darker first draft script, probably when Burton and Keaton were both still attached. I NEED to see this directors cut. I feel it would completely change the film's legacy and reputation.
But the shooting script is somewhat disappointing. Making a great actor in Tommy Lee Jones, (replacing Billy Dee Williams), perform as a mixture of the Joker and channeling his co-star Jim Carrey. (There is a well known serious conflict of personalities between the two during filming.) I feel if the character were more true to its comic origins, Jones would have been an excellent Two-Face. Clearly Carrey has been cast to just be Jim Carrey with his Riddler, I feel he is one of the highlights of the film however, although he quite have easily, and more effectively, been a good choice for a darker take on the character also. 
Nicole Kidman is the sexed up love interest, Chase Meridian. She spends much of the film in a permanent state of lust, and doesn't actually bring anything to the film other than her insane attractiveness, and that's it.
Chris O'Donnell is brought in as Dick Grayson/Robin, but his age does suspend belief in the majority of his scenes where he's clearly supposed to be someone of college age. Again it's mainly the writing and the crafting of the character, as opposed to his performance, that drags it down. Interesting to think how Burton would have tackled the character.
Danny Elfman is also absent, in his place is Elliot Goldenthal, whose score doesn't compare with Elfman's even remotely. But it's solid enough for the film, and does feel more light and heroic. More kid friendly.
Which is what the film succeeds in. It's far more kid friendly, in every aspect, but it pays a terrible price for it which drags the film down. There are elements of a good Batman film in there, but it's not enough to even be compared to its two brilliant predecessors. It doesn't even feel like it belongs in the same universe as them, could easily be seen as a reboot. 
It's an entertaining film, definitely. The plot, as daft as it gets sometimes, moves quickly, and the whole film works, as a film. As a Batman film, it doesn't even hold a candle to the first two. What this film led to two years later is catastrophically worse, and although the cracks started showing in this entry, at least it never got to to the levels of Batman & Robin...",Batman Forever

It added color back into a Gotham that had gotten way too claustrophobic, and brought the tone back to something resembling the comics. Jim Carrey is a scene-stealer and dead on as The Riddler, and Val Kilmer is the perfect Bruce Wayne and Batman. Tommy Lee Jones does a great turn as Two-Face, unfortunately he isn't given enough to do and therefore comes across too cartoony, minus the angst of the character in the comics. One other big complaint is the new score - gone are Danny Elfman's orchestrations.  Elliot Goldenthal's music would have been fine if not for his predecessor.

492,tumyeto_kid,"The often underestimated or ""middle child"" of the Batman saga",7,28 January 2007,"I admit that when the Batman film franchise shifted from the gifted,visionary claws of Tim Burton to the ""new wave"" obsessed flippers of Joel Schumacher, it eventually went down hill. But the third(and I wish it was the final installment although Batman Begins(2005)was fantastic and virtually reinvented the concept)Batman film has been called the last straw in the downwardly spiraling reign of Schumacher. I partly agree with this because I fell that the fourth movie(Batman and Robin)is terrible and not worth your time. I also think the Batman box set would sell better if it was not included. But Batman Forever is a great film, definitely not because of it's director (or Chris O'Donnell) but because of it's great acting and half decent portrayal of Batman. Val Kilmer played batman respectively and believably while still holding on to the haunted and dark image that Michael Keaton engineered. Nicole Kidman adds the perfect film noir character to the scheme and although she has been ridiculed as having a ""useless"" role in Batman Forever,I can't imagine watching it without her( she definitely gave more to this film than Chris O'Donnell). If Tommy Lee Jones is involved in a film then you know it's going to be good and Tommy Lee does not disappoint. Intelligently given the role of a Harvey Two-face, Jones gives us a scathing portrayal of one of Gotham's most dangerous criminals and what makes him tick. Jim Carrey's performance as The Riddler is arguably what saved this movie and this role truly revealed his chameleon acting abilities to the rest of the world. Most of the trouble that accompanied this film spurred from the fact that it had to follow up Batman Returns which was Burton's very personal and romantically dark view of Gotham city. It was an artistic masterpiece and the most controversial Batman film. Jiel Schumacher told the public that for his first swing at a batman film he wanted to sway away from Burton's dark and romantic Gotham world (a very,very bad idea) and create a more ""new an hip"" Batman. His world is more corny and modernized which is not where Tim Burton visualized his story going. Schmacher's possible disaster is saved by brilliant casting decisions, even better acting, and Jim Carrey. THis film is altogether worth watching especially because it focuses on the concept of duality. The best way to look at Batman returns is to see it as a separate franchise from the first two and ignore Batman and Robin altogether.",Batman Forever
493,steven83,Why Joel Schumacher Why?,3,16 July 2002,When Tim Burton Directed the first two Batman films ( which are definatly the best out of the set)  he really got his view across about what Batman should be like. So the new director coming in ( I don't know why Burton didn't direct the 3rd did he refuse or wasn't he asked ) couldn't be that different so when Joel Schumacher was chosen to do it i remembered the lost boys which is an exceptional film which stays serious and doesn't have any overly camp sections even though it is about Vampires! So Why did he decide to abandon the gothic which had made Batman so good and go back to the campness of the Tv shows. If you have seen the first to Batman films and enjoyed them avoid The last two they are nothing like the first two. Lets just hope Joel Schumacher dosen't direct the next one.,Batman Forever
494,abban,It is a good movie. Too good.,10,26 June 2003,"Wot?!? I asked myself, the first time I saw it... I just had to see this movie again. At first it struck me as a regular run-of-the-mill high-end Hollywood blockbusting action movie. On my second viewing, to my initial surprise, I found quite a lot under the surface...Why did the batsuit have nipples? This movie is loaded with sexuality. It has a frighteningly quick pace. It is an extremely well constructed story about how Batman is defined through his relationships with Robin, Dr. Chase(!) Meridian, Two Face and the Riddler. Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones and Nicole Kidman are great by the way. Great. Val Kilmer is a more low-key as Batman. But he's also the best Batman out of him, Michael Keaton and George Clooney.Batman Forever gets better every time I see it. I've never seen a movie that lends it self so readily to analysis. For me the primal scene in the movie is when Batman comes to visit Dr. Chase Meridian for the first time: He stops outside the door, hearing some sounds of ""Oh, Oh, Oh"". Somehow he thinks she is in danger - and kicks the door down finding her kick-boxing with a heavy-bag. Strange, considering it sounded as she had sex rather than being abducted. The film is full of this kind of stuff. Smart. It is playing with you.Much content, blistering pace. Classy villains. Great flick.",Batman Forever
495,unrideable,Comic Book Fans Will Hate,6,17 December 2008,"There are plenty of reasons as to why this movie took a turn for the worse: Warner Bros. wanted a more family friendly version of a violent comic book. Tim Burton left Michael Keaton left. Two-Face was portrayed terribly. While I think Jim Carrey did a great job as the Riddler, there was just too much slap-stick humor in the film and a weak side story about the love interest in Chase Meridian, who was written just for the movie. There was also no depth into how Harvey Dent became Two-Face minus a brief viewing. His character was also portrayed as a vibrant more vocal character who followed his own rules instead of his coin. Comic book fans remember Two-Face for his gimmick on the number 2, his quiet manor and his dependence on his lucky coin. Sadly, Batman & Robin also has the same flaws with a similar story line but with new characters. The movie could possibly be better with a different pairing of villains and a more realistic atmosphere. Val Kilmer played particularly well as Batman, but rather weakly for Bruce Wayne",Batman Forever
496,bmaje,Burton Forever.,2,17 May 2015,"I am a big Batman fan and for me the Batman movie was perfected by Batman Returns, with all it's flaws. Michael Keaton's take on Bruce Wayne and Batman worked because Keaton is an ""every-man"" type of dude. In Batman Forever Val Kilmer doesn't quite have this trait about him, and comes off as this preppy, soft and entitled Bruce Wayne. Even though it does follow the events of Batman Returns, the whole movie looks and feels like it's an entirely new re-imagining or something. Granted, Tim Burton and Keaton left and Joel Schumacher and Kilmer came in, but the dark tone and the Batman that kills people (one of the flaws of Batman Returns) also were replaced by this strange neon pink and green colouring that flashes through out the movie and this odd pacifism that makes Batman dull throughout most of the movie. Even the gang members for some reason wear unintimidating neon face paint, or have neon pink coils on the barrels of their tommy guns. There's a few reason this movie isn't good. The main one being this movie makes a departure from the Burton movies by being more marketable to families, thanks to a WB directive, owing to Batman Returns being too dark. There were also efforts to make the series more ""edgy"" and ""hip."" If you ever read those describing anything: run fast, run far. That's a death knell for whatever those two words are describing. The most visible attempt at trying to make things cool is the Robin's earring, which has the appeal of my grandmother releasing a hardcore hip hop album.One of the more interesting things in this movie is that it's more Robin's movie. Yes, his family are killed by Two Face quite early on and Bruce for some reason adopts a grown man, and Robin has this understandable hatred for Two Face and wants to kill him. The character of Robin has never really been brought to life and been done justice. Even the most competent and fleshed out appearance- Joseph Gordon Levitt's ""Robin"" in the Dark Knight Rises- wasn't particularly groundbreaking. Even though Robin gets the character development that probably would've been better wasted on one of the villains, it does not redeem the vacuousness of the movie.A problem with Dick Grayson is that his back story is too similar to Bruce Wayne's and people just don't care as much. And why should they? Bruce Wayne's billionaire, philanthropist parents leave him the means to become Batman and his bitterness towards injustice and retribution provide the will to become Batman. Robin on the other hand comes from circus folk, and receives pity and charity from Bruce Wayne. He essentially is a yuppie by proxy.In the first wave of Batman movies, from 1989 to 1997, there are some really poorly thought out characters. The female characters in these movies are universally terrible and Nicole Kidman's Dr Chase Meridian is no exception. The good doctor mindlessly trudges through this movie with a ""crush"" on Batman and later, Bruce Wayne. I use that term to reflect that she lusts after Batman like a 1990's teenage girl lusts after the Backstreet Boys. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress, but she just has the emotional range of a carrot in this flick.Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey play Harvey Dent/Two Face and Edward Nygma/The Riddler respectively and they feel like they're straight out of watered down comic book. While in Batman, Jack Nicholson's Joker was ""the world's first functioning homicidal artist"" and Danny Devito's Penguin had a grand plan of murdering the children of Gotham, the villains in this piece seem not to have a plan beyond killing Batman, in a number of ever increasing elaborate schemes and executing them in a number of ever more convoluted ways. For example, Riddler has an idea how to figure out who Batman is, by his brain manipulating device and tricks Bruce Wayne into using his machine, only to find out that Bruce Wayne is literally a man with ""bats on the brain."" The Two Face gets impatient and crashes a dinner party with guns blazing, allowing Bruce to escape and come immediately back as Batman.When Nygma figures out Bruce Wayne is Batman, he, with Two Face in tow, go to Wayne Manor and destroys the bat cave, while Two Face and his henchmen attack Bruce Wayne and the obligatory love interest Chase Meridian, eventually Bruce is taken down by a graze to the head courtesy of a bullet from Two Face. The Riddler has returned to find Two Face holding a gun to the temple of the unconscious Bruce Wayne, only to stop Two Face from murdering Bruce Wayne, because Bruce won't learn anything. They then abscond with Dr Meridian to get Batman's attention. Bruce wakes up and Batman and Robin go after Two Face and Riddler, where they start trying to blow up Robin with underwater mines and shoot Batman out of the sky with rockets whilst bemoaning how hard it is to kill Batman and Robin.If the last paragraphs sound nonsensical and stupid, it's because they do. That's the movie, well that's where I got up to. I turned this witless mess of a movie off. It's funny that this movie features an IQ draining machine that could not be nearly as effective as wasting two hours on this terrible movie. I'd recommend watching Batman and Robin over Batman Forever, for no other reason than I haven't seen Batman and Robin for a long, long time. I view cinema as an art, and I believe that true art exists for no other reason than it just exists. This movie exists to only tread water. It is the non-threatening, decaffeinated, gluten free, castrated Batman movie. And it sucks.",Batman Forever
497,andrewbasson,a great hybrid movie,7,1 September 2011,"I think it does it's job well in providing a cheerful film for kids whilst also providing a dark story for teens and adults.The settings are stylish if not colourful in some places, the characters, particularly Robin and The Riddler are well performed (with neutral feelings for Val Kilmer's Batman.) and because many critics are... well... adults, they feel that they shouldn't sit through a kid's movie and they regard this as such, but they miss the fact that it's intended for children and should thus see it through their eyes.i would definitely show it to my friend because even though he would never express an interest, he would like the dark overtones and childish nature of this featureI declare it a movie with the WITSB? badge: Why Is This Stuff Bad?",Batman Forever
498,mcg26,My Favorite Movie!!,10,5 July 2012,"This is my favorite movie for many reasons. Is it as dark as the previous two? No, but that doesn't make it a bad film by any means. The acting is my favorite part. Two-Face is my favorite Batman villain and Tommy Lee Jones was perfect for it; he totally delivered. Jim Carrey was also perfect for the Riddler. Val Kilmer isn't as good as Batman as Michael Keaton was(Keaton is probably my favorite Batman), but he is not bad. This is a goofy movie, just like it's successor, but it was made that way intentionally. Just because it isn't serious, that doesn't mean it deserves criticism like that. I blame all the comic book nerds who don't like something if it's a tad different from previous titles. I don't blame Schumacher for wanting to try making them a little less dark and more comedic. If anything, that makes the movie more versatile. Maybe the statues and gangs are a bit much, but that isn't a reason to hate a movie. I can think of far worse movies than Schumacher's Batman movies. Just one example would be the Friday the 13th remake where Jason wasn't even the focus of the film. If anybody hasn't seen it yet, I wouldn't waste the time or money to see it. ***Spoiler Alert*** The focus of that movie is primarily partying and getting drunk, not a psychopathic killer which is supposed to be the point in watching. That's a reason to dislike a movie, not campiness. In summary, real Batman fans should like all Batman films. They're all great in their own ways. Nolan's are more realistic, and the older one's from 1989-1997 are more aligned with the comics. They shouldn't make sense because they're not supposed to. That's why you can't take them seriously; they're all just good fun to watch and enjoy them for what they are, great movies.",Batman Forever
499,fredpisciuneri,fun but definitely not the best in the series,7,12 May 2013,"before watching this film you must think to your self ,Im just watching a entertaining pop corn flick because essentially that is what batman forever is as a film.Joel Schumacher brings a completely different type of batman movie ,this film is brighter and more visually appealing in my opinion to the Burton films.Gotham city is covered with tall towers, bright lights and colorful villains this time around .the whole film looks more like a comic book which is a good thing because this film aims to give a more comedic side to batman as his dialog is filled with puns and funny one liners ,even the small smirk in one scene made me feel that this was a much less darker version of batman.however this film has much more batman and not enough Bruce Wayne .Bruce/batman is played by val kilmer who does a good job but never really stands out thanks to a great standout performance from Jim Carey who pretty much saves this film from being a lot worse than it is with his eccentric and over the top personality he was a great casting decision to play riddler .unfortunately the same cannot be said for two face played by tommy lee Jone's who is only given a brief back story in comparison the riddler and is basically just very bland and boring when playing alongside Jim Carey.Nicole kidman is decent as Bruce Wayne's love interest and Chris'o' Donnell looks great as robin .the story in batman forever is mainly centered around how the riddler becomes a villain and the start of the relationship between batman and robin which i feel is a great idea since the previous two films made no attempt to add robin in despite him being a huge part of the comics and the show.i was happy watching Bruce's growing acceptance of having a partner and one scene i like in particular is when robin finds out that Bruce is batman and takes the the bat mobile for a joyride .the scene does a great job of making robins character very likable as we feel as though hes become a kid in a candy store enjoying all of Bruce's toys.besides whats already been mentioned this film did have an extremely silly and over the top plot but it works well since the film tries to go for a comedic and lighter tone .my main complaint is that the films action scenes just could've been a bit better and little things like batman getting sucked into a trap in the opening scene as if hes just a brain dead henchman .the film is an entertaining pop corn flick but by no means one of Batman's best work.",Batman Forever
500,tyanthonywalker,It's not the worst thing ever,6,19 April 2014,"Batman Forever is a movie that had a lot right, but just as much wrong. This movie gives a new meaning to campy. Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Two Face is odd, to say the least. Although he does look much like the character is portrayed in the comic books, rather than a gritty more realistic version as seen in the Nolan films, the performance does not seem to match the character much. He needed a grittier side, maybe not to the extent that Aaron Eckhart took it, but more than what was shown in the movie. Jim Carrey was the real two face, showing both great potential for his portrayal as Edward Nigma, as well as something that the character is not. At certain parts, Carrey gives a performance that really captures the character, an obsessive person who constantly wants to prove that he is smarter than anyone, most importantly the Bat. But on the other side of the coin, he shows a performance that is resembled more closely to the Joker. Another problem with portrayals was Robin. While I enjoyed the presentation of him, true to his comic book origins, except a few parts, the casting should have been a younger person. O'Donnell would be a great Nightwing, but seeing a grown man run around in green and red tights as Robin was a little off putting for the character. Val Kilmer however, makes a decent Batman, and an especially great Bruce Wayne. While most would probably disagree with this, others might see it as I do. He looks the part, first of all. If he gained a little more weight and toned his physique, he'd be even better. The other aspect is the voice. He had a natural sounding voice, not the raspy growl that Bale did (not that Bale was bad, quite the opposite),but more closely resembling Michael Keaton's Bat Voice. A good portrayal of Batman comes down to choice, an opinion. Quickly looking at the plot, there isn't too much here. It's as simple as it gets, giving minimal back-story to the villains, the movie is pretty much on rails the entire time. Nothing impressive, but not utter garbage . To wrap this up, The movie does an interesting thing, just like its predecessors, in showing the extreme villains that Batman must face. Some odd portrayals of characters and questionable casting along with a few cheesy moments and a mediocre plot do hurt this movie. But overall, its amount of campy over the top moments gives it a certain charm, making it a decently fun movie to watch now and then.",Batman Forever
501,ARosser14,It is What it Is,7,13 November 2006,"When you ignore what Batman Forever COULD have been and just look at what it is, it's not that bad of a film. Granted, it falls off a bit when thoughts of a not-so-corny dialogue and (most importantly to me, as he's my favorite villain of any kind) a more developed and more serious and sinister Two-Face.The film as it is was good, albeit with an occasional painfully corny line. Its much lighter than its immediate predecessor, Batman Returns, both in tone and literal appearance. A lot of neon and colored lighting, most notably on the redesigned Batmobile (which was somewhat unneeded but to an eight and a half year old boy, utterly cool), replaced the relatively black and white (so to speak) look in Batman Returns.All in all, when you take the movie for what it is instead of saying ""This could've been different and this could have been different,"" it's pretty good. Like I said, when you start thinking about changes, it drops from good to average for me and probably lower for most, but I take things for what they are, and taking Batman Forever for what it is, it's pretty good.",Batman Forever
502,ninjalemons,Link's Review and What is actually true,9,27 August 2015,"To be honest most of the acting could've been better but Jim Carrey played a great riddler and did well with the role he was given. The movie all around is corny and is just like any other superhero movie that you would see in the 70s or 80s. Corny one liners and the good guy comes in to save the day, people who review just to crap on the actors need to go actually read the comics a bit more before judging this movie. The only thing I would have to say that is bad about the movie is Harvey, not exactly the best impersonation of the role but does well for what he was told to do. This movie is good for a family movie for the all the generations especially for kids less fortunate to not have comic stores around and even older generations that really enjoy DC. People who crap on movies with their own personal opinions and no actual facts is why we can't have nice things.",Batman Forever
503,natalieandmonkey,A Technicolour Homage To The TV Series,7,24 April 2010,"Whilst this third instalment in the series may not be up to the high standards of the previous offerings, this entry still offers enough fun to be a satisfying and at times completely hilarious movie. I think what really helps when looking at Batman Forever is how you look at the movie- 1. If you look at it as a continuation of the previous noir offerings, it lacks... 2. Compare it to the seriousness of Christopher Nolan's entries, it comes across as shallow and tacky... 3. However, look at it as a partner piece to the gloriously camp and fun TV series and it comes across as a fun and enjoyable movie! Robin's Holey Rusted Metal Batman! is a classic in movie quotes!The multicoloured palette of colour on show in Joel Schumacher's Gotham is a welcome departure from the greys of the original and give the film an energy and panache which really benefits the story. Helped by the garish green of the Riddler, and the carnival feeling to many of the scenes, this is one of the film's main strengths. Undoubtedly, Kilmer's performance shows just what an underrated actor he is- after Michael Keaton was overshadowed by his foes, Kilmer brings Batman back to the forefront of the films as he should be. Similarly, Carrey epitomises The Riddler in all his gleeful maniacal persona however the real weakness of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character of Two-Face. Whilst Carrey benefits from a real set-up and character beginning, Two-Face is rushed out in an aside. Notice that in the VG Batman Arkham Asylum, whilst Joker is the chief catalyst Riddler is seen but not heard. Reason being, two larger than life characters (Two Face and Riddler) inevitable clash and one has to come across as weaker. Some have criticised Nicole Kidman as the love interest, and this is quite a thankless role- Drew Barrymore's Sugar is a lot more memorable. I think in hindsight, Kidman's strengths have been shown so much in films such as Dogville and Birth that it's a surprise seeing her in such a sketchy role, but she acquits herself well! Similarly, Chris O'Donnell as Robin could have come across as just another teen angst on screen but with a well executed back story and some surprising martial arts moves, he adds another welcome dimension to the film.To sum up, Batman and Batman Returns may be more beloved however don't discount Forever as just another Godfather 3 because there's a lot more to it than that!",Batman Forever

Just so I don't hear any comments about how there were too many neon colors and comic book-like features in Batman Forever, I will assure that Batman & Robin was a piece of crap.

508,Bopetter,"Colorful and comic, but not even close too Burton's two films.",4,19 October 2001,"This film is with out a doubt one of Kilmer's better films, but fare from Carrey and Jones best work. Carrey is off course great as usually but need more depth, Jones is wacky and fare from the cold and dangerously calm character I imagine. Kilmer is just Kilmer and doesn't give the character the dark side Batman have, but shows a very shallow and poor Wayne. The best thing about the film is Jim Carrey and Michael Gough, who both are great actors. Gough gives a cool and good performance. Chris O'Donnell should just stick to the other parts he fits. O'Donnell is a great actor but not in this movie, too... I don't know.The two first films is the best superhero films ever and it's because burton knows how to keep the comic, and still make it dark and scary, and sometimes even give us a brilliant acting performance as Michael Keaton and Jack in ""Batman"", Depp in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and Pfeiffer in ""Batman Returns"".Schumacher should direct films like ""The Client"" and ""A Time to Kill"", and not these kind of films, if he doesn't see it with a little less light.But nice try everybody, and keep trying until the darkness is back in ""Batman""-universe.",Batman Forever
509,BogsSheepProductions,Batman Forever? Batman Never!!!!,3,13 May 2002,"I have been a Batman fan since I was about three, I can even remember seeing the first Batman movie in theaters when I was four. It's my earliest recollection of the cinema, and can be attributed to my love of films, since it was probably the spring board of my interest. Batman Returns came out when I was seven, and was a wonderful follow-up. After another three year wait, Batman Forever. No longer would Michael Keaton play the dark knight but Val Kilmer, and I was cool with that, and Tim Burton didn't sign on to direct but I was also too young to care or know what difference these changes would make in the Batmn universe. Upon first viewing I thought it was ok, but I never watched it after that first viewing, until today, whilst doing a batch capture while editing, I happened upon a copy of this film in the media center where I was working, I decided to re-watch it. Only then did I realize how bad it was.This is a bad movie from start to finish. From the over-the-top bank robbery opening to Jim Carrey's over-zealous overacting to Tommy Lee Jones, portraying the most evil of Batman's rivals, Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent as a caricature of the villain he should have been. But I shouldn't be too hard on Carrey and Jones, for, they are the shining stars of the film, next to Nicole Kidman, who turns in a surprisingly good performance in a film filled with such bad ones. Chris O'Donnel as Bruce Wayne's ward Dick Grayson, is just plain bad, delivering lines like, ""You can't understand. Your family wasn't killed by a maniac."" with the skillful delivery of a soap opera actor. But the worst is Kilmer, who somehow manages never to change his facial expression practically throughout the entire film, changing the complex character of Batman/Bruce Wayne, into a one-dimensional loser. You feel no empathy for him, nor do you care about Bruce's life and the only reason you care about Batman is because, well he's Batman.But perhaps the most offensive is Joel Schumacher's perversion of the film. Changing Gotham City from the dark desolate cityscape it once was into a bright neon city, where over-the-top villain, and glow stick gangs run rampant only to be stopped by a man in a suit with rubber nipples. Needless to say, I have a bone to pick with Schumacher, about several choices he made, but I shall stick to these two. The entire film was redone neon style, and is no longer a scary city where evil lurks around every corner, but a city where where neon lights the cityscape, and everyone is neon too, even the street toughs. The nipples is another thing I could've done without, I don't see what purpose it serves only to allow Joel Schumacher to express his sexuality to the teeming masses of moviegoers.The film has it's good points though, but frankly I can't remember them due to the atrociousness of the rest of the film. After looking at the trivia and reading about several sequences that would have made the film darker, I still question if it would have been. If the darker version ever gets released I'll watch it in hopes of the real Dark Knight of Gotham, returning to avenge this affront to his sanctity.",Batman Forever

511,mikeownsyourface,Terrible.,1,9 January 2009,"I'm the kind of guy that likes continuity in watching a series of films... so the fact that the sequel known as Batman Forever has 0% connection to its two predecessors completely ruins the film for me.Scrapping Tim Burton's view for the film was undeniably the stupidest ploy ever schemed by WB in an attempt to appeal to more ""families"". I would have loved to see the return, or at the very least a cameo, of Catwoman to explain her mysterious final appearance at the end of Batman Returns, which I'm sure Burton would have included. Furthermore, did we forget about Harvey Dent who was played by Billy Dee Williams in the first film? Why on earth was his character replaced by not only another actor, but another actor of a completely different race....? According to my research, Billy Dee Williams had a contract stating that he would reprise his role as Harvey Dent/Two Face if there were to ever be a sequel created including his character. But apparently his contract had to be bought out JUST so Tommy Lee Jones could be recast as Two Face..... Evidently Warner Brothers would rather spend MORE money to replace an actor than to simply call back an actor and remain true to the character and connected to the previous films. CONTINUITY PEOPLE. Stick to it. You get more fans with continuity than you do families with cool-looking graphics. Idiots. Another thing that bothered me was the 20 second explanation to Harvey Dent's transformation into Two Face on a news broadcast, which could easily be missed if you have to lean over to scratch your knee. Unlike the other 2 films, Batman Forever took literally no time in explaining the background of its villains. They were thrown in there with no depth to their characters, wearing silly suits just to entertain the kiddies. I'm the sure the film was great in the moment and appealed greatly to 11-year-olds with flavor-of-the-year actors such as Jim Carrey replacing originally cast actor Robin Williams as The Riddler, but never will Batman Forever be looked back on as a decent film of it's time, or a legacy such as the two blockbusters preceding it.",Batman Forever

Literally everything went downhill: The acting, the directing, the sets, the plot, the score the... well as i've already said EVERYTHING.First lets start with the acting.Val Kilmer is as wooden as the contents of a Pine furniture store, seriously i've seen more life in corpses before. Chris o Donnell's acting shouldn't really be commented on as he was probably only put in the film so Schumacher could drool over him. Nicole Kidman looks hot as Chase Meridian (what kind of a stupid ass name is that) but that's about all. Most of the dialogue they give her is terrible anyway. Jim Carrey goes way overboard as the Riddler, but the sad thing is he's the best thing in this movie. But the icing on the Sh!t cake is Tommy Lee Jones as Two-face. In the comics Two face is a very complex character, but here he's played as a bad Joker rip off.Joel Schumacher is an awful director and nothing changes here.The sets are also a step in the wrong direction. They make Gotham look like Las Vegas. The gorgeous, dark and artistic sets seen in Burtons movies are replaced with garish neon lights. They make me feel sick, heck even the Batmobile is made to look like a Mobile disco machine. Even a short sited villain could see Batman coming a mile off.The plot left me confused, apparently the Riddler wants to read peoples minds or something...and..well...oh i don't know it's probably rubbish anyway. One thing though, at least it had Riddles in it. This hints that they may have glanced at a Batman comic before.The score actually isn't that bad. But i loved Elfmans one so much that to me, this one hardly compares.If you want to see decent Batman movies check out Batman (1989), Batman Returns, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (i haven't seen it yet but i can already tell it's going to be awesome).

519,mikemorfa,Great film! Best of the Batman movies!,10,16 September 2010,"Fantastic film! I think Batman Forever is without doubt the best Batman movie so far and is one of my all time favourite movies. I went to see it twice in the cinema where it premiered in Leicester back in 1995 and I was blown away by it - awesome film!! Val Kilmer was good as Batman (better than all the other Batman actors inc. Christian Bale who is a great actor in other films but doesn't suit playing Batman). Also, the Joker (Jim Carrey), Harvey 2 Face (Tommy Lee Jones) were played brilliantly. Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicol Kidman) was super cute and sexy.Some of the acting was a bit tongue in cheek but in a good way which I think made it more entertaining.Things that stood out most for me were the very stylish and stirring artistic starting credits accompanied with a great moving score and also the ending was very stirring and stylishly done too - I left the cinema experiencing Euphoria - felt really great. You don't get that often in the cinema.This was overall an achievement worthy of praise. Well done Joel Schumacher!",Batman Forever
520,jake316-987-798763,An Underrated Batman film but still to kiddie,7,26 February 2011,"This was the first Batman movie I ever saw in theaters. I loved this film a child. But watching this film recently, I realized how kiddie it is compared to the Tim Burton films which was geared towards adults. But it brings back memories when I watch it. I think it is a underrated superhero film. While it may not be as incredible as The Tim Burton or Christoper Nolan Batman films, it is still worth a watch. It's a different take on Batman and it was trying something new. I think it does a good blend of both the Burton films and the 60's T.V show. It's fast paced, over the top and fun to watch. I also think it's story about Bruce Wayne's decision on whether to remain as Batman or not was smart and it adds a new challenge to the character like what Superman does in Superman 2. I like it's jokes like how chicks dig the bat-mobile and I'll get drive through. I thought those were smart jokes. I also think people hate this film because it basically leads to Batman and Robin. There are flaws like the music. It's not the Danny Elfman score which is fantastic. It's different which is too bad, but it is a different Batman film so it works in a way. However, I feel the biggest flaw with the film are the villains. They are too flashy and goofy for a big Batman film. Compared to the Tim Burton villains which were dark, demented and scary like The Joker, Penguin and Catwoman. This villains were to goofy and they felt to much like the 60's Batman villains. Those villains worked in the 60's, but they don't really work in the 90's. I think the casting was good for this film, here is my rundown for each roleVal Kilmer as Batman- I think he was a good choice and he does a good job playing The Dark Knight. Even though I don't think he is the best Batman. He is a little more of a mellow Batman and acts more like a detective while playing the role. His highlight in the film was when he survives a trap by Two-Face and he runs through the fire. That shot always stayed in my mind as a child and it should go down as a fantastic Batman moment.Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face- This role was WAY to over the top for a Tommy Lee Jones role and for the character of Two-Face. I love Tommy Lee Jones in any of his films, but I think he overacts a little too much in the film. I also think his character was not true to the comics at all. In the comics, his character is like a split personality. In here, he is a goof ball who laughs a lot. His coin has no purpose unlike the comics. Although he had scenes that I liked. Such as when he was teaching Riddler how to punch.Jim Carrey as Ridder- Well what can you say, it's Jim Carrey. He plays this part like his other parts which isn't really a bad thing. But again, it's too over the top for a Batman film. I did love how obsessed he was at trying to be like Bruce Wayne. It adds a little more character to his role.Chris O'Donell as Robin- I thought Chris does a good job as Robin. He's young, arrogant and stubborn. I love how he is revenge driven and desires to kill Two Face. It gives another challenge to Batman having to stop Robin's lust for revenge. It has a stronger message against Revenge than most superhero films do.Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase- Not much to say, just a typical damsel in distress. Although I though she was sexy in this movie.Overall, it's nowhere near being the Best Batman film like the Tim Burton or Christoper Nolan films are. But it's a fun movie and it's still worth a watch for young Batman fans.",Batman Forever

522,packerslilc4,The 2nd best in the 90s!!,10,17 October 2021,"I love Batman Forever! I grew up in the 90s, and this is definitely my favorite when I grew up, of course behind Batman 89. Val Kilmer as Batman was amazing! He should've done Batman & Robin, Jim Carey as the Riddler was amazing and definitely lit up this movie. Of course Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Two Face is an iconic character. Thank you Joel for an amazing childhood movie!",Batman Forever
523,megaman58,"""Kiss From a Rose"", the movie. Guest Starring Batman.",4,7 September 2012,"Is literally all I can say about this film. The most memorable and great part of this movie is the end credits when you hear Seal crone out his #1 radio hit from 1995. At that moment you instantly see, in your minds eye, the sun hitting the crest of the ocean waves of Arkham Asylum as Seal stands on the beach yelling out his joy that what you have just witnessed has come to a close. It feels as if almost that this movie itself, by it's cheesy and campy direction compared to the tried and true dark Batman formula, was set up as a means to give rise to this ultimate ending act. As if, by having the audience witness in absolute horror the terrifying existence on screen before them, that when the music of this great hit, this absolute statement of the human will, this passionate crone that is beloved the world over, the audience would stand in joy and salvation of what has transpired! And that, in an act of great gratitude, the masses would break the levees of the record stores and raid the ""S"" section of the artist alphabet to hear this man's Messianic cries over and over again. Thank the world for Joel Schumacher folks. It is never too late to realize his end goal, which is for humanity to truly find out how great soundtrack hits really are in an age and an era when mediocrity infests popcorn action feasts. When I first saw this I didn't realize the truth, all I knew was ""somethingsomethingBatmobiletoysomethingsomethingBatwing!"" Now, however, after seeing this grand genius work his magic in other musical masterpieces like John Parr's Christ like appearance in St. Elmo's Fire by synthing out the title name drop song of the century, or that one oily chested dude with the tuba covering that one Tina Turner song to remind us that even in a world of badly dressed bemulleted vampires he still believed in humanity and the eighties! God bless you sir, you have truly achieved the distinction of a genius with this.",Batman Forever
524,jontebond30,How could Tommy Lee Jones ruin this movie,5,27 June 2013,"Jim Carrey as the riddler was great and Val Kilmer did a pretty good performance as batman, but i don't understand how the great actor Tommy Lee Jones who won an academy award for the fugitive ruined this movie. He laughs almost all the time in the movie and behaves silly when he is with the riddler. according to me this is his worst role ever and it wasn't just the performance, it was the makeup and the clothes to: it was awful and made him look very bizarre rather then a cool scary looking guy which is how the two-face character is all about. This movie could have been great and even good as batman and batman returns if Tommy Lee Jones had done a serious two-face like Aaron Echart in the dark knight. instead it became the beginning of the end of the first batman movie franchise.",Batman Forever
525,jimswarthau7,Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones made this flick worth watching.,5,1 September 2015,"Val Kilmer blows in this, when he is usually quite good. A very ""plastic"" performance. Kidman is forgettable as usual for the most part anyways. You would think you'd have a good chemistry. But the dialogue between the two is just horrendous. The villains are the only characters that make this movie watchable on a repeatable basis. If it wasn't for Carrey, who was great as The Riddler(perfect madman), and Jones, who was quite good as Two-Face. O'Donnell was good as Robin, as well. But in the end the writing surrounding Bruce/Batman, was just laughable as being passed off as realistic in any way. The effects were pretty good and the stunts were impressive. How does it match up with the others? It's not the worst, but it's not the best either.",Batman Forever
526,Link_Tristan,"It's Time to Retire, Mr. Schumacher",1,24 July 2005,"Batman Forever is the third installment for Warner Bros. Batman franchise, only Tim Burton and Michael Keaton decided to jump ship, so now we're stuck with Joel Schumacher, Val Kilmer and writing so campy it'll make you want to pitch a tent and make some s'mores. What we see in this film is a systematic destruction of absolutely everything that made the first two Batman films so popular.Kidman and Kilmer have been great in other films like ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Tombstone,"" but Joel is simply incapable of getting any good performances out of his actors. Don't believe me? There's a scene where Kidman's character tells Batman to meet her at her place at midnight. Even though she's expecting company, she decides to sleep in the nude before he shows up. I can understand her character trying to seduce Batman, but why go to bed and fall asleep while you're expecting company? Just listen to her character's inner conflict when she says ""I can't believe it. I've imagined this moment since I first saw you... and now I have you and... guess a girl has to grow up sometime."" I guess I can't blame Kidman on doing the best with the crap she was given. Someone needs to fire Mr. Script Writer. Joel, in the tradition of Burton's previous Batman film, decided to use two villains at once: the Riddler and Two-Face. Personally, I wonder why the director would want to use two villains when he can't get one character right.In previous Batman films, the villains were layered characters. The Joker was back-stabbed in a set up, Catwoman was in a mid-life crisis and sick of being taken advantage of, and the Penguin was a social outcast playing the sympathy card so he could get revenge on Gotham. While these character motives are little more than ""I want revenge"" at least it's something. Joel enjoys making the villains of his Batman films silly cardboard cutouts which don't make any sense at all.Joel turned Harvey Two-Face, a steely, no-nonsense crime boss, into a laughing idiot that hops up and down whenever he blows something up. There's a quick twenty second explanation of how Harvey Dent had acid thrown on him during a trial, so he swore revenge on Batman... what? Batman didn't throw the acid. Two-Face is pretty much Tommy Lee Jones copying Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker, except with different makeup, and the Riddler isn't far behind. Jim Carrey was acting like... well... Jim Carrey. As ""good"" as Carrey's performance might be, there's really no room for non-sequitur dance sequences and goofy voices to be thrown into the middle of a scene-- but that's what Jim is good at doing, I guess. As for Edward Nigma, they briefly explained how he became the Ridler (he was fired from his job, I know that tends to make people become super-villains), but never explained why he likes making riddles. His master plan: become the smartest man alive by reading the minds of Gotham's citizens and then... and then... uh... well, it doesn't matter because we all know Batman will save the day.As if a poorly done treatment for Two-Face and the Riddler, and a poorly done romance subplot added into the mix weren't enough, we have another poorly done subplot thrown in: Robin! The most hated side-kick in the world. Joel introduce Robin as a character who wants revenge on Two-Face and offers absolutely nothing else significant to the story. There's not much to say about Robin, except that he kicks ass at doing laundry. He's just eye-candy so the ladies (and Joel) have someone to swoon over in this poor excuse for an action film. The biggest crime in Gotham was how Joel rebuilt the city. He demolished Burton's Gothic atmosphere and added colored lights and large bronze statues to turn the desolate wasteland of a city into a sparkling Las Vegas wonderland. He also introduced the phosperhous gang, a group of guys who glow in the dark and play heavy metal music... drug trafficking never looked so fabulous! Big naked man statues, face-painting gangs, and rubber nipples summarize everything that Joel has added to the franchise.I've heard some arguments standing up on Joel's defense, claiming that the movie would've been better with the deleted scenes put back in. Namely, two scenes: one which shows TwoFace escaping from Arkham, writing some sort of anti-Bat message in a victim's blood, and other scene where Bruce gets amnesia and has to remember why he's Batman. The first scene was supposedly cut for being too scary for kids, but I can safely say that it was filmed and edited to fit into the rest of this crap fest perfectly. And the amnesia scene was utter crap. Honestly: AMNESIA. As if a bullet grazing Bruce's forehead and causing amnesia isn't far fetched enough, how about the fact that he cures it in under five minutes? That scene wasn't cut for being too dark, or too slow, it was cut for being too stupid. It could be worse. You could be watching the next installment ""Batman and Robin."" At least the plot for Batman Forever wasn't as poorly juggled as that movie. The worst you get with this movie is a bunch of clichés, poor acting, nonsensical moments (as in ""why would only thirty or so members of the circus audience slowly form a circle to look at the the dead trapeze artists?""), and an undoing everything dark and dramatic that made the first two films good. What we're left with is a campy, kid-friendly movie that anyone with a brain can tell is just a cheap knock off of the first two Batman films.",Batman Forever
527,jdbartlett,"Cheap, tawdry tripe",4,1 January 2005,"Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, 8MM) attempts to blend the campy 1960s Adam West Batman with Tim Burton's Frank-Miller-esquire Gothic ideals in this family movie. The ""biff""s and ""kapow""s are replaced with punch lines and the special effects are up to date, but the result is still just as embarrassing as Adam West still is. When I thought things couldn't get any more ridiculous (the constantly blown-about hair of Nicole Kidman, her first date with Bruce Wayne  ""Let's go to the circus!""), things got more ridiculous. There's so much bad about this movie  from butt shots of bat suits to Dr. Meridian's rejection of Batman himself (""Oh, er, yeah, I fancied you for a bit, but I like someone else now, 'k?""), the movie has a consistent blend of bad humor and bad drama.It's unfair to expect Schumacher to have walked in Tim Burton's shadow and churned out another Batman looking exactly like the two before it, and although some of Burton's ideas do stick (Bruce Wayne wearing turtlenecks, the house looks roughly the same, same Alfred, etc.) most of the visuals are new. Things are brighter, shinier. Lots of neons, fewer browns. The direction is also extremely claustrophobic: there are close-ups all the way through the constant, in-your-face action. From the opening credits (a CGI effect that looks like an office screensaver), his glossy, tawdry take on visuals wrecks and conflicts with the darker side of Batman he regurgitates from Burton's work. In short, Schumacher's attempt at direction doesn't come off as a clever play on the 60s TV show, it comes off as over-the-top crowd-pleasing amateurish tripe, at least as bad as the 60s TV show.The screenplay is terrible, the sort of thing you expect when a script gets edited so many times it becomes nothing but a slurry of one-liners and cheap Hollywood hacks' cracks (""And this is for my mother"" says Robin, punching Two-Face for each of his family members and then for him). There's so much pointlessness to the script and the events of the movie happen in an awkward order (Dr. Meridian's irrelevant introduction to Batman right at the beginning, breaking up the action with Two Face.) As for acting, Tommy Lee Jones is wasted as Two Face, Nicole Kidman attempts to play a psychiatrist, apparently someone called Val Kilmer is in the movie, and Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast try to work as best they can with what they're given.",Batman Forever
528,GrandRoyal,Very Good Batman Movie,6,2 June 2005,"I'm surprised at the current rating of this movie. I think a lot of people fail to see Batman Forever as being done in a '50s comic book form; instead rating it as if it were a sequel to the dark, gloomy feel of the first two films.I like the look, feel, and flow of Batman Forever. No, it's not as good as the original Batman movie (and Keaton is still my favorite at playing Batman), but on its own this is a very solid movie. I hadn't seen the movie in years, but I happened to catch it again tonight on TV and was impressed with how much I still enjoyed the movie. I think Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face and Carrey as The Riddler work well together...two bad guys who share a connection and almost make the viewer want to root for them...On another note, I think the music, theme, scenery, and overall look of the film has a great combination of flash and substance. Kilmer does a more than adequate job playing the Dark Knight, but I have to admit that I'm not too fond of Chris O'Donnell's character.I give this film an 8/10, and consider it my second favorite Batman movie behind the original. Don't watch at it as a sequel to a franchise, expecting gloom and doom...watch it as a flashy, action packed comic book movie that packs humor and drama all into one.P.S. - The part where Bruce Wayne has the flashback to the bat flying at him in the cave is awesome...nice touch. Check out this movie if you haven't already, it's solid all the way around.",Batman Forever
529,wacko_ruxi,Best Batman movie!,10,14 July 2005,"This is by far the best Batman movie. Val Kilmer is the best actor to play Bruce because he himself has an image of ""tall,dark and handsome"", the look in his eyes is very deep and mysterious. He is a great actor. Not to mention Nicole Kidman and Jim Carrey, another pair of great actors and some of my favorites. The story is fascinating and superior to other Batman movies. Another great thing about this movie is its soundtrack, ""Kiss from a rose"" definitely is perfect for the illustrating the ideas of the movie and until this day it is still one of the most beautiful love songs. The movie is a perfect combination of adventure, crimes and romance. If you haven't seen it yet, you should!",Batman Forever
530,GillyCat,"Fun, Fantanstic Movie",10,19 December 2005,"Before I saw this movie, I looked at the ratings on IMDb to see how people have rated it. I completely disagree with the low rating, I think everyone in the movie played their role perfectly. Val Kilmer was amazing. He was serious, and funny at the same time. I don't think any of the other Batmans did such a good job. His good looks is an ideal representation of what Batman should look like. I believed him, even in such an exaggerated role. Chris O Donnell's debut as Robin was perfect as well. Although he was hot headed, we, just like Albert supported him. Albert was so lovable. All of the supporting cast was so great as well. I usually dislike Jim Carrey very much, but his portrayal of the Riddler almost stole the show for me. The exaggerated acting that normally would be annoying, was so funny when Carrey did it. Nicole Kidman played a cute girl but was very sexy as well. Even Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, just incredible. Same for Tommy Lee Jones. They were supposed to be ridiculous/ sarcastic/ corny kind of funny. And I found it hilarious. Besides the superb acting, the theme of Neon throughout the movie definitely reflects the point- its supposed to be flashy, out there, light and enjoyable. This movie deserves a much, much higher rating. To me, it was definitely the best of the Batmans and I had a great time watching it.",Batman Forever

This is a film anyone can enjoy it makes you laugh and the villains were the best part, Ridler and two face (Jim carry and tommy lee Jones) and Dr. chase Maridian played her part with spirit as well.

533,steven_fish,Batman Forever / Bad Movie,1,13 October 2005,"Batman and Batman Returns were the best in the first 4 of the franchise. Had Micheal Keaton played in the following two Tim Burton might have / would have been involved in making the scripts much better. Batman is a dark character in a dark city which Keaton / Burton made you feel, and that is what I gather from the comic books.Batman Forever was a bad script with some great actor trying to cover up the writing. Val Kilmer just seems like he should be on a beach somewhere with the frat boys. I just didn't think he was right from the start.Batman and Robin was even worst. The script should have been burned right after it was written. Although have you ever placed an actor in a role someone else did and thought he would have been a good choice. George Clooney is this guy. Had he played in the first two I think he would have been great. Clooney plays a great dark character role, ie Dusk til' Dawn, and Tim Burton would have brought that out.Batman Begins is a different story. At first I felt like I was watching the Last Samurai, I guess because of the way it was filmed compared to the earlier versions of Batmans, that seem like they took the comic book and put it on the screen.Christen Bale's Batman has a cockiness and swagger about him that shows to much. With Keaton it was a feeling, he didn't really show it, but he knew it and the audience knew it also. But I will have to say I did like Bales performance. Don't get me wrong, Batman Begins was, if not better than the first, better than the second to me.",Batman Forever

535,harrybrock,Legendary Movie,4,7 August 2017,"Ahh Batman Forever, the ultimate Joel Schumacher masterpiece, the sexy intro music, the impeccable CGI, the memorable quotes. Although the movie seems to be a masterpiece at first glance, there are many flaws, such as the overall rapiness of the movie. One of the memorable quotes from Jim Carrey's 'The Riddler' was ""You were supposed to understand... I will make you understand"", which made it seem like he will sexually assault Bruce Wayne. Furthermore in another scene Jim Carrey states ""See you soon"" in a gay rapey manner. The issue with this is that it seems to support the view from feminists that there is currently a rape culture. The costume design was also phenomenal... for a 5 year old. In addition to this it looked like a two year painted the side of two-faces head and at times Tommy Lee-Jones 'Two-Face' acted like a gay stripper. Nevertheless the script was almost perfect, the acting of Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman is flawless, in which Kidman's superb role in the movie made the misogynists watching the movie want to gouge their own eyes out, and the immersiveness of Gotham City is exquisite. I have other problems with the movie, I believe Alfred may have sexually abused Master Dick and there is instance of misogyny where Bruce Wayne sighs and says ""Women"", the feminists have highly criticised this part of the script. The emotional shown by Chris O'Donnell who portrayed Robin was quite simply breathtaking and he should have won an academy award for his role in the movie. Overall the acting in this movie is quite astoshing and the effects had set the precedent for the future. The audio used was phenomenal and matches the likes of Hans Zimmer and Ennio Morricone. Even the movie had its flaws, it had became an instant classic and Joel Schumacher had made an incredible contribution to the movie industry. 
So the movie is basically crap but funny because of how stupid and bad it is.",Batman Forever
536,alexjer,Neon nightmare,3,27 September 2017,After the mixed reception of batman returns the studio decided to get rid of Tim Burton and bring on board Joel Schumacher. The results however are anything less than stellar. The worst aspect is the script as the characters are only barley developed with the love story between Bruce Wayne and chase meridian coming across as a couple of teenagers flirting at a party. The motivation of two face is also very weak as we do not really understand why he wants to kill batman and he is given no other goal making him seem more of an excuse for a villain until Jim carrey shows up. The Riddler is slightly better as he is at least given a slightly interesting. His obsession with Bruce Wayne almost makes him seem like a gay rapist. This potentially could be interesting but unfortunately it is only given a few minutes of screen time before he becomes essentially ace Ventura in green spandex. The acting is also poor Val Kilmer Chris O'Donnell and Nicole Kidman all look board whilst Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones both embrace themselves with ridiculously over the top performances. The direction is also poor with an overuse of neon and Dutch angles making the film feel like a disco. The accompanying music and sound effects coupled with the visuals creates an obnoxious style that even Michael bay would object to. The CGI also has aged poorly and as a result makes a the film feel almost fake. However the film is awful in an enjoyable way with the Jim Carrey scenes in particular being so ridiculous that they will likely get a laugh out of the viewers. Overall the film is laughably bad and it is weird to think that a major studio released the film as given the seriousness of modern batman movies it is a wonder why anyone ever see this film as being a legitimate batman film.,Batman Forever
