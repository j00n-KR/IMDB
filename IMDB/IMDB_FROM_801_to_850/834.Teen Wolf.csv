0,MartinHafer,Lycontrophy CAN be cool!,5,2 June 2019,"""Teen Wolf"" is an 80s teen movie....with many of the usual 80s teen movie cliches. However, I must admit that it IS unusual because its leading man is a werewolf!Scott seems to be a pretty ordinary teen. He plays basketball for his school team and they are terrible. However, when Scott suddenly realizes he's a werewolf, suddenly he's super popular and an amazingly good basketball player. Not surprisingly, he soon becomes cocky and full of himself. What's next for this oddball teen?The usual 80s teen movie cliches include: MOST of the cast playing high school kids are nearing their 30s, there is a kooky (and VERY inappropriate) best friend, sex and crude stuff parents really did NOT want their teens seeing. And, like so many of these pictures, the marketing was squarely towards teens and adults would have avoided the films like they were plague-ridden. Despite all this, the movie made money and spurred on a sequel.So is it any good? Generally, yes but overall it's a time-passer. The only thing I really did love was how people reacted to Scott becoming a werewolf. No one was scared and they thought he was pretty cool! Strange...but a nice twist on the whole lycanthropy angle. Unfortunately, the rest of it is pretty ordinary and predictable...especially the 'big game' near the end.By the way, Michael J. Fox apparently hated making this film....so much that he refused to appear in the sequel. This was a GREAT decision in hindsight, as the film bombed and has an overall rating of 3.2....placing the sequel at number 62 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List (featuring the 100 worst rated major release films).",Teen Wolf
1,TheLittleSongbird,I liked it,7,21 June 2011,"Teen Wolf is not a perfect film by all means, some of the editing could have flowed better, the story while having some great nice and starting off with very few problems is basic and meanders a bit towards the end and the film could have been longer(just). That said, the film apart from some lacking editing looks good, with nice scenery and lighting, while the soundtrack is superb. There may be the odd cheesy line, but overall the script is solid, and while somewhat predictable the ending is nice. The characters have a certain charm about them, and while the actors are not award-worthy perhaps they all do very likable jobs especially Michael J.Fox. All in all, not a masterpiece, but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Teen Wolf
2,bkoganbing,The Beavers have a wolf,6,28 November 2018,"Michael J. Fox got one of his iconic roles in Teen Wolf which spawned a far less
successful sequel and a TV series. This was certainly a new kind of werewolf for
the 80s. No hint of the dilemma Lon Chaney, Jr. had in his many incarnations
as werewolf Lawrence Talbot.I'm still trying to figure why someone as short as Michael J. Fox would be going
out for basketball. Still there he is on his losing high school team the Beavers.But there have been some strange things going on with Fox's body and not all
attributable to puberty. It's then that his father James Hampton shows him
that there's a werewolf strain in the family genetics.Sure enough it comes out under pressure during a basketball game as Fox
wolf's out and immediately becomes popular. That sure wasn't the way folks
reacted to Larry Talbot when he did his thing.No full moon or anything like that to trigger the inner wolf. Hampton and Fox
almost have it under control. It's a werewolf for the Reagan years.Michael J. Fox really makes this film. From his role on TV's Family Ties he had
a nice persona that fans could identify with. It's such a shame that he has
the Parkinson's Disease and that has severely cut down his working.Teen Wolf is pleasant and really goes over well because of Michael J. Fox.",Teen Wolf
3,Leofwine_draca,Probably one of the most dated of the 1980s high school genre,4,9 November 2016,"TEEN WOLF is one of those films that was a hit of the '80s but hasn't dated very well since then. Some might get a kick out of the 'timeless' '80s atmosphere it offers up, full of house parties, discos, kids drinking, and basketball games; the truth is, this isn't a very good film and it just doesn't stand up next to Michael J. Fox's true classic, BACK TO THE FUTURE. The main problem is the script, which takes the simple premise – a high school student is a werewolf – and never takes it anywhere other than a few lame gags. Sure, there are the usual themes here – how a student can become popular and leave his old-time friends behind – but it's nothing that wasn't done in about a billion other movies of the period.So, is there any reason to watch? The '80s atmosphere aside (and you really will love it or hate it), we get another good-natured turn from Michael J. Fox, a cheap and cheesy werewolf costume, some okayish turns from supporting characters (Susan Ursitti is sweet as Fox's faithful love interest) and a fun play-to-the-finish climax at a basketball game which I enjoyed, despite not caring for basketball one bit. Funnily enough, the '50s high-school-werewolf movie, I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF, hasn't aged nearly as much as this. A sequel inevitably followed.",Teen Wolf
4,SnoopyStyle,Charming Michael J. Fox,6,11 April 2014,"Scott Howard (Michael J. Fox) is an average student and an average basketball player on a very bad school team. Popular girl Pamela Wells doesn't care for him. His best friend is the girl Boof (Susan Ursitti) who is secretly in love with him. His other best friend Stiles (Jerry Levine) is a talkative schemer. He is slowly showing signs of something. His father Harold (James Hampton) tells him that their family are werewolves. When he shows his true self on the basketball court, the students surprise by showering him with love as they win games. Even Pamela starts to like the popular Scott angering her boyfriend Mick. However it's not all smooth sailing as he struggles to find his identity.This is a very average teen movie. Michael J. Fox is the only thing that make this compelling. He has a charm that makes this silly concept watchable. There is a good message underneath with Scott trying to figure out his identity like all teenager movie. It's not as stupid as one might think but we're not talking about Shakespeare either.",Teen Wolf
5,gavin6942,Incredible Cheese,5,10 June 2011,"A high schooler (Michael J. Fox) discovers that he is a werewolf.This is not a great film. It may be a pop culture cornerstone, but do not assume that makes it good. The special effects are fairly bad (the transformation is decent but the actual wolf makeup is cheesy). The origin of the werewolf is unclear.Sure, it has Mark Holton (Francis from ""Pee-Wee's Big Adenture"") and a song from Bunny and the Wolf Sisters telling us that he (the wolf) is not stupid like grandma.See it once. Maybe you will like it. My friend Cody does. I thought it was just, um, cheesy. Not a must-see by any means.",Teen Wolf
6,jboothmillard,Teen Wolf,6,1 February 2013,"I had heard about this film so many of television shows, including spoofs on Bo' Selecta! and Celebrity Juice, I assumed it was going to be a naff horror film, I didn't realise it was a comedy, and before the leading young actor became an instant star in the first of what would be a trilogy for Back to the Future, I looked forward to watching this very much. Basically seventeen year old Scott Howard (Michael J. Fox) seems just an ordinary teenage high school student wishing he was something more but hopeless at playing basketball for the Beavers and failing to get the attention of Pamela Wells (Lorie Griffin), the prettiest girl in school, who already boyfriend Mick McAllister (Mark Arnold). He is hitting puberty, but the changes he experiences are more than he expected as he grows more hair than he expected, his teeth become sharp, and his nails become longer, and eventually he locks himself in the bathroom to be a full werewolf. Scott's father Harold (James Hampton) demands for him to open the bathroom door, and he when he does to freak him out he is surprised to see that he is a werewolf as well, his father explains that the werewolf gene is in the family, only sometimes it skips a generation, he was hoping it wouldn't happen to Scott. He tries whatever to keep his newfound werewolf side inside, but during a basketball game he cannot but let it out and reveal it, the people on the court and watching are freaked for a little bit, but he continues to play and proves a hit with newfound skills and wins the game, so after this he continues to play superbly. Becoming the star play for the Beavers team and learning to control of his other side Scott uses his persona as The Wolf to gain to popularity he had always longed for, and he finally gets the attention of Pamela, but he is neglecting best friend Lisa 'Boof' Marconi (Susan Ursitti) who has had feelings for him since they children. Party animal and Scott's other best friend Stiles (Jerry Levine) takes advantage of the popularity for The Wolf by becoming entrepreneurial, he starts selling goods and merchandise for Teen Wolf, in ""wolfmania"" he even trades in his old car for a van he calls the ""Wolfmobile"". The Spring Dance approaches and everyone expects The Wolf to be there, Scott obviously doesn't want to disappoint them, but Boof is against the idea, and it is after a near violent encounter with Mick that he starts wishing he was just simply himself, he even contemplates this before the final basketball game with the Beavers against the Dragons. Scott refuses to become The Wolf, Coach Finstock (Jay Tarses) is sure that the team will fail without the star player, but he proves him wrong, and with penalties by Mick he gets the dramatic ending where he scores the all-important final two baskets to win the game by one point, Pamela expects his attention, but Scott puts arms around Boof and they passionately kiss. Also starring Matt Adler as Lewis and Jim MacKrell as Mr. Thorne. Fox is pretty good as loser turned hero from his alter ego, I slightly agree he is similar to the character of Marty McFly, but obviously the werewolf aspect sways you away from that thought, the makeup effects are very good, and even though it does feel slightly cheesy at times it has some light hearted funny moments, a fun comedy. Worth watching!",Teen Wolf
7,Woodyanders,Very cute and engaging 80's teen comedy romp,8,16 October 2013,"Shy and awkward average guy high school misfit Scott Howard (an excellent and affable performance by Michael J. Fox) suddenly becomes quite cool and popular after he discovers that he's really a werewolf. Director Rod Daniel, working from a sweet script by Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman, relates the entertaining lighthearted story at a brisk pace, maintains a good-natured tone throughout, and milks the amusing sense of pleasant humor for a bunch of solid innocuous laughs. The cast have a ball with the upbeat material: James Hampton as Scott's amiable dad Harold, the adorable Susan Ursitti as Scott's loyal and smitten gal pal Boof, Jerry Levine as Scott's shrewd opportunistic hustler buddy Stiles, Mark Holton as jovial fat dude Chubby, Jay Tarses as the laid-back Coach Finstock, and Jim McKrell as mean vice principal Mr. Thorne. Luscious blonde stunner Lorie Griffin heats up the screen as foxy babe Pamela. The sincere message about being true to yourself gives this film some real heart and warmth while the infectiously bouncy soundtrack delivers an extra appealing jolt of happy vitality. Moreover, this movie has an easy'n'breezy charm to it that's impossible to dislike or resist. Miles Goodman's funky syncopated score hits the groovy thumping spot. Tim Suhrstedt's slick cinematography provides an attractive bright look. A nice little item.",Teen Wolf
8,BA_Harrison,With great power comes great fur.,7,17 May 2015,"In Teen Wolf, Michael J. Fox unexpectedly changes from an average teenager into a suave werewolf; having already made the transformation from TV star to movie star a month earlier with Back To The Future, the young actor puts in an effortlessly charismatic turn that goes a long way to making this otherwise corny and predictable teen fantasy a reasonable amount of fun.Fox plays dweebish high-school basketball player Scott, such a loser that he can't even see that his extremely cute longtime friend Boof (Susan Ursitti) has the serious hots for him; instead, he pines after slutty head-cheerleader Pamela (Lorie Griffin), which brings him to blows with her boyfriend Mick, his rival on the basketball court.Scott's luck changes, however, when he discovers that he is a werewolf: as his alter ego, Teen Wolf, he is confident, talented and popular, scoring the hoops, scoring with the ladies, and scorching up the dance-floor. But for Scott to be truly happy, he must be content with who he really is under the fur—and so when his basketball team makes the championship finals, Scott leads the way while Teen Wolf takes a back seat, much to the surprise of his loyal fans.Teen Wolf could definitely have benefited from a few more solid laughs, but with an engaging central performance from Fox, likable supporting characters, lots of 80s atmosphere, and a general good-natured approach, the film has a charm about it that is almost impossible not to like. It's a feel-good movie—nothing more, nothing less—and as such, it does its job well.",Teen Wolf
9,paul_haakonsen,A timeless classic teen movie...,7,31 December 2015,"I have always enjoyed ""Teen Wolf"" since the first time I saw it as a child at about 10 or 11 years old. And even today I still think this is a good movie. It is just one of those types of movies that never becomes outdated.""Teen Wolf"" along with ""Back to the Future"" were the movies that made me become a fan of Michael J. Fox, another thing that still holds true today.The story in ""Teen Wolf"" is about Scott (played by Michael J. Fox) who is a very average teenager in high school who wishes to be outstanding and special. And when he finds odd changes to his body and he turns into a werewolf he surely does become unique and special.This is a fun and enjoyable teenage romantic comedy that is suitable for the whole family. And it is a fine movie in Michael J. Fox's career.If you are not already familiar with ""Teen Wolf"" then I can more than warmly recommend that you sit down and watch it.",Teen Wolf
10,bevo-13678,Meh,10,2 November 2020,Not very scary for a werewolf movie. You could almost call it a rom com if you ask me,Teen Wolf
11,poolandrews,Likable teen comedy.,5,10 May 2010,"Teen Wolf starts as average high school teenager Scott Howard (Michael J. Fox) is having problems, he can't get Pamela Wells (Lorie Griffin) to notice him, the school vice President is giving him a hard time & the school basketball team he plays for suck. However Scott starts to undergo changes, he grows long strands of hair, has claw like fingernails & hears dog whistles as Scott discovers that he in fact a Werewolf & that his dad Harold (James Hampton) is also one as it runs in the family. Soon Scott's secret is exposed & the whole town loves the wolf, under pressure to remain popular & the center of attention Scott lets the Wolf get out of control & uses his animal like strength & agility to get the basketball team to the state finals but Scott soon realises that the Werewolf inside him is as much a curse as a blessing...Directed by Rod Daniel this light hearted fantasy isn't exactly great but it is hard to dislike thanks to a nice performance by Fox & a fairly likable story. Sharing a lot in common with I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957) the similarities are obvious but the metaphors & parallels are updated to the 80's as the script deals with teen problems like puberty, school bullies, girls, parent trouble & pins it all on the fairly standard plot of the sporting underdog who comes good rather than the 50's which featured teens rebelling against authority & being singled out as trouble makers. Although very much of different time periods & eras Teen Wolf & I Was a Teenage Werewolf are more or less the same film. At 90 odd minutes Teen Wolf moves along at a nice pace & the story although a bit predictable & cheesy at times is fun to sit down & watch, I don't know because while it's a comedy & I didn't really laugh or anything I did smile & you do sort of root for Scott. As Scott makes decisions like having to choose between being himself or the Wolf, whether to alienate is friends or the girl who has always had a crush on him you can sort of see where he's coming from. Maybe one of the few Werewolf films that completely does away with full moons (although one is briefly seen it has no purpose), transformations & silver bullets.The film looks OK, it's not some visual masterpiece but it's OK to look at. The Werewolf effects are really poor, once Fox becomes one he looks like a mutant dog or something with long hair & a long beard as his facial features are kept. The basketball matches are alright but there's only three & don't feature in the film as much as I thought they would. There are lots of musical montages which look a little dated now as the Werewolf does a handstand on a moving van & there's an amusing Saturday Night Fever (1977) homage.Filmed in 1984 this wasn't released until after Back to the Future (1985) which made Fox a star & as such did very well off the back of it, shot in California the production values are decent enough. The acting is good & one of the films best aspects as everyone gives a likable performance.Teen Wolf is a likable film more than a really good one, it sets a standard tale of teen angst & anxieties against the backdrop of a Werewolf film & is quite fun if a little dated & predictable. Followed by a cartoon series Teen Wolf (1986) which ran for twenty one episodes & a live action sequel Teen Wolf Too (1987) while the makers of Teen Witch (1987) might have took inspiration from Teen Wolf...",Teen Wolf
12,view_and_review,The Lovable Wolf,8,14 October 2016,"It's 1985-an era of big hair, break dancing and synthesizers. Michael J. Fox was one of the biggest actors on the scene and between Family Ties and his movies he could do no wrong. Teen Wolf was one of his gems.I haven't watched every movie dealing with werewolves but to my knowledge there wasn't a werewolf movie before or after Teen Wolf that was a comedy (excluding Teen Wolf Too). Teen Wolf explored the idea of a wolf man being hip, cool and the life of the party. Michael J. Fox and company nailed it. They took a menacing creature and made it fun and lovable. If only vampires, mummies, zombies and others could come out from the shadows and show their party side.",Teen Wolf
13,FlashCallahan,Landing on your face......,8,24 June 2012,"Scott Howard is a high school student with problems. He is on a lacklustre basketball team, and he's having problems getting noticed by the prettiest girl in his school. When he comes home from a party, he discovers his new problem. He is a half human- wolf hybrid. He tries to keep this a secret, but during a basketball game the secret comes out and it helps Scott to turn his life around.The basketball team starts to become a contender for the state championship, and he becomes very popular. But Scott's father warns him about turning into the wolf out of anger....Teen Wolf, also known as the Fox film released in 1985 where he didn't go back in time, is a guilty pleasure from start to finish. On one hand you have the wolf doing all the cool stuff and becoming the popular pup, and on the other hand the film could be seen as a metaphor for puberty and coming to terms with big changes in your life (like finishing high School).All of the cast are good in their respective roles, but if you a looking for a Fox movie in the same vein as BTTF, you will be disappointed.Narrative is a bit choppy, and there really are no other plot points apart from the fact that there is a big basketball championship going on. So in theory it's really a sports movie.But the make up is good, even if the first few moments he sounds like Micael Jackson, and it has that unmistakable eighties feel to it.Cheesy goodness that is endlessly watchable, despite a few flaws.And no, there is no flashing person at the end, If you look closely, they are just hiding the fad that the flies are undone.",Teen Wolf
14,Aaron1375,A film that needed more scenes like the initial werewolf transformation.,4,22 January 2010,"This film had potential up to a certain point then became a downright boring movie with to many positive messages and not enough wolf for my tastes. The only reason this movie apparently did okay at the box office was that Fox had another hit at the theater in ""Back to the Future"" so Fox was essentially hot at the time. This movie was rather hot for the first twenty minutes or so, but then it cooled off a lot after the initial fun. Basically, it is good when he turns to the wolf the first time having the best scene when he opens the door to let his father see the horror. It was an unexpected moment in a movie with very few unexpected moments. It was also kind of funny to see him transform during the basketball game, however after that the rest of the movie was just to message laden to be really good or funny. The whole I don't need to be a wolf and I need to look to the slightly cute, but also kind of nerdy chick that is seen in like every teen movie during the 1980's as is the cast that is way out of the ages they are playing. To much heavy handed stuff, not enough funny stuff to really keep you entertained, about the only other joke that was funny after the basketball scene was the dad having it out with the principal. In the end a movie that should not have been that successful and did not really warrant a sequel or its on Saturday morning cartoon.",Teen Wolf
15,Wuchakk,Fun high school flick with Michael J. Fox as a werewolf,6,26 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Rod Daniel, ""Teen Wolf"" stars Michael J. Fox as a teen in Beacontown, Nebraska, who works at his Dad's shop in town (James Hampton), plays basketball for his lousy school team and enjoys a friendship with a neighborhood girl (Susan Ursitti) while desiring the popular blonde (Lorie Griffin). Complications result when he starts turning into a werewolf. This was actually Fox's first theatrical film, made BEFORE the mega-successful ""Back to the Future"" but released afterward. By comparison it's a decidedly small movie, but enjoyable for what it is (an 80's teen flick). The second act takes a turn that I wasn't expecting. No spoilers, but the movie poster tells all. I liked the closing moral: Don't lose yourself in your special talent to the point that you lose your family/friends. If people just love you for your extraordinary gift are they truly your friends? A good real-life example is Bobby Knieval who became world famous as 'Evel' Knieval, the radical motorcycle daredevil: Family members said they ""lost Bobby to Evel"" and the negative repercussions of fame (e.g. booze, babes, bucks and pomposity). Thankfully, in his later years he realized this and tried to make amends.Griffin has one notable scene as the ""hottie"" without falling into tasteless sleaze. THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 31 minutes and was shot entirely in Southern California: South Pasadena (neighborhood & town), Los Angeles (school), Montrose (bowling alley) & Tujunga (liquor store). The credits acknowledge ""Friends in Fremont, Nebraska"" because the director traveled there and spent 3 hours talking to seniors for research. WRITERS: Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Matt Adler plays the protagonist's bud and Mark Arnold his rival. Jay Tarses plays the coach while James MacKrell appears as Mr. Thorne. GRADE: B-",Teen Wolf
16,zetes,Unfortunately it doesn't hold up,5,2 May 2011,"I don't know if I'd go so far as to call this a childhood favorite, but I liked it and saw it several times when I was a kid. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't hold up. It's the kind of concept some glitzy Hollywood douchebag through out as a pitch and the studio decided it was a sure-fire hit. Of course they were right. But, come on, Michael J. Fox as a werewolf? For some reason, being a wolf makes you good at basketball. For some reason, Fox can become a werewolf whenever he likes. Kind of defeats the purpose of being a werewolf. The make-up is pretty crappy, and I think if you did a backflip on top of a moving van you'd fly off the back of it. It is cool, though, when Fox growls at the liquor store clerk that he wants a case of beer.",Teen Wolf

18,namashi_1,A Classic from the mid 80's,7,23 September 2009,"Rob Daniel made entertaining, memorable cinema in 'Teen Wolf', which I refer as A 1985 Classic! I loved the film, just imagine... today after watching high-packed,much more advanced stuff, yet I enjoyed the film. 'Teen Wolf' works and works big, and that's because it's got it's heart at the right place.Right from the very first scene to it's last scene I was gripped into it. No wonder, this film was a success back then and has remained a talk among hardcore film buffs like me.Acting-wise: Michael J. Fox has always been one of my favorite actors. He's fantastic in here. 80's was easily this film Legend's heyday. It's sad we don't get to such a fantastic performer much. Susan Ursitti as Boof is wonderful. Others do well in their parts.On the whole 'Teen Wolf' is a must watch. Thumbs Up!",Teen Wolf

OK, on to the movie. ""Teen Wolf"" was a typical 80's flick. Put a little camp and spoof in the mix. And throw in some Michael J. Fox, and you've got ""Teen Wolf"". It's an OK movie. Nothing really special. It was pretty memorable for it's time though. Michael J. Fox. What can I say about the guy? He's come a long way. But he was pretty entertaining in the film. I've only seen this a couple times. And they've both been on TV. So, I haven't seen the non-edited version. But I got the idea of what they cut out. If you enjoy 80's movies, you might get into it.

20,sddavis63,A Fairly Typical 80's Teen Movie That Loses Some Appeal As You Get Older,4,2 April 2010,"I certainly have good memories of this movie. I watched it when it first came out and quite enjoyed it as I remember. Of course, I was much younger at the time. Looking at it now reminds me that I'm getting old, I guess. This is a teen comedy - directed at teens, starring teens (or at least actors playing characters who are teens) and dealing with the normal teen issues such as acceptance and friendships and romance and the changes that accompany those years. Scott, played by Michael J. Fox, has a big change happening. He's suddenly discovered that he can change into a werewolf - a surprisingly friendly one for the most part, but still a werewolf. The change makes him a superstar basketball player who now leads his team to victory after victory and it makes him really popular - especially with the hottest girl in school. Scott was a bit of a strange character to me, though. The movie is supposed to be about the unpopular kid becoming accepted, but having to become something other than who he was to do it, but I didn't get the impression that he was particularly unpopular. He seemed to have lots of friends, he got invited to all the parties (more and bigger ones than I ever got invited to in high school!) - lots of kids have a lot more problems than Scott. The only issue he had was that as Scott he had the hots for the hottie but he couldn't get her to talk to him. I don't think I ever got the hottest girl in high school to pay much attention to me either. So, Scott didn't strike me as having that many challenges or problems to be honest.In the end, I suppose the message is still worthwhile. He learns that he can't use the wolf to buy friendships, and he convinces the basketball team (who eventually take a dislike to him because as the wolf he dominates every play of every game and the others hardly ever get to touch the ball) that they have to play as a team (without him being the wolf) if they really want to be successful. So, the lesson is - don't put on masks. Be yourself. Point taken. Fox was pretty decent here, and I liked Susan Ursitti as his friend ""Boof"" - who has the hots for him, but who he doesn't notice because of his fixation with the hottie. (Frankly, thinking back to my high school years - from which I wasn't far removed when this came out - I'd have gone for Boof! She was cute!)",Teen Wolf
21,Cineanalyst,"Fox to Wolf and Back; or, Puberty Makes Basketball Star",5,12 July 2021,"A rather cheap-looking teen exploitation flick in the tradition of, well, ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" (1957), ""Teen Wolf"" is another silly movie made somewhat better by casting the charismatic Michael J. Fox. I like the guy, but, geez, he's in some stinkers--everything I've seen at least perhaps with just about the only exception being the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, where he was cast within a smart idea and with a capable co-star. Anyways, this one is expectedly a puberty parable, which is too much on the nose and very hairy with the lycanthropy. So, kid turns werewolf, a.k.a. Hits puberty, and becomes better at basketball, which is fair by comparison to the same guy exploiting plagiarism and time travel the same year to be a rock star. Per usual, hormonal PG sexcapades also ensue.Some of it's pretty funny. Jerry Levine hits all the right notes as the van-surfing friend sidekick, Mark Arnold plays the heavy well enough to be worthy of hissing, and, just wow to the girl-next-door to the werewolves being named, of all things, ""Boof."" At least it wasn't ""Woof,"" I suppose. The basketball footage set to pop tunes isn't all that badly edited together, either. It must be said, though, that those refs are awful. Call a jump ball, already. Since when do basketball players wrestle until only one of them is holding the ball? Also, are the teams always over the foul limit, or did the filmmakers just not know that a team inbounds a non-shooting foul otherwise? I was amused at one point, however, by Scott's Beavers finally being punished for their excessive celebrating after every basket by an opponent driving in for a layup as they were still giving each other high fives.And there's a play-within-the-play (a theatrical play, that is) that both reflects the narrative in the film at large (normal kid working at his dad's store turned wolf to become the star and win the girl) and the making of the film given that Fox reportedly hated the movie, as his character here sheds the wolf to be a prima donna storming off stage.The only thing I find disconcerting--more so than a homophobic scene typical of '80s teen flicks or all the fat jokes, which, besides, the fat kid triumphs in the end--is that ""Teen Wolf"" is another odd ode to mediocrity. The entire plot is Fox's Scott whining about being mediocre in the first act, becoming very un-mediocre in his canine second act, before finally learning to appreciate his prior mediocrity and eschewing what makes him unique. To a large extent, it's the same thing that happens in ""Back to the Future"" (1985). I mean, the kid can go anywhere in the space-time continuum, and all he cares about is a pickup truck. If I were a paranoid conspiracist, I'd think it a Hollywood scheme to subdue the masses into complacency. On the other hand, it could also be the result of mediocre filmmakers stroking their own mediocre egos.

22,The-Sarkologist,One of those fun movies from the mid-eighties,7,4 January 2014,"This was one of those movies that I remember watching a few times back when I was a kid and back when Michael J Fox was still acting and I must say it is one of those eighties movies that I still have a fondness for, even though now I would probably not watch it again because despite all of the fondness that I have for the film, there is nothing really all that much about it that makes it stand out all that much. It's not as if it is The Terminator with a classic Arnold Schwartzenegger one liner, or any number of other classic eighties movies that I remember with fondness because, well, there isn't all that much about it that would make it a classic.Basically it is about a boy in highschool who suddenly discovers that he is a werewolf, and that it is something that runs in the family. After the initial shock, he suddenly becomes really popular, and is able to take on an opposing basketball team all by himself. In fact at the beginning of the film it is very clear that the schools basketball team basically blows, and it is not until one game when he finds himself at the bottom of a stacks on that he becomes the wolf, and then goes on to win the game – single handedly.Some have suggested that this is a subtle exploration of the nature of High School in your average American town (or suburb, or what not – it is not really made all that clear, but you could suggest that this could occur in any high school in any part of America – except for the fact that werewolves are creatures of myths and legend). Some have also suggested that it is about how, unless we are sporting heroes, or there is something important about us, that we are damned to spend our lives in obscurity. Yeah, I can see that in this film, and I can also see it as some form of subtle criticism of the American way of life (not that there is much that you can criticise), and that one is defined based not only upon how many people know who you are, but also how many people like and look up to you.It could also be considered some form of morality tale, in that we don't need magical powers to be able to win, all we need to do is to work as a team and believe in ourselves. Well, that is all well and good, but it suggests that by doing that then we can go from being a basketball team that blows to a basketball team that can win a championship – the problem is that it never actually works out that way. Still, this is a Hollywood movie, and in the end, the hero gets the girl – the right girl, not the snivelling bitch that leads you on because you are a famous person, and she can only define herself based upon what that famous person thinks of her, and that they win the basketball game, and the evil vice-principle (it is always the vice-principle that is evil, isn't it) is put into his place, and then the movie ends. I guess that suggests that everything is sorted and everybody lives happily ever after – until the make a sequel, that is.",Teen Wolf

Keaton on ""Family Ties"", the same year he was Marty McFly in ""Back to the Future"". Now he's Scott Howard in this movie, ""Teen Wolf"". Howard is an average teen in high school with a little secret, he's an lycanthrope(Werewolf). Like most werewolves, it's genetics, unlike most lycanthropes, he doesn't need a full moon to get him worked up. Living in denial doesn't do it. His father lets him know about it. However, he finds it to be a plus. Being a werewolf does have it's advantages. It made him very popular. The basketball team adored him when he got them to finals, he got the popular girl Pam(Lorie Griffin). During a play, he was in wolf mode. So when he reverted and went into the dressing room where Pam was there, she shamelessly dropped the towel and her bra, to me that will get anyone Wolfy! **WOLF HOWL!** The bowling scene, the party scene, the beer scene, the only scene I liked was the air guitar scene on the van.

29,hellraiser7,Howlin Fun,8,24 March 2016,"I'm a kid from the 80's decade and this film is another childhood gem. I always loved the werewolf sub genre in films and this film was literally my first werewolf film, I had a lot of fun with it then and I still do now.What I really like about the film was how unique it was for it's time. It not just brought the werewolf subgenere to the teen audience but it also made it lighthearted which is something that hasn't really been done before or much. Let alone the fact this film is also kinda a sports movie as it's kinda about Basketball but with werewolves.I do like the effects and design of the wolf, it's a unique design because the wolf is non threatening and actually pleasant looking. The soundtrack is very good, there are a lot of memorable songs. Two of the ones that stick out are ""Win in the End"" which was a fun but encouraging song. But my favorite one of all is ""Shooting for the Moon"" which I thought was just beautiful because it really had a romantic tone but most importantly a great and inspiring message which correlates with the theme of the film.The comedy is solid, like that whole motto surf concept which was a trend at the time. And I even like the basketball sequences, mainly that final game which was a lot of fun.And of course the story is solid, it's the typical underdog rising up but it's done right. I really like the characters from Boof whom I think is cute and she has the persona to boot. The chemistry between both Scott and her is solid. It's basically a developing romance between the two, you already know that Boof and Scott are right for each other, it makes perfect sense since both of them have a long history together. The way it's handled feels a bit realistic as we see it slowly develop as Scott is feeling more toward her begins to see her different.Styles is just great, I really love how he is just this ball of energy. He's sort of an underdog as well, despite not being popular or even coming close to getting there he never lets that get him down as he just want to simply have fun, do his thing, and express himself not caring what other people think. I really love how he always has this different colorful graphic tees which are always funny as each of them has a colorful message which perfectly reflects the kind of character he is. He's also sort of a business man as we see him making a business out of Scott's werewolf fame which I thought was kinda funny but also clever, why not.And of course Scott is great (played by one of my favorite actors Michael J Fox) I really love how he's a sympathetic optimistic underdog we all can relate and sympathize with. He's not really on the high end of things, as he love for the sport isn't quite translating to a winning streak. But in certain points in time his luck will soon change in a big way. Even like how he reacts at first to the whole wolf change which seems normal for anyone, honestly how would you react. Basically the whole Werewolf transformation is metaphor for the common bodily changes all teenagers go through which can be both a wonderful and scary thing.Most importantly I like how the film has a good theme about the importance of being and believing in yourself.The whole Werewolf transformation thing is also metaphor for the image Scott is hiding behind just to get the popularity and empowerment he craves. From the abilities the Werewolf powers have given him as they made him perform physically better at Basketball, and the attention he's getting he feels that this is the person he should be. However he learns that living life though an image is a shallow and lonely existence because Scott isn't being himself, and he of course begins to learn the flip side of the coin of his powers that it not just produces consequences but also he's starting to become what he doesn't want to be.And of course I really like how he comes through in the end, which just goes to show that all you really need to be to achieve good and great things is yourself.Teen Wolf is howling fun.Rating: 3 stars",Teen Wolf
30,Captain_Couth,"Revenge of the 80's: Good ideas, bad movies.",3,1 July 2004,"Teen Wolf (1985) could have been a good movie if they stuck with the horror themes instead of trying to make an unfunny pre-teen comedy.  When I was a kid, I used to love those old Universal horror films.  I had just watched the Wolf Man and I read somewhere that a movie called Teen Wolf was coming out.  I thought it was going to be a sad story about some stupid kid who's cursed with lycanthorpy.  Boy was I wrong.  What a waste of time.
A vertically challenged ""high school basketball star"" (Michael J. Fox) is bored with his mundane life.  He has a girlfriend (who's he known since grade school) an obnoxious friend and an after school job at his father's hardware store.  Every day, he's been noticing some changes on his person.  He ignores them until he finds out about an old family trait that was passed down from father to son.  Boy, is life different from then on.
A bad movie.  A great concept but horrible execution.  I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this tripe.  I hated this movie as a kid and I still hate it to this very day!
Not recommended.D
When Michael J. transforms into the ""teen wolf"" clad in his basket ball uniform, he looks like a cross between Chewbacca and the legendary Bill Walton (Portland Trailblazers era).

The storyline follows a young man who isn't popular, is an average basketball player on a terrible team, and can't seem to catch the attention of the girl of his dreams.

Fox (Back to the Future), James Hampton (Sling Blade), Lorie Griffin (Cheerleader Camp) and Susan Ursitti (Zapped). This coming of age film is smarter than it should be. There's some great depiction of teenagers and adults struggling to talk the same language (Fox talking to the coache and his parents). The wolf transformation scenes in this are actually pretty good and the basketball scenes are legendary. This has both great conversations/writing (liquor store scene is hilarious), solid soundtrack and I loved the ending. Definitely one of those movies that when it ends you wish would keep

33,snoozejonc,A great slice of 80s fun,7,26 September 2020,"A high school Mr Average finds out he's anything but average when he turns into a werewolf.This is your quintessential 80s feel good movie. We have twenty-something Michael J Fox playing teenage Scott Howard, who is 'sick of being average', in a coming of age movie driven by a sporting underdog narrative with a twist. The twist being he is a werewolf.The werewolf theme is really a subtext for the changes that Scott is going through as part of his adolescence. Who is he going to become in life? Is it 'The Wolf' who he perceives will bring the success and popularity that he craves? Or will he just be himself and stay true to the people who really care about him?As you can imagine the plot and themes aren't particularly original but the movie has a great deal going for it. For one: characters: As the main star, Fox radiates the same charm that made him so compellingly watchable in the 'Back To The Future' trilogy. Jerry Levine is equally charismatic as the best friend and lovable highschool rogue Stiles. Jay Tarses plays a fairly memorable basketball coach who is about as inspiring as a terminal illness. James Hampton and Jim McKrell are both solid as Howard's father and antagonistic vice-principle respectively. Scott Paulin is a bit of a walking cliche as a jock bully and boyfriend of the school glamour-puss played arrogantly by Lorie Griffin. Finally we have the lovely Boof, the sweet girl-next-door type played with perfect wholesome charm by Susan Ursitti.From a technical perspective I think it's pretty good. You can see it's not made on a massive budget, but the spectacle is there all the same. The early scenes where Howard starts his partial transformations are presented with strong visual film-making. I particularly enjoyed the school scenes that jump from one class to the next using the word ""wolf"" as the transition point. His first big full transformation to the wolf is done sensibly and is edited well enough so it doesn't look fake. The movie also has strong imagery throughout all the basketball scenes, using slow motion appropriately and a variety or angles to good effect.In true 80s fashion we have superb use of popular music. The 'Surfing' USA' scenes are so much fun, along with 'Big Bad Wolf' at the high school dance and the two sporting montages we have on the basketball court are the type of thing that defines pure 80s cheese.I enjoyed this as an 80s child when it was one of the few VHS tapes I owned and watched it recently with my four year old daughter. Let's just say we both enjoyed.",Teen Wolf
34,gcd70,Likable cast save howler,4,14 April 2008,"Many may howl in pain at this awful teen comedy with a twist, which finds Michael J. Fox in rather a fix when he discovers he's going through changes most normal teenagers don't experience. Extra hair and growing pains are one thing, but fangs and claws are another.Rod Daniel directs this rather silly script form Joseph Loeb III and Matthew Weisman which really never stood a chance, because the idea itself was too weak ( and not a good one in any case ). The special f/x aren't that great, the makeup is very heavy handed and the soundtrack is unoriginal and none too inspiring.Thank goodness for Fox (who plays the frantic then ultra-cool Scott Howard ) and Susan Ursitti ( as his old buddy ""Boof"" ) who save the picture with their pure likability. Other characters are either one dimensional or completely moronic ( or both in the case of Jerry Levine's ""Stiles"" ). Soundtrack is from Miles Goodman.It is interesting to note that producers astutely withheld the release of ""Teen Wolf"" until after the blockbuster ""Back to the Future"" ( filmed after ""T.W."" ) had cleaned house. They then promptly cashed in with the catch phrase : ""Michael J. Fox is Back from the Future in an all new comedy"".Friday, December 6, 1996 - Video",Teen Wolf
35,dworldeater,Party like a werewolf!,9,17 March 2015,"Teen Wolf is my favorite of Michael J Fox's movies. There is no doubt Back To The Future is a higher quality and better crafted film, but there is a special place in my heart for the crazier, more outrageous classic Teen Wolf. Michael J Fox is a fairly normal teenage dude that is bored with being average. He soon goes through some changes that make him the talk of the town. Once he confesses to his friend Styles that he is a werewolf, Styles then sets a campaign for maximum coolness instantly making him the most popular guy in school. Styles also makes a killing selling Teen Wolf merchandise. Much like every 80's teen movie, our hero has the hots for the stuck up beauty that won't give him the time of day. That is until it becomes fashionable to do so. However, he has a lot of interest from the girl next door, Boof who also looks great but is mad cool as well. This film is grounded by James Hampton(The Longest Yard) who gives a great performance as Michael J Fox's laid back, but caring dad. The father and son chemistry is perfect and without it and without James Hampton, the film would be too silly and not work. Michael J Fox also shows he has some dope moves on the basketball court. His team, The Beavers also has Francis from Pee Wee Herman's Big Adventure as one of his team mates, Chubby. He also has a super laid back coach that does not care about anything and gives horrible advice on life. He also has a lot of fun with his crazy buddy Styles.

At first, the movie is interesting and somewhat original, but this stupid plot is hard to stand for the entire 90 minute run.Scott Howard (Michael J. Fox) is a nerdy basketball player, who more than anything wants to get with the popular girl and be more than just average. One night he transforms into a werewolf, only to find out his dad is one also, and he can change back and forth pretty much as he likes. For some reason his becoming dog like and hairy makes him very popular with the ladies, and he becomes MVP at basketball. Almost all of the humor comes from Scott doing silly things as a werewolf, including doing handstands on a moving van and break dancing in the halls at school. If you think that's funny material, then this is probably the movie for you. With that said, this is somewhat enjoyable, and Michael J. Fox gave as good a performance as he could for such a dumb premised character.Fans of bad 80s films will love this, and even people who like light hearted comedies will enjoy this...others will despise it.

37,Agent10,One of the best of the teen comedies,7,7 May 2002,"Michael J. Fox represents the tragedy that has befallen all youth in high school: the lack of acceptance. While this looks like a comedy about someone's personal difference, its more of a telling commentary on high school and how cruel it can be. One is only accepted through athletic achievement or by who they are. Fox's character only becomes more popular because he can dunk and take over a game. Of course, the team eventually wins in the end, but only after digging deep inside. But all of the dark critiquing aside, this film is quite good because of the unusual twist on an old story. Funny and outlandish, this film has more staying power than the typical teen movie from the 1980s.",Teen Wolf
38,aidanratesmovies,Purely Fun 80's Flick,8,29 May 2020,"Silly and predictable, but very fun and entertaining to watch- Teen Wolf is a pure 80's joy ride. The film is quite often very amusing, and very fun to watch. It's pacing is on spot, and it retains a surprisingly very entertaining nature, despite its awkward moments at times. The film largely relies on Michael J. Fox in the lead role, and his charisma and performance on screen truly propels the film and its fun nature. His casting fits perfectly with the film, and though the rest of the characters in the film feel like an abundance of stereotypes, a few of the other actors in the film do give it their all. Susan Ursitti and James Hampton do fit pretty well in their roles, despite their obviously flawed dialogue. The makeup for the werewolf itself is pretty impressive for the time, especially with the budget only being a little over 1 million. As for the films flaws, it is very predictable at times, and some moments in the film are a bit hard to take seriously. However, due to the lead performances and direction for the film, Teen Wolf is able to provide for a very fun and nostalgic joy ride. Michael J. Fox is great in the film, giving it his all, despite hating the film, and his charisma is one of the main components to the films massive and amusing sucess.

40,vertigo_14,Poor Kid. He had to turn into a werewolf to raise his self-esteem.,4,20 April 2004,"Teen Wolf is really one of the cheesiest horror comedies of it's day, and sometimes, that cheesiness factor depreciates the enjoyability factor. I think it's winds up being a love it or hate it movie. I'm still mixed about it, loving some of the characters (smart ass styles), a few of the sequences (werewolf transformation at unexpected moments), and a bit of the music. But Michael J. Fox turns his character, Scott Howard, into the epitome of hopeless nerd (though not looking like one), even though he's more of just a quiet kid who's not popular or anything like that, and that, for me, makes the movie often difficult to appreciate, despite the little goodies scattered throughout.Scott Howard has an identity crisis. Uh...he's a werewolf. Howl at the moon, scratch behind his ears. The whole bit, thanks to werewolves being a long part of his family lineage. For a kid like Scott Howard, high schooler who's a fairly poor basketball player and super shy around the girls, this is bad news. His self-esteem is shot altoghether, especially when his inner wolf makes an appearance in a big way...during a game on the basketball court.But, maybe being a teen wolf isn't so bad afterall because with the fur and fangs, Scott has also developed something of an alter ego, allowing him to do things he couldn't as just plain Scott Howard. Now, he's an individual. And with that, he's popular, he can play basketball, he can breakdance, he gets good grades, and he can even surf on top of a moving vehicle without falling off. Scott Howard seems to have it all.But Boof (Susan Ursitti), Scott's closest friend and the girl who really likes Scott (more than his superficial infatuation with the popular girl Pamela Wells (Lori Griffin), encourages Scott to get rid of the wolf image. It was fun for a while, but what she admired was the real Scott. This being in part a romantic comedy, Scott will soon realize that Booth is really the girl for him, and being the wolf is turning him into something he's not, or at least not something he's proven that he could do on his own. As many of these films always teach the viewers, Scott's got to learn to gain some self-confidence in himself is he's ever going to expect to do things the teen wolf Scott can do (only without being a wolf). In other words, he'd probably be able to do just what teen wolf could do, if he could only muster up the guts to try hard enough. And Boof is just the proper guidance he needs to realize that.Teen Wolf...too bad it was so damned sentimental. If Scott wasn't so horribly nerdy and uptight, then the characters could've had a little fun with the story, maybe even using some stupid humor. Heck, for a theme repeated so many times, you've got to be creative. One of the few treats in the movie, however, is Jerry Livine as Scott's friend Stiles who finds Scott's wolf dilemma to be an excellent money making opportunity. Stiles is always a guy who's looking for a good time, anyways. And hell, this is also one of Matt Adler's earliest appearances as Louis, Scott's timid friend. The music is kind of good too, for 80s dance and rock.Unfortunately, they even made a sequel to this dumb movie.",Teen Wolf

His enhanced abilities and scary new look quickly make him a star on the court and the most popular kid in school, but as Scott begins to lose himself in ""the animal,"" he must learn that with great power comes great responsibility. This film rest solely on the charming, pitch-perfect performance of Fox and re-watching this today, it is still his performance that raises the film above it's script. Probably the biggest surprise is, how easily everyone accepts Scott's transformation into his alter-ego, without so much as a pitchfork or torch on display. This is all the more surprising given that the 80's weren't particularly known for being accepting of minorities or people who were different. Near the end when that song, 'Shooting for the Moon' starts, it sends a shiver down my spine every time. Soundtrack is just awesome with groovy sound of 80's pop rock joints including Robert Palmer, Amy Holland, The Beach Boys etc.All in all, this is such an awesomely bad movie. I really do enjoy it, but mostly because I was quite young when i fist saw it on TV. If you are 30, 40 years old and you still haven't seen Teen Wolf, you probably never will... but for the rest of us, who grow up with this film, it would be a still memorable classic of retro collections.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",Teen Wolf

44,Howlin Wolf,Adolescence - that time of life when hairs start sprouting everywhere...,7,28 June 2007,"Established and snooty critics are quick to dismiss this as 'the silly little film Michael J. Fox made before he really hit the big time', and, I suppose if you break that statement down semantically then they might be correct. It is a cheerfully silly premise and it doesn't have the largest budget, but to me those aren't reasons not to glory in it.Aside from Fox's self-effacing good nature, this film is plain fun to watch even for its supporting characters. You have Coach Finstock's absurd advice, entrepreneurial best friend Stiles and his multicoloured array of slogan adorned shirts, plus Kirk Lolley, the preening theatre director. Put these individuals to work in a story about the insecurities of growing up, and whilst it might not have much depth, most people are sure to relate to at least some part of it. To top it all off, you can add the rousing music of the 'underdogs making good' finale to the formula, and what you end up with is a slight and unassuming but likable film.Considering the subject, it's likely to be the best 'basketballing werewolf' movie you're ever gonna get, so I say why not make the most of it rather than grumbling?!",Teen Wolf

For me Michael J Fox has been on the upswing while others, like Steve Martin, are headed in the other direction. There's nothing particularly unique about any of the elements of this movie except maybe the combination of all of them. Fox finds he can transform into a werewolf with superhuman powers - his ""problem"" makes him the most popular guy in high school and creates a winning basketball team. Forget that the wolf playing Fox on the court must be twice his size and four times the athlete, this movie is just a lot of fun to watch, helped considerably by Hampton as the understanding dad and Ursitti as the under-appreciated girl friend. Very rewatchable.",Teen Wolf
46,blott2319-1,Pure fun that actually holds up well,8,25 August 2020,"I never realized Teen Wolf was so light-hearted and fun. I remember seeing snippets of the movie on TV and seeing the werewolf playing basketball, so it should have been obvious, but this movie doesn't take much seriously. In fact, aside from some mild shock when the transformation first happens in front of people, in general no one acts as though the existence of werewolves is all that surprising. What would probably be earth-shattering news in the real world, turns out to just be a way of winning basketball games in this one. Because the film was so playful about it all, I found it to be quite enjoyable. It's a silly coming-of-age story that could have been told just as well without the werewolf thing, but that made for a more humorous metaphor when it comes to the changing bodies of teenagers. Also, I imagine the werewolf makeup and costume made it much easier to substitute a body-double for the stunts and some of the basketball.I'm a sucker for any film that features Michael J. Fox, and he brings a lot of charm to Teen Wolf. For such a charismatic actor, I am always impressed how he can portray genuine insecurity and fear. Of course, in addition to Fox, the film pulls that classic 1980s trick of filling the cast of ""high school kids"" with people in their mid-20s. Over the years I've found that, once you accept it, the whole age difference kind of fades away and it's easy to forget that it was ever an issue. I also have to mention that I loved James Hampton in his small role as the dad. He is the perfect average and ordinary dad who delivers wholesome advice, which makes the reveal mid-way through the movie work so well. Teen Wolf certainly has some weaker moments that don't hold up nowadays, and it is somewhat irreverent and goofy. But there's enough pure entertainment value in the film, that I enjoyed it even without one bit of nostalgia from my childhood.",Teen Wolf
47,ODDBear,"Somewhat enjoyable, especially for fans of Michael J. Fox",5,16 August 2008,"Young Scott Howard (Fox) is bored with being so average. Working in a hardware store managed by his dad, not being at all good in basketball and the girl of his dreams won't even say two words to him. But then he learns that he's also a werewolf and his social status rockets.If the film didn't have the irresistibly appealing Michael J. Fox on board I doubt seriously the film would have enjoyed any success at all. Fox was the real star in ""Family Ties"" and the film got released in theatres after the phenomenal success of ""Back to the Future"" and therefore; Teen Wolf was a hit. It's not totally devoid of real laughs now and then (that one on one with the coach is pretty funny) but it's a very ho hum little flick.And don't you just love the 80's. Everything here is so dated, from the music to the clichéd basketball finale. But that's just why we over 30's think so fondly of these films. When all is said and done this really is just plain old good natured fun where the good guys win over the bad guys in the end. There's no bad language or below the belt sexual humor. Of course it's cheesy but it's somewhat enjoyable for the very least.As said, Michael J. Fox really shines as the angst ridden teenager with a problem not everyone can relate to. The rest of the cast do their bits well enough and fare pretty well.At the end of the day Teen Wolf is a fun diversion for an hour and a half and you could do a lot worse. For instance you could watch the sequel.",Teen Wolf
48,vip_ebriega,"TEEN WOLF has no bark nor howl, just a whimper.",3,28 September 2007,"My Take: Unfunny teen flick that reeks in the 80's right now. Expectations weren't so high on my meter when I currently saw TEEN WOLF on TV. I immediately made comments about the film. Being it way too stupid to be any source of entertainment. My expectations serves me correct, TEEN WOLF has no bark nor howl, just a whimper. It's the usual substandard teen hokum you expect to find in a tilted, dated teen flick crossed with bits of pseudo-B horror flick.Michael J. Fox, fresh from his Marty McFly role in BACK TO THE FUTURE, plays Scott Howard, a totally bashed-up wimp (of course), who suddenly gets to become the school's next ""big thing"", when he discovers he can transform to a werewolf, even after the full moon. This gives him certain amount of fame, gets to be the school's hotshot basketball star, and gets to hang out with the school's hottest girl.TEEN WOLF has every single thing teenage movies have. Wimps that turn to popular dues, hot young teen chicks in their under wear, the strict school principal and the big jocks that gets embarrassed in the end. Now, cross that with a plot about a family that has a legacy for lycantrophy and you got TEEN WOLF, a dreadfully silly film that's way too dated to be given much credit.The director, Rod Daniel, is used to this kind of shaggy dog stories. TEEN WOLF is one example of this shaggy-dog story, crossed with teen stuff that doesn't exactly blend well. Michael J.Fox manages to keep his face stalwart, although he's soooo much better in BACK TO THE FUTURE any day. The rest of the cast are just a bunch of teens who are used to all this hokum.Overall, I'm not recommending TEEN WOLF to anyone. Instead of telling us a good werewolf story (not necessarily a straight horror film), which is also a good subject, instead of a wild ANIMAL HOUSE-inspired teen flick, this film could have at least had a bit of recommendation.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",Teen Wolf
49,phubbs,Teen Wolf,8,1 February 2014,"In the same year that Fox became a superstar going back to the future he also had this little werewolf gem creep out. The title says its all really in its brilliant cheesy way, a typical 80's film title. Young teen Fox slowly discovers that he is in fact a werewolf and its been in the family for generations. In all honesty this is your very standard cheeky 80's high school romp which was the staple diet of many classic comedians throughout the 70's and 80's. The twist in this of course is the supernatural element which is simply a play on the effects of puberty, swapping spots for claws. Its all here as you would expect, the sexy blonde everybody lusts after, the plain brunette our hero never notices, the party obsessed crazy ass best friend, the quiet sensible best friend, the bully, the fat kid, the token black guy (lemonade...awesome character name) and various amusing stereotypical teachers. The best easily being the carefree gum chewing basketball coach.So if you put the predictable teen antics to one side what are the wolf antics like? Well its pretty darn sweet as a matter of fact, and what's more amazing is the makeup effects on show are really quite good. The little sequence of Fox turning into the wolf has clearly been influenced by 'An American Werewolf in London' and its a really well done moment. Its not scary or gruesome in any of course but it still does look quite realistic utilising simple effects and quick editing. His father in wolf mode doesn't look quite as good admittedly, more like a greying woodland animal with puffed up hair.There isn't all that much wolf action so to speak, its mostly more silly high school antics but in wolf mode. Wolf mode gives our hero greater strength, better vision, brains etc...the guy becomes a super werewolf and aces everything in school whilst becoming a ladykiller (not literately). The main events of the film are based around the high school basketball games in which Fox's character usually sucks but naturally as a werewolf he's turned the game on its head. This film actually got me into basketball for a time, it introduced me to the game, because of this I bought NBA Jam hehe. The game segments are really good fun and as the film climaxes it does get a little emotional I can't deny. The game montage accompanied by Mark Safan's 'Win in the End' is glorious mainly down to that corking track. Funny how the underneath of Fox's arms didn't have any werewolf hair applied, always obvious when he raises his arms. I think people can relate to this film in many ways, certain characters despite them being cliché, the problems of popularity, loneliness, bullying, sexuality etc...usual teen stuff. In all fairness this film doesn't really differ much from the vast array of fast food American high school flicks out there, the werewolf angle is only a different representation of teen angst. It shouldn't really be a good film but somehow it is, what you see isn't original and there aren't any dazzling special effects, its more a character/school based fantasy which is simply a good fun little ride. Attractive performances all round especially from Levine as Stiles and a wicked soundtrack make this a solid cult gem.8.5/10",Teen Wolf
50,Ruskington,The best surrealist eighties teen canine drama movie ever made,6,13 April 2020,"What I love about this movie is that it has this incredibly bizarre premise but doesn't insult us by trying to explain it all. Scott, played by the baby-faced Michael J Fox, turns into a werewolf for no apparent reason and that's fine. His Dad is also a werewolf for no apparent reason and that's fine as well. Being a werewolf somehow turns Scott into a great basketball player, and this too, is fine. Oh, and don't forget that werewolves are also great breakdancers.The movie looks great, with many beautiful shots drenched in dusky Nebraskan sunshine. Michael J Fox is as cute as a button and is one of the most iconic faces of this era. The wolf make-up is very average but that kind of fits in with the film's casual attitude to this strange transformative process.Teen Wolf is a harmless piece of cinema that is light-hearted, charming and enjoyable. It has a pleasant youthful vibe and is carried along by an unmistakably eighties soundtrack.",Teen Wolf
51,aesgaard41,Big Bad Movie,1,2 January 2004,"I hate this movie, but somehow it made enough money to warrant an even weaker sequel. I'm a horror purist and I hate it when a movie twists and distorts the facts to squeeze a script out of nothing. Michael J. Fox plays a teen with a werewolf heritage, but instead of turning into a wolf man at the sign of the full moon and terrorizing the countryside, he just spouts hair and wins basketball games. Just when the concept couldn't get any more stupid, he is graciously accepted by being a freak by his peers. I've known kids who terrorized others for mismatched socks ! And who knew wolves were basketball players; that's one tidbit that I'm sure Steve Irwin would like to know about. If a wolf attacks, just distract it with a basketball ! Please don't waste your time watching this movie; I cringe today just wondering how this movie got made! The best movie Fox ever did was ""Back to the Future,"" but after the success of that movie, he was tossed into this movie and several more trying to parlay his young good looks, but ""Teen Wolf"" just fails pitifully, yet still somehow garnishes as its own cult hit. It's ""Dude, Where's My Car"" for the Eighties.",Teen Wolf

54,Hayden-86055,Sort of charming 80s comedy with Michael J Fox,5,19 January 2021,"Teen Wolf is no masterpiece, in fact the film barely holds together just sort of riding off the idea of him being a werewolf, there's actually very little plot to it! It's rather unexciting after the reveal but Michael J Fox is a joy to watch and the other members of the cast like Stiles, Chubby and the coach just about hold the film together.5/10: Rather average film that has Michael J Fox in it basically",Teen Wolf
55,MovieCriticOnline,Super Simple Story but goofy fun,4,24 March 2020,"It's the typical goofy 80s movie that is is basically a 3 mi n skit turned into a feature. It takes about 45 min or more before anything happens, because right from the beginning he is already changing into the teen wolf. No time to get to know the characters etc as it would have been in normal writing.The nerd, the jock, the beauty queen, the girl next door etc, they are all there to satisfy the stereotypical 80s film.So no great filmmaking here, but if you are bored and want to cheesy for for 90 min go for it.

To be fair, it's probably more of an issue of mine, for me, than simply a common occurrence. This movie truly is deserving of being called a classic. At least, I think it's called/considered a classic.The only ""issue"" that I had with it, although that's more of an overstatement, if anything, is that there didn't seem to be a story. I mean, there was, in a sense, it just felt directionless, I guess. Other than that, there weren't any issues as far as I could ascertain. Then again, I'm not looking for any.It was a fun, slightly goofy movie. You may have to suspend your disbelief, though, just a little bit. I didn't have to, but I can understand why some people wouldn't like it. I liked it very much. If you're looking for a laid-back movie to watch to bask yourself in after watching more intense, stress-inducing, tension-filled movies, this should fulfill what you're looking for, and if not, you must be watching a lot of nerve-racking movies. I know that feeling. But, in general, this movie should do the trick.",Teen Wolf
57,Med-Jasta,Just fine,6,19 March 2020,"This movie is what it is and it's fine. It's fun, it's easy, it's teenage fantasy. My biggest gripe about this movie is the teenagers that don't act like teenagers. I mean that's how we all wish we were then. I really love that there is a werewolf and not only does nobody care but he's the coolest guy in school. No reporters come by, no scientist and no one really questions this. I kinda respect the film makers more for just saying kill it to that logic and moving on with the story. Several times I found myself asking, ""how the hell did they come up with this story?I really liked that the werewolf thing was genetic, that was a cool take on it. Of course MJF is always likable and fun to watch. He could be an SS officer doing the worst things to humans and he'd still be likable.",Teen Wolf

It happens to be so typical 1980's the  major theme is about fitting in with the crowd at your high school, the main goal is to become popular. As Scott Howard (Michael J.

Leaving the morals aside this is a simple tale, with some really stupid scenes and some fairly good ones.  There is far too much basketball playing, which makes it a touch boring and the car roof surfing is a bit silly.  If it was not for Michael J Fox, this film would have totally fallen to pieces.  Fox is charismatic as always, but not nearly as good in this as he was in Back to the future.  They really underplay the horror in this film, when you think about it- if you had a werewolf at your school, wouldnt they be more of an outcast?

62,LanceBrave,Stupid kids' movie that's a bit too raunchy for kids,6,3 November 2013,"When people complain about the ""Twilight""-ifaction of the classic monsters, I like to point out that Stephanie Myer did not invent this phenomenon. Cinema isn't that old a medium. It was only about thirty-so years old when the Universal Monsters came along. It was only twenty-some years later when pop culture overexposure had watered the original horrors down to TV sitcoms, kid cartoons, and breakfast cereals. You can't trace a path from Lon Chaney Jr. hunting maidens on the foggy moors to Taylor Lautner turning into a big shiny husky without passing through ""Teen Wolf,"" a fondly remembered bit of ridiculous eighties nostalgia.The premise is hacky, Hollywood, high concept writing at its best/worst/burst. Scott Howard is a high school student who's not quite a loser but definitely isn't cool. He plays, poorly, basketball for his school's poor basketball team. His friends are weirdoes obsessed with van-surfing who can only get into the good parties by promising to bring booze. His object of desire, the hottest girl in school is also a drama student somehow, is way out of his league. All of this is confounded when Scott finds out he's a werewolf. While horrified at first, the powers that come along with the transformations quickly make Scott the most popular kid in school. But, ah, the screenplay implores us, will Scott learn to accept himself for who he is? If that plot synopsis didn't clue you in, ""Teen Wolf' is an exceptionally dumb movie. Co-written by Jeph Loeb, a frequently terrible comic writer who gets a life-time pass for ""Commando,"" the movie takes place in that bizarro high school world that only exists in 1980s comedies. One of Scott's basketball teammates is a big fat guy clearly in his thirties. Even the perpetually youthful Michael J. Fox looks a bit too old for this. Jerry Levine plays Scott's best friend, Stiles, a really bizarre creation. Aside from the van surfing, he wears obnoxious t-shirts and MCs inexplicable party games, one of which involve two people in their underwear, tied up and covered in whipped cream. The entire premise hinges on the student body finding a kid turning into a werewolf to be the coolest thing ever. That strikes me as somewhat unlikely. Despite this being made in the mid-eighties, the film parodies ""Saturday Night Fever"" during the prom scene.Despite its general dumbness, ""Teen Wolf"" manages to mildly amuse at times. Released the same year as ""Back to the Future,"" Fox is as charming as ever, making his bizarre character a likable every-kid. Even when Scott's sudden popularity is suppose to turn him into a huge jerk, Fox makes him immensely likable. Occasionally, the movie's lame humor catches up with its wacky premise. The basketball couch delivers rambling, heart-to-heart speeches that are in no way helpful. James Hampton is delightfully dead-pan as Scott's very patience father. The jerk principal subplot pays off nicely. Susan Ursitti is also over-qualified as Scott's childhood friend. You know the two of them are going to end up together and it's clear she loves him. However, Ursitti and Fox have great chemistry and she's likable enough to make the obvious plot mechanics less clunky.Like all ridiculous high school stories, ""Teen Wolf"" tries to play its deeply inane premise for drama in the last act. The school turns on the wolf and Scott is forced to prove himself at the final basketball game. It makes the preceding stupidity seems even more stupid in retrospect, no more so then when an overdone ballad plays over the slow-motion end-credits. The werewolf make-up isn't very good and, considering the tiny budget, it's no surprise that there's only one on-screen transformation. The storyline involving Scott's crush, her douche bag boyfriend, and the drama teacher is terrible. The sometimes homophobic dialogue will probably make you wince. ""Teen Wolf"" is an occasionally entertaining stupid kid's movie that's a bit too raunchy for kids. Aside from a terrible cartoon show and terrible sequel, the movie would also lend its title to a terrible MTV supernatural romance soap-opera, bringing the ""Twilight' connection full-circle.",Teen Wolf

I always liked the parts in the classroom when Fox starts hearing wolf being said everywhere. Wolf wolf wolf wolf. ""Thomas J Wolf!"" Yells one of his teachers during Fox's hallucinations. Fox keeps desperately trying to keep from changing into the wolf in school. He runs through the hallways bathroom to bathroom, trying to find a place where no one will see him. Then he runs into his arch nemises, the principal. The principal does not see him turn into the wolf, well not that time. He does a little while later, along with many other of his student peers during basketball practice. Fox is on the basketball team. Like in most 80s high school movies, there is the bully that the hero keeps getting pushed around by. And the hot girl who the hero has an burning desire for, and the girl barely noticing he's alive. How many other highschool movies have we seen with the same formula? In ""Teen wolf"", the bully's name is Nick, and the hot girl's name is Pamela. And the two of them are (what a surprise!) going out together. And Pamela is (what a surprise) a blonde. Anyway, one night after a night out, Fox comes home and rushes to the bathroom, noticing something very strange is happening to him. That's his first time changing into the wolf, and it's when we see Fox's father has the same wolf problem. We also learn that the reason Fox's principal gives him a hard time is because Fox's dad, as the wolf, had previous problems in the past with Fox's principal. So the principal is taking it out on him now. Then Fox turns into the wolf during basketball and then decides to keep it that way because he realizes that he has extra powers as the wolf, he's suddenly able to really kick butt at basketball, and his popularity suddenly skyrockets. Personally, Fox looks a lot more like a hairy gorilla than a wolf. And in real life, girls would not be attracted to and want to touch someone that looks like that, no matter how strong it makes him. Fox's friends include a goofball named Styles and a nice ""girl next door"" type who Fox had been friends with but not intimate with. Fox had always had eyes for Pamala, and once he's the wolf, he does get intimate with her. In Pamela's dressing room after play rehearsal. She pulls off her shirt for Fox, but we only see her from the back. He's also able to defend himself from Nick now. I have one curious question: on a date with Pamela at the bowling alley, they run into Nick. And Nick tells Fox that his mother used to steal chickens from him, and he then shot her. Was Nick just talking s***, or was it true? Cause we never see Fox's mother during this movie, and nothing else is ever mentioned about her from anyone else. And also Fox's reaction is so angry to what Nick said.",Teen Wolf

Fox turns into a werewolf and becomes a popular star of his high school basketball team. There is even a dance at his prom that is wolf related. The whole school turns wolf crazy but Fox learns the right lesson in the end. How can you not love this corny crap. I'll be the first to admit that this isn't a good movie and is incredibly stupid, but honest to goodness crapfests don't have Stiles or a breakdancing wolf. Take that American Werewolf in London. Recently Teen Wolf has been blessed with DVD release along with it's sequel, Teen Wolf Too, on one disc. 80's fans rejoice!Bottom Line: It isn't worthy of even trying to call itself good, but it's a classic, doesn't take itself seriously, and occupies a honored place on my shelf.",Teen Wolf

It makes little sense, even less when you consider some of the lines in it, like, ""Do the right thing. That's all I want to do"" There is no moral, there is no justice. But I watched it dozens of times. As movies go, it works to make a person feel good, somehow. Maybe what is good about this super corny movie, it is just the music. ""Shooting for the Moon"" by Amy Harding is a tremendous ending song, one of the most beautiful songs, I ever heard. Maybe it is a nice ending that couples tremendous cheers with the main character, getting something right, finally after apparently getting so much wrong throughout the movie. Maybe it is Boof, (Susan Urisitti). She is very likable. Maybe I can't explain it logically. But I like it.",Teen Wolf

The film has a very strange feeling with some jokes that land, but the cast never acts like they do, and some jokes that don't land.

67,xbrad68,Michael J Fox during his movie career peak,9,20 June 2004,TEEN WOLF is a charming teen comedy/fantasy the kind you might look forward to seeing at the Wellfleet Drivein Theatre in Massachusetts or the Hanover Drivein in Ontario. Director Rod Daniel does a good job directing because of scenes like Michael J Fox surfing on the top of a van. Remember that while that may like cool in a movie it is illegal. Of course werewolves don't really exist. In Germany after the second world war the German resistance called themselves the werewolves. Since I am non-violent I am pro-American because they are like the worlds policemen. If the American Presidents wanted to call themselves werewolves I would still think of them as great leaders.        Doug Savant of Melrose Place fame is in TEENWOLF as Brad. Michael J Fox as Scott Howard gets up to mischief when he goes to a beer store and says that he wants beer with a growl low enough to get the beer from the startled employee. Fox seems believable when he is hanging out at the diner as a wolf and everybody is walking around accepting the fact. These days if you say you are a werewolf people react with a phobia. Foxs character is a good example of non-violent werewolf. They call President George W Bushs advisors the VULCANS and nobody thinks this is a fantasy but the moment you say you are the Omega Wolf of the American Intelligence Community you have multiple police cars pulling up to your doorway. The lesson is if your CIA Handlers call themselves SPOOKS and WEREWOLVES you shouldn't tell people or they will just get scared. The term Vulcan for the Presidents Advisors doesn't seem to scare Americas enemies and maybe it should because they hang out with spooks and werewolves. I gave TEENWOLF a 9 out of 10.,Teen Wolf
68,sibisi73,An American werewolf in high school.,6,12 December 2002,"After the huge success of 'An American Werewolf In London' (1981) werewolves suddenly found themselves back in vogue. With that in mind, and on the coat-tails of Fox's 'Back To The Future', it was the perfect time for this hastily put together effort. Surprisingly the quick mix of comedy and teen angst, with a horror movie twist is fairly successful. Fox, forever the eternal teen, is so likeable that he cuts through most of the cringeworthy dialogue with ineffable charm. However, not even he can save the embarrassment (of performer or viewer) during the party scene where the film is invaded by extras from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video.Still, the film runs through all the coming-of-age cliches with a twist, and is very funny at times - the revelation of Scott's dad at the bathroom door is priceless. That it runs out of steam is more down to the weakness of the idea itself, rather than the energy of those involved, and it provides the prerequisite happy ending in bucketloads. How can you fail to like it?",Teen Wolf
69,boe_dye,Well... somethings just didn't make it out of the 80's,6,7 August 2019,"This was one of the first high school teen movies I had ever seen growing up. Naturally, I had seen it as reruns on television, so naturally a bit of editing occurred, as the original dialogue and sight gags were not suitable for television.You know... some movies age well, and others... let's just say that they were great for a time and now that the time is gone it's not so great anymore. It's not that there is anyone one wrong thing with the movie -- it's an interesting concept. For the most part the acting is pretty well done and the story is... well, it's interesting but retrospectively kind of cringey.No one really questions the elephant in the room, and they just kind of run Scotts sudden transformation. Suddenly because he can become a werewolf he becomes the most popular kid in school all because he can play basketball really, really well. No need for being discreet, no troubles being cautious -- he just wolfs out, and the townsfolk are entirely cool with it.It never dawned on me that the principle cast were all in their 20s when this was filmed, and I could never really understand why High School students looked so old in the movies growing up. Knowing this makes the movie all that much more silly in that you realize that the actors and actresses really had to pull from their past to relive the horrors of highschool in order to film this.It's got it's fun moments, and I can't deny that it did inspire in my 16 year old self to try car surfing on an occasion or two. But today, here and now I am left wondering why everyone suddenly loved the Teen Wolf simply because puberty hit ad absurdum.Is it terrible? No... Is it worth the watch? Maybe if you want to realive a bit of 80's nostalgia, but I highly doubt younger audiences today would get into it as it's a bit dated, and not terribly interesting compared to some of the more interesting selections from this time period.",Teen Wolf

71,Teknofobe70,Entertaining teen comedy ...,6,16 August 2005,"Let's face it, from his ""Back to the Future"" years, this is probably the other Michael J. Fox movie that people most remember. It was teen fodder, really -- made hip by the soundtrack, the actors, and plenty of dodgy in-jokes. Not to mention the ""van surfing"" scenes, which got the filmmakers into a lot of trouble with concerned parents who were worried that their idiot kids might try to imitate it.In ""Teen Wolf"", Michael J Fox play an unhappy high school kid who isn't popular and plays on a terrible basketball team (already stretching believability there) who finds himself going through some rather odd changes. As it turns out, he has inherited the werewolf genes from his father and is becoming, yup, a TEEN WOLF! He is unable to hide this from his high school friends, and ends up changing in the middle of a basketball game. However, in wolf form he is a star at basketball, as well as at pretty much everything else he tries. Suddenly he is popular and well-known, but does it all come at a price? From a moral point of view, it's all very American. There's not much to separate the good guys from the bad, being self-centred isn't necessarily a bad thing, and winning actually IS everything. It separates itself from most previous werewolf movies simply because it's so lighthearted. There had been other werewolf movies that were aimed at the teen audience -- 1957's ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" being one that shares a lot in common with ""Teen Wolf"", the main difference being that it was primarily a horror rather than a comedy.So how old was Michael J Fox when he played the ""Teen Wolf""? Well, he was 24 of course. Nevertheless he does a good job, being the reliable actor that he is, but of course he can never really escape from his Marty McFly persona. The supporting cast are all decent, managing not to embarrass themselves despite the inherent silliness of the movie. The fact is, this could have been a lot worse -- and it surely would have been if it wasn't for the charisma of it's lead actor. But ultimately it was made as light-hearted entertainment for teenagers with nothing better to do, and that's exactly what it is.You might also want to know that in the very last shot of this movie (right before the cheesy freeze frame), one of the extras is doing something very naughty. See if you can spot it. Go on.",Teen Wolf

77,rneil95,"Enjoyable, Albeit Cheesy Flick",7,26 February 2011,"Despite a thick layer of cheese poured over the entire film, ""Teen Wolf"" is a campy, classic comedy of the 80's. Michael J. Fox stars as Scott Howard, a high school student who's going through changes, one of which being that he happens to be a werewolf. He eventually is able to turn the situation positive when he uses his werewolf persona to become the star of the basketball team and the new cool guy on campus. This movie is incredibly entertaining despite being cheap-looking and cheesy at times. The story is clichéd by today's standards, and it feels slightly dated, but for me that just increases the likability of it. The jokes hit fast and funny, and there's numerous memorable scenes and it ends up leaving you desiring more, and that's always a good sign when you don't want the movie to be over. Even though we never got a good follow-up to Teen Wolf, the original is still a classic film that was a huge part of my childhood and to this day remains to be a really fun movie despite some plot holes and cheesy dialogue and whatnot. I highly recommend it",Teen Wolf

The all time best part is when Scott Howard's dad says, ""unless that was another werewolf doing a handstand on Stiles' Wolfmobile!""  I personally didn't know that living organisms play better basketball as canines than as human beings.  This movie can teach you a thing or two about life.  I also didn't know that the hottest chicks at school were interested in wolf love.  Now I know why ""doggystyle"" is so popular!  This is a great flick to watch solely to make fun of.  If you bring up a good Teenwolf conversation and someone knows what you're talking about, you might want to take heed though, it really isn't too cool.

There is no doubt that the ending was the typical happy ending to fun and goofy 80's movie but I always thought the ending of the movie had a little extra special feeling to it.

In fact the truth is...its really rather good. O.k, I can honestly say hand on heart i love Teen wolf, see theres no shame in it! Its pure cheesy hokum but its done it such a warm, lighthearted and typically corny 1980's sort of a way i can excuse it. For me Teen Wolf is less about a boy in a wolf costume and much more about fitting in, growing up and being true to yourself. The story revolves around everyday teen Scott Howard who finds out he's a werewolf (as you do!) and discovers that this gives him the gift of instant celebrity. He is no longer just one of the crowd but the star basketball player and all round school hotshot, however everything comes at a price and Scott has to learn a few valuable lessons about love, popularity, responsibilities and friendship along the way. Michael J Fox uses his likeable charm to create a cute and sympathetic character and its a great credit to him that you actually care about Scott and his problems no matter how strange they may seem. Scott's best friend Stile's provides plenty of funny moments and the 80's pop soundtrack compliments the film perfectly. All in all its a fun little movie and it probably has alot more heart and class than most of the 'teen' movies being made nowadays.

At the time, I thought it was a really cool movie, but I was only 8 or 9 then. Having recently watched a tape of it that I borrowed from the library, my opinion has changed. I think the premise was a really good idea, but the writers/producers don't seem to have done much with it. The entire plot can be summed up like this: ""High school student turns into werewolf, becomes popular, then discovers that his true friends are the ones who liked him for himself."" There's really no ""meat"" to the story. Scott's father tells him that he'll have ""great powers"" but we only see two of them: the ability to play basketball really well, and the ability to find a stash of marijuana by smelling it. I think they should have shown some of Scott's other powers, or how his day-to-day life had changed (aside from his popularity). To me, concentrating on the wolf aspect of the story would have been more interesting than Scott's pursuit of the snobby blonde girl. I also agree with the other reviewers about the wolf costume/makeup.

A couple years ago I was re-watching this movie and realized that it was not as good as I remember. I am still saying 6 stars because the good part of this movie was Micheal J Fox. Not just Micheal J Fox but Fox in his prime years. Micheal J Fox's pure charm is one of only really good thing about his movie. The script is just awful and sometimes it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a teen drama. Now why a comedy/teen drama can work if handled correctly (Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueuller's Day Off, or any movie made by John Hughes) but this isn't good at mixing the drama and the comedy.Its a lot better then Teen Wolf Too though.",Teen Wolf

105,philipross,One strange crazy comedy movie out of my league here!,2,7 March 2000,I remember watching Teen Wolf and some of the parts are okay and a little bit funny. Expect for this one scene were it includes a half nude teenage woman when she take off her bra. While she's wearing her own panties on herself. By seducing making love to Michael J. Fox in a make-up and dressing room. I'd think this babes naked back side body has a hot & sexy figure of herself. I used to have this movie but not anymore it isn't my favorite film. Great acting though with a few talents and unknown star cast's portrayed here!,Teen Wolf

What a heartwarming and wonderful movie. It had my family and I laughing, in tears, angry. Teen Wolf gives me emotions I thought I couldn't experience, at least until now. It's moral is something you truly never see. Sometimes you should be yourself, you don't have to change to satisfy others. I learned that today after watching this glorious movie. I have zero complaints and I found nothing about this movie to be cliché or predictable. What other movies can you name where Chewbacca plays basketball or surfs on a car roof? Exactly. There's none. Don't even get me started on that iconic soundtrack. There are two wolves inside me, one loves Teen Wolf, the other adores Teen Wolf. Watch Teen Wolf.",Teen Wolf

However, it STILL has to use that make-up that was used as far as 40 or 50 years before??? I guess computer animation hadn't been developed yet. Anyways, my main thought is that TW holds its own for a B-movie, I've been thinking of UK and Japanese re-makes--- [pelted with several hard pieces of sports equipment]...and, culturally, my main thing is this: Love it or hate it, it's difficult to ignore Teen Wolf.

109,strokingoffbeef,Underrated Classic That Displays Early Michael J. Fox's Diverse Acting Talents,10,10 August 2009,"I've noticed reviewers revel in taking pot shots at the numerous plot holes in this film. That's much too easy a thing to do and a complete cop out. Besides, that's not what this movie is about. It's about relating those ""awkward teenage blues"" to the big screen. Michael J. Fox's Scott Howard is every bit as charming and charismatic as Marty McFly or Alex P. Keaton. Jerry Levine's Styles is as witty and subversive as Corey Feldman's Mouth from the Goonies. The free spirited interaction between Scott, Styles and Louis when they first ""ride the waves"" on their way to the party is the most honest depiction of what high school is really all about. Maybe the plot of the movie is Swiss cheese, but Teen Wolf is a brutally funny and emotional realistic display of everyday working-class kids and the awkward situations of their adolescence. It is actually more realistic and astute than most movies that are critical favorites. Brokeback Mountain was a critical favorite, yet how many blue-collar AIDS- infested cowboy fags from Wyoming have you met in real life anyway? What about Pulp Fiction? That was supposed to be good, but in reality it was simply an unorganized rehash of a bunch of cheesy movies from the 70's. Slumdog Millionaire? Yeah, like any real human being without homicidal, suicidal or genocidal aspirations can relate to a bunch of towelheads prancing around a third-world wasteland set to music. Teen Wolf is a classic that is still quoted to this day. Where are all the critical faves? Long forgotten, that's where! By the way, ""Win in the End"" by Mark Safan is right up there with Joe Esposito's ""You're the Best"" and Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" as the most inspirational songs on a movie soundtrack ever! The ending is every bit as good today as it was in the late summer of 1985 when this movie first came out.",Teen Wolf
110,byates21,My favourite as a kid.,8,17 June 2003,"The first memory I have of this film is standing in a line that stretched right around the block and into the car park to see it. Even then we didn't get in and had to come back. I'm not sure why it was in such high demand, probably because it was released in the wake of Back to the Future.Maybe I am biased because I loved this film so much as a child (I had a copy taped from T.V. that I watched every Saturday morning) but I still think this film is excellent. A true eighties classic. It has so many fun elements, bang on characters (Styles, Coach Finstock, Pamela) and great quotes that I don't think it can be considered anything but.
Of course if you watch this film for the first time now, you may find it to be a cheap flick with a silly story. However, in my opinion a thoroughly likeable movie that gave us a fantastic slice of wish fufilment as well as a good old-fashioned lesson in remembering who your friends are.",Teen Wolf

112,sbennett-12,5.4...Are you kidding me?,8,2 May 2008,"Yes, at first, this movie seems to be just another quirky comedy to come out of the lighthearted 80's era of film making. But, if you dive a little deeper, and pay close attention to the final scene in the film, you are left with an accurate glimpse into high school life as we all knew it. Most of the characters are send-ups to John Hughes, post Weird Science (I.E. over-the-top stereotypes) but the Scott character is a real gem. This is a guy who is the most average guy on the planet. He has girl problems. He doesn't fit in. More than that, he longs to fit in. This longing builds up in him for so long that it finally manifests itself as the wolf character. This character makes him cool, athletic, and gives him confidence. The problem with this character, as any of us who ""acted"" cool in school will remember, is that it is hard to get a handle on the character once it starts rolling. Scott traded in his own pride and self-worth for 15 minutes of fame being something he wasn't. The rest of the movie is about him getting a handle on that inner struggle and coming to terms with being himself. This ""wolf"" allegory could be used to sum up a thousand different feelings. Shy, nerdy, poor, rich, homosexuality, etc. The movie is about liking yourself for who you are and not hiding the truth from anyone. Once he tempers himself, he wins the big game and is hoisted above the shoulders as all of his friends (our friends) carry him off to a slow-motion, highly sensitive, and ultimately satisfying ending! Give this movie a better score you morons!!",Teen Wolf
113,jjjloy,Fox is a Great Wolf,6,12 June 2017,"Whether or not if you view this as a corny teenage 80's movie. There is no denying the Michael J Fox was perfect to play Scott, with his uneasy on screen antics Michael was a perfect choice for the film.

117,eamonn-redmond,"He's not a teen or a wolf, he's a teen wolf",10,5 June 2006,"To say that Teen Wolf was the runt of the 1980's teen comedy genre would be a dog faced lie. This brilliantly cast ensemble comedy showcases all that was great about the free loving 1980's. In what other decade could one bodaciously surf on on top of a gas guzzling wolf mobile with an utter disregard for public safety and still look so god dam cool. When Michael J fox's character Scott Howard starts growing hair in very funny places he believes he is finally becoming a teen, in reality he is becoming a teen wolf. A secret his father has kept from him, Scott doesn't really seem to mind about what in this reviewers opinion is a massive lie that could psychology damage an adolescent and also shatter the entire civilized worlds reality when it comes to werwolf's, vampires and the boogy man. Hey, but I obviously don't have the vision that director Rod Daniel does. Daniel takes the genres of comedy and horror and mixes them in a great big melting pot of cinematic marvel to create a genre of his own, Horrody. The movie is best viewed as a 1980's period piece and a reflection on a simpler way of life. These days if a young teen wolf revealed himself in all his hairy glory he would be called a freak or even worse a terrorist. Oh how we long for those halcyon days. Teen Wolf is a howling success of a movie and may I recommend a doggy bag because you will definitely want more latter.",Teen Wolf
118,eric-1262,Michael J. Fox: In memorandum,8,23 August 2006,God forbid...when (and if?) Michael J. Fox passes. The Motion Picture Academy will have to honor the life of one of its top Hollywood elite with a choice spot in the montage of deceased stars. Especially since his distinguished block of work spanned so many decades. He might even garner the coveted closing spot saved for the marquee death of the year. But I hope they don't go with the quick 'character-menagerie' version. That would be a black mark on the career of too fine an actor. I hope they go with the movie clip testimonial. Because the clip that best solidifies an actor's foundation is his rise to glory. In Memorandum 'Michael J. Fox' (clip) TEEN WOLF: M.J. in full adolescent teen glory biting/shotgunning a beer can with wolf fangs in the middle of a bowling alley with the crowd responding in the only way possible: euphoric applause...now that's a life.

Not only was it the first and only time that I worked with my best friend Jim Hampton, but Michael J Fox and the director Ron Daniels made ever day a wonderful time of work. Thanks to all the folks that saw and loved this movie. I still have people come up to me and say, ""Oh, your the guy who peed his pants."" That scene wouldn't have been in the picture if it were not for Jim Hampton remembering a earlier scene (one that hadn't been shot yet) in which he explained to MJF that when he showed the wolf to Rusty (the principal, me) Rusty lost all of his bodily functions. Needless to say of all the scenes I did in my 40 year career, I am probably best remembered for peeing my pants in Teen Wolf.

I remember this was THE first movie ever played in my family's first VCR! The movie could have been very ""gimmicky"", but it wasn't. It had a very good storyline that people could identify with. Michael J. Fox plays Scott Howard, a skinny high school kid that isn't in the ""cool"" clique, more of an everyman. It shows him struggle with changes in his life of growing up. A little more extreme than most teenagers have to deal with, but the theme is there. It shows how the power of being a teenage werewolf can be very tempting, intoxicating, but in the end, it's who you are in the inside that counts. Great movie, and I love the song that plays at the end of the movie! (I gave it an 8 out of 10 because 9's and 10's are reserved for the Braveheart's of the cinema world!)",Teen Wolf

It's not just the poor effects or awful music... the entire film struggles to find it's way with a poor storyline. It seems to take half the movie before any real action begins. The character development is weak and there is virtually no chemistry between any of the main characters. It's hard to believe someone was convinced to make a TV series about this. Perhaps the best use of this film is to see some pretty authentic 80's clothing and hairstyles that should spark some great ideas for your next Halloween party.
