0,Leofwine_draca,Well mounted,4,27 October 2020,"HARRIET is a typical Hollywood biopic that presents the life of its character in a glossy and perhaps sanitised way. Apparently, this one is more fiction than fact, heavily inventing key parts of the narrative and maybe losing something along the way; after all, I'm a sucker for the truth and fictional characters don't have much place in true stories. It's handsomely mounted and well acted, but there's something a little too reverent and sentimental about it which detracts from the experience overall.",Harriet
1,SnoopyStyle,standard biopic,6,20 January 2020,"It's 1849 Maryland. Minty (Cynthia Erivo) is a slave married to a free black man named John. Her family is supposed to be freed after the death of the old master but his family continues to hold them in bondage. In desperation, she makes a run to the North guided by God's voice in her head. She finds safety in Philadelphia where she takes her free name Harriet Tubman. She would return time and again to rescue her family and other slaves as one of the conductors of the underground railroad.This is a standard biopic of anti-slavery heroine Harriet Tubman. It's a serious take. The tone is singular which leaves the movie rather flat. I'm not calling for some broad jokes to inject silly humor or grotesque violence to horrify. The constant uninspired narrative can take a toll on the tension. The movie could push the intensity of the escapes. There are emotional power points but they always seem a little melodramatic. I have some issues with the awkward staging of the killing of Marie and the final confrontation with Gideon. They are very standard in a bad way. This material is ready for a truly great biopic but this movie is only at a passable level.",Harriet
2,Horst_In_Translation,Solid story of an unlikely hero propelled by Erivo's strong lead performance,6,10 July 2020,"""Harriet"" (of course based on an actually existing person) is an American English-language movie from 2019, so still fairly new and fresh, especially if we take into account that the last couple months the cinemas were closed (at least here). I think that otherwsie this would have been released in spring already. Oh by the way, this is indeed a Chinese co-production. Now that really does surprise me because neither the story nor the cast seem to have any connection with China or Asia. But it is what it is. The director of these slightly over two hours is Kasi Lemmons and she is also a co-writer. I cannot say I am familiar with her at all to be honest, but her color makes sense as a director for a film with this subject. In fact, she has far more acting credits than filmmaking credits and looking at her age, this is unlikely to change, but who knows, maybe I'm wrong. I do know though that it makes me kinda curious to check out ""The Silence of the Lambs"" now to see her character. And the brilliant film in general of course. But back to this one here now: It is not too shabby either. The key writer is Gregory Allen Howard and also with him I am not too familiar, but his break of almost 20 years after being involved with ""Ali"" is certainly highly unusual in the industry. In Hollywood. But if he keeps delivering quality like this, I am glad he is back because this film's story, even without an Oscar nomination for the screenplay, is one of the movie's biggest strengths. It also did not drag a lot really, which is always a success for such a long film. No offense to the writer and director, but the real big star here is lead actress Cynthia Erivo playing Minty/Harriet and her turn is the heart and soul of the film. If she was not considered among the finest Black actresses before this film already, then now she certainly is. And me saying this means something especially because I am not blinded by looks here. She is not particularly attractive, but her performance is all about talent. So good for her that she got the Oscar nomination. For lead actress I should say because she also got a second nomination for her song ""Stand Up"". The latter was probably the one where she had a better chance for the win, even if Elton John was really safe there, but her song probably came in second. I like the song. It is powerful, uplifting and featured strong vocals. Sure, it is debatable if it is appropriate given the subject to nod your head while listening to it, but it is also extremely catchy, so the woman in front of me as well as myself kept nodding. I do think, however, it is a pity that this song was ""only"" used for the closing credit sequence. It also should have been part of the movie one way or the other because it is that good and with the right scene it could have made an impact indeed. And there was a lot of music in there, they used other songs, but for some reason this one they did not. They saved the best for last you could say, but it was a bit of a waste.For example, one great idea to use it was when we knew about Minty's talent in getting people away from their slave masters. They could have summarized her work there after the first important rescue succeeded and played the song in the background while we find out how she keeps succeeding on future missions. Instead, they messed up a bit in that department. How exactly? Well, the Moses reference was a bit exaggerated and also how we find out that she can speak to God. Or thinks she can and everybody else believes it too. However, I will not be mad at the writer here for including these two references because they were probably factual from the real Harriet's life. So it is okay, even if they got slightly too much attention perhaps. One mention would have been enough for me. Nonetheless, the positive aspects are far more frequent. Cinematography and soundtrack are as much of a success as make-up and art direction. And there is not a single weak performance here although many actors I was not familiar with at all, down to those who play the title character's parents even. Or the main antagonist. But I thought Joe Alwyn was really good. I was a bit worried with how generic his character could turn out when we see him sit there in the first scene, but they did enough with it to justify him playing a really vile man. Okay, Harriet's act of mercy in that spectacular showdown at the end was perhaps over the top, but it is okay. The connection between them as children was surely interesting. It is not 100% hate there and you could wonder why he keeps saying (and killing even because/) that he wants her alive. Really to torture her because she shattered his ego. Oh yeah, the scene when they get away because they have one character who poses as the son of somebody else was also a bit fake I'd say. Cannot imagine this really happened like that in real life. Or could happen. Back to Alwyn, he really impressed me and I am curious about his upcoming roles and movies. Another one who deserves a mention is the main antagonist's mother. That character was also written nicely. Pay attention to how she sings with the slaves at the very beginning. She sure would not do the same at the end when she loses her mental and physical health and sees Blacks only as vile antagonists. But now a few more words on Harriet: I think Erivo was really a great choice for her like I said before. She managed a vulnerability and dedication at the same time and the idea that she wants to be free or die could not have been depicted more convincingly by another (Black) actress I'd say. But there probably weren't too many options. Another would have been Janelle Monáe, who is maybe the second most known cast member here and I thought she was pretty stunning. Sadly, her character's story was not too good. When she sees the scars on Harriet's back, it is even a bit embarrassing. This has been done many times and also many times better. Given the gun aspect, also what you see in the trailer, you could think that this film is a female equivalent to Tarantino's recent western about a Black man fighting for his freedom. But this comparison is not too accurate. Actually, it reminded me more of ""12 Years a Slave"", only with a female at the center of it all. So if you liked that one, you will also like this one here. Or at least not hate it. ""Harriet"" has of course achieved a great deal of awards recognition, but close to a Best Picture Academ Award win it was not. Still, I personally think both films are decent, but neither is great. ""Harriet"" has a pretty great moment here and there though for sure. For example, another thing I liked was also how they kept it unbiased. There are also White people in here who help Harriet, like the one who tells her the name of the dude she must meet at Philly. Philly and Maryland are the two key locations in this movie. Just a little piece of side information. Or also the Black guy who is a cold-blooded headhunter and shot by the main antagonist right before he can shoot Harriet. Overall, a lot was done right here. No hesitation in giving this movie a thumbs-up. Unless you don't care about the subject at all, i.e. race equality, I say go watch it. It is also an interesting watch from today's perspective with the #BLM movement going on right now. And with that statement I do not mean that this film should even direct more attention to this subject, but that this film really shows us what actual discrimination and racism looked like. And that what we have today is luckily nowhere near as worse as things were back then. I think I read that Erivo is actually not Lauryn Hill or Will Smith's wife when it comes to her opinion on the matter. Not entirely sure though, but if I am not mistaken, then I like her even more for making the statemens she made. Clearly not a poster girl for the (illogical) cause. Okay, now we are drifting too far away, so let's end the review here. ""Harriet"" is a good movie, but not one of the year's best. The lead performance, however, is also among the year's best. Go see it.",Harriet
3,nogodnomasters,Don't tell me what I can't do.,8,10 November 2019,This is the biopic of Harriet Tubman who led fugitive slaves to freedom. Her face will soon grace the $20.00 bill. She had a remarkable life and I learned a few things from the film. Cynthia Erivo had performances that were at times spectacular and other times bland most likely due to an average script and direction. Janelle Monáe gave an excellent performance and I think would have made a better lead.,Harriet
4,kosmasp,More than surviving,7,4 March 2021,"American History is riddled with many dark ... this may not be the most political way to describe it I reckon. There are things in the past that the USA still hasn't completely dealt with. And there are still things going on that can be considered discriminating to say the least.So this is a powerful story of a woman that fought against a system that was more than wrong, no matter how it was viewed back then. We may almost find it comical that some people were crying when they lost slaves. Not because they regarded them as humans but as property and value (in money). But the titular character had other plans, not just for herself, but for others that had it as bad or worse than her.The question is, if you want to delve into that past, if you want to see what this is showing. For education mostly of course, but also for a powerful message.",Harriet
5,classicsoncall,"""I'm gonna be free or die.""",8,26 November 2019,"A number of the reviews I've read here on IMDb are decidedly negative on ""Harriet"", citing facets of her life that were inaccurately portrayed in the movie. I've seen enough films based on historical figures to know by now that historical accuracy isn't always of the most paramount importance when making a film. Whether the real life Harriet Tubman ever picked up a firearm isn't what's going to make me give the movie a thumbs down or not. Not knowing much about her history other than the dedication she showed in freeing as many fellow slaves as she could, I thought the picture did an admirable job of telling her story. Cynthia Erivo appears to have been an excellent choice to portray Araminta Ross Tubman, resolute in her quest to obtain personal freedom at the expense of her own life were she ever to be apprehended by Southern slave catchers. The hatred for Blacks and the cruelty slave owners were capable of is demonstrated by her former 'owners', notably Gideon Brodess (Joe Alwyn) and his mother Eliza (Jennifer Nettles). More so via dialog than by actual physical punishment; we are not witness to some of the horrors that were exposed in ""12 Years a Slave"", 2014's Best Picture Winner at the Oscars. An overall fine cast and compelling story makes this one of the year's best offerings, and certainly a contender for it's share of awards in due course.",Harriet
6,BandSAboutMovies,Inspiring,6,17 March 2020,"Kasi Lemmons started her entertainment career as an actress - she was Bernie in - before starting to direct. The movie I remember her for most is The Caveman's Valentine. A film about Harriet Tubman was rumored for years and I'm quite glad she got the job, as this is a movie that moves quickly and imparts plenty of emotion and history without feeling preachy or boring. That's quite a feat for a historical film.Cynthia Erivo, who was in the stage revival of The Color Purple and who has been great on The Outsider every week, plays Harriet throughout her life, as she escapes from slavery (choosing to either live free or die) and then continually comes back to help others escape. It's a harrowing tale filled with twists that history class never taught me, such as the fact that the man who gave her the last name Tubman remarried, as everyone in her family believed that she died after she jumped off a bridge to escape her owner Gideon Brodess.Leslie Odom Jr., who was the original Aaron Burr in Hamilton, is in this, as is Janelle Monáe, a freewoman whose sophisticated ways are in direct contrast to young Harriet.I would have never watched this movie if not for a freelance assignment where I've been creating teacher guides for biographical films. So in some strange way, the predicament of my occupation has led to me experiencing plenty of new things I would have otherwise never had the opportunity to see, listen, watch or learn.You don't need to go through all that to see this. I recommend you watch it at your first opportunity.",Harriet
7,view_and_review,Drop the Dramatizations,6,11 November 2019,"This is a movie that needed to be made. I don't mean this movie specifically, but a movie about Harriet Tubman, definitely.What needs to be known and what needs to be said is that Harriet was an amazing woman no matter what. She assisted dozens of slaves in escaping to freedom, that is enough to be considered a hero. So, whether she did so in an authoritarian way, in a sage way, or in a simple way, none of that enhances or detracts from what she did.I say that because they made Harriet a prophet of sorts in the movie. Her ability to elude capture was aided by her clairvoyance as much as it was aided by benevolent people and her sheer force of will. I will plead ignorance to Harriet being somewhat prescient, but I have never heard that narrative. If that was a dramatization, then it was so unnecessary. This woman was incredible and achieved incredible feats regardless if she was precognitive or not.This addition to the Harriet Tubman story didn't derail the movie. It was an annoyance but one that could be overlooked. What I couldn't easily overlook were two characters. One was Walter (Henry Hunter Hall) and the other was Bigger Long (Omar J. Dorsey). Let me explain.Harriet was escaping through the woods with a group in tow. At the same time, Walter, a (presumably free) black man was in those woods spying on them. But he wasn't simply just spying he actually sketched a picture of Harriett while waiting!!! There was so much wrong with that that I don't know where to start panning it.We find out later that this clandestine sketch artist is a hustler of sorts, offering whatever services to whoever for whatever he can get. That includes selling the sketch and his tracking services to white slavers.It didn't stop there; this hustling sketch artist can also find the infamous slave catcher/tracker Bigger Long. Bigger was a Robin Harris/Biggie Smalls/Rick Ross looking dude with the gravitas in 1850 to say to some armed white men that he would spend his money on as many """" as he can afford.This character was so over the top and anachronistic he looked like he was pulled out of the 60's Black Power movement.A movie about Harriet Tubman doesn't need to be overshadowed by such dramatizations. There was a lot of good in this movie. We saw Harriet's strength, her determination, her resolve, and her leadership abilities. If the movie focused more on that then it would have been better for it.",Harriet
8,AlsExGal,Harriet deserved better,2,28 November 2019,"I hated this movie. There isn't an ounce of authenticity in and it was just so bland. It was a movie about a black person made for a white audience to feel warm and fuzzy with a superhero angle thrown in. At least it didn't have the white slave owner turn out to be a nice guy (and they sure came close).The score is distractingly bad. It's an overbearing and manipulative score, ripped straight from any Lifetime movie. Then there is the opening scene showing a group of slaves gathered in front of their white slavemaster and establishes the fact that the bad guy is bad. It felt so amateurish to me and the rest of the movie then proceeded to feel similarly amateurish, cliched and predictable. On her first trip south, Harriet has what is supposed to be an emotional reunion with her family, but it's a bunch of characters we've never met so the scene just doesn't work. There are just so many things like that.It's such a shame because Harriet Tubman was such a heroic and interesting figure and her story is an important part of American history. I feel like this movie is getting a pass from the critics because of the material. I know I feel somewhat guilty writing a bad review merely because of the subject matter. Maybe what is needed is a Ken Burns style documentary so that the temptation to have cartoonishly cardboard baddies, scenes of singing Harriet, and heavily dramatized and fictional scenes for the sake of checking all of the 'Biopic Cliche' boxes can be resisted.",Harriet
9,ferguson-6,Harriet was due,6,31 October 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. As far as I can tell, there has never before been a feature film profiling Harriet Tubman. Given her remarkable accomplishments and historic standing as an iconic American hero, we should all agree that it's high time. The film plays as a passion project for writer-director Kasi Lemmons (EVE'S BAYOU, 1997) and her co-writer Gregory Allen Howard (REMEMBER THE TITANS, 2000). Cinematically speaking, it's a fairly formulaic biopic; however, from a historical perspective, HARRIET is story that was due to be told.Cynthia Erivo (WIDOWS, BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE) stars as Araminta Ross, known as Minty. She was born into slavery, and the film picks up in 1849 Maryland when she is being sold 'down south' by her heartless owner Gideon Brodess (an understated Joe Alwyn, THE FAVOURITE). Rather than be separated from her family, Minty runs (she does a lot of running). She runs until cornered, and then leaps from a bridge into rushing water. It's only after her treacherous 100 mile walk to Pennsylvania that she becomes a free woman and changes her name to Harriet Tubman - in honor of her mother and husband.She receives help along the way. Reverend Samuel Green (Vondie Curtis Hall) plays a recurring role in her escape and later rescues. Once in Pennsylvania, she meets abolitionist William Still (Leslie Odom Jr, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, 2017), who runs the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and introduces her to fellow abolitionist Marie Buchanon (Janelle Monae). Ms. Buchanan is a free black woman, as elegant in her manner as she is dedicated to the cause ... and she's worthy of her own story.Harriet decides she must go back and rescue her family. She is told the trip is foolish and too risky - which doesn't stop her from making 13 trips and saving 70 slaves. We learn of her work with the Underground Railroad - not a train, but rather a secretive organization committed to helping slaves escape to freedom. After the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Harriet's work becomes even more difficult, as she must guide the slaves all the way to Canada. Omar J Dorsey plays Bigger Long, an expert slave hunter - yes, that's an actual occupation - hired by Harriet's owner to capture her. When Harriet converts Walter the scout (Henry Hunter Hall), the colorful character becomes a valuable ally and strong believer.As a young girl, Minty/Harriet had her skull cracked by a slave owner whilst standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. After that, she experienced episodes, ""spells"" that she claimed were visions from God. The film captures quite a few of these and treats Harriet as someone ""touched"". Was this the prophecy or was Harriet an extraordinarily resourceful and tenacious woman? The message of God is present throughout, and it's difficult to not view this as unintentionally taking a chip out of what Harriet accomplished.Slave owners were baffled by the rescues conducted by this mythic figure they named ""Moses"". Of course, they assumed it was a man, and once Harriet's identity was exposed, her former owner was held accountable by other slave owners. It's at that point where Gideon Brodess' mother Eliza makes one of the most cold-hearted, racist speeches we've seen on film. Eliza is played by Jennifer Nettles, the singer for C&W band Sugarland. In 1858, Harriet crosses paths with abolitionists John Brown and Frederick Douglas, and delivers an impassioned speech of her own in the presence of Senator William Seward (one of Booth's targets in the Lincoln assassination). Harriet assisted Brown with recruitment for his raid on Harpers Ferry. In 1863, Harriet led the Comahee River Raid, which resulted in 750 slaves being set free.The film might be a bit slick, but the acting is top notch, and Harriet's story is remarkable. Director Lemmons forgoes the brutality of 12 YEARS A SLAVE, and tries to cover Harriet's time as a slave, her first escape off the bridge, and her continued work freeing other slaves. Harriet went on to become a Civil War spy for the Union, and later a respected elder who worked for women's voting rights and to make latter life a bit easier for former slaves. It's possible a movie was not the best format to tell Harriet's story ... a story that continued to develop until her death in 1913 at age 91 (or thereabouts). But it's important to have her story documented in some way other than the textbooks kids likely won't read. A film that tackles such a towering historical figure deserves a little slack.",Harriet
10,phd_travel,Good would have liked more of her life covered,8,16 January 2020,I liked the tone and approach of this overdue biopic of Harriet Taubman. Avoiding over sentimentality and melodrama keeps the story flowing. Unlike recent slavery movies that have been quite graphic or deliberately exaggerated like Django and 12 Years.The scope of the movie is limited to her escape and the Underground Railroad activates probably due to time constraints. I think these could have been shortened and instead there could have had a bit more of her earlier life before marriage when the movie began. Also more of her her civil war activities besides the river battle and more of her later life and marriage.The acting is good but being a British actress I couldn't understand some of what she said. Joe Alwyn is good as the composite fictionalized evil slave master.,Harriet
11,deloudelouvain,A good movie about an exceptional woman.,7,24 February 2021,"It's good that there are movies like Harriet to remind us what an awful country the USA was at one point, where racism and slavery were just a normal thing, accepted by the vast majority of the population. Some people now (if you can call them that) still didn't learn anything from it and probably never will. That said Harriet is a well made biographical movie about Harriet Tubman, a hero, who made it her lifes work to help slaves escape their 'masters'. Harriet got nominated for two Oscars, for best music (which is a bit far fetched if you ask me) and for best performance of an actress in a leading role (which wasn't bad at all from Cynthia Erivo but not really Oscar material either in my humble opinion). Cynthia Erivo did a very good job though, played her character in a very believable way, and the rest of the cast was also very convincing. Harriet is a good movie, but certainly not the best movie with slavery as topic.",Harriet

13,ThomasDrufke,"""Must have been wearing my high boots that day""",7,5 November 2019,"Oscar season is fully underway as there's nearly a new film every week that is attempting to garner enough praise to warrant awards consideration. Harriet's marketing campaign was less than stellar, and without a lot of buzz, I figured it was going to be a throwaway period piece about an iconic American hero. Luckily, Cynthia Ervo and a great ensemble help put this fill over the mediocre edge and instead boast a crowd-pleaser of a film. One that audiences seem to be on board with, and rightfully so. It's certainly not re-inventing the biopic formula, but it's undeniably engaging.7.0/10",Harriet
14,Cineanalyst,"Frustratingly Formulaic, Irregularly Revelatory Biopic of a Hero",4,14 February 2020,"The recognition to its subject that a biopic of Harriet Tubman brings is cause for celebration in itself, but while the movie has some other merits, it's a severely flawed piece of filmmaking. Oscar-nominated Cynthia Erivo leads a fine cast, but the script forces her and others into grossly-grandiose and blunt dramatic speechifying and rejoinders. Erivo authentically portrays Tubman as a gun-toting action figure, but the plot overly simplifies her rescuing of a reported approximation of 70 slaves during 13 missions to her mostly rescuing her family while being chased by her dogged (and fictional) former owner and a black (and, again, fictional) bounty hunter and to a brief montage played for humor of her bursting through the doors to William Still's office, accompanied by an alternating array of escapees. Another fictional character acted by Janelle Monáe also plays into this needlessly trite cat-and-mouse scenario. All of which leads to the odd culmination that Tubman would be wearing red while trying to avoid detection. Sure, the striking color highlights her for the spectator, but within the narrative, it would do likewise for the characters chasing her.Music is another element here that's a mixed bag. It's a nice motif employed by Tubman and other African Americans to signal each other, and Erivo's Oscar-nominated song ""Stand Up"" is fine, but the picture's score otherwise is a hackneyed travesty of overblown trumpeting and emotional signalling for how the spectator is expected to feel as the picture relentlessly moves from one point to the next in the equally formulaic biopic plotting. The cinematography, too, while including a lovely moment, say, when Tubman reaches out towards the Sun when she reaches freedom, is mostly bland, with the most obvious set-ups to achieve pictorial beauty regardless of narrative and stylistic considerations, and, if all else fails, the camera resorts to resting on Erivo's face. Moreover, slavery and 19th-century America in general doesn't look ugly enough here. Although one scene specifically addresses Tubman bathing, it seems as though everyone, for the most part, in the picture has recently washed and conditioned their hair, and when they smile they display the pearly-white teeth of actors' 21st-century dental care.Although brief, I also appreciate the inclusion of Still's recording of the stories of escaped slaves and the scene of Tubman being photographed. These point to the real pieces of history that have provided a picture of Tubman and her times and to better biographical sources for this great woman. The revelations from God was promising material, too. Yet, unfortunately, this is a convention biopic, slavishly devoted to the inherited pattern, for an unconventional subject who fought for freedom.",Harriet
15,westsideschl,The Story Carries the Film,8,13 February 2020,"Her story is remarkable. But, this particular retelling left me feeling like important documentation of her life was left out in order to create a movie story drama.

18,cruise01,Outstanding performance but nothing else that makes this film stand out.,6,30 January 2020,"Harriet (3 out of 5 stars).Harriet is a decent biographical film about Harriet Tubman and the impact she has had rescuing slaves escape and setting them free. Which caused a lot of slave owners to be furious and had a set bounty on her. It is a decent film with a good story about Harriet Tubman. And a great performance by Cynthia Erivo who played Harriet. The direction can be a little slow and play like a straight to tv kind of movie that belongs on a history channel.The plot follows Harriet (Cynthia Erivo) a slave which her and her family were promised to be free at a certain age with their plantation owner. When Gideon (Joe Alwyn) and his family break the will of freedom. Harriet plans an escape and leaves everything behind. Escaping from white men who are hunting her down. She goes up north and gets her freedom. When she can not escape her dreams of slavery. She decides to sneak back down to the plantation to help free her family too. Which she does several times, helping many slaves escape for their freedom.It is a good plot about Harriet Tubman and her journey that she goes through. She depends on a lot on faith and god to help guide her the way. There will be a scene where they are on the run from bounties and plantation owners. She will sit in front of a tree. Praying and letting God guide her on the direction. Crossing a steep river instead of taking a path where they may get caught.Cynthia Erivo performance was outstanding as Harriet. She delivered the role. Joe Alwyn was good Gideon. Where he was always obsessed with Harriet and trying to catch her.The direction, music score, and tone did feel like a straight to tv movie which felt a little uninspired or cliché for this type of historical film.Overall, Harriet is a fair film. The performances and story are great. The direction could have been a little better.",Harriet
19,Red-125,Some people--including me--believe that this is a great movie,10,18 February 2020,"Harriet (2019) was co-written and directed by Kasi Lemmons. Lemmons is an excellent director. Also, an excellent scriptwriter. That is obvious throughout the film.Cynthia Erivo portrays Harriet Tubman, and, naturally, the movie hinges on her performance. Erivo is a skilled, award-winning actor. Her talent becomes clear from the first frames of the movie. A lesser actor might not make Tubman come alive, but Erivo accomplishes this feat.If you read other reviews of this movie, you will find that many reviewers heaped scorn on it. Why? The basic facts are true. For example, Tubman did, indeed, lead an attack force of Union troops during the Raid on Combahee Ferry. She was an amazing human being, which is clear in the filmApparently, some people thought that Tubman, who was certainly a hero, was cast in the mode of Hollywood Superhero. In fact, I see it in exactly the opposite way. Tubman was a superhero. The portrayals of Hollywood Superheroes are informed by the lives of people like her.This film would work better in a theater, but we saw it on the small screen, where it worked well enough to be enjoyable.Harriet has a dismal 6.3 rating. I looked further into the statistics. Men rated it 6.1. Women rated it 7.1. As is usually the case for IMBD raters, men outnumber women by three or four to one.

A flip of the coin which perception of Harriet Tubman I like best. If you ever seen a show called Underground a version of Tubman exist on that show. Where I stand that version feels like a superhero (watch the show and you tell me). At best I feel this movie treats Tubman as turning folklore into reality.
But no version is wrong. All that matters is that we are telling the story of a true American hero and that's what this film is doing. It's focusing on the heroics of a champion of equality. It does a good job of this.

24,Turfseer,Standard hagiography can't hold a candle to 1978 TV mini-series,4,28 January 2020,"A cursory glance of pejorative epithets describing Harriet found on Rotten Tomatoes, yielded the following: ""by-the-numbers...bland biopic,"" ""formulaic,"" ""feels in awe of its subject,"" ""treating her narrative with far too much reverence,"" ""easy to digest, but not interesting or complicated enough to engage with.""
While these epithets encapsulate Harriet's various problems, they don't really explain or get to the essence of what went wrong with the film's narrative. A better strategy is to compare it to the far superior 1978 TV mini-series, A Woman Called Moses, starring Cecily Tyson and written by the late noted playwright and screenwriter, Lonnie Elder III.
Right away we see that Director and co-writer Kasi Lemmons along with screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard opted to turn the seminal civil rights figure into an action/adventure heroine, concentrating on her own escape from slavery and then leading family members as well as other non-relatives, to freedom in the north. Accordingly, Tubman's life on the plantation prior to her escape, gets short shrift.
Howard and Lemmons invent the fictional character of Gideon, son of Mr. Brodess, the plantation owner, recently deceased. Gideon proves to be the standard melodramatic villain, a racist who treats his slaves poorly. Gideon is designed strictly as a monster, an anachronistic figure designed to make whites feel guilty in the present time.
Such attempts to intimidate are nowhere found in Lonnie Elder's In A Woman Called Moses, where racism is a much more subtle and devastating affair. Violence was actually frowned upon by the genteel slave owners, who pushed back against those who were ""damaging"" their ""property"" (i.e. assaults on slaves). Elder has a scene where Brodess actually fires an overseer who assaults one of his slaves.
More significantly, Elder realizes that slavery was more a system of PSYCHOLOGICAL intimidation and humiliation than outright violence. One of the most devastating and effective scenes in the 1978 mini-series, shows how Tubman was leased out to a neighboring slave owner, who invites a party of friends to laugh at her, as she's hooked up to a harness and ordered to drag a cart on a muddy road, in place of a mule.
Instead, Lemmons has Cynthia Erivo as Tubman play the part of an action adventure heroine. In a most unlikely scene, when Tubman is cornered by Gideon on a bridge, she jumps off it into the raging waters below. During a later one of Harriet's rescue operations on the Underground Railroad (apparently on the same bridge), a sheriff unconvincingly fails to search a wagon where Tubman and the slaves she's trying to save, are hiding (he mistakenly misidentifies the daughter of a local slave owner who's driving the wagon, and lets them through).
Elder creates a more believable adversary for Tubman in the form of a northern detective hired by a southern planters' association. In a perhaps a slightly better scene involving a close-call for Harriet and her charges, the group escapes through a secret tunnel, after the detective and his posse set the barn in which they're hiding on fire.
When Tubman makes it to Philadelphia, little of the machinations there are believable. That includes Leslie Odom Jr. as William Still, the writer/abolitionist, who assists Harriet on her forays operating the Underground Railroad. Odom hardly looks the part of a 19th century freedom fighter and his dialogue with Tubman appears ludicrously anachronistic (Tubman tells Still, ""you're not my type""!). Worse yet, Lemmons has Tubman castigate civil rights leader Frederick Douglass for not ""being in the trenches."" In contrast, Elder has a friend of Tubman read a letter of appreciation to her from Douglass!
In an effort to make things more dramatic, Lemmons has all the former slaves in Philadelphia flee to Canada due to the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. The problem is that the Act was passed in 1850, before the scene where all the former slaves are fleeing. In a Woman Called Moses, the passage to Canada did not occur all at once as depicted here; nor was a friend of Tubman's, Daisy Buchanon (strictly a fictional character) murdered by Walter (Henry Hunter Hall), a black Judas slave-tracker employed by Gideon. In the 1978 mini-series there are none of these histrionics; instead, Tubman's growing fame as an inspirational speaker is emphasized.
As Armond White pointed out writing in the National Review, ""Erivo's eager-beaver energy and wild-eyed intensity epitomize unpleasant aggression rather than the strength of character that Cicely Tyson conveyed when she portrayed Tubman in the 1978 TV movie.""
Even the denouement fails to engage when Tubman decides not to kill Gideon in revenge for his treatment of her on the plantation. Instead, she launches into an absurd speech, somehow predicting the civil war, promising Gideon that he and his fellow slave owners will all die on the battlefield as retribution for their collective perfidy.
There's much more to Harriet Tubman's story-her heroic actions as the first female to lead an armed assault for the Union Army during the Civil War is only mentioned briefly during the closing credits.
But Tubman's life after the Civil War was far more difficult and kind of sad, in contrast to Lemmon's hagiography (that includes getting her arm broken after a group of racist whites threw her out of the half-price section of a train into the smoking section of a New York passenger train in 1869).
""Harriet"" covers some of the basics of the iconic civil rights leader's life, but Tubman's legacy was much better served by Cicely Tyson back in 1978. If you don't mind the tacky score and the poor lighting, A Woman Called Moses can be seen for free on Youtube!",Harriet

The storyline is excellent and provides a deeper dive than I've ever seen of her mannerisms and relationships with those who worked with her.

27,CubsandCulture,The script is too bare bones and saccharine but a good biopic nonetheless.,8,1 February 2020,"The film is ultimately fairly frustrating. The central performance by Erivo was really good and powerful. The film is quite handsome-it was nice seeing some photography by Toll with a budget. The technical aspects provoke period and the director gets a lot of suspense out of Tubman's escape and rescue missions. The film takes a pretty narrow range of Tubman's life as its plot but working within that range it seems to be fairly accurate. It certainly was engaging. The film resists centering whiteness-abet not fully-and I was glad to see that the Underground Railroad seemed to be almost exclusively black. The film doesn't contain a white savoir trope so there's at least that.However, the film's narrowness results in a too simple and too short of a rendering of Tubman's life. Her work on Women's suffrage was a mere footnote. Arguments around what sort of actions the abolitionist movement should take were greatly reduced. John Brown was omitted entirely. Fredrick Douglas was given a cameo. The film jumps years at a time and it results in narrative that is merely a skeleton of Tubman's most well known experiences.The film is weirdly hesitant around Tubman committing justified violence. At times the film contorts itself to avoid showing Tubman hurting people, especially white people. It seemed to be too saintly of a characterization especially as the film leans heavily on Tubman's faith. (In general the faith stuff lands with emotional resonance). This is a far less visceral portrayal of slavery than 12 Years a Slave.Overall I think this is pretty good biopic.",Harriet

30,masonfisk,MS. TUBMAN DESERVED BETTER...!,4,25 March 2021,"The recent biopic of Underground Railroad pioneer Harriet Tubman is notable only for Cynthia Erivo's performance (she was nominated for Best Actress & Best Song at this year's Oscars) & not much else. Taking the road of the histrionic rather than historic, this film traces her escape from slavery (her owner threatened to sell her) leaving her husband behind. When she reaches the North, she falls in w/the Underground Railroad (initially in the guise of Hamilton's Lamar Odom Jr.) but determined to free her immediate family (& subsequently hundreds of others) on the eve of the Civil War, she successfully becomes the thorn in the sides of many slave owners where she gains the ire of slave hunters who hope to track her down. Directed & co-written by Kasi Lemmons (a one time actress; remember her as Ardelia Mapp, Clarice Starling's FBI friend in The Silence of the Lambs) the will & desire is there to bring some import to the subject matter but when you have films like 12 Years a Slave or Birth of a Nation (hell I remember a Jason Patric/Thandie Newton starrer from the '95 named The Journey of August King which got the job done) artfully directed it makes this standard Masterpiece Theatre meets the Own network treatment a glaring disappointment (which is a shame since Lemmons worked wonders previously in other films she's directed like Eve's Bayou, The Caveman's Valentine & Talk to Me).

31,aidanratesmovies,An Emotional Journey,9,12 November 2019,"Harriet is not just a standard biopic on an extraordinary life, but an embrace of pain and glory and all that comes with it. Harriet shines best with portraying emotion and capturing that through its audacious style of directing, cinematography, and some great performances throughout. The film's script may seem to make the whole deal a bit choppy at times, but the film knows how to handle itself properly and thus doesn't linger to be an issue in the long run. Cynthia Erivo gives one of her best performances to date as the title star, truly capturing every bit of detail and emotion needed to play the true life figure. The use of music and sound throughout the film makes for a thrilling and somber piece of work, all needed to truly tie the film together. Harriet may also struggle a bit to find its footing towards the end, but as it wraps, you can't help but marvel at what a piece of work the film is, let alone Harriet herself.

32,questl-18592,The Terrific Tales of Tubman,5,17 December 2019,"Harriet Tubman is a legendary figure and it's a shame she hasn't had a movie until now. It's also a shame that this movie couldn't just give her credit for being incredible all on her own. Instead, she undergoes a head injury that lets her speak to God. It's also part musical, which is kinda nice because Cynthia Erivo has a beautiful voice, but there are times it also feels a little forced in.To its credit, it does a good job of depicting that the color of ones skin doesn't immediately equate to some inherent virtue. The white people aren't all evil, the African Americans aren't all good. We're more complex than that.Unfortunately, being based on a true story makes this entirely predictable.

33,truemythmedia,Waaaay Over-rated,4,27 February 2020,"While this film is about an admirable woman, one who should be admired and hero-icised, and whose story should be told through cinema this movie is not that film and I can't say I recommend it to any except the young who may need a first introduction to the ideas and people found within it but without the harshest scenes of violence you might normally expect to find in a film like this one.Unfortunately, as a person who grew up with graphic representations of what slavery truly was as well as near constant education on the evils of slavery and the heroes who fought to end it either for themselves or others. This omission also leaves the film feeling trite and small, not dealing with the harshness of slavery nor the emotional turmoil of the principle characters in the story in a way that feels true. It feels put on or dressed up.The movie is poorly written. It doesn't seem to be plotted according to emotional movement of the internal character. Instead, it feels like someone opened a history book and took the paragraphs about Harriet Tubman's life and decided to make each sentence a scene of the film. Luckily there are no shortage of celebrities to play these roles.Unfortunately, there were times in the film where it felt like the only reason Harriet (Cynthia Erivo, ""Widows"") was talking to, say, Marie Buchanan, was because Janelle Monae (""Moonlight"") was playing her and not because that scene was true to life (though it might be) or important to Harriet's growth (again, though it might be). The latter part of the film is all about how she helped free more than 70 slaves from captivity but it is all told in montage form. We see her and others running through the woods, dogs chasing them, white men beating down the roads on horseback but never do we learn anything about those slaves, their masters, why freeing them was hard, what the logistics were, or how close they got to being caught.Compare that to a film like ""Schindler's List"" where you can count the people and names of those who were saved and everyone can remember how that one boy almost got caught in the latrines because there was no room for him in the pit beneath it. I would have loved to see a film which covers her escape in the first half hour or forty-five minutes but the rest is all about the various breaks she leads from the plantations. A real Hero Freedom Fighter picture full of heroism.It seems the movie just wasn't thought out that much. The entire film feels very paint by number down to the costuming which seems OK at first glance but there isn't a stitch of clothing in this film that I believe was actually made or worn by anyone in the 1800s and I have to say the same for almost every other aspect of this film.If this is a movie for the young and I'm being overly harsh, I apologize, but when a film is getting Oscar buzz I expect that it will be something more competent than the simplistic stories of Martin Luther or Jesus that I watched when I was a kid. I certainly hoped that I would be seeing a serious treatment of an important story and subject matter but I guess that was too much to ask.I have to say that I am really disappointed in this film. The trailers looked bad to me but with the talk around Cynthia Erivo's performance, which is very good, I was thinking I had maybe misjudged the film by its trailer. Alas, the trailer was true to the film and while I think Erivo is a very fine actress and delivers a good performance as Harriet, I am also looking forward to seeing her in a film that is worthy of her as much as I am to a film worthy of the name ""Harriet.""",Harriet

36,jadepietro,Fiction is Stranger Than Truth in This Bio-Pic,7,25 January 2020,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Historically inaccurate, but a well-acted bio-pic.JIM'S REVIEW: Let's talk history and begin this review with a side note about banknotes. Harriet Tubman, that famous Civil War heroine who saved hundreds of slaves as a ""conductor"" for the Underground Railroad still may not have her own $20 bill...that's long in the working stages, but she does finally have her own movie.Harriet, the film biography of the this famous abolitionist's life, plays more like a game of truth or dare, with more of the latter and less of the former. It's Hollywood's version of a real-life figure and, once again, historical accuracy be damned!A former slave, Harriet (a wonderful Cynthia Erivo, giving a fierce performance) escapes from slave owner Eliza Brodess (a fine Jennifer Nettles portraying this real person). Harriet is chased by Eliza's grandson, Gideon (a walking example of fake news, and played with overwrought villainous glee by Joe Alwyn). A bounty on her head as a runaway slave, she also eludes trackers who worked to catch slaves running north. Although black trackers were in the minority, the film has African-American actor Omar Dorsey in the role of Bigger Long to heighten the drama and sense of irony.That said, many elements of the story are based on facts: she was born Araminta ""Minty"" Ross before renaming herself, had godly visions, dressed as a man, was a straight-shooter who carried guns, walked 100 miles to escape capture, risked her life numerous times to travel in the South and rescued approximately 70 slaves (not the embellished 300). All true events in this icon's life. Also on the plus side, the film does not soften her character and shows her to be the militant radical that she proudly professed to be.Still, director / Writer Kasi Lemmons' film takes too many creative liberties and makes Ms. Tubman into a modern day superhero without cape or spandex. This woman may be fearless in her mission, but there's enough far-fetched exaggeration thrown in to preach to any choir or denomination. The director and co-screenwriter, Gregory Allen Howard, lay it on rather thickly, serving the melodramatic hyperbole in huge dollops as thick as day-old Southern grits. Instead of restraining their emotional focus on the title character's factual life, they pump up the story with enough dangerous adventures and add too many fictitious characters which push the limits of history while moving the plot along at a brisk pace. Loosely based on the facts, the film continually contradicts reality, even if it remains rousing entertainment. The plot device of Harriet Tubman's freaky premonitions and fainting spells are overdone and are more frequently on view in this movie than one would find in an average Stephen King horror film.Ms. Erivo is excellent in the lead role. She shows her character's courage and determination with a vengance. The actress also displays Ms. Tubman's vulnerability in the film's rare quieter moments. The acting is strong throughout the film with ample support from Leslie Odom Jr. as real-life activist William Still, Zackary Momoh as her husband John, Clarke Peters as her father, and Janelle Monáe as freed slave Marie Buchanon (not a real-life individual).Harriet Tubman's life-story is a solid and powerful tale of an oppressed woman's fight for freedom. It truly deserved a more accurate treatment and could have stood on its own without the creative tinkering. (I think Harriet would have agreed.) Harriet, the film, does shamelessly manipulate facts vs. fiction, but the movie tells an important chapter in our nation's history with consistent flair and is crowd-pleasing in its storytelling of a legendary American hero.",Harriet

Weaker Antagonist Characters
The Vision Piece Of The Puzzle
The Action Component or lack ofSummary:Movies continue to prove their abilities to act as windows into different worlds, and in this case the budget they have is impressive in recreating the troubled times of our countries past. Harriet's dive back into the Civil War comes with impressive recreations of a time forgotten, bringing the simplicity of the plantations and the surrounding towns to full life to immerse one into the culture. Costumes play a major support adding a subtle edge to the movie that will integrate you into the culture a little more. This is perhaps the biggest strength of Harriet, showing cultural components of the time period and while the visual elements are impressive the writing only augments that to bigger levels. Harriet loves showing off the song traditions of that time period, in the power of religious hymns and soul music that not only served to inspire, but acted as a means of signaling to others. Erivo's voice holds the power you expect of this music, and while I would have liked more diversity in the song I give props to the use and execution of the power melodies that Tubman held in this film. Fortunately, this thing is not a musical, and the rest of the spoken word contains a powerful dialogue that makes for a wonderful platform of explaining the story. Harriet's dialogue contains the raw passion of the times, bringing out the emotional fury of the times, while also the passion of the people. It's deep, metaphor filled writing is the stuff novelists love to unleash, and it will surely be on quotable boards in future classrooms. As to who unleashes that writing, well the actors get the props and skills from this reviewers to bring that fire to the film. Erivo leads the group into dealing out how much hurt and anguish the people of this time had, and showing how it fueled their drive to bring people to freedom. It's a bit overdramatic I'll admit, but when honed with the words, you get those models that made the women behind me comment in agreement and potentially act as the focal point of the movie.Yet, for all the passion that the movie has there are some things that I was not impressed with. For one thing the pacing feels a little off for me, starting out slow and meticulous at the set-up, only to go fast in the journey to freedom, before going slow once more. The stop and go approach has never been my preference, and based on the expectations from the trailers I had hoped for a little more conflict and impasse to add spark to the mix. Sadly, the montage approach was used where only small segments took the form of the rescuing scenes and intense moments that was a little disappointing to be honest. Now let's take in the characters that were built up in the beginning. Most of them practically don't exist, guess that's why it is called Harriet I guess, and it led to many characters feeling only as afterthoughts and not really involved in the story. I would have liked to see some of these people work alongside her, have more character involvement, than small exchanges, especially when they went to all the trouble to introduce and try to build them up. But, the drama aspect takes over and leads to very dramatic, bluntly ended affairs that were almost not needed. It's like these intense moments were just the seasoning on a burger, rather than the meat, leading to flat ended plots that were a little boring to say the least. This is especially true for the antagonists, men I thought would be ruthless hounds in their pursuit of Harriet, with legendary skills that would push Harriet to the heights of her abilities. Instead, we get egotistical, weaker characters that do little to contribute to the story outside of, looking like grandiose fools and do a little hurting on the side. I'm with a lot of fans here in stating that if you are going to blur the line of reality and fantasy, do it in a little more style with characters that actually made the journey worthwhile. Another thing I'm mixed about is the vision aspect of the movie. Harriet's connection to the Lord is one I'll always envy from this film in getting communication back, but the way this movie did it made it like a super power that acted as her means of movie. An original twist? Yes! What was needed for this movie? I don't think so and can't say this vision was my cup of tea. Finally, I had hoped that the trailers showing Harriet wielding guns and an army was going to add a little more flare to the mix, helping with the pacing and adding that edge that we discussed earlier. Perhaps then the movie magic decisions would have been worth the effort.The VERDICT:
Depending on what you are going in here for will determine how much of Harriet you like. It's certainly the dramatic flair of modern cinema, taking lots of liberties to make history a little more pleasing to the attention span of today. If you can appreciate the liberties, the full-on passion and professional writing for powerful monologues then I feel you're going to enjoy the attitude of this film. Throw in some impressive visual recreation and acting to bring all this to life, and well you've got the world of dramatic Civil War. However, if you are looking for historical accuracy or at least a dramatic world that has a lot more edge and character involvement, then prepared to be ignorant or disappointed. Harriet's artistic liberties were appreciated, but in the long run it did not come altogether for me and I was left wanting a little more investment to bring this magnificent woman's story to life.My scores are:Action/Biography/Drama: 6.5

38,rannynm,Sincere Tribute to the Real-Life Freedom Fighter Harriet Tubman,8,21 October 2019,"Harriet is a sincere tribute to the real-life freedom fighter. Excellent performances and a developed story add layers of entertainment. Anyone interested in documentaries or the subject material must watch this.
The story tells the heroic tale of Harriet Tubman's escape from slavery and transformation into one of America's most influential figures. The film recounts how her courage and intelligence freed hundreds of slaves and changed history as we know it.Cynthia Erivo, as Harriet Tubman, brings out something award-worthy. This actress of Broadway fame launches her star potential to greater heights as she perfectly captures Tubman's appearance on top of her distinguishing characteristics. The film is truly a vehicle for Cynthia's many talents. Other cast members include Leslie Odom Jr. as William Still and Janelle Monae as Marie. While Odom Jr.'s role is relatively one-note as someone Tubman sends runaways to, Monae adds heart to Marie as she settles Tubman for city life. As the film progresses, a heartbreaking scene sticks its landing due to the dynamic between the two.Kasi Lemmons aptly directs, as the story is told chronologically. However, the cinematography does leave a little bit more to be desired, as it lacks nuance and something of interest, during extended dialogue-heavy scenes. Due to this, I felt the runtime and was left desiring the thrilling rescues that follow. It is worth mentioning that you must be interested in American history, or else you will truly remain bored during its two-hour runtime. My favorite scene is Tubman's first escape, because a thrilling scene follows where Tubman jumps downstream into the river rather than get captured. It is truly a testament to Tubman's courage and agility.The message of this film is that Tubman always stands for justice and treats even her opponents fairly; really everything Tubman stands for speaks truth in heroic qualities. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to violence, thematic content and language, including racial slurs.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Harriet Tubman is hands above one of those people and I think this movie should be seen in every high school. It is inspiring. This is also a really well made production: writing, directing, production value and cinematography - it is award worthy. It is a compelling drama. It is also well performed. I'm embarrassed to say I had never heard or Cynthia Erivo, but it was obvious, from the moment she appears on screen, that she is a powerful talent. I was not surprised to discover that she comes to us via the theatre, having won accolades for her acting and musical talent (a Tony, a Grammy and an Emmy -3/4 of the way to an EGOT). The supporting cast is nothing to sneeze at, either, it is littered with stars and seasoned character actors. Do yourself a favour - see this movie.

There was just nothing new here, we've seen it all before and done so much better. I reckon this is the 12th movie I have seen on slavery and Hollywood is just not the place to do justice to this topic. Django Unchained, whilst fiction, did this so much better.Please no more of the same, most audiences just cannot connect with the reality, history and economics of the slave trade without falling into an emotional abyss, when for 200 years slavery was the economic normality in the south of America and the Caribbean.Lastly slavery was abolished 200 years ago, to raise these issues outside of school history, to my mind, just raises the racial temperature when there is no one left alive responsible for this industry. If there is a shock revelation it is that slavery was abolished in America (1865) 33 years later than England (1833) following the civil war 1861-1865, and the millions that died following emancipation and subsequent poverty and unemployment is a story never told.The acting was predictable, the story mundane and there was just nothing new here 4/10",Harriet

Her story is astonishing, filled with heroes, villains, visions, successes and failures and should have lent itself to a film befitting of the great heights this woman achieved.Unfortunately, Writer Director Kasi Lemmons (EVE'S BAYOU) spends a great deal of the film showing the actual, accurate events of Tubman's tale, so much so that it suffers one of the most deadly of sins in filmdom - it drags into boredom under the weight of it's own earnestness. Lemmons, obviously, has great respect for Tubman and shows her in a reverential light throughout this film, showing few (if any) warts and giving us a one-note character that is laser-focused on her purpose, and not much else. While this might have been true-to-life, it does not lend itself to an interesting film.The same goes for the lead performance from Erivo. I have liked her previous work in films like WIDOWS and BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE, so was excited to see her take the lead in an important film like this. But...her portrayal is one-note and slight and does not plumb the depths of a character that I am sure has many, many more layers than is portrayed on this screen.The supporting cast (including Leslie Odom, Jr, Vondie Curtis-Hall and Clarke Peters) are also earnest and slight and don't really add anything to the proceedings. Only Janelle Monae, as a fictional free black woman who becomes a mentor of sorts to Tubman, seems to rise above this weak script.Usually, in films about slavery, the evil (or conflicted) slave owners have a tendency to shine out because of their wickedness (or their confliction) - but in this film, and with this script, Joe Alwyn as Gideon Brodess (the fictional owner of Tubman who is obsessed with bringing her back to slavery) and Jennifer Nettles (as his mother) are...you guessed it...slight and underwritten and don't really bring anything to the proceedings.What this film did do - and did do well - was make me want to find out more about this hero...and that is a good thing. So, if that is all this film does, then I applaud the attempt, I just wished it would have landed as a film in a much stronger way.Letter Grade B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Harriet
49,bob-the-movie-man,A Crime has been Committed.,9,29 February 2020,"I'm not talking here about the criminal act of Edward Brodess (Mike Marunde) at the start of the film, tearing up perfectly legal documents that prove that slave 'Minty' (Cynthia Erivo) should be released from servitude. No. I'm talking about the 2020 Academy Awards selection.This was just about the one and only mainstream film that I didn't get to see before this year's awards, and on catching up with it now I feel positively cross with the Academy. Were they looking for an excuse NOT to pour praise on a black-heavy film? Surely not! And yet here we have a standout performance from Cynthia Erivo, that should have been (imho) a more prominent challenger to Renée Zellweger; together with a superb supporting actor performance by Leslie Odom Jr. as her underground railway ""Fat Controller"" in Philadelphia.And don't get me started on how or why Erivo didn't get the Oscar for best song with ""Stand Up""! (And as both Erivo and Elton John are British, I'm not being partisan here). But did you HEAR and compare those two songs on the night?The story is based (many would say 'very loosely based') on the amazing life story of Harriet Tubman, who in the run-up to the American Civil War made it her mission to free slaves. Illegally trapped herself on the Brodess farm in Maryland, 'Minty' plans to flee north leaving behind her husband John Tubman (Zackary Momoh), her father (an excellent Clarke Peters), her mother (Vanessa Bell Calloway) and four of her six siblings. It's a perilous pursuit, since being caught by the posse and their hunting dogs will mean severe beatings if not worse.Fortunately, Minty has an ally.... God. For since a skull fracture, handed out by Gideon Brodess (Joe Alwyn, on great form), at the age of 13, Minty has had seizures where God has shown her flashes of future events.""Be Free or Die"" are the options. Which way will the dice fall for Minty, now reborn as Harriet, as she embarks on ever more perilous missions?I just loved this movie. I thought Cynthia Erivo was mesmerising as the woman of great substance (you might say, 'True Brit'). There's not been a single Erivo film yet shown that I haven't been impressed with, with ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" being a particular favourite.And what a fabulous ensemble cast! Aside from the folks mentioned above, other key performances come from Vondie Curtis-Hall as the Reverend Green (no, not ""in the conservatory, with the lead piping"") who delivers some fabulous gospel singing, Janelle Monáe (of ""Hidden Figures"" fame) as the kindly (but fictional) Marie Buchanon who is a friend in need, and Henry Hunter Hall who we first meet as the tricksy bounty hunter Walter.Also praiseworthy is the score by Terence Blanchard, which seems to completely fit the mood of the movie, and the slightly blue-washed landscape cinematography of John Toll.Kasi Lemmons - a lady whose previous work I'm not familiar with - directs with style, and (although I appreciate that the Best Director Oscar category only has five names in it) she must have been disappointed not to have been nominated for this. Lemmons also contributed to the story/script from Gregory Allen Howard (""Remember the Titans"").Why the hate here? The IMDB user reviews seem to be full of hateful 1* reviews, complaining of perverting the historical record. I can only conclude that this cohort is composed of a) black people genuinely upset about the portrayal of Tubman (which I can respect) and b) racists who are deadly opposed to the message the film portrays and looking for an excuse to bring it down.Ignore them! If you change the name of the lead character to a fictional one and ignore the ""based on a true story"" angle, this is a genuinely uplifting and inspiring film. I was sat on a crowded plane, but I genuinely teared up at the finale (and particularly the very final shot) of this movie. It really spoke to me.Recommended..... dig it out on a streaming service near you and make your own mind up.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb and Facebook.

None of the above disastrous ratings reflect what is seen on the screen. Sure, there is the Hollywood treatment of cutting corners and tightening a storyline spanning several decades. But the Howard/Lemmons script captures the essence of Tubman's evolution from an illiterate, shy Maryland slave to a confident leader. Her story unfolds like an real-life adventure--which it was--and the imprint on her deeds inspired thousands to take a path towards freedom.Well done and much deserving telling of an amazing woman.",Harriet
51,tm-sheehan,A Story of incredible bravery and courage,7,13 August 2020,"My Review- ""Harriet ""streaming on Prime Amazon
My Rating 7/10It was especially interesting for me watching ""Harriet"" on the day that Kamala Harris became the first woman of colour to run as a Vice Presidential running mate in an American Election with a real possibility if she wins that she also may become the President of the ""UnUnited ""States of America.
Harriet is a film based on the extraordinary true story of Harriet Tubman who escaped from slavery and became one of America's greatest heroes, whose courage, ingenuity, and tenacity freed hundreds of slaves and changed the course of history.Cynthia Erivo as Harriet or Minty,her slave name gives a brilliant and passionate performance and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination this year as Best Actress.
Who was Harriet Tubman? Harriet Tubman was born March 10 1822 and lived a long and eventful life of 90 years . Harriet was an American abolitionist and political activist. Born into slavery, and after escaping she subsequently made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women's suffrage.
My only small criticism of the movie Harriet is its predictability it's one movie in my opinion that would have made a much better episodic Television series.
I say this because the timeline of the movie doesn't do justice to Harriet's long 90 year life in a 2 hour film. In the last scenes of the film, Harriet is seen caring for her family, and leading 150 black soldiers into the Combahee River Raid, freeing hundreds of slaves it left me wanting to know more about this amazing woman.
""Harriet"" the movie is a great companion film to the wonderful 2014 Oscar Winning film ""12 Years a Slave "" which is a more brutal depiction of the cruelty and brutality of slavery. I think in movie terms 12 Years a Slave is a much better crafted movie.
In Harriet the slave escapes early in the film and from then on it's a ""fugitive ""type chase plot by her cruel ""owners "" to get their property back and punish her.
In ""12 Years a Slave"" also a true story its the opposite scenario to ""Harriet ""
A free Black man Solomon Northup is captured and sold into slavery then eventually finds his freedom through a Canadian abolitionist.
One of the fascinating aspects of both these films is the Canadian involvement and how different the two countries attitudes were to the tyranny of slavery.
An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 freedom seekers entered Canada during the last decades of enslavement in the US. Between 1850 and 1860 alone, 15,000 to 20,000 fugitives reached freedom and safety to the Province of Canada.I recently watched Leslie Odam Jr a very talented Afro American actor in ""Hamilton ""the musical cast as Aaron Burr another historical character in American history.
He is also impressive in Harriet cast as William Still who was an African-American abolitionist based in Philadelphia and conductor on the ""Underground ""Railroad that smuggled many slaves to freedom and also was the chairman of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society.
""Harriet"" is a very good movie its entertaining,educational ,interesting and very well acted by a terrific ensemble cast I particularly liked Janelle Monáe as Marie Buchanan the free woman who takes Harriet in when she reaches Philadelphia.
I also enjoyed her previous performances in the movies Moonlight and Hidden Figures .
If you get a chance to see Harriet I recommend it it's an amazing story of a woman's desperation ,bravery and Faith to free herself and many others from the tyranny of slavery.",Harriet
52,Andres-Camara,Plummets,5,19 January 2020,"What I mean, because the first hour and something is very good, but it starts to fall and does not stop. There is a moment in which it seems that it goes back when it returns the first time, but from there, the rest is already as if I were watching so many movies together that I don't know what I am seeing.There are sequences that seem to be rolled in a hurry. It seems as if they have not taken it seriously, as for what this plan counts, do it and finish.When a character is applauded in a movie like in this one, it is a moment in which, either it is known to do very well, or you are going all down, and in this case, everything went down.I did not know the case of this woman, and at the end of the film, apart from its interpretation, which I think, very good, it is almost one of the best nominations I've seen in several years, I think I saw the movie seen, just to know that it existed, but the entire first half left me.The lighting seems very beautiful and very special. It puts you fully in that historical moment. It accompanies you.The costumes, makeup and hairdresser do the film a great favor. They are very well achieved.
The director's job is well below expectations. He wants to tell too many things in a short time and he does it wrong. It does not hold attention. The camera does not know how to use it. Leftover movie or at least, I should have done another one counting the last half hour.The truth is that the film is saved by the actress.",Harriet
53,MrDHWong,A fairly pedestrian biopic powered by the solid performance of its main star,7,5 March 2020,"Harriet is a biographical drama film based on the life of abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Starring Cynthia Erivo in the lead role, it is a fairly pedestrian biopic powered by the solid performance of its main star.In 1849, Araminta ""Minty"" Ross (Cynthia Erivo) lives as a slave owned by the Brodess family who run a farm in Maryland. In spite of her slavery position, Minty is married to a freedman named John Tubman (Zackary Momoh) and plans on starting a family with him. One day, the head patriarch of the Brodess family dies suddenly, prompting his son Gideon (Joe Alwyn) to take over and sell Minty off due to her unruly behaviour. After successfully fleeing from the farm, Minty reaches Philadelphia, adopts the new name of ""Harriet"" after her mother, and decides to work hard to free as many of her fellow slaves as possible, earning the nickname ""Moses"" in the process.Despite its uplifting story, ""Harriet"" plays it safe all too often with its unwillingness to break away from the typical biopic mould. There's very little this film has to say on the topic of slavery and the mistreatment of African-Americans that hasn't already been said in better movies. It merely points out that the slaves had it bad and that white slave owners were racist and abusive toward them. With that in mind, there is still that undeniable satisfaction in seeing Harriet gain the upper hand over her adversaries as she bests them nearly every step of the way.Director Kasi Lemmons does a fine job keeping the film moving at a brisk pace, avoiding too many scenes of expositional dragging, but she does struggle to implement any noteworthy cinematography and production design to leave any impact on the viewer. I feel that this may be due to the fact that I believe the film ""12 Years a Slave"" showcased the plight of the slaves in 19th century America with such a beautiful, artistic melancholy that it felt as though we were watching a painting from that era come to life. This film, on the other hand, had basic and uninspired production values which caused it to come across as a made-for-TV movie instead. This is a huge shame as the story of Harriet Tubman certainly had the potential to have been given much better treatment if it were handled by a more experienced and influenced team of filmmakers.In terms of the cast, this was clearly a one person show, with Cynthia Erivo carrying the film the entire time. Her approach to playing such an important role is what kept me invested in the story and it was truly heartbreaking to see what Harriet and her fellow slaves endured during such a bleak chapter of American history. Unfortunately, the rest of the supporting cast serve no other noteworthy purpose than to advance the plot along and provide expositional interactions with its leading actress. Again, this feels like a missed opportunity, as there could have been more scenes involving Harriet and her family to provide further insight into her motivations to keep going in her pursuit to rescue as many slaves as possible. Sure, there were moments where she has emotional reunions with her family but they all felt glossed over in favour of something else.Overall, even though it could have much better than what we got, it is still nice to see that Harriet Tubman's legacy is now preserved in the form of a motion picture. The acting from its lead actress alone makes it worth at least one viewing but it is unlikely the film will be remembered in a matter of years due to the uninspired approach to telling such a story.I rate it 6.5/10",Harriet
54,Alexander_Blanchett,Missed the full potential,7,5 January 2020,"Important story about a strong woman that broke all boundaries. It is an important piece of history and gives the potential for an amazing story.
What director Kasi Lemmons made out of it is a thrilling adventure, that might not be 100% historical accurate but still focuses on the main theme, women rights and human rights both combined in the historical figure of Harriet. She is played by Cynthia Erivo who once again turns into a great performance making her one of the most promising new stars at the horizon. She nailed the role and offered a great character development to it. Yes she even fought against the rather mediocre screenplay. The rest of the cast is fine but nobody reaches the quality of Erivo who owns the film.

Harriet is much like Darkest Hour, with a faster pace and less historical relevance. The individual scenes are fine, but they don't create a compelling or emotional arc, especially because Lemmons chooses to spend so much time on Gideon for unclear reasons. The other choice that bothered me was the extremely confusing and vague spiritual guidance that Harriet felt - the visuals imply that she can see the future and hear God speak to her, which is bizarre on its face and detracts from the remarkable but human strength she had to save all those slaves. Also, we see her bravely go back for family and manage to bring them North, and then right after we go through a generic montage of her easily helping a bunch of slaves escape. Not super convincing. There's not a lot to discuss with Harriet because it takes very few risks, and while it is competent, it's not noteworthy in any aspect, maybe with the exception of Erivo's good performance.

Surprisingly this is the first ever feature film about Harriet Tubman. The trailer wasn't the absolute best, however I really like Cynthia Erivo and it's a good story. Then the reviews came in as sub-par, so that confused me a bit. After seeing it, I completely understand. This isn't by all means a bad movie, there's just a structure to this that makes it not as great as it could be. The director, Kasi Lemmons, for whatever reason made the setup of this exactly like a Lifetime or Hallmark movie. That choice really disappointed me because this movie could've been great. Watching it I wasn't amazed like I should've been. However, I didn't hate it and the story and performances were still good. I know Cynthia Erivo is trying to get her Oscar so she can be an EGOT winner (for those who don't know, that's getting an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony). She really does well and this is her best performance to date. Erivo just got a Globe nomination the other day for acting and best original song along with a SAG nomination for acting. She knocks this whole thing out of the park and made this movie. Everyone really does well with acting. The story is good if you take out all of the Lifetime aspects to it. To explain those aspects, the cinematography, score, and setup is exactly what you'd expect to see on either of those channels. When it's a past memory, that also didn't effect the story as well, there's over exposure and a blue tint to it. That bugged me so much. There's a few good shots but it just reminded me so much of a Lifetime movie. Also the score never seemed to fit the tone well. Erivo's song is good and her singing is beautiful, however the score just doesn't fit. I don't need to explain the setup because we all know what it is. This sounds like I'm bashing this whole movie, but it really isn't that bad. I was just disappointed with that setup and I think that swayed most everyone's opinions on the movie. If you want to know the whole story, it does a good job at telling it. If you want to watch a well done Lifetime movie, I don't know if that's a compliment or not, this is something I'd suggest. Don't expect too much going in. If you can handle the whole Lifetime aspects after a while, I think you'll be fine.My Grade: B-",Harriet
58,DuskShadow,"A movie about Harriet Tubman and yes, its Hollywood but so what?",7,14 August 2020,"I see a lot of division from people saying this movie is either a 9 or 10 rate worthy film, or dozens of people that say its a 1 or 2 out of 10 at best. What rubbish either way. The movie was a solid 7 for anyone that has suffered either at the hands of others, or struggled to be free or worked themselves half to death in a slavish manner. Stand up, anyone that can empathize? * looks around * Anyone wanna raise their hands if they have been through something even slightly close to the categories that I mentioned? * raises own hand * Oh...so nobody but me, then? Then everyone else STFU while grown folks are talking.
I have yet to see a single ounce of evidence as to why this film got such low ratings from haters just because of slight liberties taken with the story. Sure it was weird when the Harriet song to communicate with her family, but history says it happened. Do people want a longer movie that focused on the singing or a film about Harriet's achievements?
IT WAS A DECENT FILM. A 6 is not enough, but where there were times when I felt like shedding a tear at the hopelessness of impossible circumstances and the odds stacked against people, man I had flashbacks to so many chapters and incidents in my life, I just nodded my head and kept watching. I judge a film or work as much as anyone else, yet the worst thing that happened after the movie came out was that I dont recall it getting an Oscar Nomination. Maybe it did happen, but I am just not so into all the ego boosting such hollow ""ceremonies"" try to create. I saw a woman that was forgotten and thought dead. A woman that braved wilds and bloody feet to run from certain death or life that might as well have spelled her doom through years of unpaid, hard toil and suffering. A woman that fought to get done what needs doing, and regardless of gender, there are sometimes few things worse than being prevented from doing whats right. And sometimes you gotta fight. I expected far more bloodshed though, but was glad to not see portrayals of children suffering, though it obviously happened during those times. What I wanted to see more of were the experiences with the people Harriet Tubman was ferrying to freedom. MOre of the people along the way that helped and had begun the movement before Harriet herself had even gotten involved. I wanted to see more of her life during the civil war as a nurse and inspiration to the black men in uniform that stood for a change against the archaic dogma of slavish notions. I wanted to see her with her family in New York more and see more into her mind and thoughts. Hell they didnt even show the later years of her life where she helped the suffragette movement, or where she began a home for elderly and sick black people. The movie should have been longer, no doubt.
But if people expect Hollywood to do something without drama or exaggeration, than what friggin idiots for going to se ea Hollywood movie. Go watch a documentary for the nitty gritty. Go read a book, if you simpletons even dare to approach the written word in this dullard age of tech crawl buffoonery. BUt make no mistake, this movie tried to do a lot, and succeeded in not only showing a lot of the interactions between the Tubmans, but the motivations and wrongdoings of the southerners and slaveholders, and many people along the way , whom, without which, nothing would have been achieved. No woman (or man) is an island. Even I need help from time to time, and do not hesitate to ask it if it saves lives.
As I said, a decent enough film. Forgive my spelling mistakes, but after all the lickings I have taken in my life, and since spell check doesnt seem to be working, its hard to often differentiate between what I mean to write, and what my crooked fingers end up typing. BUt I think I got the message across. 7 out of 10 film. And if you dont feel the same, good for you. Think for yourselves, but dont be prigs about it. L8",Harriet

63,higherall7,Midnight Run for Freedom...,7,16 March 2021,"This is not the first time I have seen Harriet Tubman outwit slave masters and ferry fugitive slaves to freedom. I'll never forget Cicely Tyson in the television mini-series, A WOMAN CALLED MOSES (1978), hip throwing a runaway slave to the ground who was having second thoughts about the success of their escape and then cocking a pistol on him declaring, ""You'll be free or die!"". Once again, you found Orson Welles sonorously narrating the proceedings as he did for KING OF KINGS (1961). Earlier, in another review, I mentioned being first introduced to Harriet Tubman with the venerable Ruby Dee in the title role, dropping in a swoon unconscious from a head wound inflicted upon her from one of her earliest attempts to help a fellow bondsman get away clean. This happened in an episode of THE GREAT ADVENTURE (1963-1964), a History Anthology series for television airing on CBS. Now we have Cynthia Erivo as Harriet seeing stars and catching hell and hauling it in big boots that only she can fill for the North.I hear people screaming and hollering and raising a hub-bub about Erivo and the acting, Gregory Allen Howard's writing, Kasi Lemmons' directing, the cinematography of John Toll, and some are bitterly disappointed and hate this historical presentation and others are uplifted and praise it to the skies as a fitting tribute to the woman slave hunters called Moses. Many students of Black History grouse about the historical inaccuracies. It's all good to me. Keep it coming, I say! Scream and holler and raise Cain until you have as many incarnations of Harriet Tubman as we have of Batman and I won't be mad at you. I have seen three so far, and would not mind seeing sequels to this film similar to THE MAN WITH NO NAME trilogy. The more you tell the story of Harriet Tubman, the better the story gets told in my book. Lewis Wilson was a wonderful serial Batman, Adam West was the suavest Bruce Wayne, playing the caped crusader as a cross between Hamlet and Sherlock Holmes for laughs, Michael Keaton was a startling surprise with his Marlon Brando version of Batman and on and on go the various incarnations of this fictional superhero. Why not have just as many incarnations of Harriet Tubman, and you can begin the next film with her mug on a twenty dollar bill!This is a wonderful evocation of the freedom fighter's legend, proving once again that the true exploits of our African American heroes continue to outdo the strangest fiction. There is soul here, and mighty swipes of passion, and yes, misses that make you groan at the melodrama and hits that sail out of the park and make you cheer. Does all this leave you wanting more? Good. Let's have some more, and let's see if we can't tie up some of the loose ends this time, and bring in Frederick Douglass, and pose the little old lady Harriet for the camera and posterity. Let's see Harriet through the eyes of Artists and down the halls of African American museums and then back onto the Road to Freedom to follow the drinkin' gourd before the hounds catch up with her. There's more than one way to travel on the Underground Railroad, and you never know who or what you might find amongst the herbs and the weeds along the trail.This is the graphic novel version of Harriet Tubman. But what's stopping filmmakers from going even deeper and taking inspiration from Jacob Lawrence and Charles White? Meanwhile, what is going on elsewhere in the country while the slave catchers and black-birders are raising the price on Miss Tubman's head? How about a good look at the actual routes that comprised the Underground Railroad on a map and more colorful anecdotes about the people who risked their lives providing shelter and aid for those who would be free? Let's see some of the characters who helped Harriet write the story of her Life and Times.The point being that the life of Harriet Tubman is an open field, ripe for all kinds of running around and hiding and seeking. This was a great taste of her adventures, but I have a hangerin' and a thirst for more. What does Miss Tubman do after the War of Emancipation, and who does she tell her story to after that? Harriet Tubman and her freedom seekers started this, now let's see how she and they finish it. I hear voices in the darkness, time to hit the ground running. There goes Miss Tubman again! Grab all your belongings, y'all, and let's see if we can't catch up...",Harriet
64,mr_bickle_the_pickle,A Paint by Numbers history lesson.,6,6 February 2020,"I thought this film was....ok. The film does have some controversies that I dont totally agree with ( and I can get into - though there may be spoilers) but overall my disdain for the film is more for the fact that it's a little ""safe"". It feels like a PG version of events.Does the film have a ""white saviour"" narrative? Personally, I didnt see it. Yes, her Master shoots another person that was about to kill her. But it wasnt out of love. It wasn't to save her. They make it clear from the beginning of the movie that he has an obsession with her. That she's his ""prized pig"" if you will. So my interpretation is that he saves her only because he wants the satisfaction of a) being the one to catch her and b)raping/torturing/killing her himself. Like, I definitely was not getting any saviour vibes from him. Besides that, the only white people that help her on her journey is a farmer that lets her ride in his hay cart and another that tells her where to find William Still. And they're barely in the movie. Like less than 5 minutes of screentime. And theres some white extras in the background of scenes of Underground Railroad Meetings, but the focus is never on them.The other controversy or complaint I've seen is that Harriet was given superpowers or there was too much of a supernatural element to the film. It is true that Harriet was struck in the head with a weight as a child. And that she suffered from seizures as a result from this injury. And it was Harriet herself who attributed it as visions from God. Whether or not you believe in that sort of thing, thats what Harriet herself believed in. So for a film about Harriet, it didnt bother me that they went down the route of her having visions and telling people ""God is telling me we should do _____"" .The one controversy/complaint I do agree with though is the character of Bigger Long. A Black Bounty Hunter. A) You already had the villan/antagonist role filled with Joe Alwyn's character Gideon. I dont think it was necessary to shoehorn someone else in. Especially since the character wasnt real or even partially based off a real guy. So then it begs the question, why add this character to the story? What's the narrative behind it? Is it to say ""Hey, not all black folk were as good as Harriet?"" Like, it seems like a weird thing to throw in a movie that is supposed to be celebrating the amazing person that Harriet was. Even if you wanted to have this narrative in there, for whatever reason...couldnt you make it more believable. I mean the guy openly carries guns, boasts about having *relations* with white women. Demands to other white bounty hunters to get a bigger cut of the pay...like......really? That's supposed to be believable in like 1840s south?And as I mentioned one of the problems for me is that the film felt ""safe"". Im not saying that film needed to be super violent or super bloody. But it doesnt feel like a lot of consequence happens. The biggest beatdown of the film is of the hands of the black bounty hunter for starters. The whites barely get their hands dirty. Some slaps, a couple pistol whips....like pretty tame. Even if they didnt want to showcase too much violence against the blacks in the movie because that would be too upsetting, fine. But they didnt even do a good job of showcasing how harrowing these journeys to freedom were. Like, you dont get any sort of timeframe for passage of time. Did it take Harriet a couple days, a week, a month to get to Pennsylvania? Who knows. I mean even when she goes back for the first time to get her family, the biggest hurdle we see them face is crossing a river and the scene after that is them at William Still's office. Again, how long, how tough was this journey? Who knows. This could have been a way to add some weight and gravitas to this film but it dont want tot show you. Even the white slave master Gideon never really gets his comeuppance in the end. I mean sure he loses a couple of fingers, its implied he'll lose his farm and his ego is probably hurt but like.....thats it. I mean if the film isnt going to go full fantasy and have Harriet put a bullet in his head, fine. But theres no satisfactory ending for this guy. Not even like a shot of him in war dying or something. It just feels like he gets off easy. The whole film feels eays. Like a nice little paint by numbers of history.As for acting I thought Cynthia Erivo was really good. Although, I thought Janelle Monae and Leslie Odom Jr were the standouts. Joe Alwyn was fine. Not the most compelling. Although, I think thats also partly due to how he was written. But he really doesnt have the same presence as Michael Fassbender in 12 Years a Slave did or Leonardo DiCaprio did in Django Unchained.It wasn't a wholly bad film, but could have been better.",Harriet

67,kingofdanerds,"A film that meets expectations, but that's about it",8,24 August 2020,"I think it is about time that a film depicting the life of Harriet Tubman has been made and released. I know that a miniseries called ""A Woman Called Moses"" was aired in the late 70's but no film has been released. The film was released in 2019 and was met with positive reviews. The film managed to make back its $17 million budget at the box office and the film recieved nominations from both Golden Globe's and the Academy Awards. The film stars Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman.The film follows the life of Harriet Tubman as she goes from slave to being a conductor on the Underground Railroad. We see the struggles she goes through as she fights to free the slaves. That's about it.Honestly, what you expect is what you get out of this film. You got a strong cast with Cynthia Erivo doing a fantastic job as Harriet Tubman. The plot is pretty formulaic with Harriet going back and forth saving slaves which I understand is a big part of Harriet's life but it does make the whole plot predictable and can make the film feel slow at times. As for historical accuracy, for the most part, it seems pretty right. It does not appear (to me at least) that anything big was changed but I am no history buff. Which leads me to say that this film managed to appeal to me even though my type of films are action, sci-fi, horror, and comedies. My one major complaint is the soundtrack. For one, it is pretty forgettable and two, it just seems off to me. Though the times that Harriet sings are pretty good. One other thing that bothered me a little bit was the fact that Harriet was able to know things through God or something. I am not a big religious person, just enough that I believe in God but not believeing everything that happens is because of God. The way it came out in this film made it look like Harriet had some sort of ability. Of course this film probably could have included more about Harriet's life outside of the Underground Railroad but I am not going to complain. The cinematography is pretty good with one scene that I thought was beautifully shot with the sun setting.Harriet manages to meet the expectations that I had but did not really surpass my expectations. It has great acting. The film is a bit formulaic and thus making the film a bit slow but that does not keep this film from being an important one. Because I think it was about time that a film about the life of Harriet Tubman has been made.",Harriet
68,jrneptune,Not a documentary of the woman but a failed attempt to capture her spirit,8,19 July 2020,"The movie has a number of factual inaccuracies for the time period. They should have hired more historians to review the script. They could have taken advantage of the reality of the time to tell an even better story. For example, most Southern states if a slave owner wanted to free a slave they also had to have the State legislator's approval as well and if the slave was under 22 or over 45 the owner would also need to provided income for the slave.Otherwise, showing her overall spirit and the spirit of the times including how the State and law enforcement perpetuated the problem while others fought against it is what won me over. Perhaps it should have been re-titled the ""Spirit of Harriet"" instead but I still recommend watching it.",Harriet
69,beachy-38431,Best Movie this year,10,2 November 2019,"I only saw two minor flaws. The train they show is a Europen or Asian train, not an American train. This is probably because Americans have not preserved their old trains from this period. The main thing they preserve is the big monster steam engines from the 1930s and 40s. I remember one movie about this period where a character was getting on to a passenger car in the station. The passenger car was steel rather than wood. They did not have steel cars until the 1920s. The other flaw I saw was when she was in the tub they had a reflector set up on or near the tub. These were used to reflect candle light to increase it. However in the scene they had it facing away from the tub. Also I think I saw the reflection on a light bulb on the screen behind the tub. This is a common practice in museums to put more light in a room. Finally, when the black preacher is preaching on the plantation, he quotes the Bible and says the Bible says for slaves to be obedient to their human masters. There is nothing in the movie that says in the south, Bibles were rewritten and removed all reference that slavery was wrong and freedom was right. Their Bibles were very small. That part is shown in the movie. The movie itself is fairly historically accurate about the story of Harriet Tubman at this time as I know it. For instance, it shows a lot of runaway slaves escaping up the Chesapeake bay on small ships mastered by free black men and abolitionist. It also, finally, tells the story of how horrific slavery was, not only for the beatings but in breaking up families. There was a show on TNT, I think, called ""Underground"" a few years ago where a runaway slave talks about the psychological terror of knowing you can be sold at any time. If you can find that show on DVD, watch episode 2-6. That entire episode is Harriet Tubman giving a talk to raise funds for the abolitionist cause. The show is wonderful and the actress who played Tubman was wonderful. Regardless, go see this movie.",Harriet

This movie might be a little offensive towards the african americans as it shows they had big difficulties following the law at that time also..

Is it not weird that African Americans would worship the devil-god of their masters?,Harriet
71,MovieBuff11732,An Under-looked Film By Critics,9,18 November 2019,"Harriet is about a adventures of Harriet Tubman and her slave journeys.I don't really know why many critics have disliked this movie. I found it very interesting and at some points, intense. It did exceed my expectations. The critics had set low ones, but once I came out of the theater I was pleasantly surprised. Like I said, there was some pretty intense scenes. They also gave you a solid depiction of how hard it was for Harriet Tubman to get all of the slaves she did freed. The movie showed that she was even more amazing than you are taught in school. There are more intense slave movies out there like The Color Purple, but this one I have a feeling that, schools will show it. It just felt like a film that you would watch in school. That being said, it was still a great film.The acting was really good. I didn't know any of the actors in this film, but I thought they all had solid performances. I didn't think they're a bad actor in this film. The writer kind of made it look like the acting wasn't too good because they script forced some emotional scenes in this movie. That was the only problem with the script.The score was good. Towards the start of the film, it sounded sort of tech-ish and I didn't think that went well with the film. There were other scene were the score played a major part in the scene and it didn't disappoint then.Overall, Harriet was a good movie I would recommend even if you don't really know a lot about Harriet Tubman.",Harriet

77,Sasha_Lauren,Harriet Tubman's Heroes Journey -- this film moved me!,8,11 February 2020,"HARRIET (2019)Abolitionist Harriet Tubman escaped from Maryland to Philadelphia in 1849 on foot by following the North Star and utilizing the help of the Underground Railroad, a network of secret routes and safe houses set up by white abolitionists and free people of color to help slaves to freedom. She then repeatedly risked her life by going back into the lion's den over a period of eleven years to lead other slaves to their freedom. She never lost a passenger. This is so damn brave it makes my head spin.This film served up a substantantial serving of history, embellished by a modicum of fiction. Though it's not a movie masterpiece, it's a strong depiction of Harriet's Heroes Journey that lifted me up for days. Cynthia Erivo's portrayal of a determined Harriet, known before her liberation as Araminta ""Minty"" Ross, (and later nicknamed Moses because she helped her people escape to freedom), was stirring; her singing was the gold on the edges. Harriet used spirituals as coded messages to warn fellows of danger or to signal a clear path.The antagonist in the story is the racist, corrupt system of slavery embodied in part by her heartless owners. Plagued by hypersomnia sleeping spells caused by a head injury when she was thirteen, Minty's owner Edward Bodess tried to sell her. This would separate her from her family. There were no buyers for her. Angry, Minty prayed, ""Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way."" Edward died. Harriet expressed regret for that prayer.Joe Alwyn played Gideon Brodess, Edward's grown son, with a conniving, lecherous sneer. Guideon leered after Minty and tormented her. Harriet's husband was a free black man in theory, but not reality; any future children of the couple would be slaves, regardless of papers granting manumet to Harriet's kin, which the Brodesses ignored. She and her husband planned to escape together, but Tubman fled alone and travelled a hundred miles through wilderness to Pennsylvania, being followed by her scummy owner Gildeon. Well, screw him, she made it, and became a heroine.",Harriet

I had not seen Harriet til after the 2020 Oscars Awards. And I'm glad for that or I would have been very disappointed in the Best Actress award.

84,stefstars,Takes a lot of liberties but still honors an American hero,6,4 November 2019,"While the movie does a good job in showing how strong, determined, and overall badass Harriet Tubman was, it added a lot of fictional instances to her story. I, personally, don't think these additions were necessary because Harriet Tubman's story is interesting on it's own, as it was in real life. I saw previous reviewers saying how the movie doesn't do a good job in showing the true horrors of slavery. I disagree to a point. The movie doesn't get graphic when it shows slaves on the plantation but it does show how cruel the masters could be and the violence it shows from the masters to the slave is tamed, in comparison to previous films that deal with this subject. However Harriet discusses the horrors of slavery with the Underground Railroad committee in Philadelphia and towards the end in New York with the abolitionists, pointing out that hers is a firsthand account. I get where you're all coming from though, her just saying it vs. having the audience see it for themselves makes a big difference in having the audience understand the danger Harriet was in, prior to and after she ran away.Which brings me to the next issue. The actress who plays Harriet was good and maintains that strong aura that the real one had - you could see this in the photo of the real one. However, I feel that she delivers a lot of the lines in a preachy tone, like if she's talking to the audience waiting for them to clap for what she just said rather than saying it to the characters in the film. One example is when she's on the bridge surrounded, her first time heading up North, and it's the first time that she delivers the line ""I'll be free or die."" The dramatic pause it does and the way she says it, you can tell that they wanted it to make some emotional impact on the audience and expected them to clap in the theaters. Maybe some audiences did but the one I was in didn't, and understandably so. I'm all for the message but the way it was delivered, I'm afraid it was to cheesily done. It doesn't help that they have her say different variations of this line like 5 more times throughout the movie.Perhaps the most problematic fictional addition this film does to Harriet's story is having several instances of the white savior. Her cruel master, well his son, is shown as this from the start in a very twisted way. They took the liberty to make him sexually attracted to her and having romantic feelings for her at the end ?! That didn't settle right with me and other audiences, it wasn't necessary. Also he saves her near the end from a black man... need I say more ? Again, while the film does good in showing her successes and how great her contribution was to the progress of this country and in ending slavery, it added things to her story that weren't necessary at all. Wish the directors, producers, etc. trusted in Harriet's story as it is, alone.",Harriet

86,JackCerf,Familiar Tune In A Different Key,6,4 November 2019,"A wise man once said that a plantation is just a concentration camp with a prettier front office. That's why Harriet seemeed to be such a familiar movie. We're all used to seeing Third Reich resistance movies that involve extrarordinary idealists hiding from and tricking the Nazis and their collaborators, unexpected sympathizers, false papers, narrow escapes, and, in the better ones, a smart and motivated villain who understands exactly what he's doing and believes in it. This is that movie, except that instead of SS men with tommy guns we have everyday white Americans wearing ""U.S. Marshal"" badges and carrying Colt revolvers. Its a worthwhile reminder that until the Civil War slavery was the law, that it had the power of the federal government behind it, that it was founded on violence, and that large numbers of white Americans believed it was essential and right and were willing to kill and die to preserve it.This is also a vindicated Cassandra movie. Like the heroine of Zero Dark Thirty, Tubman is patronized by well meaning men who sympathize with her cause but don't take her seriously and mistakenly believe that they know better because she is only a woman. The heroine defies their advice that she doesn't know what she's doing, goes her own way, proves them wrong and then makes them admit it.It has the usual artistic license of movies on historical subjects, compressing and simplifying events and adding drama. Fine performnce from the lead actress, and solid work from everyone else in the cast, who seem to believe in the project instead of phoning it in for a paycheck. It's a good afternoon's entertainment, and it may provoke some viewers to go learn Tubman's actual story, but it won't be remembered 5 years hence.",Harriet

From the get go we get boring, lame acting that you'd see in a high school production of a play, and while the story is good, it just never really gets that exciting for me. It feels more like a grab for attention, but was trying so hard for 12 Years A Slave, which is a much better film, and yet was a novel and not based on historical facts like this film is, which you think would make for more interesting viewing, but instead it just never really picks up and is definitely NOT Oscar or Golden Globe worthy, much like Black Panther was last year.",Harriet
90,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Harriet or: Why This American Hero Belongs on the $20 Bill,9,7 January 2020,"The Stream: A little paint-by-numbers historical biopic for such a towering figure in American history.The Big Screen: Cynthia Erivo embodying the strength, perseverance, and fearlessness of a remarkable human being.The Final Bill: Even though you know how Harriet's story goes, this movie is suspenseful and deeply inspirational.-Trip FontaineA five-foot tall, female runaway slave escapes the clutches of a jealous slave owner, and she treks to freedom nearly 100 miles from where she had been enslaved with nothing except desperation, her wits, and faith propelling her on. Harriet Tubman is one of a handful of well-known African American Historical figures that are taught even outside of their designated month. In fact, she is such a towering figure that she was slated to be the new face of the $20 bill. So, why did it take until 2019 for this story to get the Hollywood treatment? I hope it was just because everyone involved along the way wanted to give the woman the respect she deserves. I don't know if what Harriet is is all that it should have been, but it is nevertheless a respectable effort that grabs your heart and doesn't let it go.Harriet, as directed by Kasi Lemmons and starring Cynthia Erivo as the erstwhile, Araminta Ross, takes no time setting the stage to get Araminta on her journey. The farm owned by the Brodess family is no place to raise a family. She must live free of die. Lemmons ratchets up the tension and builds the suspense of every moment of Araminta's trek. Although the escape of Araminta, soon-to-be Harriet Tubman, is well-known, the tension of every step away from enslavement and the fear of capture from slave trackers is relentless. Her determination is equally unrelenting.Erivo plays Harriet as impassioned as she must have been, not only for her own freedom but for that of her family. This woman is fierce, cunning, determined and every other adjective for heroic. Erivo embodies each aspect with such a spirit that captures the audience. She is soulful and every expression is heartrending. There are others in the ensemble like Leslie Odom, Jr. and Janelle Monae, who play people that help Harriet in her freedom and introduce her to the Underground Railroad; and, there are also villains like the slave owners played by Jennifer Nettles and Joe Alwyn, who become a bit cartoonish. They all really pale in comparison to the powerful presence of Erivo with some divine inspiration of Harriet herself.There are a few quibbles with the film. As biopics go, the truth of the history is what makes Harriet worthy. There are not any tricks or gimmicks that make the film itself anymore of a typical historical biographical film. Also, Lemmons tries to explain why Harriet takes the risks she does and how she is successful in eluding capture, but it doesn't always work. Lastly, there are two instances where there is a comedic shift that feels out of place.Ultimately, Harriet is a must-see movie. The story of Harriet Tubman is remarkable. To see this dramatization reminds one of the struggle that some Americans had to go through just to get what should have been inherent in their simple existence. Tubman is an American hero, who deserves all of this recognition and more. Go to the theater early and often, and probably bring a tissue or two, just in case.Note: Stay for the credits to hear Harriet's anthem, ""Stand Up,"" sung incredibly by the brilliant, Cynthia Erivo. If you are not crying by the end of the first chorus, rush to the hospital to make sure your heart is not a cold, cold block of ice.",Harriet
91,pazu7,"I really wanted to love this film, but...",4,26 January 2020,"So, the thing about ""Harriet""... it just wasn't such a good film. And I really hate to say that. But it was full of tropes, awkward exposition, ill-timed speechfyin and a score that sounded like it was written in the 1970s. There were a few moments that felt genuinely emotive but most of it was forced. Not the actors fault. The cast was great but, man that dialogue was way overripe. One character even says ""It didn't have to end like this."" omg... If there was ever a hackneyed line. It was better than a 4 star film but I gave it a 4 because because Harriet Tubman is one of US histories most important characters. And this film failed to represent,. The same thing happened to the film about Jackie Robinson. Important character and story. Bad film. Bland script. Forced emotive moments. Trite score.

After all the hype I was looking forward to something engaging about a heroic protagonist who deserves to be better known, this is not the film a woman of her stature deserves.Cynthia Erivo commands the screen as best she can, but she's fighting against a dull script and plodding direction. The whole thing is static, told with lumpen pacing and too many actors who seem to be either disinterested, lost, or lack craft.

Regardless, it is a powerful portrayal of a woman who sacrificed her own comfor and safety to fight the evil of slavery. And this isn't the timid Harriet Tubman of our elementary school lessons. She carried a gun (true) and led a raid in the Civil War (also true). She was fierce and brave and devout. I loved that they accurately represented Harriet's faith and trust in God's guidance.

99,Metaflix,An Inspiring Tale That Suffers from Uninspiring Dialogue,7,6 November 2019,"Harriet Tubman has near-universal name recognition. Soon, she'll even be replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. But the events of her life, which is why her name is so recognized and why she deserves to be featured on currency, are far less known. This makes seeing Kasi Lemmons' 'Harriet' more valuable than just spending a couple of hours watching a movie. It's also like spending time at an educational lecture, gaining a deeper understanding of our history, our country, and ourselves.Cynthia Erivo gives a phenomenal performance as Harriet and the story itself is truly inspirational. Throughout the film, however, the dialogue often stands out like a sore thumb, dragging the film's overall rating down. It either comes off as far too cliche, mundane, or basic compared to everything else in the movie, making it that much more (painfully) noticeable.Overall, we still recommend seeing 'Harriet' for the reasons noted above, but just wish the pencil used to write it were a little sharper.",Harriet

However, as with many of the long-lingering characterizations of legendary American men (and women), ""Harriet"" has been gracefully ""airbrushed.""

Her Harriet is brave, fearless and driven by her visions brought to her by God. However, the telling of her story is at times over fraught and lacking in subtlety and I felt the pacing was uneven. It starts very well setting the scene and telling the backstory effectively. We then lose a year after Harriet escapes and we dont know what she has been up to and the film then jumps to her wanting to go back. This kind of jumping of narrative happens quite a bit, making the pacing uneven. For all that the main performance is strong, the cinematography excellent, an the background to what was going on was covered well.

102,franklindf,Intro to Harriet Tubman,5,26 July 2020,"This movie offers an introduction to the life and times of Harriet Tubman. Unfortunately, the material that it covers is probably well known to most people familiar with abolitionism in America. The movie focuses almost singularly on Harriet's abysmal life as a slave, and concentrates on the standard portrayal of piss and moaning, subjugation, slaves coping by chanting gospel, dehumanization of slaves, the cocky and evil hearted whites involved, and corruption of other black people to help maintain the system of oppression. It's very standard stuff, the way slavery normally is covered in the American media. Sure, there is no denying it, but we've seen 100 of these films that get stuck in the same rut with the material. So this movie brought nothing new, I knew everything it had to offer about Harriet Tubman, and I actually know more. What bothers me, is she is portrayed mostly as an uneducated simpleton with little capacity beyond following her instincts and visions brought, perhaps by brain damage. In a way, I don't feel like it does justice to her character or intellect. I realize she wasn't educated, but this movie makes her seem, dirty, smelly, unlearned, and somewhat dull. It just focuses on the same standard slave narrative without exploring her other achievements such as the people she worked with who were important to the movement like Frederick Douglass or John Brown. It doesn't go into her involvement in the suffrage movement or the Civil War (aside from a footnote). She had a lot more going on than this film even touches on - they just portray her as ""barefoot and pregnant"", somewhat savage, lucky, and maybe brain damaged. It's the kind of stuff you might learn in a high school history lesson without depth. So at most it just offers a somewhat unsympathetic introduction to her life.",Harriet

Then they pushed it back to 2028 because apparently we can't print black people on money or something. If this movie was going to cause a groundswell to speed that process up, it did a horrible job. (This is an obvious sidetrack-- it just peeves me that they announce it and then push it back 8 years... and I'm not sure what the current status is).This movie is boring in so many ways.

108,michaeldoud,First Hit: Definitely an Oscar-contending performance by Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman.,8,4 November 2019,"First Hit: Definitely an Oscar-contending performance by Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman.Before she took the name Harriet, she was called Minty. The film opens with Minty as a married slave working for the Brodess family. Her husband, John Tubman (Zachary Momoh), is a free man working for another landowner. She sees him infrequently, and they steal hugs and kisses on rare occasions.Minty's mother works for the Brodess family as well as does her sister and other members of her family. Her father works for another family, just like John works for another family.After the patriarch Edward Brodess dies, the son, Gideon (Joe Alwyn), takes over and ensures that he makes Minty's life harder.Minty and her husband had a lawyer to get a judge to write a document allowing her to be free and to leave the Brodess farm and start a family with her husband. The Brodess family rips up the letter and forbids John from coming around to see Minty ever again.Minty cannot stand it and tells John to meet her by a fence gate, and they'll run away together. However, she's afraid that it will hurt John's freedom, so she heads out alone to find freedom in Philadelphia, PA, and leaving him behind.Her journey is horrendous, but she trusts in her faith in God and the visions that overwhelm her along the way. In the visions she sees the dangers that are coming her way and makes decisions about what to do next. The images are presented as flashes and in a dream-like sequence and sometimes I didn't interpret or understand them like Minty did, but her actions gave the audience a clear understanding of her visions.She gets to Philadelphia and finds her way to William Sill's (Leslie Odom Jr.) printing business and also leading an organization that helps people escape slavery through the underground railroad. Sill is also documenting each slave's story by interviewing them. One of the things he does when he talks with the slaves, Sill allows them to select a name for themselves, which he documents. This allows the new arrivals to be rid of their slave names. Minty decides on ""Harriet"" in honor of her mother and ""Tubman"" because that is her husband's name.Harriet is barely five-feet tall, but she becomes a giant in the underground railroad because, against all the odds, she goes back to Maryland multiple times and frees more slaves on each trip. She leads them through the wilderness and to Philadelphia.Not only is she the most prolific of the conductors of the underground railroad, but she also becomes a leader of soldiers for the Union Army and frees over 190 more slaves in battles against the Confederate Army.Not only did I learn a lot more about Harriet in this film, I left the film amazed that she didn't get more print space in my middle and high school history books.The film felt very formulaic, and some of the early scenes felt very staged. This is where the film struggles, however once I let go of these staged scenes, and just rode within Harriet's story through Harriet, it worked very well.
When it comes to putting her picture on the new upcoming $20 bill, she deserves it, and it can't come soon enough. She's a hero of the people.Erivio was absolutely sublime as Harriet. This performance is of Academy Award caliber, as is the story. Odom Jr. is excellent as one of the leaders that coordinate the underground railroad. Alwyn is strong in this unenviable role as slave owner. Momoh was very good as Harriet's husband and the scene when she comes back for him is devastating for both. Janelle Monae, as boarding house proprietor Marie Buchanon was terrific. Her support of Harriet was unending and undying. Kasi Lemmons wrote a strong screenplay. Gregory Allen Howard directed this film. There were times the scenes were strong, but there were also scenes that felt too staged.Overall: Despite the film's unevenness, Harriet's life as developed here was one of embodied strength.",Harriet

It would have been nice to have a bit more explanation about how the underground railroad operated and the different figures involved. I know this was a biopic about Tubman's life, but a bit more development of those around her would have aided the story.As others have mentioned in their reviews, one of the weakest parts of the film is the score. The use of song in the film is fantastic but the background music is very uninspiring. The same generic motif is used constantly whenever an uplifting moment happens.

Nevertheless, I'm sure most, if not all of the people, who rate this movie under 5 probably fall into that ""I'm anti-God"" camp and do not believe either God exists, God communicates to His people, or that God even cares about humans. Oh well, sorry to inform you, He does exist, He does communicate to His children (when they listen) and yes He cares about us. My God, He allowed for His only begotten Son, Lord Jesus to empty Himself of His Godhead for a time being to become a man who ultimately ""had to"" die on the cross at Calvary in order to pay the penalty for our sins that we deserve, not Him (He was our-felt of course). Weren't you taught this?But I will leave giving GOOD NEWS....it's never to late to turn from your evil selfish ways and put your faith in His love and atonement that He graciously offers you every minute while you still have breath of life.

It's a story we've heard of many times in history classes and now her story had finally come to the big screen and is ultimately just a serviceable film that doesn't have much to offer.Harriet is a solid film, a good film even with a stellar cast including: Cynthia Erivo, Leslie Odom Jr. and Janelle Monáe, bust sadly the film ends up just being a standard retailing with very little flash to separate it from other more powerful films regarding slavery. It's a shame too since Harriet Tubman is such a huge part of our history and her story is so well known.The acting however is strong. Cynthia Erivo gives a committed and wonderful performance as Harriet. Supporting cast also goes a great job and the film overall looks very nice.

It goes on from there. Yes, it's a bit hollywooded, dramatized. Many of the basic facts of her life were there, however. Striking at this time, offering an inspiring story of a woman willing to do whatever it took to break free from slavery, the courage to go into the unknown and find her way to stay true to something that ushered her through immense difficulties. Because we're not being whipped, raped and sold we don't recognize the degree to which we are enslaved in this consumerist society. We also don't recognize the degree to which the white supremacist viewpoint still runs things in our world. So while this film may not be perfect, it's well worth watching. It was engrossing, and shows both a spirit within us that will be free, the feet to carry it out, and what will fight in so many ways to keep that down, dominate and control, keep the riches of the status quo they've found on the backs of people for generations. Will you watch the film and wonder how you might find the courage to break free? If you think you are free, check your credit score and what it allows you to do or not do, and how many people, companies and organizations have access to that information. We are living in a time when our democracy is all but gone, and we go on as if what is essential to our freedom doesn't exist. To me, that's what the film is mirroring, and it does it's job.

121,tomfeller,The Story of Hattiet Tubman,9,25 November 2019,"Harriet-
Back in the Sixties, there was an anthology TV series called The Great Adventure, which dramatized stories from American history. In the episode ""Go Down, Moses"", Ruby Dee starred as Harriet Tubman (1822-1913) and Ethel Waters played her mother. This was my introduction to the woman, who is the subject of this new movie starring Cynthia Erivo as the title character. (I also recently read a biography about Tubman.) It begins with her escape from Maryland's Eastern Shore to Philadelphia in 1849, where she meets Marie Buchanon (Janelle Monae), a free black woman who owns the boarding house where Harriet finds lodging and William Still (Leslie Odom, Jr.), a free black man who is active in the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad. (Still was an historical character, but Buchanon a fictional one.) It then shows how she return more than a dozen times to rescue 70 more slaves, including her parents (Clarke Peters and Vanessa Bell Callaway) and other friends and relatives. The role of Gideon Brodess (Joe Alwyn), Tubman's owner, is greatly expanded in the movie from the historical record to make him the film's primary villain, and a secondary villain, black bounty hunter Bigger Long (Omar J. Dorsey), is added. As a child, Tubman had been hit on the head by an overseer and suffered from Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, which caused her to have frequent blackouts. The film takes the position that these blackouts were actually visions of the future that allowed her to bypass traps set for her by her enemies. The last five minutes of the film show her service during the war, in which she participated in the campaigns along the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, including a raid that liberated about 700 slaves.

Before watching this, I thought ""Harriet"" might have unwatchable scenes and I was still prepared to buy this movie on Amazon Prime Video, I was surprised to find that this movie is actually watchable, there is no extreme violence depicted in this film, I think it's good that they didn't depict that, there are already plenty of films with this theme that feature extreme scenes, there doesn't need to be more. ""Harriet"" is still a powerful movie without the extreme violence, and there are a couple of scenes that almost brought me to tears and I never usually get emotional when watching a movie.""Harriet"" is a brilliant film, powerful performances, and as a Christian - I will obviously state that I like the Christian theme, and I do believe that God helped Harriet Tubman free all of those slaves, it is something that would be quite impossible, but like a verse in the Bible says ""Nothing is impossible with God"". Her visions and head injury...many historians debate about that, but the bottom line is God helped her free her people. If you don't believe in God, then that will obviously be difficult for you to fathom.I want to mention a few supporting characters, the two black men that were trying to get Harriet captured, the bigger guy is absolutely disgraceful and had no remorse, whereas the smaller guy - at least he changed his ways and went out of his way to help Harriet and her family.
The scene where the young woman who was pretending to be her master - even though she was not in the film for that long, she gave a powerful performance especially when she got emotional for that couple of seconds when she was asked if she knew a particular slave owner.I also want to mention that many people in life think that verses in the Bible about ""slaves obey your masters"" is about racial slavery, and yes the slave owners did use that verse against their slaves, but they did that to try and justify their wrong ways, that particular verse is not about racial slavery, to understand it is to study that verse in context, and one can only really be able to understand it if you are born-again.10 out of 10 rating from an amateur film critic.

The Harriet Tubman in this movie is more akin to Wonder Woman. It was a dreadful depiction of a woman who deserves to be remembered for what she actually did, not for this dreadful bucket of dog sick!
Holly""woke"" are really getting on my nerves now. Instead of padding out a decent and captivating story with some artistic license; in order to create an interesting movie, they're making things up as they go along, and adding a sprinkling of the truth ever now and again. It's like every movie has to contain an element of Marvel heroism.
If you're interested in the actual history of this incredible woman, read Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom.
If you want a load of old gash - watch the movie.",Harriet

I'm more of an Artist who draws my interpretation of things which impact my life. That being said, this movie impacted me. It stirred my emotions from anger to joy. It left me cheering for the human spirit that fought and fights for what is morally and ethically right.... that everyone is created equal. This movie spoke to me. It gave me hope in humanity despite the inequality which still exists today. If you feel the same, watch this movie. I also give props to all the actors who gave a convincing interpretation of this part of history that will stir anyone's heart.",Harriet

133,ayojerkinskarega,Important film,8,1 November 2019,"This film had the potential to be much more, but nevertheless it's a story that needs to be told. First, the writing and acting was flat; because of that, Harriet and the secondary characters were one dimensional. Additionally, some of the characters motivations were questionable and were just plan unnecessary to the story. Also, I felt like the film was too quick thus no time for character development. I do like the message of the film as to show how important black women are to American history. Also, it shows how important black women are in general. I felt that this film showed that idea in many aspects not only Harriet, but also in Marie Buchanon, played by Janelle Monae. Contrastingly, I felt that black women empowerment ideology was at the expense of black men. For example, the black slave catcher Bigger Long, played by Omar Dorsey. His character was an unnecessary antagonist that, proven historically, the slave owners who, in real life, didn't employ a slave catcher to find her and there was a minute amount of black slave catchers. Nevertheless, this is a Story that needed to be authentically told. Overall I'll give it an 8.2/10.",Harriet

Just know it's not a biography or autobiography it's a story told from the point-of-view people in 2019. The good thing about this movie is it should Inspire younger generations to look up this great black American Hero and research and study the truth about her more.

And I'm thankful to be part of another strong woman who left her name in the book of history as a hero. Cynthia Erivo, initially with a blandly acting, arrive to a superb interpretation of the strong character of Harriet with a crescendo.

As far as I can see the haters are a) atheists who object to a religious person being praised, b) historians who whine about all the historical inaccuracies and c) the ones who complain the movie isn't gritty enough. There's also those who claim she's made out to be some sort of superhero of the Marvel and DC variety and the ones who complain about the movie score.To all of the above I say ""chill out"" or maybe you need to find something else to do with your spare time. The above complaints are unwarranted. Yes, the ""visions"" were weird but apparently she did have ""episodes"" due to a sustained head injury and I don't think it detracted from the movie as a whole. As for the score, I loved the soundtrack, especially the final song, and was not surprised to learn after that it was nominated for an Oscar.Obviously I'm an idiot because when I started watching I had no idea it was based on a true story.

Is this movie perfect? No. But it is WAY better than all the whining 1 star reviews make it out to be. Yes, there are invented characters -- what bio-pic doesn't have them? As some reviewers have said, this *isn't* a documentary. But this movie shows here as the woman I remember reading about as a kid. And yes, she DID carry a gun. What she did as an Underground Railroad conductor was INCREDIBLY dangerous, and she knew it. Yes, she did dress like a man at times. She also (and the film gets dinged a star for leaving this bit of factual trivia out) dressed up once as a high society lady (confusing the Hell out of the people who were trying to stop her and her ""passengers"": after all, here's this black woman but she doesn't act like a slave and they can't wrap their brains about that; so, like the slack-jawed idiots they are, they let her go on her merry way and more former slaves are helped escape. I don't remember reading about the seizures and the visions, but it was also a kid's book and stuff like that is a little difficult for a third grader to grasp. I only knew a bit about her being a Union spy (so, an second dinged star for just glossing over it); as for leading troops in the Civil War? Apparently that is *also* factual. And yes, there were a LOT of white people in the anti-slavery movement (so sorry to mess with your little pea-brains, but it's the truth; my church growing up in NYS had, at its dedication, a sermon given by the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher. (You might POSSIBLY recognize his sister's name: Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wrote _Uncle Tom's Cabin_). Both of whom were fervent Abolistionists.

Tubman was a real person who accomplished great things for African slaves in the South. But, the surrounding characters were poorly written and the acting truly subpar. I am not a historian, so I would be open to discussion on the portrayal of mid19th Century Blacks in the North, in this case, circa 1855 Philadelphia. To me, it seemed to be a shown in fantasy-like scenarios. Free slaves or free Blacks still we're not treated well by White society in the North at that time. Yet, in this film, we see them portrayed as Upper Class Society movers and shakers.

The best part to me was the closing scene and the written adlibs after. I really don't like disparaging works that show the history of Blacks in America, as our stories need to be told, but I was very disappointed. The lead did not evoke any compassion in me, and the villain was very unconvincing. Think about it, 12 Years a Slave and Django had you side-eyeing the actors that played the slave owners because they emoted so well. The lead villain, Gideon Brodess, God Bless him, didn't pull it off IMO. The fact that the best performances were the supporting cast, Leslie Odom as William Still, Clarke Peter as Harriet's father, Omar J. Dorsey (no spoilers as to role) and Henry Hunter Hall (no spoilers as to role) doesn't bode well for a film. Maybe the fact that they made Harriet 24, 25 instead of a mature woman? Maybe it was the dialogue that was written a bit ""slick"" for the time period? Maybe the inconsistencies with what was presented vs reality? Even Janelle Monae was just so so for me. Although I do not work in Hollywood, when there are that many failures within performances and only the veteran actors shine, it may be the director. I dunno, but I was disappointed. I would still support the film because we need Hollywood to know we want our stories heard/seen. Maybe if Viola Davis' project had gotten support, her version would have been better. She was going to star in and produce a biopic on Harriet Tubman for HBO, but it never happened.
I would give it 5/10 stars.",Harriet

This is clearly a somewhat hollywoodized dramatization of one set of events in a long life. There is nothing new about that...in fact it is routine.Tubman surely wasn't the perfect absolutely saintly being portrayed here...she was human. But the broad outline of the story is true...in my view, you have to be something of a jerk to be so harshly strongly motivated to trash it...and ""jerk"" is the most charitable interpretation of hating on this movie.My sense is that there are some people who are stone cold people who, obviously can't demean the movie directly...but who come here and use what sounds like legitimate movie criticism criteria to simply throw negativity into the picture and to try to prevent people from going to see the movie. Obviously not all of the bad reviews are from stone, but I suspect a significant number of them are.We saw this last night and people were crying. I shed tears myself. At the end there was applause and many stayed in their seats through the credits. Again, the movie works.I suggest that this should be used in schools as one element in a curriculum of instilling values into kids. The ideal of ""give me liberty or give me death"" is a key to whatever it is that can indeed make America great.

164,FantasyCreatureFilmsLLC,This is a WONDERFUL film!!,10,15 December 2019,"Kasi Lemmons, co-writer and director of Harriet, is a filmmaker with heart. Her excellent, no-holds-barred depiction of the life of Harriet Tubman, the reality of slavery in the Maryland enclave she witnessed, and her bravery in leading so many to freedom despite horrific punishments if caught, will resonate long after you've left the theater. Lemmons' screenplay captures not only Tubman's immense contribution to ending the ""sin of slavery"" in America, but that brief era prior to the Civil War when heightened anxieties led to heightened cruelties. You will see the South perhaps Faulkner captured best in Absalom, Absalom, which Selznick avoided, despite an opportunity to not do so with GWTW. It apparently has taken the breakdown of barriers in the Hollywood director, white-men-only club, to finally get non-revisionist films of that tragic time produced.

173,JohnnyRatesALot,An Amazing and Inspiration Film about a Heroic Woman,10,22 November 2019,"I just got back from seeing Harriet and thought it was a very moving, intense, emotional, triumphing film about the brave and courageous Harriet Tubman. Cynthia Erivo did a phenomenal job portraying the humble yet courageous, spiritual, intelligent, heroic female figure who dedicated her life - and risking it - to freeing slaves. Her determination to ""kill this monster called slavery"" was bold and definitely shined. Although the film isn't 100% accurate, that does NOT take away from the intriguing and extraordinary story this film delivers. It's Hollywood, people, so all films based on true stories are embellished. That doesn't hinder the powerful message that it delivers.
I'm not sure why some people are nitpicking at this film and being petty about it. It told Harriet's story in an emotional, thrilling, and inspiring way - as it should be. I learned about Harriet Tubman in elementary school all the time, but I never knew what a lot of the film depicted. Many parts made me cry, while other parts had me on the edge of my seat.
The performances are strong, the script is well-written and has powerful lines, the atmosphere is very historical and scenic, the soundtrack is nostalgic, and there's a perfect mix of suspense, triumph, and emotion. You feel what the characters feel. It's a journey that you'll go along with them.Harriet (2019) deserves much better justice than it's getting, and people shouldn't complain over small mistakes a historical film makes, or the embellishment it gives. That's Hollywood. It's nothing new. That doesn't make this any less than an inspiring, amazing, inspirational story that'll stay with you for a while.Five stars!",Harriet

Harriet Tubman is one of the few universally recognized American heroes in our national pantheon. Her story is one that has inspired for generations and should be EASY, VERY EASY to get right on film. Instead, we are presented with a melodramatic, anachronistic mess of a movie that tries to strong arm its cultural significance to modern day events. It has more akin to a Tyler Perry Madea movie than a historical biopic and I really don't understand how the producers allowed that to happen. The director indulges her worst instincts while losing the thread of why Harriet was such a transformative figure. It's not just that Harriet was brave, it's not just that she inherently knew what was right and what was wrong, it was that she committed herself to action at a time when so many others were complacent.

She has nothing but god with her! If you believe in god it shouldnt be surprising or odd she had visions! I mean you think she got lucky saving all those people? You think it was all skill?

Look at the professional ones. Yes, this film is polemical and skirts the truth at times, but most of what is portrayed is not to be found in historical reports, so the writers are entitled to their own treatment, especially when it reflects the horrors of slave-holding and the courage of the main character. If you aren't touched, you must have been denied the gene for compassion.",Harriet

Of course some of the stuff about Harriet was fiction, as every true story film has. What wasn't at all fiction was the pain and suffering and horrors the men and women went through.

184,jcmadsen-2,Meh,5,19 July 2020,"I feel 5 is a good rating and this movie seems to be about average. And, I tend to be more forgiving of a movie that shows up on a streaming service and you go ""eh, it's Saturday during quarantine and I have nothing better to do"".My understanding of the real Harriet Tubman is Wikipedia-ish at best. So, I won't argue the merits of its historical accuracy (others here have bashed it). Creative license and all that. But, some observations that stuck out to me:Harriett leaves her husband behind. Manages to escape on foot even though men with horses and tracking dogs seem to be 20 yards behind her at all times. This becomes a regular occurrence. I mean, she is FAST.She keeps going back, back, back to the same plantation that she escaped from. To get her husband after being gone a year. (Oops, he remarried and his new wife is expecting! Harriett is NOT happy! Didn't he know she was coming back?? How could he not!?So, she gets her brothers. Then goes back later for her sister. Then goes back to get her parents and niece. Daytime. Nighttime. Doesn't matter. She goes to church there in the middle of the day. Stands out in the open talking to her father even as she knows that men are after him. But it's ok - goes back to her former plantation to get her mother. And more people. She evades the long arm of the law who always plants themselves on the same bridge.Young bad guy who will sell out escaped slaves becomes a close confidant.Bigger Long. Don't know if he was an actual dude in real life. But, that's preeeettty close to Biggie Smalls in my estimation. What was his role? To let the White audience nod and say ""see - they did it to their OWN kind!"" Also, plenty of Whites helping the runaways so they can nod and say ""see! We HELPED them!"" Only thing missing was the kind slave owner who took care of his ""property"" and was actually very loving and supportive. Hollywood loves that character, almost as much as the White characters in sports 'based on a true story' all come together and their racist/bigoted views are miraculously washed away from the inspiration of the Black athlete(s).Back and forth we go. Long soliloquy's from Harriett. Crisscrossing the country. Lots of singing, almost as a siren call of ""come to me"" and they do. She sees, literally, God and future events (including the Civil War two years ahead of time). When she crosses the river to lead frightened people, is that supposed to represent her Moses moniker? Perhaps physically parting it was a bridge too far for the director.Anyhow, I guess you could do worse.",Harriet
185,annieoklieCerrillos,A must-see must-see!! Ignore the bah humbugs!,10,13 November 2019,"You can go online to read about the many accomplishments of Harriet Tubman, a truly amazing woman. As the granddaughter of one of the original suffragettes, and great great granddaughter of the lawyer who helped free the Amistad slaves, I have always loved knowing about people such as Harriet. I was distraught when the current Administration decided to delay putting her on our $20 bill, but I hope with enough vocal and motivated people seeing this fabulous film, she will be reinstated on the bill, and it will be issued soon. No, it's not a documentary, as most feature films are not. But did they get most of the facts and incredible feats of Harriet Tubman into the film? Yes they did!! Can't believe so many bah humbugs don't like this because it wasn't perfectly accurate; but so what? Good filmmaking tells a good story, and good filmmaking inspires those who have seen it to read more about the real people who are in that story. Slavery and racism on our planet are things that humans are still fighting. This is an excellent film to show how an undaunted human Spirit, one with a real vision for Justice, can make a difference for so many fellow humans! A great film like this can go a long way in educating and informing people who have no idea what is really going on. And those who do know about the life and accomplishments of Harriet Tubman will appreciate that her story is being told in such a powerful way!! The Acting was superb, the cinematography excellent, and the music score Simply Amazing!!

This film somehow managed to attack the character of blk men who should be victims of their circumstances created by Europeans, while glorifying or making massa a person with a conscious when we all know that the brute animals of that time had no conscious.

Cynthia Ervio (Recently in The Outsider) is an up-and-coming master class actor, who does a phenomenal job portraying the righteous, fierce and courageous Harriet Tubman.

I was really looking forward to this movie as a real biopic of an American hero and got a joke of a movie about supernatural powers",Harriet

Why this movie and it's actors were not nominated for an academy award is deplorable and definitely proves the racism that still exists in this Country. Black or White this woman should be recognized for her courage, her connection to God, determination and her abiding love for family and Country. I have recently in my elder years tried harder than ever to close my eyes and try to walk a mile in the shoes of others, it frees me in so many ways. I loved the movie and all the actors within.
PS: my sister owned until recently, a home that was a part of the underground railroad. Everytime I entered that basement I could feel people around me, and although a hole was dug and plank flooring laid across the basement area where slaves stayed for sometimes weeks until their next journey, all that surrounded me was joy and renewal. God bless all that helped in the effort to free slaves and God forgive all that prevented it.
As a free white woman I was blessed growing up, but not so for my girlfriends of color who constantly endured THE HATRED OF racism.

193,perdyhorse,Interesting reviews,8,28 May 2021,"I downloaded this movie and before I watched it, I read up on Harriet Tubman. I read from several sources and was blown away by her extraordinary life abs heroism. I am fascinated by the history of how progressive and democratic society could continue to take park in this barbaric process. But this woman was heroic.From what I read, the film only dramatised the story and brought the story of Harriet to people like me who never heard of her which is shameful.The acting was superb! There was enough violence for the viewer to feel the pain and misery of the enslaved humans. There was (as in all movies) a dramatic licence but this is story telling not a museum piece or a history book.This film should be watched by as many people as possible to remind us what we are capable of doing to each other.I really enjoyed the underlying story abs it did cover a lot of fact.Watch it. Make up your own mind but I recommend that you read about this amazing woman.",Harriet

Blows me away that so much money can be spent on a film and not have any ounce of effort.",Harriet

Most likely because I knew it's an (untold) true storyline. It's very educational, as well. I feel everyone should watch it. That movie was very educational (for me). Now I understand/learned why (1) Black Americans are so religious and God-fearing, (2) why and how such a large Black (American) population ended up in Canada, and (3) why Harriet was so brave, and possessed such an unique prophet/alien-like ability/gift.",Harriet

I also looked it up and it's incredibly accurate. So I think people would be pretty impressed with this woman's bravery and strength and faith.
from what I read it said that when she hit her head as a teenager she suffered from something that might have been seizures and that she thought was God communicating to her but it clearly served her well. I couldn't imagine having such faith in silencing all of the fear and noise around me so much to be able to think so clearly in such high stress situations.",Harriet

She is stoic, emotional. courageous and carries a gun that she will use if necessary.In this movie we see how enslaved families maintained their unity and connection despite the vile institution they endured. They not only survived, they thrived. Recent movies about enslaved individuals focus on the horrors and hardships. In this movie we see familial love, romantic love, how agonizing, difficult decisions are made and those who organized to fight for freedom for others. I love that the movie has a happy ending.

Not in specifics but in the things that matter,10,17 August 2020,It astounds me that so many people on these reviews fail to see that the spirit behind the portrayal is what matters far less than the exact facts. Harriet's character and wisdom were on display in full view and this film was a triumph in the sense that it conveyed the realities of her personal and spiritual journey. To hold up any Hollywood film and bash it for not being historically accurate is foolish in the extreme. No one expects that and nor should we. It is the truth of the characters that matter.,Harriet

However what you have is an apologetic and entirely boring biopic. The costumes and music are ok. Apart from that unconvincing and a waste of the talents of very good accomplished actors.

Although it's historically accurate that she reported having visions from God after her traumatic brain injury, none of her purported visions were as precise or significant as the ones from the movie. Her real visions were vague and more dream-like. In real life her friends and family were not convinced that they really were prophetic; whereas, in the movie, multiple people were convinced God really was talking to her and dictating her actions. This overly fantastical portrayal cheapens an otherwise powerful and historically significant story, and it calls into question the credibility of the whole film.",Harriet

But it's not entirely fictional like some seem to claim. I think the acting was very good. A solid B film in my opinion, and the film was definitely memorable too.
You also need to recognize that outside of a paragraph in most K-12 history books, the average person knows next to nothing about Harriet Tubman. Adding some pizzazz to her life to make a film more intriguing and exciting is hardly new or surprising. This is not a documentary. I'd like some people to give specifics about what is so incredibly fictional. I only saw one review of the many I quickly read that gave an example. Plus, historians consulted on the film that then were interviewed and discussed reality versus fiction in many articles. One example is given below.

Shames the legacy of Harriet Tubman. A waste of a compelling story that could have been a great artwork.Whilst I understand and appreciate the recent drive for Hollywood to have more black protagonists and heroes, they have got the message very wrong here. Harriet Tubman WAS a black hero. Her real, true story, is as interesting and important as it is heroic. This film's need to embellish the bare bones of her story, and history, with absolute fiction and historical inaccuracy belittled Tubman's real accomplishments by portraying her as a nineteenth century black female Rambo, with elements of Martin Luther King, Mystic Meg and laughably (at one point) appropriated imagery of Che Guevara, this IMO is detrimental to both Harriet Tubman's legacy and history. It worries me that viewers will believe this is historically accurate because it has attachments to a real life character. Need to know the story? Read a book, watch a documentary or if you want to watch a film portrayal of her life ""A Woman Called Moses"" from the 70's is a better choice. if you insist on watching ""Harriet"" please view it largely as a work of fiction.",Harriet

Think about it...there is no lower denominator than what Harriet was during slavery...the lowest of the low.That is the value and the importance of the movie/story and what I choose to focus on. The determination, grit, compassion and relentless desire that it must have taken each and every time when attempting to free others- not knowing what new obstacles were ahead. As women, we do not have perfect equality. Nor is it present as a person of color as an extra added layer of struggle. If I am to take a page from Harriet's character...I choose to focus on what we do have which is great than what was all the yesterdays before. My ancestors are free due to great women like Harriet Tubman and Susan B Anthony.

Why not take time and fully explain why Harriet had epileptic seizures and the factual cause of the condition? The way this movie went, I was waiting for Harriet to fly. smh BAD...BAD...BAD!!!

Not many have done what she has done, a one woman Army and Marine Corp. This movie was very well done. It highlighted her strengths, her weaknesses, her fears and her faith. It described this figure in history with sensitivity and courage. I recommend every man, woman, and child see this film and really process what is must have been like to be present in this time. The supporting cast was equally phenomenal. The team that put this film together truly exhaled life into an unsung heroine!",Harriet

If the film were called something else, and you didn't spend the entire time comparing it to some encyclopedia (or Wikipedia for a lot of you), would you have enjoyed it? Probably, because it was interesting, suspenseful, exciting, moving, and well acted.Remember it is not supposed to be a documentary. If it were, then yes, rate it based on accuracy. Even then, many aspects of her life were included in the movie. I deduct 1 star for inaccuracy, and the other two because it isn't a perfect film.How does a movie like Avengers filler with completely made-up, unrealistic, green giants and floating hammers rate 8/9? Because you're rating the movie, not the accuracy. Then you watch Harriet, and suddenly you're a historian and a film critic.

242,janshedd-1,Fabulous Movie,10,8 November 2019,"Harriet was excellent and I highly recommend it! It had several elements in it that I really enjoyed. First, in many movies that cover the subject of American slavery, all the bad people are white and all the good people are black. This does not comport with history, much less reality, and the film has good white people and bad black people, as well as the other way around.Second, Harriet has a deep faith in God and she depended on Him to guide her. None of today's ubiquitous anti-Christian bias here.I have admired this woman for years. She was only 5 feet tall and probably weighed between 85 to 100 pounds, yet she was a giant of her time or any time. I would be content if I had half of her intellect and courage and a tenth of her toughness. We should all endeavor to be more like her. America wouldn't be in the mess it's in today if we had more Harriet Tubmans.Yes there are fictional characters in the movie. I know of no film that attempts to tell a ""true"" story that does not take some dramatic license. But most of what we see in this movie is true and it is a wonderful tribute to one of the most remarkable women that ever lived.GO SEE IT",Harriet

246,jrslickstah,I didn't like this movie- I LOVED it!,10,18 November 2019,"Everyone's a critic, and that's ok- but there are a lot of haters here too. It's just a fact that movies with black leads will be rated lower than movies with leads of other races. With that in mind, I'm surprised at everyone crying over things like; the script, I read a review where it was described as ""disgustingly low brow""... SPOILER ALERT: The main character was a former slave, did you expect her to be quoting Shakespeare?? Another was crying about historical accuracy- this movie was never billed as a documentary, it's historical fiction with some creative liberties taken- I'm not mad at it, suspend your disbelief! Another said Cynthia's performance was ""corny""...I don't even know how to respond to that- I think Erivo was great, Odom Jr was great, even Janelle Monáe was good! I'm a black man, and I was really saddened that none of my brothers & sisters wanted to see this movie, they told me it looked low budget but it's a movie set in the 1800's, fantastic explosions & futuristic graphics would not have been appropriate. Furthermore since I'm ranting, LoL, the last Madea film made $22 million it's opening weekend (Harriet did half that amount), so you idiots will go see Tyler Perry dress up as a woman and make a fool of himself by playing on african american stereotypes but you're all ""high brow"" when it comes to Harriet. I can't count how many movies/tv shows with black leads portray us as drug dealers, I can't remember the last movie that portrayed a black person as a legitimate, autonomous HERO. Very rarely does hollywood give us movies with powerful black leads- even rarer do we see a FEMALE powerful black lead. I didn't see this movie because I thought it looked AMAZING, I saw it because I wanted to support such a rare event. I wanted the powers-that-be to know that I want MORE black people in powerful leading roles. Unfortunately it won't happen if this is how these films continue to be received. Finally, I'm gonna make a shameless plug for you to watch Black Lightning on CW. The show revolves around a well-to-do black family (nope, not drug dealers, sorry to disappoint, lol), the father is a school principal and the mother is a scientist, all of their kids are great students, etc... it's corny at times but you've got a very rare BLACK superhero, working on a lot of issues that face the black community. The show is woke, if you're woke you should support it, just my humble/not so humble opinion.",Harriet
247,j-ninja392,Phenomenal,10,13 November 2019,"Harriet Tubman was all about standing up to slavery and helping slaves escape to a life of freedom. This film captured every aspect of her. She knew the risks of what would happen if she was to be captured, but that didn't stop her into rescuing the people who wanted to be free.

Why not sticking to reality just for once?

Whenever a movie is made about historical figures, there's always some degree of fiction. However, they went above and beyond this to a degree that was ridiculous. They needlessly created primary characters that aren't part of the historical record . Also, some elements of the relationship between Harriet Tubman and the slave master were totally unbelievable.The acting was ok but, never reached the caliber that one would expect for this type of film.

Personally, I don't think this a very good movie. The cinematography is very bland and has no style to it and as a result, it looked like a tv show. Another problem I had was the score and the background sound effects also sounded very cheap and lazy. Lastly, this movie didn't really make me feel anything. I walked out of the theater feeling very unsatisfied and I didn't really fat anything out of it. the acting and directing was acceptable but not amazing, and the writing seemed a little lazy at times.

263,joshuavela-58606,A superhero in the 1800s?,5,23 November 2019,"It's a wonder why it took so long to produce a silver screen film about one of the most daring and history-impacting women in American history. Not only did Harriet Tubman escape a tyrannical form of slavery, but she also helped many others escape. A woman of short stature, Harriet risked her life countless times utilizing the network - and almost secret society - of The Underground Railroad to transport slaves to Philadelphia where they would be free. The canvas provided to create a film of grandiose proportions was there, but in my opinion, the story itself became the film's enemy.The film begins in a field that belies what's really happening. The Brodess family is hosting a small religious sermon by Reverend Green, directed to their slaves. It seems amicable, but things turn sour rather quick, when Harriet (although she's not Harriet until she's a free woman) and her free husband request freedom so their future children can be born free. What ensues is a chain of events that leads Harriet to escape, return and free more of her people.Cynthia Erivo performs great as Harriet, and this film is simply a platform for her career. The other performance that is enigmatic, but it's a minor role, is that of Janelle Monáe as Marie Buchanon - a born-free woman in Philadelphia who owns a building that houses recently free slaves. She is beautiful and ignorant of the struggles slaves face, and her actions towards the end of the film is climactic.Here are my issues with the film. The story of slavery is one we all know since grade school. We learn nothing new from this film. Let's take for reference the 2000 film Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe. Gladiators were slaves and fought to attain freedom. Maximus knows he's a slave, but his agenda is different. He doesn't care about being free. The idea of being free is deconstructed by the events that surround him. All Maximus wants is revenge. This resonates with us, and we can connect with him because when someone betrays us we want revenge. Maybe we will not act upon those urges, but the core of us desire that. Harriet's story is permanently etched in history. And it is what it is. And because of this I understand the film is limited with liberties. But rather than tap into more of the emotional struggles Harriet should be haunted by, the film catapults her into a more mythical creature, a superhero. Tony Starks would recruit her as an Avenger, especially with her mental intuitions she has - an ability that allows her to foresee the immediate future. History claims that Harriet suffered from seizures after having her head split open when she was thirteen, but a seizure is not a superpower.Although this film didn't quite involve me, the issue at hand is one that doesn't seem to have a foreseeable end: racism. The film is saturated with derogatory racial terms, and physical abuse. Although the main antagonist, Gideon Brodess, is evil, his role becomes too cartoonish ... but we still hate him. A better film, I believe, that is one that will deal with similar issues is the forthcoming Just Mercy, starring Michael B. Jordan.Overall grade: C",Harriet
264,mrsjond-46656,Interesting,8,4 October 2020,"After reading reviews saying it is not close to Harriet's life and ""Hollywood should be ashamed"" does not mean men/women/children did not risk their all to gain their much deserved freedom.

Be happy Harriet Tubman is here so I can read more about her.2. if you look at her young photo. So much concern in those young eyes. Look at her old photo, with wrinkles and dots, bitterness and toughness in those eyes -- old and experienced, it is not the age in her life, but the life in her age -- what a hero.3. Harriet Tubman DESERVES A BETTER MOVIE -- a better director, a better writer, a better movie, a swooping international audience recognition, two or three oscars (but if the ppl who didn't give Kubrick an Oscar won't give her an Oscar that is fine by me) -- but this movie doesn't do that
4. The movie has its pros -- the crossing river scene -- as a proud Chinese -- when i watched this on the plane -- the river scene was intense and riveting. The moment she reached freedom was emotional too.5. this movie takes a great historical figure and put it into an action movie formula -- go figure
6. Look at TUBMAN's statistics -- 70 people saved, 13 missions, 2 escapes from jail, Harpers Ferry Raid, Union Spy, underwent brain surgery without anesthesia (intentionally), civil war: another 300 saved -- those are her statistics -- WOW -- the movie didn't show any except a two minute montage -- the rest is formula and cliche of an action movie plot formula fitter for her -- wow
7. She is the #1 black women in the HISTORY -- her movie needs to be #1 black women movie of all time -- not this cliche -- though some scenes are fine and I enjoyed it ----- but to say it deserves a better movie means I need to have criticism for this -- so silly -- the director and lead are silly -- but parts of the performance are nice.",Harriet

Also major points that they didn't feel the need to pull a passion of the christ and glorify the suffering of slaves to 'show how bad it was'. The suffering is shown though Harriet's words and the scars they all carry.*plot details thought not spoilers below*
Perhaps the difference is that I was fact checking as I watched but the only outright fabrication I found was that she jumped into the river to escape the first time.
However they did a beautiful job of depicting her first steps into freedom just as she described the moment.
Equally when Harriet calls out the UGRR for wanting it to play it safe after the Fugitive Slave Act, gave me chills.
Her visions are also debatible in accuracy (but again not in fact) as Harriet herself beleived they really were ""revelations from God""
To that end the whole subplot of her Master's son gunning for her with a Slave tracker seems to be less historical fact and more a hollywood representation of just how bad people wanted to hunt her down.None of this takes away from the movie though. It's so well done, and would be a great way to introduce people to Harriet's story if only for them to go on and learn more.",Harriet

It is untrue that it didn't touch on Harriet's relationship with God - that is woven through the entire script! It is not true that the only villain in the movie was a black man - there are plenty of white villains and one black one. There are also plenty of black heroes, and some good white folk. What I know of Harriet Tubman's spirit is reflected in this movie: courageous, kind, resolute, determined, and utterly dependent on the leading of the Holy Spirit. The dependence of the Underground Railroad on the leadership of black Americans was well represented. I can only think that the reason some of these reviews are so negative is that there are still some who believe in the enslavement of other human beings, and do not want their world view challenged. I heard a report today about slavery in the modern world, including in the United States. 80% of slaves today are women, and are sold into sexual slavery.

Granted, they made some scenes more dramatic than they probably were and I'm sure the scene near the end where she confronts Gideon is fabricated for dramatic affect. Show me one one biopic that is 100% accurate especially if the person was from another century, yet I don't see any one star reviews for any of them and some of them were truly appalling!

286,thescarletdivision,Giving it 10 to balance out the 1's,10,18 February 2020,"I think most negative reviews either haven't really seen the movie or don't know anything about Harriet Tubman. It doesn't surprise me, though. Most of American history is still whitewashed and rife with ludicrous terms suc has ""first settlers"".Anyway, back to the movie. Accurate? Not 100%. Watch a documentary if you want 100% accuracy. Respectful to Harriet? I think so. I see her brave and relentless, determined in her quest to free her people. I don't know what these negative reviewers are moaning about. I wouldn't be surprised if at least half of them are undercover white supremacists w too much time on their hands.Harriet's life was long and complex, so it's hard to compress all that in a feature film. I can see why the story feels incomete here and there. Some artistic license was necessary to fit all the key points in. Cinematography is good. Production design is very good. I would've loved a scene with Harriet and the 2 chickens VS a former owner, though. She was brilliant, inventive, and wholly capable of blending into the toughest situations.The score isn't a favorite of mine, but Cynthia's performance was exquisite. She earned that Oscar nod. Overall, I'd say 8 out of 10. Gave it a 10 because it deserves more love.",Harriet
287,erif-98539,Good job from Cynthia Erivo and good music. That's it,3,17 January 2020,"This movie was long awaited. As Canadians, we all know the extraordinary achievements of Harriet Tubman. Unfortunately, this movie is nowhere near plausible. Right off the first scene, I was stunned by the quality of dental care slaves were getting back then. Then, I started thinking, maybe it's because it doesn't reflect reality. This is what happens throughout this movie. Nothing is credible. This movie tries to be historical and also attempts to portray a certain feel-good of the overthrown of slave owners. Didn't work. If you want historical, 12 years a slave was a masterpiece depicting the horror of slavery. On the hand, If you want a certain feel-good sensation over the turning point and around the time of the civil war, although very fictional, Django Unchained is spectacular. 1 star for Erivo, 1 star for music and 1 star for the first try. Let's try this again in a few years because that woman is among the greatest heroin ever to live.",Harriet

There's no Harriet romancing any white masters, there's no sex scenes with Harriet and everything the film says Harriet did, Harriet actually did in reality. The reason why people are being negative about this film is to keep the masses from seeing this film BECAUSE of its message. They don't want you to see and know the message of this film, the message of this film being that both black and white people can work together, for equality and for freedom.So i'm telling you, this film is WORTH the $24.50, you will not regret it.

291,dorothealperkins,Disrespectful to Harriet's legacy,1,2 November 2019,"Cynthia Erivo is a Nigerian from possible slave traders. Us Americans suppose she is Igbo Diala. Not only that but she has made very disparaging and disrespectful remarks to black Americans. Referencing the entire racial group is ghetto and uneducated. She also has supported tweets calling black Americans AKATA meaning lost monkey. Cynthia Erivo is an enemy to black Americans and is trying to play one of a black freedom fighter.
The irony is so canning that this could not have been an oversight by Production.The only black male character in the film is the villain. The white slave master saves Harriet Tubman at the end of the movie and she spears his life. The man who enslaved her gets to walk away free, No harm, the real Harriet would have shot him dead. This is a white feel good movie this is not historically correct at all. The made up white slave master character that is secretly in love with her, as if they were in some secret messed up BDSM love scene, was totally unnecessary. While the ""sadistic LOvInG"" slave master kills the convenient black bounty Hunter who wanted to kill Harriet. The creators of this sadistic slave fiction owe her descendants, Black Americans, an apology.

Such an amazing historic retelling of the life of Harriet Tubman and her central role in leading hundreds of slaves to freedom. There were so many deep messages in this film, life messages, like our role in a world in which others are suffering, what it means to be fearless and strong and what that can look like as a woman, leadership and action, hearing God's voice, relentlessly pursuing your purpose in life, and I could go on. Wow wow wow. A must see movie for everyone.The filmmakers did a great job with the characters, script, scenes, etc. When you look up the story of her life, you realize how much bigger she was, even than what is shown in this film.

Next time you want to disrespect a prominent figure in the history of America, try making fun of the life of Abraham Lincoln or Thomas Jefferson. The lead actor who played Harriet wasn't all that good of an actor bowing down to trees, passing out and acting cowardly.

However, in the movie she spoke like an African American with broken language. The way that Harriet Tubman may have spoken. It was a great movie for a two hour film.

304,acanty-67645,"""Harriet"" was brutal.",1,25 March 2020,"After watching this film I was highly disappointed. To sum it up, the film was extremely unrealistic. The directing was a 0/10. I give it 1 star, because it forces me to click on at least one star. This is bad for the culture of film making, especially on a historic mogul such as Harriet Tubman. I expected a lot more.One thing I don't like about the film is how proper and lackadaisical the slaves were throughout the film. A lot of the slaves and slave owners sounded too modern for me. Slaves were clean and well kept. When Harriet was sneaking around the plantation, she wasn't sneaking at all. Just casually walking and talking in hindsight. I know if i was Harriet or any of the slaves planning to escape during the night I would be crouching and on my tippy toes lurking to make sure I don't make a sound or get caught. Instead the slaves were walking around like they just got out the car going to the store. Not to mention a time when Harriet Tubman had returned to the plantation to save more slaves on her plantation. During the night she noticed one of her friends in the slave owners house being told to clean up the house by one of the slave owners. As the slave owner walks away from her, seconds later Harriet decides to throw a rock at the window. As brilliant as Harriet Tubman is I know she wouldn't throw a rock at the window like this is the beginning of Drakes ""In My Feelings"" video to get her friends attention. Even worse, when she does get her attention and she comes outside the decide to talk right outside the house in hindsight.
The character and scene build up moves extremely fast throughout the film which is probably one of my biggest pet peeves. New characters would just pop up out of nowhere without a proper build up from where they came from or how they even came about.10-15 minutes into the movie Harriet already escaped and made it up North from her plantation in Maryland. Another 5 - 10 minutes into the film she's returned back to Maryland to free more slaves. All the scenes were rushed! I'm like damn, where are all the trials and tribulations? I know Harriet Tubman didn't just run up north and take the train back like it was nothing.Throughout the film Harriet faints a lot. There were times where she would just fall without a hint of it happening in the most awkward times of the film. ""Like oookkaayy that was off. Where is the fatigue? Where is the the sweat? She was just happily making a cake.""There was a time when Harriet is running away from slave owners and hides in a carriage. The slave owners weren't to far from her in the chase and acted as if they lost her in a field of dirt. Searching the dirt with dogs they had no clue that she hid in the most obvious place in the field. It was pretty clear that she would probably be somewhere near the barn and carriage (the only thing visible in the field)We even get the chance to see Harriett WALK through the Delaware River as if it were a creek. Once her and all the other slaves walk across the RIVER, their completely dry.I expected to see more realistic scenes on how it may have ACTUALLY went. I felt very disconnected from the real thing. I felt as if I was watching a movie. I did not feel as if I was in the movie with the characters. I felt as if the director was just rushing through the scenes so that she could get her paycheck, because she knew that a ton of people were going to come watch this movie regardless because we haven't seen a film on Harriet since the release of ""A Woman Called Moses"" in 1978. VVery fake! Very misleading. And I honestly wan't to question where the filmmakers got their facts? Bad for the psyche.",Harriet

310,evilmustardseed,Harriet Tubman Deserves Better,1,9 September 2020,"While a movie about the heroism and perseverance of Harriet Tubman is long overdue, this movie does absolutely no justice to her memory. The greatest fault of the movie is that it purports that Tubman was able to see the future and that is how she was able to free so many slaves. This is a travesty. Harriet Tubman was a real human being who engaged in real heroism. She is a true American hero. Clairvoyance and psychic powers are not real. To even imply that Harriet Tubman had supernatural abilities belittles her achievements.Tubman was a hero because everything she achieved was done with her own human wits, not because she was struck with a rock at the age of thirteen thereby cracking open her skull so the voice of God could come through clearly.Although she did have ""spells"" as they are referred to in the film, they were seizures that were sometimes accompanied by visions. She did attribute these visions to God and they strengthened her faith and resolve. However, the fact remains that NO ONE can see the future. NO ONE has psychic powers. Harriet Tubman was NOT a clairvoyant because she was a real person, a real hero, not a fantastical character from a comic book.This movie does Harriet Tubman a disservice and Kasi Lemmons and Gregory Allen Howard should be ashamed of how they represented one of the greatest American women in the history of this nation.",Harriet

313,reubenrasheed,Needs to be a three hour film,9,2 November 2019,"Harriet starts somewhat underdeveloped; it literally looks and feels like impressionistic art.By a third way in, it finds some legs. And it those legs I loved. Erivo's voice lowered and her movements were less girly-girl and gave strength and sense of command. She finds the character! The lines of dialogue and action picked up. The cinematography warmed up and I started to really get into it. It did end much to quickly and went into like a survey of her life.But what really drives this film is the supporting cast. Fiery emotion-filled eyes and passionate speak. I loved the dramatical license taken with Janelle's character and the faith-film aspect thrown in too. I mean who makes intuition and communication with G-d an actual supporting character. Janelle was hot and horrific beauty. Calloway's performance was funny and Oscar calibre.Bravo to the director and producers!People giving this one star obviously doesn't know how difficult to bring a big story like this one to life in two hours. It needs three! A true one star film is fear.com. Watch that and you'll have some gratitude. Most definitely recommend.I know Harriet forces its viewer to fill in the pieces. Her actual escape was too brief and at times looked like a walk at the beach. It thought some of the lighting/ production design could have more color and unsure of what mood was there. Acting at times lacked the depth and strength that Harriet had in real life. But there's enough in the second act to overturn this. Can't wait to buy the DVD!",Harriet

321,belle2264,Harriet Empowered Herself,9,1 February 2020,"I have seen this film twice. The first time was at the Middleburg Film Festival, where the Director spoke afterwards. What is unique about this movie? Its honesty and its focus. I cannot relate to the bad reviews at all. It is NOT a cartoon. It does NOT depict Harriet as a superhero. She suffered greatly. But the film focuses on the empowerment of Harriet, largely through her own bravery, rather than making her a one dimensional victim. She is a hero because she took risks and made choices that other characters did not. She felt that God was working through her to show that the slavery system could be beaten. But the slaveholders cited God too, so you see both sides.The other characters' choices not to run are explained and we understand them. How can you run with two small children and your ""mistress"" calling for you every minute? The horrific abuses of the slavery system are woven into the story, as motivators for escape and abolition, but in contrast to any other slavery film, the focus is not on helpless slaves, and this makes it powerful. It is also the first film depicting slavery that made me see the economic desperation of not-that-rich white slaveholders as a driver for their cruelty. One can feel what it is like being born into this system, told from childhood that other people belong to you and being widowed or orphaned by an inept debtor, with your main assets as slaves. You felt how this brought out the worst aspects of human character, especially with your neighbors behaving the same way. This subplot is very important, because it helps us to understand why the US had this system for so long and what it took to overcome it.",Harriet

It's all the more problematic because Comcast which bankrolled this film is currently embroiled in a lawsuit by Talk show personality Byron Allen because what you may not know is that Comcast is trying to chip away at the civil rights that Black American's have and if we don't collectively smarten up to what these corrupt organizations are doing, we will all quite literally be S*% up a creek just like our real Harriet was..""

THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME.,10,9 March 2020,"Several folks are criticking this movie due to its fictional base, but we must understand that the essence of films like this is not just to depict in verbatim what happened but deliver an experience which could take one back to feel what it was like to be in that era and this movie was able to do that so we shouldn't take that away from it. We need more films like this and the way to get to that is not by rubbishing great works like this.",Harriet
335,johnwhitted,Love the movie and accuracy!,10,1 November 2019,I'm surprised about the low ratings. This movie was terrific! It kept true to the history about Harriet Tubman. I never thought the movie was 2 hours because you are glued to your seat from the beginning to the end. The action was very well paced. Everyone in the theater enjoyed it. The movie can be enjoyed by all including children.,Harriet
336,jakemaxwel,Harriet is a must see!,9,16 November 2019,"I loved the movie. It was extremely well acted, written, etc. Loved the music. It was an integral part of the movie for me. I don't know about exact, historical accuracy, but I believe it captured the spirit of this amazing woman. Further, it shows the consequences of the cruelty of slavery on the everyday life of its victims. It wasn't easy to watch, but it was powerful. I highly recommend.",Harriet
337,seandoran,At Least Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Was Honest In Telling Us What It Was,5,7 June 2021,"I give it 5/10 though as this over the top dramatization of Harriet Tubman's life might have been the point, but if it was it shouldn't be called ""Harriet"" like it's the definitive account of her life.",Harriet
338,gtthaggard,Complete Fiction,1,3 November 2019,This movie found a way to disrespect the life of Harriet Tubman. The greatest threat to her in this movie was a black bounty hunter not the entire system of slavery sponsored by the government and the sadistic white slave owner loves her and is painted as a hero WTF! If you want to watch a movie that actually depicted what slavery was like go watch 12 years a slave.,Harriet
339,chassphne,I appreciate this movie,10,7 June 2020,I appreciate everything about it. Cynthia Ervio did a excellent job and I appreciate the opportunities they gave to many new actors as well. It surfaced and depthed well on how she frees slaves and share some of Harriet personal life. The movie was amazing!,Harriet
340,breyawalker-01719,Rewrite the story,10,5 November 2019,"Is film provides you with a new perspective of the story we've all heard. No longer do you have the sad slave narrative, Harriet allows the story to be rewritten and from the vantage point of freedom and ingenuity.",Harriet
341,punch-85453,I loved this movie,10,11 November 2019,"My mom and I went to see this movie last Tuesday. I would recommend my friends and coworkers to go see this movie. We went to see it at Potomac mills mall in Woodbridge, Virginia",Harriet
342,timcross-23599,"Agenda based, historically inaccurate.",1,13 November 2019,"The only redeeming feature of this piece of ""cinema"" is that a lot of money was spent to promote an anti, well watch the news.",Harriet
343,deborabuerk,Great story needing to be told,10,22 March 2020,Excellently researched. Powerful acting telling the story of the Underground Railroad. Deserved the Oscar nominations it received.,Harriet
344,sammytherooster,"Harriet deserves more than ""Harriet"" can deliver",1,25 January 2020,"To say this film is a sad depiction of an amazing hero in American history is an understatement! Despite the fact that it is absolutely filled with inaccuracies, it has an overall look and feel of a Hallmark or Lifetime movie; it is certainly not a picture that should have ever found it's way to the silver screen!
I was truly hoping this film would make it into my film library. Instead its absurdity has caused me to write my inaugural IMDB review!
The actors clearly gave their all, but with a poorly written script, jam-packed with cliches, and an amateurish level of direction, their was little opportunity for their performances to truly shine.
This should have been a gritty film, filled with amazing imagery and an overwhelming sense of anguish that made me dwell on the content for weeks. However, I'm now left feeling like there's a void in my soul that was first created by a much-anticipated movie experience that will now remain vacant until the Coen brothers hopepefully realize their talents are greatly needed to tell this story the way it deserves!
Oh, Ethan and Joel, hear my plea! You may be the only cure for my soul hole!",Harriet
345,keyslaurenl,lies,1,4 November 2019,This movie is based on all lies and not a representation for black slaves that is why the cast is not african american slave bloodline,Harriet
346,edone-26428,Harriott,8,7 February 2020,"The story of an extraordinary life, I did not know much about harriott tubman prior to seeing this film. The story was great the acting was superb. I enjoyed this film.",Harriet
347,imhonde,Excellent,10,26 October 2019,"I saw a screening of the film Harriet last night, and was riveted to my seat. I don't generally like to see movies about slavery with a group, because I get too emotional and/or too angry about the violence against African Americans portrayed in these types of movies. There is some violence in this movie, however it was more subtle and restrained than in most movies of this genre. This movie is one that you can enjoy with others. We were clapping and cheering and at times, holding our collective breaths as we rooted for Harriet and others in the film. This was an excellent human portrayal of this great conductor of the Underground Railroad. As I watched, I was thinking/wondering if any of my ancestors had escaped slavery, or if like so many others, were they too 'afraid to run'.One of the reoccurring themes in Harriet's life, as it is portrayed in the movie, was her faith in God, and the belief that God was with her, guiding her and ordering her steps. I really enjoyed this aspect of the movie, as it reminds us that with God is with us too, and that all things are possible with him. This is definitely a movie that you will want to see with others and make sure that your older children and grandchildren see too!",Harriet
348,rajivrambais,Fear is Your Enemy!,9,7 December 2020,"My headline is why this movie is special. Frankly, based on the people with ratings of 5 stars or lower, they are spoiled.They didn't appreciate the movie for its strengths. After all, it was about a white man with a creepy laugh who painted himself and killed his mother #joker.",Harriet
