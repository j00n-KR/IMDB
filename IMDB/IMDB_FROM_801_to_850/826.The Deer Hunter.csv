0,MartinHafer,An exceptional film...and with some indications of Cimino's later undoing...,9,8 December 2009,"THE DEER HUNTER is an extraordinary film--there's no denying that. However, I looked at this film from a slightly different perspective than many, as I first had a chance to watch director Cimino's mega-epic, HEAVEN'S GATE (one of Hollywood's biggest money-losers ever). I am glad I saw this later film first, as it forced me to look for the seeds of the director's downfall--even in his greatest triumph, the five-time Oscar winner, THE DEER HUNTER. Despite THE DEER HUNTER being considered a classic and one of the great films of the 1970s, it was not without minor faults--faults that would become much, much more apparent later in HEAVEN'S GATE.The biggest problem was pacing and editing but the film was so good that you could excuse it. Some parts of the film were long and brilliantly done. The scenes in Vietnam were, if anything, too short--but very, very compelling. The scenes leading up to Vietnam (such as the wedding), however, went on way too long--seeming to place about equal emphasis on this rather banal and unimportant part of the film as the later and much more important part. Editing down the first hour a bit and perhaps even adding some more footage of Vietnam (or leaving it as it was) instead would have been a good thing. Additionally, having the characters act LESS like obnoxious jerks at the beginning would have helped as well--the characters didn't grab you right out of the gate. Both problems were significantly worse in HEAVEN'S GATE--the prologue went on for what seems like days and the characters were even more obnoxious! And, while THE DEER HUNTER comes in at a hefty 182 minutes, this long and slow pacing became interminably long in the followup film--clocking in at an astronomical 219 minutes!! In other words, Cimino only followed his own pattern from THE DEER HUNTER in the next film but expanded it even further--probably the result of his own success he felt he was onto something. However, these complaints do NOT say I am knocking THE DEER HUNTER--I am just saying that these tiny complaints became serious problems in HEAVEN'S GATE.As far as the good in the THE DEER HUNTER goes, the acting is amazing, the direction (though slow) was very good, the music terrific and moving and the film grabs your attention. While I was not quite as bowled over by it as some, you cannot reasonably deny it is a standout film--even with pacing issues and any complaints about the ubiquity of Russian Roulette in Vietnam (geez...what are the chances of TWO games like this or a Russian Roulette league--especially since many doubt that such goings on ever happened in the first place) or there being an elk in Pennsylvania (which, by the way, looks like the Rocky Mountains--which it actually is and 2500 miles from where the hunt in the film was supposed to be). A must-see for anyone who considers themselves to be a film aficionado. Just be aware that the violence is intense and disturbing and the language is amazingly spicy for a 1970s film.",The Deer Hunter
1,TheLittleSongbird,Uneven but often very impressive,7,4 July 2017,"Considering the cast, the critical acclaim and accolades 'The Deer Hunter' garnered, and still does garner, part of me was expecting much more. It is a long way from a bad film, in fact it's good and often very impressive, but it's also uneven in places.'The Deer Hunter' is by some way director Michael Cimino's best film, and it contains his best ever directing. That's saying a good deal, considering that only a few years later he would go on to direct the notorious flop 'Heaven's Gate' and his career never really recovered. 'The Deer Hunter' is considered by some one of the finest Vietnam films (don't quite agree, to me there are far better examples), but it is also perhaps the most controversial. Either viewpoint is very easy to understand.Despite its many impressive, outstanding even, elements, 'The Deer Hunter' is uneven. It is a bit too long (and no before anybody sneers, there have been films of similar length and even longer that still manage to be great films, a few among the best ever made), and would have been solved by tighter editing and a little less time on the lengthy wedding sequence, which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed.Parts are disjointed too, with some abrupt scene shifts and a heavy-handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against the rest of the film. There are deficiencies in the sound quality on top of all this.On the other hand, editing aside, 'The Deer Hunter' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography is quite magnificent and the attention to detail in the settings and the rest of the production both sumptuous and rich in atmosphere, the authenticity also remarkable. The music haunts the mind and is very beautiful, the mournful guitar theme unforgettable.Cimino is at his best in the director's chair, while the script provokes thought and the story is often incredibly powerful and moving. The highlight is the justly acclaimed Russian Roulette sequence, which today is genuinely harrowing and will stay with you forever.Robert De Niro has seldom been more restrained and gives an affecting performance. Even better is Christopher Walken, who has never reduced me to tears before and he really wrenches the heart here, making his character a compellingly real one and the most relatable one. John Savage, John Cazale (in his last film before his ultimely death) and a young Meryl Streep are sterling in support.In summary, uneven film but often very impressive with much to admire. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Deer Hunter
2,bkoganbing,One Shot,9,12 December 2007,"I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother's family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He's growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he's in and can't bring himself to come home.Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she's so totally immersed in her role and her role's ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven's Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino's career plummeted and never really got back on track.28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn't really about the Vietnam War. It's about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.And this review is dedicated to those that serve.",The Deer Hunter
3,Leofwine_draca,Traumatic exploration of the POW experience,9,2 November 2011,"This epic-length film looks at the effects of the Vietnam war on the working-class Americans who signed up to fight in it – and once it gets going, it becomes one of the most harrowing war movies ever shot. Instead of adopting the gung-ho heroic approach to the conflict that the later '80s cheese-fests did, THE DEER HUNTER emphasises realism throughout. It takes well over an hour before the action even moves to Vietnam, and that time is usefully taken up with building the characters of a group of male friends.Of the group, Robert De Niro takes the headline role and it's one of his straightest performances yet. His character internalises all of his feelings, so subtlety is key and it pays off: this is a De Niro free of artifice and grandeurising, just focusing on playing an ordinary guy. Of course, Christopher Walken bags the limelight with his unforgettable portrait of a man deranged by the horrendous experiences he suffers, and with good reason: it's easily the highlight of his entire career.Once the story shifts – very abruptly – to Vietnam, the film delivers its ace – the Russian roulette sequence. It's absolutely distressing, impossible to watch without flinching, and contains more unbearable suspense in five minutes of screen time than in a dozen murder mysteries. Later, things become even more interesting as the film explores the different levels of trauma wrought by the war – from the ""merely"" physical to the exhaustingly emotional. It's a heartfelt, heartbreaking exploration of post-traumatic stress and pretty much the final word on the subject.",The Deer Hunter
4,SnoopyStyle,great war movie without the big war action,9,30 January 2016,"It's 1967. Best friends Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), Nick Chebotarevich (Christopher Walken) work at the local mill in an industrial Pennsylvanian town in a Russian-American community. Steven marries his girlfriend Angela pregnant with another man's baby. Mike is in love with Nick's girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). Nick asks Linda to marry him. The friends are heading off to the patriotic Vietname war. Mike promises Nick not to leave him there. In Vietnam, the men are captured by the Viet Cong and forced to participate in a Russian Roulette game.This is a great war home-front movie. One cannot beat De Niro and Walken and Streep. The detailed extended Michael Cimino style is effective in giving a lived-in feel to the movie. The Russian Roulette is the most controversial aspect. I think it is the shock that sends this to another level. It encapsulates the desperation and the randomness of war. It is the perfect metaphor for war.",The Deer Hunter
5,Prismark10,The Deer Hunter,8,25 April 2020,"When this movie was released. The popular joke was. I went to see The Deer Hunter in the cinemas, three hours in and nothing happened. There was still another four hours left!When you find yourself watching a movie where Christopher Walken is playing the most normal character at the start, you know you will be heading to some difficult places.It is obvious that Director Michael Cimino was obsessed with The Godfather. The Deer Hunter has a long segment featuring a wedding at the start of the movie. The characters are of Russian heritage instead of Italian. Two of the main cast were in The Godfather films.The wedding scene is used to establish the Pennsylvania steel mill community and the three friends. Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro) is a bit of a loner and a hot head. Steven Pushkov (John Savage) is the young man who is getting married. Nick Chevotarevich (Christopher Walken) is the warm hearted one that everyone likes. He is going out with Linda (Meryl Streep) a woman that Mike also has his eye on.All three men are due to go to Vietnam. When they get there, all three will be captured by the Vietcong and face traumas that will change their lives.Surprisingly the Vietnam combat scenes are brief. There is the famous shot of De Niro with a flamethrower. More infamous is Cimino portraying the Vietcong as savages. One soldier throws a grenade in a bunker with women and children inside.The film was controversial at the time due to the Russian roulette scenes. It is apparent that this is a metaphor for the madness of war and the mental damage of the characters.Cimino wanted to make a modern epic and he succeeded. The film won the best picture Oscar. The authorship of the movie was mired in contention. It has four credited writers and this contributed to the choppiness in the story when the film moves to Vietnam and onwards from there.Like Apocalypse Now which would be released a year later. The Deer Hunter is not strongly anti war even though the characters are damaged by their time in Vietnam. This could be due to the fact the Vietnam war only ended four years earlier. It was still a raw wound. It was not until Oliver Stone's Platoon when the Vietnam war was shown in a more critical light and only because Stone fought in the war.The treatment of the Vietnamese is racism on the level of native American tribes in many of those old westerns where they were stock villains. The accusation of racism followed Cimino when he made Year of the Dragon in 1985.There were some flaws in the story. It was never clear why the three joined up especially as Mike and Nick are older characters.How did Nick know that Steven was in a veteran hospital when Mike had difficulties finding this out. This looks like a flaw further compounded when Mike next sees Nick. By this time Nick has totally metamorphosised who does even acknowledge Mike.I watched The Deer Hunter as a teenager, I managed to rent it on video when I was not yet old enough for an 18 rated film. I should not had bothered, it premiered on television two months later. I watched it again over 30 years later with a cleaned up print.It does stands up well. There was a lot of detail in the Pennsylvania scenes, the extensive use of location shooting. Actors hungry for a meaty script. What a difference in De Niro from here to Dirty Grandpa.One of the weak link was the shallow use of female characters, two of them are literal punchbags. Dare I say it, maybe another actor could had played Stan. I noticed in my first viewing John Cazale looked gaunt and slightly different from the Godfather films. Now watching him in the knowledge that he died before the film was released, he just does not look well and was also too old to be in the main characters close circle of friends.",The Deer Hunter
6,kosmasp,Hunting & surviving,10,24 May 2020,"Men will be men - until they go to war that is. Then they will change - or rather the war will change them. A very fine foreshadowing of where things can go, can be seen at a bar scene, when De Niro is offended by a former soldier - as if he was disrespecting him. But soon enough, while he may not remember the incident itself, he will experience something that will make him appreciate the mind set of that person.Having said that, this movie is considered a classic, running just under three hours. Which makes it clear that you should not scrutinize movies for their length, because there always have been longer movies, not just recent Blockbusters. It is about the quality of the movies and it is apparent here. But it is not just the script but also the casting. Yes De Niro (naked for a second or two again, after 1900) is the top dog, but you also have ""Fredo"" (who was ill and died shortly after the movie was shot of cancer - no pun intended), but also Savage and Walken, not to mention Meryl Streep! What a cast indeed.There are a lot of subtle things and maybe a lot of new things for some (being orthodox the wedding even if Russian and not Greek, felt eerily familiar for me, but others may be surprised by some customs) - there is especially a lot of violence. This is raw and gritty, rough and dirty. This will not be for everyone, because this is not shiny and entertaining, but it is really good.",The Deer Hunter
7,classicsoncall,"""You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about"".",9,12 June 2011,"My first inclination upon considering this film is that's it's a cinematic masterpiece, confirmed by it's five Oscar wins and additional nominations in various categories. However even while watching, there are scenes and events that require a certain suspension of disbelief for the story to progress. Having never served in the military, I can only surmise about the possibility of three hometown friends going into the service together who wind up consistently running into each other over the course of a war thousands of miles from home. It begins with the helicopter drop a little over an hour into the story, when Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage) come upon Michael (Robert De Niro) as he's taking out a Vietcong terrorizing a South Vietnamese village. The same holds true for Michael discovering Nick in a Saigon gambling den where the fictional Russian roulette game takes place. These needle in a haystack coincidences bother me in a picture, even though they often seem necessary for a film to tell it's story.It's interesting to read the reviews of others on this board weighing in on the first hour of the story. For some viewers, nothing of consequence happens at all that has any impact on the picture's conclusion. Actually, I find the setting and interactions of the principal players as important to establishing the feel of small town America of the late Sixties/early Seventies. Three young men from Clairton, Pennsylvania are about to enter the Army shortly following Steven's wedding day. The men are accorded an understated place of honor at the reception hall where their poster size pictures are prominently displayed. The circle of friends around the principals routinely ponder whether they'll make it back and in what condition. These discussions of patriotism and loyalty exemplify what three decades later a presidential candidate would describe as 'bitter clingers to their guns and religion'.The 'one shot' theme is given prominence during the deer hunt after the wedding, as Michael reinforces for Nick his conviction that a man must prove himself with discipline and finality. That theme is reinforced in the Russian roulette scenarios and most critically, when Michael's frustration leads him to put a gun to Stan's (John Cazale) head in the latter part of the picture. What if, just what if there was a bullet in the chamber when Michael pulled the trigger. The idea that every bullet fired has consequences in setting off a new chain of events is a powerful concept, and reaches it's utter finality when Michael witnesses Nick's death and is unable to prevent it. One could argue that Michael might have been the catalyst for Nick's death by showing up when he did, but here again you have one of those untenable plot points, whereby Nick survives as long as he did by betting the odds against killing himself.Which brings me to one more point, and a major plot hole. Michael gets the clue he needs to locate Nick by visiting Steven at the VA Hospital, where Steven shows him the money that's arriving in the mail from overseas. Yet when Michael encounters Nick in Saigon for the first time, Nick is so shell shocked and drug dazed that he fails to recognize him - 'Michael who?' For me, this begs the question, how would Nick ever have learned where Steven ended up following his release, much less send him his roulette winnings on a regular basis.Still, even with these pitfalls, I find the picture to be a directorial achievement, particularly for being the first Vietnam War film a mere three years following the end of that conflict. Yet the film isn't so much a war picture as it is a story of the human dynamics that are affected by war and it's consequences. For that reason, I think the movie will be watched and discussed for a long time as it holds it's place as one of cinema's best.",The Deer Hunter
8,gavin6942,"Great, But Missed Its Mark on Me",8,7 May 2010,"This film had long intrigued me, mostly because of Christopher Walken and somewhat because of Robert DeNiro. But sadly, despite the film's greatness, it just did not hit me in the gut. I'm going to respond to another viewer's thoughts: ""I think the reason most people don't like this movie is that it is unnecessarily long... I could have done without the hour long wedding scene, but the reason I really don't like it is that it served little purpose... The Godfather wedding is almost as long, but it deeply informs you about the characters... watching the Deer Hunter wedding was like watching someone's wedding video, and it didn't tell you much about the characters... there are many scenes like this in this movie"" Now, I tend to agree. The wedding, which takes up like the first third of the film, was not an effective way to get me to care about the characters. In fact, it caused me to get bored early on, and the war scenes had to un-bore me. Luckily, those are really good. But yes, the film as a whole is long for no good reason, and rather than being suspenseful, becomes tedious. An edit cutting 20-30 minutes out would have done wonders for me.And don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with long films. Three hours is fine, sometimes even four hours (""Das Boot"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") is enjoyable. This one just didn't live up to the reputation, and I don't think it allowed DeNiro or Walken to shine. I expect some day this film will fade from ""classic"" to ""obscure"".",The Deer Hunter
9,lee_eisenberg,"Disturbing, if flawed.",7,24 February 2006,"Nineteen seventy-eight saw the release of the first two movies that dealt seriously with the Vietnam War: ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"". The latter portrays some Russian-American friends working in a factory and going hunting before shipping off to Vietnam.I guess that this movie's biggest problem is its approach to the war in general. Whereas ""Apocalypse Now"" directly condemned the US occupation of Vietnam, this one mainly focuses on the Americans getting killed there. Also, when it came out, there were complaints about how it portrayed the North Vietnamese: cruelly taking the Americans prisoner and making them play Russian Roulette.As long as one understands the approach that this movie is taking, then it's good. One really interesting aspect is the contrast between the children and their immigrant parents: while the parents remain very religious - and the men drunk - the children are getting very much into popular culture and such things. Overall, a good movie as long as you understand it, although I would have given ""Coming Home"" Best Picture. Great performances from Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, George Dzundza, and John Savage.",The Deer Hunter
10,jboothmillard,The Deer Hunter,10,13 July 2005,"Many people consider this one of the great war films, it might not have the biggest amount of war in it, but it is certainly a great film from Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Michael Cimino. Basically it is all about four friends, and how they are all affected (in whatever way) by the Vietnam war, whether in it or not. The four Pennsylvanian steel factory worker friends: Michael Vronsky (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro), Stan 'Stosh' (The Godfather, Part II's John Cazale), Steven (John Savage) and Nick (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Christopher Walken) are dedicated to joining the war in Vietnam, and at Steven's marriage to pregnant bride Angela (Rutanya Alda), the wedding party also serves as a farewell before Michael, Steven and Nick depart. Then of course an explosion marks their time in Vietnam, and the horrors to come, as they are imprisoned by the Vietcong army. Steven is still in a cage, but Michael and nick are forced to play Russian roulette against each other (the most memorable and notable scene of the whole film, and two more games follow later). They manage to escape, and the rest of the film sees them separate, and we see mainly seeing trying to recuperate, while Steven is handicapped having lost his leg, and Nick is still in Vietnam, leaving his girlfriend Linda (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep, in her first major role) worrying. Of course Michael goes after him, and Nick is still playing Russian roulette, sending the reward to Steven, and tragically trying to bring him home Michael witnesses Nick losing, and the film ends with a funeral, a short song, and a toast to him. Also starring Basic Instinct's George Dzundza as John, Chuck Aspegren as Axel, Shirley Stoler as Steven's Mother, Pierre Segui as Julien, Mady Kaplan as Axel's Girl and Amy Wright as Bridesmaid. It may be long, but it is certainly worth it for the great performances (notably Walken), the Russian roulette scenes, and the wonderful guitar music by Stanley Myers. It won the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

11,BA_Harrison,A bloated bore.,3,15 June 2017,"Three friends, Mike Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), and Nick Chebotarevich (Christopher Walken), find their lives affected in different ways by the horrors of war.50 minutes, give or take a few: that's how long the opening wedding sequence takes in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. It starts with the preparation, followed by the ceremony itself, and finishes at the reception where there is much drinking and dancing. It's about as much fun as being at a real wedding where you know none of the guests (other than your partner) and are forced to remain sober because you're the one doing the driving home. You want it all to end as soon as possible, but your other half insists on just one more drink (and another, and another) while she chats with all of her friends.Having bored the viewer to death with the wedding, Cimino then proceeds to numb the senses further with some dreary hunting scenes in the mountains, after which the film finally cuts to Nam for a little war action. Here we are treated to the infamous Russian roulette torture sequence, which is arguably the highlight of the film, both suspenseful and terrifying. But don't worry, we're soon back to the drudgery as the main characters escape capture, Mike returning to his steelworks hometown, Nick remaining in Saigon (to earn cash by taking part in Russian roulette games in seedy gambling dens), and Steven recuperating in a veterans hospital. Eventually, Mike decides to find Nicky and bring him home, which he does—with a bullet in his head, his luck having finally run out.Winner in 5 categories at the 1979 Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Film Editing (seriously?), and Best Sound.

12,moonspinner55,It affects people on the deepest of levels...but is it really interested in searching the souls of these men or in being a treatise in brutality?,6,12 March 2010,"Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" is aching for a battle: even in the interminable wedding sequence, wine spills like blood. Though it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film is so puffed-up with a grisly sort of foul-mouthed machismo, one doesn't react to it as much as repel from it (much like John Boorman's ""Deliverance""). The movie isn't edited with precision, and yet it still stuns with its gripping depictions of savagery and man's inhumanity toward man. Unfortunately, the underlying point of the film seems to get lost in its general assemblage; both the editing and Cimino's direction are not as sharp one might hope (particularly in the final 45 minutes). Three men from a blue-collar town in Pennsylvania serve harrowing time in Vietnam, while life on the homefront seems repressed under a constant cloud of uncertainty and hopelessness. Cimino grinds the audience down, not with the intermittent scenes of violence but with the anticipation of those moments. It's a bludgeoning slab of filmmaking. There isn't much mystery in Cimino's approach; however, when a sensitive moment is called for, the director certainly delivers. Performances and technical aspects are at the highest level (which causes viewers to react, like it or not), but this isn't art any more than it is an anti-war film. **1/2 from ****",The Deer Hunter
13,paul_haakonsen,A powerful story...,7,27 December 2015,"""The Deer Hunter"" is the type of movie that you can watch again and again with some time in between. And even though you might know the story by heart, then it quite well-told by director Michael Cimino.The story is about a tightly knitted group of friends living in an industrial city in Pennsylvania. With a wedding just around the corner and a draft to the military service to do a tour of duty in Vietnam, things are changing for the friends.The film takes place in America and Vietnam, and both sides of the story do have individual strengths and weaknesses. The American story is a solid story about friendship and love, while the Vietnam story is about camaraderie and perseverance.Aside from the really well-told storyline, then the movie also has some really impressive names on the cast list, which includes Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep. And in my opinion it is the three aforementioned male actors who really carried the movie, and they did so phenomenally.""The Deer Hunter"" is a has lots of depths and layers to both storyline and characters alike. And it really feels like something that was taken out of real life, because director Michael Cimino really had an eye for detail and realism.I can't claim to have found much enjoyment in the music that was used in the movie. But then again I watch movies for the visual experience not the audio experience. Of course, I do enjoy a good music score for a movie, but since I can't remember the music from ""The Deer Hunter"", then it wasn't outstanding enough to make an impression on me.Despite being from 1978, then ""The Deer Hunter"" is a movie that still holds it right by today's means and standards, and it is well worth watching even today.",The Deer Hunter
14,dbdumonteil,to call it masterpiece is to state the obvious,10,15 December 2006,"Of the first two American films about the Vietnam war with a priceless artistic weight, ""the Deer Hunter"" wins hands down over ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) although Francis Ford Coppola's work is very potent too.But would it be judicious to pigeonhole Michael Cimino's work in the category of the war movie? Unlike Coppola's visual nightmare, only the central part takes place in Vietnam and the filmmaker barely shoots one fight sequence before Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Stevie (John Savage) are prisoners of the enemy and are forced to play Russian roulette in the notorious unbearable scene. Actually ""the Deer Hunter"" is a film straddling two movie genres: the war movie and the social drama. Rather than shooting a political film, Cimino chose to represent us the deadly impact this nightmarish war had on an American community whose hopes and values disappeared.Dividing his work in three parts: before, during, after and thanks to symbolical images, scenes or even eloquent details, Cimino used and honed his own cinematographic language to set out his stalls and the result can only command respect and admiration. Each sequence could be separately taken and carefully studied like the representation of the humdrum but reassuring living standards of the blue-collars with their everyday rituals (Cimino's obsession with rites and customs) revolving around factory, bar, friends and hunting (you have to admire the startling contrast between the dirty little town and the gorgeous, wild landscapes). Archetypal sequences that epitomize life and it reaches its height in the famous, unusually long wedding sequence. Perhaps Cimino wanted to stretch this sequence to make his characters take advantage of this rapture moment. But even during this state of bliss that lives inside them, the imminent tragedy ominously lurks: Mike and Nick gently laugh at an officer who remains dumb and when Stevie and his wife have to drink in a dish, some drops fall on her wedding dress. This sequence also epitomizes the polar opposite to the sequence of the Russian roulette in which death is just around the corner. After the war when Mike comes back to the small town, he's completely altered. Before, a devotee of deer hunting; after his traumatizing experience, he can't kill one. He's unable to talk about about what he went through and for his sidekicks, the experience of a war like this one is incomprehensible. Cimino eschews classical, predictable storytelling and hasn't recourse to psychological study. Nearly everything occurs in gestures and looks while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs. Besides, during the whole movie the topic of the war is barely mentioned by the characters. A lyrical whiff blows on the film, dovetailed by Cimino's astounding directing.Cimino was consumed with ambition and went at it hammer and tongs to get his crew completely involved in his project. He was hard on his actors (Robert De Niro has often said that ""the Deer Hunter"" was his most grueling role to date) and was obsessed with absolute control. But the efforts weren't vain at all and gave a heartfelt, invaluable yardstick in war movie, even American cinema which reached the streets when America rose from its ruins. It was also the beginning of the end for Cimino, a filmmaker ahead of his time and on the fringe of cinematographic trends.",The Deer Hunter
15,Quinoa1984,"Not the best film of 1978, but close",8,17 June 2006,"The Deer Hunter was one of the group of films that, in a sense, got me into more mature dramas and other types of films almost a decade ago. I remember liking the Deer Hunter, particularly the bulk of the scenes in Vietnam and of Walken in his iconic role as the Russian roulette doomed Nick, even though the wedding scene did seem to 'drag' for me. But watching it again I'm struck by how the grandiose nature of the picture, all of the deep and sorrowful emotions let out through the toll of war on these men, still holds up for me. And the wedding scene, upon a second look, is not as overlong as I thought but a rather brave example of how a real wedding goes on in all of its celebration and bittersweet moments (the scene at the bar where the soldier says 'f*** it' is memorable for me). The Vietnam scenes are likely the best in the film, with a heap of horrific suspense with bits of sick humor (if one were to look for it). Later, there are the roulette scenes, but also contemplative ones with De Niro in the woods, and maybe the most heartbreaking of the scenes with John Savage's Steve at the hospital. It's a film that did deservedly give Michael Cimino his (at first) big reputation for creating a touching, violent epic story of the toll of that most recent war of the time. If it's not as great as the other Vietnam film of the year, Coming Home, it might be because there are some scenes that don't work as well, even with co-stars like John Cazale (sadly his last film) and Meryl Streep. But the amount of things that do click in the Deer Hunter do make it one of those possible 'essentials' for the baby-boomers; it's also, as well, a jolt of a scar war movie at times.",The Deer Hunter
16,michaelRokeefe,Intense war drama. Friends experience P.O.W. camp.,7,24 March 2001,"Most films about the Viet Nam War are loud action movies. This three hour plus project of Michael Cimino does not come right out for or against the conflict in Nam. What we have is the rituals of home in contrast to the rigors of war. The lives of three men are altered forever after surviving gut twisting games of Russian Roulette in a P.O.W. camp.My only personal complaint is that the first hour depicting mostly a wedding party is way too long. Why not trim this portion down to maybe fifteen or twenty minutes? I suppose this was to set the mood contrasting home with war.Robert De Niro plays Michael the hero. John Savage comes home crippled. And Christopher Walken remains in Nam leading a very strange existence. Of course, Mr. Walken's middle name is ""Strange"". De Niro and Walken were outstanding in this movie. Also in the cast are Meryl Streep and George Dzundza. John Cazale and Chuck Aspegren play characters that are irritating and obnoxious as Hell.This movie was bestowed with much critical acclaim. Oscars went to Walken and Cimino. Also Oscars for best picture, editing and sound.",The Deer Hunter
17,sunwarrior13,The Greatest Film About Friendship And War's Effects On People,10,27 September 2012,"The Deer Hunter is a drama film directed and co-written by Michael Cimino about a trio of Russian American steel worker friends and their infantry service in the Vietnam War. It stars Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, Meryl Streep and George Dzundza. The story takes place in Clairton, a small working class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh and then in Vietnam, somewhere in the woodland and in Saigon.It is one of the many films about dealing with the Vietnam War that was both renowned for its tough portrayal of the war's effect on people particularly those belonging to the working class group and friendship.Mike,Nick and Stan celebrate the wedding of their friend Steve and go on a final deer hunt before the men leave for Vietnam. Mike treats hunting as a test of skill, lecturing Stan about the value of ""one shot"" deer slaying and brushing off Nick's urgings to appreciate nature's beauty. As Mike ruminates post-hunt, the screenplay cuts to the horror of Vietnam, where the men are captured by Vietcong soldiers who force Mike and Nick to play Russian roulette for their amusement. Mike turns the game to his advantage so they can escape captivity, but the men are permanently scarred by the episode. Steve loses his legs. Nick vanishes in the Saigon Russian roulette parlors. Mike returns alone to Clairton a changed man, as he rejects the killing of the deer hunt and finds solace with Nick's old girlfriend Linda. Disgusted by the antics of his male cohorts at home, Mike decides to bring Steve back from a veterans' hospital, and he returns to Saigon to find Nick. As Saigon falls, Mike discovers how far gone Nick is and the survivors gather in Clairton for a funeral breakfast.This is one of the greatest films ever made about friendship and the personal impact of war. It's hardly a conventional battle film but its depiction of war on an intimate scale packs a devastatingly dramatic punch. Cimino may be manipulating our emotions with masterful skill, but he does it in a way that stirs the soul and pinches our collective nerves with graphic, high-intensity scenes of men under life-threatening duress. To the viewer, they become unforgettably intense rites of passage for the best friends who may survive or perish during their Vietnam tour through a tropical landscape of hell. Back home, their loved ones must cope with the war's domestic impact. Its greatness is enhanced by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances especially from De Niro,Streep and Walken. Overall,the film achieves a rare combination of epic storytelling and intimate,heart-rending drama.",The Deer Hunter

19,Theo Robertson,Overlong And Overrated,6,19 August 2004,"THE DEER HUNTER was a movie I'd heard about ever since it was released in 1978 . It received its first broadcast on British television in 1984 and since I was on holiday via the penal system I never got to see it . I did later ask my friends what they thought of it and they all discussed the bits involving torture by the Vietnamese on their American prisoners which made me thankful that I wasn't doing time in a Vietnamese jail . It wasn't until 1988 that I finally saw the movie and was bitterly disappointed and bored in equal measure The problem with THE DEER HUNTER is with the script , it's shapeless and unfocused . Can anyone explain to me what the most important part of the story is ? Is it the wedding scene ? Is it the deer hunting scene ? Is it the prison scene ? is it ... ? I know it's difficult to write a script . In fact I once wrote a script entitled SOLITUDE a story of war and how it contrasts with peace which was set in the UK and Former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s . All the above criticisms made about Deric Washburn's script could certainly apply to mine ( In fact I describe it as "" A British version of THE DEER HUNTER ) , but unlike SOLITUDE the script for THE DEER HUNTER was produced and it's amazing the studio or director Michael Ciminio didn't sit Mr Washburn down and say "" Look this script is far too long , we can do without a good sixty pages that add nothing to the plot . Bring us back a script of one hundred and forty pages maximum "" !!!! SPOILERS !!!!There's another problem with the script and that's the level of coincidence involved when the action switches to 'Nam . Nick ( Walken ) and Steven ( Savage ) disembark from a copter where they meet their old buddy Michael ( De Niro ) . What's the chances of that happening in real life ? It should also be pointed out that the three characters were drafted into the army at the same time but that now Michael is an elite Green Beret while Nick and Steven are still draftee infantrymen . Didn't Green Berets have to serve a certain amount of time in the army before they could apply to become special forces ? I'm thinking if Michael was special forces Nick and Steven would have completed their military service . This introductory sequence also seems to have been heavily edited so much that it doesn't make much sense . But back to the coincidences .... After being captured by the VC South Vietnamese and American prisoners play Russian roulette that ends with Steven being imprisoned in a bamboo cage and Michael and Nick being the remaining contestants in the Russian roulette sweepstake . Unlikely enough but then they play with a revolver that has three bullets , they play several times and never shoot themselves once , the revolver only seems to work when they point it at their VC guards . Believe me there comes a time when coincidence gives way to unlikely farce There are some plus points to the movie such as the acting and seeing a movie where De Niro and Walken rising above material to put in truly great performances makes me very nostalgic . There's also a lot of little interesting stories surrounding the making of the film ( See the trivia page on the left ) but THE DEER HUNTER is very far from being a great movie far less being "" The best Vietnam war movie "" . You really do have to wonder how well APOCALYPSE NOW would have been received by the voters of the Oscars if it came out a year earlier THE DEER HUNTER gets six out of ten",The Deer Hunter
20,Hey_Sweden,Hits its audience hard.,9,12 August 2018,"An epic film about both friendship, and the tragic effects that stressful experiences can have on the mind, ""The Deer Hunter"" would have to be considered the true magnum opus of the late director Michael Ciminos' career. It brilliantly captures the feel of a small working-class town (Clairton) in Pennsylvania, and the camaraderie among a tight-knit group of buddies.It's divided into three parts: their lives before, during, and after their tours of duty in Vietnam. It's a very long but engrossing picture that takes characters and viewers alike on a very emotional journey. It's sensitive, beautifully acted, and extremely well shot in widescreen by Vilmos Zsigmond.Robert De Niro (Michael), John Cazale (Stan), John Savage (Steven), Christopher Walken (Nick), George Dzundza (John), and Chuck Aspegren (Axel) are the friends in question, and at no time do they not feel like real people. Real, flawed, but compelling people whom you really come to love by the end of the picture. Steven and Nick have definitely been shattered by their time in 'Nam, leading to some heartbreaking moments. Indeed, Walken does some of the finest acting of his career, and his Supporting Actor Oscar win was merited. Meryl Streep also shines as Nicks' girlfriend, distraught when for a period of time he seems to disappear into thin air.As has been said, this is not really a film *about* the Vietnam War, and one shouldn't let their political inclinations affect the way they view what is ultimately an interesting character study. One review was correct in saying that these could have been any small-town characters struggling to get by during any time of war.Walken and Savage contribute the standout turns, but this is also a nice showcase for character players like Dzundza, Rutanya Alda (as Stevens' bride), Shirley Stoler (as his mom), and Joe Grifasi. Sadly, poor Cazale was dying of cancer during production and he passed away before he could even see the finished film. Roy Scheider had originally been cast as Michael, but walked off the film after major creative differences. Still contractually bound to Universal, this is why he ended up having to do ""Jaws 2"".Sometimes intense, and sometimes harrowing, this may demand a fair amount of your time, but the rewards are substantial.Nine out of 10.",The Deer Hunter
21,preppy-3,"Boring, historically inaccurate and FAR too long",1,2 September 2010,"Story about three buddies (played by Robert DeNiro, John Savage and Christopher Walken) going off to Vietnam. They're all gung ho about going and aren't prepared for what they experience. They all return home--one mentally affected, one physically handicapped and one dead.This came out in 1978 and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. It was one of the few movies that dealt with Vietnam realistically (somewhat). It also really hit a lot of Vietnam vets and young guys hard. A friend of mine went to see it and after it was over he was in the mens room and saw 4 guys in their 20s crying nonstop. I saw it around that time. I was in high school and was bored silly. I figured at the time I was too young to appreciate it. I saw it years later and was STILL bored.For starters--it's too long--3 hours. The wedding sequence at the beginning goes on and on and ON. You learn nothing more about the characters than you could have in about 10 minutes. Even after they return home it moves slowly. The Russian roulette sequences (which were VERY hotly debated) never happened in reality. There's no proof at all that it ever happened. Also one character makes a living out of playing Russian roulette???? Come on! The Vietnamese are portrayed as victims or monsters--very black and white. No shadings of character. With the sole exceptions of DeNiro, Savage and Meryl Strepp the acting sucks. Seriously--HOW did Walken get an Oscar for this? DeNiro should have gotten it. And the irony at the end (when they're all singing ""God Bless America"") was SO heavy-handed it was almost comic. Wildly overpraised and overrated. This does not belong in the top 250 on IMDb.

23,zardoz-13,Adequate but Unexceptional!,7,20 June 2008,"If movies reflect the real sentiments of society, perhaps the cinema has been telling us what we've known for ages yet seem to forget with each generationthe horror of war. More than the horror of war alone, the current crop of films about Vietnam depicts the conflict as an exercise in futility. Whether Vietnam technically qualifies as a ""war"" is now academic, but for the men who fought and died in it, Vietnam was a ""war""unconventional and without glory. In ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" director Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter,"" with Robert De Niro, three young Americans volunteer for the adventure of combat in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s as an alternative to the humdrum oblivion of life in a Northern mill town. The nightmare that they plunge themselves into when they Vietnam is a descent into chaos from which they never recover.The plot of ""The Deer Hunter"" is both epic and episodic. The first half of this 182-minute epic concerns the characters before they embark for the 'Nam.' They live in a small town whose activities revolve around a steel mill. About the only pastimes they can revel in are boozing at a friend's bar and hunting. The second half occurs in Vietnam. They are captured, escape, and return to civilian life, with mental and physical scars that they cannot conquer. Sadly, the filmmakers have had to pare down their mini-series plot to accommodate the two to three hour running time. Some scenes wear out their welcome. The wedding, for example, is a grandiose spectacle in an awesome church. But Cimino wallows in the spectacle of the wedding to excess. Indeed, the ceremony is as interesting as its setting is magnificent, but it does little to advance the plot. The entire wedding ceremony qualifies as the chick flick part of this war film.Never does Cimino foreshadow his transitions. The changes of locale from America to Vietnam and from combat to capture are distressingly abrupt. ""The Deer Hunter"" emerges as an uneven, series of loosely strung together scenes that are more powerful than their overall design. At times, too, the symbolism is so obvious as to be corny. During the wedding, John Savage and Meryl Streep drink a toast to their marriage. If they drink without spilling a drop, they will have good luck. In a close-up, we see an unnoticed fleck of wine stain her dress. Other scenes seem unconsciously funny. Michael (Robert De Niro), the hero of the movie, who is the ""The Deer Hunter"" of the title, is shown in a hunting scene stalking a deer. He edges up on one side of the slope framed by majestic mountains and raises his rifle. The camera pans to reveal a deer poised not far off as proudly as the deer in the Hartford Insurance commercial. If that isn't sufficient, the music behind the scene is a heavenly choir that celebrates the relationship of De Niro to the deer in the game of the hunt, a solemn heroic act. How pretentious!Director Michael Cimino does direct ""The Deer Hunter"" with verve. They early mill town scenes have gusto galore, and the setting of the film is solidly established by the era's popular music. The Russian roulette scenes are painfully intense, almost unbearable, and very convincing. Unfortunately, Cimino never gives his audience a chance either to breathe or laugh. ""The Deer Hunter"" is dramatically intense to the point of monotonous. ""Deliverance"" lenser Vilmos Zsigmond's beautiful, sweeping photography at least makes the film a visual delight. As war movies go, ""The Deer Hunter"" breaks no new ground. Actually, it's more about the effect of war on the characters, played by a superb cast, than Vietnam. If you're looking for an exciting, entertaining action epic, skip ""The Deer Hunter."" However, if you like fare that nourishes your intellect as well as your eye and doesn't have a happy ending, see ""The Deer Hunter.""",The Deer Hunter

Three friends - Mike (played by Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steve (John Savage) - are getting ready to join the Army. In their last few days before leaving we see them going about their lives - drinking, hunting...and, in Steve's case, getting married. Soon they will be confronted by the harsh realities of war.A thought-provoking, emotional and, to a great extent, depressing journey. We see how the war affects these men, and their community. There are physical effects for some, but there are also mental and emotional effects. Nothing will ever be the same again.Incredibly well made by director Michael Cimino. He painstaking paints you a picture of the men and their close-knit community - for example, the wedding scene seems to go on forever but is vital to the ultimate plot. The seemingly innocuous everyday things provide the contrast for later.Great performances help too. Here we have Robert De Niro at his most heroic...and most vulnerable. We also have the performance which shot Christopher Walken to fame. Plus we have Meryl Streep, who doesn't deliver bad performances.

Having seen it, I agree with them. To my knowledge, there is no historical record of Russian Roulette occurring during the Vietnam war. I understand that the people behind this argue that ""well, no one knows for sure"". Is it that hard to admit ""we made it up for cinematic effect""? That's allowed, you know; you're not making a documentary. But if that's what they're going with, allow me to counter: We *do* know that American troops engaged in atrocities including massacres. I'm not saying that their behaviour came out of nowhere(which is not to say that it can be excused under any circumstances, at most it can be explained). However, if you're going to make something up that puts the other side in a negative light, you ought to also show some of the unflattering truth about yourself. I won't claim that this is poorly done from a technical standpoint, or that the performances are bad. That is all I can say of good things about this. It is an abusively long and boring piece that at no point captured my interest. I wasn't missing explosions, a clear-cut hero or a moral; merely for stuff to get me to find it worth the time(and yes, I do love several 3 hour pictures). Someone to care about(other than Streep). Early on, I could barely tell anyone apart; they're all drunk and behaving like morons. I couldn't like any of them in the least. These obnoxious characters have sudden, instant changes of heart at apparently random times. The pacing is uneven with jolting cuts. This is shot entirely on location(no sets), and the sound-side is great. It ""feels"" real. I gotta say, between this, Year of the Dragon and *Desperate Hours*, I've about given up on Cimino. There is plenty of strong language(also a little in the informational and subtitled commentary by the director and a film critic), a bit of bloody violence and brief male nudity in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with aforementioned audio track, three interviews(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and a 7 minute photo gallery, coming to 57 minutes total, as it says on the cover. I recommend this to... I honestly don't know. Evidently, a lot of people love this, and hey, maybe I just don't see what they do in it. Personally, I'd go for Platoon or Full Metal Jacket instead of this. I can't determine who this movie is for. 7/10",The Deer Hunter

29,HotToastyRag,A masterpiece of the era,8,30 April 2020,"Most Vietnam War movies are extremely difficult to watch, and The Deer Hunter is no exception. Christopher Walken won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his unforgettable performance, and the horrors his character endures are enough to forever burn this movie in your brain. The Deer Hunter has been universally hailed as one of the greatest war movies, and the greatest Vietnam War movie ever made, so it's absolutely worth watching. Just make sure you're up for it, because it's very heavy.The film starts out showing you the personal lives of three soon-to-be soldiers as they enjoy their last days in America; before long, you're as invested in them as the filmmakers have banked on, setting the stage for an emotional, suspenseful drama. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken leave the country both in love with the same girl, Meryl Streep, and John Savage has just married a woman carrying another man's child; their friendship comes first as they go off to war. When they come home, they're not the same men who left, and since the audience has seen what they've endured, we understand better than some of their friends.It's unfortunate that both Coming Home and The Deer Hunter were released in the same year, because both movies are excellent in their own right and don't deserve to be constantly compared with one another. Both movies show that men who are lucky enough to return are permanently changed, and both show physical as well as mental effects. Coming Home doesn't show any war violence, so if you're on the squeamish side, you'll probably like that one better. The main focuses, and certainly the most memorable parts, of The Deer Hunter are the war violence and the bond between the three friends who will never be the same.
More mature audiences will remember the extra sadness behind the filming of this movie, but younger folks probably don't know that the entire cast and crew had to put their emotions aside while the cameras were rolling. There's an added tenderness you can feel between the cast members, but it does make it even harder to watch.The Deer Hunter is a masterpiece; even people who don't like it admit that it's fantastically put together and wonderfully acted. You don't have to watch it, because it's very upsetting, but if you're the type of person who likes to make ""must-see"" movie lists, add this to it. Also, if you've been unlucky enough to only watch lousy war movies-yes, I used to be one of those people-this movie will change your mind about the genre.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families.Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about.Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.",The Deer Hunter

The last hour involves scene after scene of people blowing their brains out in Russian roulette gambling games in Vietnam.Sandwiched between is the the grueling Vietnam torture sequence of POW's De Niro, Savage and Walkan. These scenes are well done and utterly unforgettable -- so much so that I never want to see them again.The overall impact is completely depressing. I have no idea how such a joyless, nihilistic work heralded so much praise. The movie was so overrated at the time that director Michael Cimino was unwisely given a blank check for ""Heaven's Gate,"" which brought down the studio (though it's actually a quality Western).Only see this film if you want to be bored and see scene after scene of people blowing their brains out. See ""Apocalypse Now"" (the original version, not ""Redux"") if you REALLY want to catch a great 70's Vietnam War flick.

This film is about the American men who went to Vietnam leaving in their relatives and friends behind to wonder what was happening over there. They went over there to serve their country because it asked them too or ordered them to go. Whatever the reason, the movie is full of fabulous performances by Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, George Dzundza, and John Savage. I think the cast is well-ensembled and brilliantly acted. The small town in Pennsylvania is quite important to know the significant impact that the war had on small towns in America. Everybody was affected by their absence. Not knowing their fates is often worse than knowing it. After the war, three of the men must face their lives back home. They are never the same again. The game of Russian Roulette is used effectively and frighteningly. We must remember that the Vietnam vets suffer enormously from being taken hostage by Vietcong. It does not matter but they suffer psychologically. Walken definitely deserved his Oscar. I just keep thinking about John Cazale in his last performance. He is dying of bone cancer in reality and dies after filming is over. The Deer Hunter is truly a powerful theme. The deer is a representation of humanity. Humans hunting and killing in the jungles of Vietnam is not much different than hunting and killing harmless deer in the mountains.",The Deer Hunter

A film that has a strong storyline which keeps you gripped, depressed and edge of the seat from the very start to the end. An Oscar winning film, it won best picture and it deserved every bit of it. Two Thumbs Up!Performances: Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken are Legendary actors, and their body of work in this film says it all. De Niro is astonishing. The scene where they are tortured in Vietnam, the expressions he delivers deserves an ovation. Walken won the Oscar for best supporting actor and he deserved every bit of it. What a performance! Words fail to describe his body of work. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always. Others perform well.'The Deer Hunter' is one of bravest films to come out in the history of Hollywood Cinema.

36,Smells_Like_Cheese,How far would you go for a friend?,10,12 December 2005,"This is one of the best adaptions of the Vietnam War on film that I have seen. We have also ""Platoon"" that represented somewhat of the same thing that ""The Deer Hunter"" did as well, but this one came first and was a great version. It showed the intense horror and ultimate change effect on the men that fought in Vietnam. At first, I admit, I was a little bored because the beginning is a little long and felt unnecessary, but then I realized later in the film how much that developed the characters and understood their friendships and how they relate.Robert De Niro seems to be the strongest one of the group, his name is Mike. He has a lot of guts, but he also seems to care mostly about himself, he later on proves that after finally just letting go with his kept up emotions, he must take care of his friends as well. Christopher Walken, he's a baby in here! He's such a terrific actor and he did so well by portraying innocence in his role and the ultimate insanity of his character. He and Robert were amazing, they were just so believable and worked so well together.This was the best picture of 1978, so far I cannot really judge one wither or not it deserved the reward. But it is an awesome movie and I would highly recommend it for anyone. The lines are just F****** A! :D I mean memorable! This does deserve to be on the top 250, good job to other IMDb users! 10/10",The Deer Hunter

The scenes of the Russian roulette are a tease yet some harrowing and very tough moments to watch of the film. All thru this picture the theme of courage and the will to live is present as that overrides the aspect of freedom even more.""The Deer Hunter"" follows a group of Pennsylvania steelworkers workers who live ordinary lives they have fun they party, drink beer and whiskey at the bar and they get married and have families. Yet after the blue collar ways when they leave the deer hunting woods of western Pennsylvania and the Alleghenies for the jungles and hell horror zones of Southest Asia for the Vietnam War it's a different story and impact on the lives of all. The performances are standout and the on screen chemistry in among the best in film history most certainly among Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken it's an epic saga of friendship with courage ruling everything. And one can see how the brutal war times have affected the men a great emotional strain that's lasting yet thru courage and determination the human spirit proves to be exceptional. ""The Deer Hunter"" is an emotional raw gritty pictures that touches the wounded heart.",The Deer Hunter
38,MovieAddict2016,"It's been given a fairly bad reputation over the years - undeservedly so, too. One of the greatest films ever made.",10,7 July 2004,"""One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot.""There's that particularly infamous scene in ""The Deer Hunter"" that seems to remain more disturbing each time we view it, when Michael (Robert De Niro), a Vietnam veteran, tracks down a friend of his named Nicky (Christopher Walken), who never arrived home after the war and is eventually found in Saigon, playing Russian Roulette for money, his mind an utter mess. He is unable to fully remember Michael, and refuses to return home, and what proceeds in the following sequence is a haunting example of gut-wrenching film-making.The Vietnam sequences take place midway through the movie, serving as a connection between the beginning and the end, both of which study the lives of the men and not the war around them. Michael, Nicky and Steven (John Savage) are young Pennsylvanian miners drafted into the war. Steven has just gotten married to the love of his life, but has little time to celebrate as he is shipped overseas with his friends. They eventually all find themselves taken hostage in a Vietnamese POW camp where their captors force them to play Russian Roulette. The rules of the game? Put a single bullet in a random chamber of a handgun, spin it, snap it, raise it to your head, squeeze the trigger, and repeat these steps until there's only one man left standing.After a series of fortunate events Michael, Nicky and Steven escape and make their way downriver. All three men are eventually rescued, Nicky via helicopter and Michael and Steven later on. Steven's battered, infected legs are amputated and he is left helpless in a wheelchair. Michael returns home as well only to find that Nicky is still back in Vietnam. Nicky's girlfriend back home, Linda (Meryl Street), begins to fall in love with Michael, but Michael soon remembers his promise to Nicky (""If I don't make it back don't leave me over there"") and travels over 2,000 miles back into the middle of his own personal hell to find and rescue his best friend. It's hard for him to understand why Nicky doesn't recognize him when he finally tracks him down. ""It's me, Mike."" ""Mike who?""Causing mass controversy upon its release because of its alleged ""racist"" content regarding the Vietnamese, a crowd of Vietnam veterans gathered around outside the Oscars ceremony and caused riots as well, claiming that the film was ""not accurate"" and somehow insulting to the veterans of the war. However as many film historians, authors and critics have already pointed out, the film is never meant to be a 100% accurate depiction of the events in Vietnam. It is not really a Vietnam War picture at all. Instead, it is a focus on the aftermath of war, and how damaging it can be, both physically and mentally, to its participants. Because of the era that ""The Deer Hunter"" was released in, Vietnam was a recent event, the focus of the nation, and is therefore used as a more convenient -- and relative -- backdrop (much like ""Apocalypse Now""). Unlike ""Platoon"" this is not a movie relating specifically to the Vietnam War, in fact less than a half an hour is devoted to the war scenes. It is a character study, and accusations of racism -- although perhaps justified to some extent -- are hardly convincing as the film itself is not concerned with bashing the participants of the war as it is the war itself.It is the film's necessary setup that is often called long and boring and, ironically, unnecessary, but this is essentially where the nature of each character is examined for the audience. To launch directly into the war sequences would be sloppy, and we would have a harder time caring for the characters. Instead, we are given scenes with weddings, discussions, and hunting trips -- normal events. Then, the end, a somber reflection upon the past, chronicles the aftermath of the damaging events in the lives of Michael, Steven, Nicky and their loved ones. Michael has a hard time adapting back to his normal life. It would be hard for anyone, after experiencing such damaging events and images. De Niro made a few post-Vietnam films during the '70s and '80s, the most famous being ""Taxi Driver,"" in which Travis Bickle was totally unable to find his way in life again after the war and resorted to violence in order to justify his existence and release his anger. ""The Deer Hunter"" is similar in approach but reveals more background; this would be a suitable prequel of sorts if the names had been changed.Over the years ""The Deer Hunter"" has surprisingly gained a fairly bad reputation -- most of which stems back to the controversy surroundings its release and protested accolades. Director Michael Cimino's follow-up (""Heaven's Gate"") was an enormous flop, bankrupting United Artists, and he had a hard time finding work afterwards. His first feature film, ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" which starred Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges, was a buddy road movie that was also a sign of things to come in Cimino' later features, most notably the process of male bonding, which is a huge primal element in this project. Cimino was an extremely talented and visionary director, and it's a shame that the ambition of ""Heaven's Gate"" cost him his career.And furthermore, despite the negativity surrounding ""The Deer Hunter,"" it is still one of the finest works of American cinema, a touching, poignant and ultimately depressing film that asks us if the effects of war extend past the physical and into the realm of human mentality. Yes, I think they do.",The Deer Hunter

The next day Steven and his two close friends Michael & Nick, Robert De Niro & Christopher Walken, spend their their last day together hunting deer in the Pennsylvania woods before being drafted into the US Army.Michael is a crack shot when it comes to bringing down a deer and proves it when he's the only one of the group that also included fellow steel workers Stanley and Axel, John Cazale & Chuck Aspegren. living by the rule ""One shot is what it's all about"" Michael puts that into practice in his hunting deers, he never has to shoot twice to make a kill. Later in the movie Michael sees that that motto of his can also effect him and his friends just like the deers he's been hunting all his adult life. Sent to Vietnam as a member the elite 101th Airborne we see Michael run into both Nick and Steven during a communist assault on a village that their defending. A moment later the three, together with a number of Vietnamese villages, having been captured by the Viet Cong are being used in a morbid game of Russian Roulette by their Communist Vietcong captors.Steven who refused to play the Vetcong death game is thrown into a underwater cage in the Mekong River where he's attacked by dozens of hungry and vicious water rats who almost chew his legs off. Both Michael & Nick are a bit luckier by playing Russian Roulett since Michael takes the chance by encouraging the Vietcong leader to put three bullets into the gun chamber not the usual one! Michael playing the odds that his chances, together with Nick, is 50/50 he'll have if he's lucky three slugs to put between his commie torturers eyes and be able to put them out and escape with both Nick & Steven. As dangerous as an idea was it worked with the Vietcong getting all that's coming to them, in bullets and rifle butts, from a mad as hell Michael and even madder Nick.If was later that the three friends are separated during the fighting and Michael is the only one who comes back home to Clairton Penn. in more or less one piece. Michael later finds Steven in a veterans hospital with both his legs amputated from the wounds he suffered in the Vietnam War and that Nick is categorized by he US Army as either AWOL dead or missing in South VietnamSearching for Nick, whom he promised to never leave behind, Michael finds that Steven at the Vet. hospital has been secretly getting scores of $100.00 bills over the last few months from someone in Saigon? That someone turned out to be the missing Nick! Michael travels 12,000 miles back to Vietnam to find and rescue Nick but there's just two hitches; first being able to get into South Vietnem with the country about to fall to the Communist North Vietnamese and second finding Nick and then seeing if he want's to be rescued and brought home in the first place.Gut-wrenching movie about friendship in war and in peacetime with Michael trying to put the pieces of his life back together after he was tortured and de-humanized by his war experiences. Michael became so disgusted and angry with killing that when out hunting he couldn't even lift his rifle to aim at and shoot a deer back home in Penn., a sport which he used to enjoy more then anything else.Going back to ""Nam"" in the spring of 1975 as the US supported South Vietnamese government was on the brink of being overthrown, with what little US personnel left at the US embassy in Saigon about to be air-lifted out of the country, Michael finds Nick playing for high stakes, his life, the brutal and inhuman game that took away his sanity while being held captive by the Vietcong years ago; Russian Roulette. Almost unwatchable final 15 minutes as Michael tries to get poor and heavily drug addicted Nick to come back home with him. Michael even goes as far as of playing a game of ""Spin the Bullet"" himself to get Nick out of his self-destructive state. Nick had been lucky all these months in the gambling dens of Siagon winning thousands of dollars defying the odds of getting his brains blown out. This time, like Michael always said, ""One shot is what It's all about"" and it was that one and last shot or bullet that eventually did Nick in.One of the best movies about war ever made that shows it for what it is ""Hell on Earth"" with a young, 28 year old, and at the time unknown Meryl Streep as Nick's, and and now Michael, long suffering girlfriend Linda. Linda together with Michael Steven and his wife Angela, and all of the friends that Nick left behind in Clairton, attending Nick's funeral sadly say goodbye to him. Later Nicks friends and family solemnly sitting together at the dinner table end the film singling ""God Bless America"" in what has to be one of the most touching and heart-rendering scenes ever put on film. P.S Michael did indeed keep his promise to Nick, he didn't leave him behind.",The Deer Hunter
41,ElMaruecan82,Journey Into the Depths of Hell ...,10,12 May 2011,"It's the literal translation of the film's French title, which couldn't have been more accurate. While watching ""The Deer Hunter"", Michael Cimino's Best Picture winning masterpiece, a deep melancholy submerged my body  yes, the pain I felt was quite physical as if I was exhausted from the hardship endured by those brave men, no superheroes, simple factory workers. ""The Deer Hunter"" drowns you in an ocean of thoughts while you try to find out what are the right interpretations beyond the tears, the cheers and mostly, the thrills...The film follows a three-structured narrative starting with a long wedding sequence, reminding of ""The Godfather""'s famous first act, only this time, the wedding is BEFORE the war, before the boys go to Vietnam, the wedding party is also a farewell-party. Cimino rightfully trusts our patience and proves like Coppola did, that a long opening sequence properly handled is crucial to introduce the characters and their relationships. And like ""The Godfather"", the film sets a friendly and jovial mood only to make the following sequence, in contrast, more emotionally harrowing. Indeed, the second segment abruptly plunges us into the reality of Vietnam, the tragic heart of the story while the third act deals with the post-war trauma. The whole movie could be seen as an exploration of the devastating effects War has on peoples' lives: here, a group of friend from a small industrial town in America.I guess the significance of their Russian background relies on two elements, the most significant being the idea of fighting as expressing a sincere gratitude towards America, the land that welcomed their families, the land they were born in and enjoyed living in, simply their home, sweet home, this is not about patriotism but a certain idea of duty conveyed by a strong sense of morality, not corrupted by the urban way of life of major cities. The second element, is probably the exotic atmosphere: I really enjoyed the music from the wedding party, especially the closing Casatschock. I wanted to dance with Michael, Nick, Stevie, Stan, all these jolly fellows, all night long ... before the last hunting. Isn't the movie titled ""The Deer Hunter"", after all?Hunting, in those pre-lobbies eras, had always been considered as one of the noblest human activities because of its deep roots in our heritage. It's the contact with nature that allows to contemplate and understand its beauty and wildness with respect. You don't kill an animal, you participate to a cycle started from the dawn of the age, when men and animals were fighting over dominating their environment, when killing was for survival, not pointless. And as a ritual honoring this noble philosophy, Michael, played by a spectacular Robert De Niro hunts with a serious and extremely sincere dedication... This seriousness is incarnated by his unforgettable ""This is This"" speech delivered to the poor Stan, the late John Cazale in his last role. ""This is this"" as the perfect harmony of things, each own assumes what happens to him, preys are preys, predators are predators, living requires a discipline so raw it's close to survival. This reasoning might sound extreme but for Michael, the rules of life are impeccably simple.Hunting inspires all the noblest manly sentiments, friendship, integrity, and respect. But this is only a setting, all these elements are explored beyond the limits of the mountain. Besides, this is an idealization, these guys, even Michael, enjoy drinking, arguing and making crude jokes. They are men of principles, faithful, but they're buddies more than anything. ""The Deer Hunter"" is the ultimate male-bonding film incarnated by such memorable scenes as in the bar where they all sing along ""Can't Take my Eyes Off of You"", one of my favorite musical moments ever. And the central relationship is between Michael and Nicky, a young Christopher Walken in his most powerful performances as the best friend, or maybe something more that I can't put my finger on, like a cloud of mystery floating somewhere in a sky, blue like Meryl Streep's lovely eyes. This friendship, as any other friendships, will be confronted to War, when Michael, Nick and Stevie, the broom, John Savage in a too overlooked performance, will be confronted to the iconic deadly game that immortalized the film, and gave it this iconic status. But more than a Pop Culture touch, the Russian Roulette is a powerful symbolization of War itself. It's having the gun pointed at you, with odds of survival getting lower and lower after each game. It's all a matter of luck, where the winner is not the guy who kills, but who let the other killed, and after such an experience, killing a deer strangely reminds you of your own condition as a human prey. In one scene, probably the most intense of cinema's history, we learn more about war and death than any other film, De Niro's greatest piece of acting, and a deserved Oscar for Walken.*** I will conclude by dedicating this review to the late John Cazale, who prematurely left this world after having portrayed weak and tormented characters with a heart-breaking authenticity. One of the images that will forever haunt me features Cazale as Stan, standing alone in the last scene as if it was the actor himself, visibly tired, who felt the song sung at that moment was his swan song, his personal good-bye to the cinema. But he couldn't have a better last film. And this is this ...***",The Deer Hunter
42,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It got away.,7,5 May 2020,"'The Deer Hunter (1978)' is often hailed as the greatest Vietnam war movie ever made, despite the fact that it only spends a very limited amount of time in the country. It's not really about the war; it's unconcerned as to whether the conflict was right, wrong or somewhere in-between. Instead, it's about the soldiers. It spends its time exploring what happens to a person when they go to war, when they see their friends die and are forced to kill to survive, and how they readjust when - or, rather, if - they return to the apparent normalcy of everyday life. Even though the picture is undeniably rather slow, its overall effect is undeniably rather powerful. It stays with you. It's a showcase of acting, writing and directing that owes a huge debt to 'The Godfather (1972)' but isn't just a copy of it. It's a realistic, affecting portrayal of war-time trauma that's as successful in its quieter contemplation as it is in its unbearable tension. 7/10",The Deer Hunter
43,g-bodyl,Decent But Overrated Film!,9,28 October 2010,"If it wasn't for the first hour or so, this movie would have been a masterpiece. For the beginning scenes with the wedding reception, I was bored out of my mind. I was about to turn this movie off because I thought it would not get better. But when the Vietnam scenes appeared at long last, this was when I was blown away.This is about a group of guys who head to Vietnam but they were captured and sent to a POW camp. Eventually, they were able to go to America. Since one of their guys were left behind, the character of Robert De Niro goes back to the horrors of Vietnam to rescue the guy.The acting is pretty darn good even in the beginning. The performances by De Niro and Christopher Walken are amazing. Meryl Streep did a credible job too.Overall, this is a good movie but it's overrated and way too long.

The entire first hour could have been cut down to ten minutes and the third hour is bleak and hopeless. The second hour is pretty intense, though. I think that this won Best Picture because it was politically controversial at the time, but it hasn't held up very well - aside from the acting, which was quite good.",The Deer Hunter
45,secondtake,"Whatever its political and historical flaws, it's too realistic dramatic to be ignored. Amazing.",10,17 February 2011,"The Deer Hunter (1978)Extraordinary. There is the worst of it, the Russian Roulette as a gambling game in the jungles of Vietnam and in the back rooms of Saigon. There are no restraints here. When people shoot themselves in the head, it's bloody and horrific. When they pull the trigger and survive, it has a different kind of horror, of surviving and realizing how incredible and insane this is.There is the best of it, the love between men, and between the people in this small iron making town in Pennsylvania. There is loyalty, drinking and hunting, bonding though just being there through everything, year after year.These two worlds collide because of the Vietnam War. But director Michael Cimino never makes it cheap. It is sensational, for sure, and people have complained every since the premier that the gambling scenes are exaggerated and rare, if even ever existing at all (there is no known proof of a single incident of Viet Cong playing Russian Roulette). There also have been complaints that the movie stereotypes the Vietnamese as sadistic, terrible people. The counter to that is that the movie isn't about all Vietnamese, but about these particular terrible ones.A larger point to remember is that this is a dramatic fictional movie. The roulette is hugely effective and also symbolic of the chaotic world of Vietnam. We don't need to believe it really happened to believe it happened in this fictional world. The result, the point of the movie, is the emotional intensity of going to war, of coming home, of figuring out what matters in relationships and violence. And maybe of realizing how little we really control our lives.One of the striking aspects of the film is its incredible mise-en-scene. The famous (and very long) wedding scene, the battle scenes in Nam (actually Thailand), and the more intimate bar and domestic scenes in what is supposed to be Pennsylvania are astonishing for their believable settings and details. The place this breaks down, and terribly, is when they go hunting in the Pennsylvania mountains and it looks like the rugged Pacific Cascades. Which it is--snowy peaks, huge mountains, the whole thing. It's dramatic, but it really disrupts what is otherwise a convincing world. (For people looking closely, there are glitches in the filming of these scenes, too, as the landscapes are intercut with shots of the hunters, and shots of big deer, and they don't really match geographically or even in the kind of light used.)But if you like to like movies, and want to just get sucked in and take things for what they are, regardless of their incorrectness (political or practical), you'll find one of the most disturbing and intense movies ever made about Vietnam. It comes a year before the bigger, glossier, and even more fictional ""Apocalypse Now"" and the two make an amazing pair, a deeply moving statement about America and Americans.",The Deer Hunter

48,ironhorse_iv,"Oh Dear! This motion picture is not historical accurate at all. Despite that, it's still worth hunting for.",8,12 February 2019,"This movie directed by Michael Cimino is supposed to be in-depth examination of the Vietnam War and how its events, impacts and disrupts the lives of three Russian American Soldiers in many ways, when returning back to their small industrial town in Pennsylvania. However, the characters in the film are more traumatic by having to play a game of ""Russian Roulette' than anything else, they witnessed. The film really lingers on that in the 3rd act, to the point, that the movie is probably best known as today, as the 'Russian Roulette' motion picture. It has caused some film scholars to question if the movie really deserve all that praise, as it hardly has to do with any real after effects that soldiers came home with from the war. Don't get me wrong, this movie was truly one intense watch. However, I have to somewhat agreed, the flick is indeed highly fictionalized & somewhat unrealistic. Without spoiling the motion picture, too much, the reason for that, is because this 1978 Academy Awards Best Picture Winner was loosely based, first on an unproduced screenplay called, 'The Man Who Came to Play' by authors, Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about a group of gamblers risking it all in Las Vegas, by playing Russian roulette. However, when producer Michael Deeley bought the screenplay, he hired director Michael Cimino & screenwriter, Deric Washburn, who hate each other, to work together to rewrite it. They did this, by having the deadly game take place in a Vietnamese Prison Camp between capture American soldiers, despite there being no documented cases of the game being played during the war. Regardless, those roulette scenes were shot in real circumstances, in dirty locations with the performers getting real beatings. The reaction from all the faces from all three principal actors, were somewhat genuine, especially Christopher Walken, who had no clue that he was getting slap for real. According to the director, the performers got so method with their acting, they requested, one real live cartridge in the revolver to heighten the intensity of the situation. That's totally insane! It's just as crazy to hear that Robert De Niro and John Savage mostly performed their own stunts, including the 30 foot drop fall into the river, 15 times in two days. They could had really got seriously hurt or even died. They almost did, as during a helicopter stunt, the skids caught itself on the rope bridge, nearly causing the copter to fall on two of the actors. They took a good amount of risk for actors deed too old for the ages, their character was supposed to be. Besides the stunts, the acting in this film is outstanding. There is no better example of this, than the 'One Last Shot' sequence. De Niro's emoting here, is ever brilliant, such a thoughtful performance. While, Walken's character just looks like a dead soul waiting for the body to followed. He's so hollow. What an amazing scene. Not to be outdone, the supporting cast were just as good as the main two. Despite, being a vague stock girlfriend character, Meryl Streep was fine in this role. Streep's then, boyfriend, John Cazale was also alright in the film. It's surprised me, to hear that he was very weak when filming began, due to being diagnosed with lung cancer. You really couldn't tell. Sadly, Cazale died shortly after filming was completed & never saw his work. Nevertheless, not all acting was praise, the film got some criticize on its one-sidedly portraying all the North Vietnamese as over the top sadistic racists and killers. Regardless of that, it's really hard to say, that this movie is an indeed a war film, when technically, the sequences involving Vietnam were a small part of the 183 minutes runtime. Most of the movie takes place, during a wedding. 51 minutes to be exact. Because of that, the movie's pacing has been claim to be, somewhat of a slowed burn to the point that Universal wanted the movie to be trim, even more. I somewhat agreed. Scenes like the drunk nude streaking could had been cut. Despite, the film going way over budget and overschedule. The movie is beautifully shot. There is no better example of this, than the deer hunting scene & the depressing climax involving ""God Bless America'. Overall: In spite of backlash from some Vietnam Veterans & War Historians who protest the film during its one theater released. The film was indeed successful enough at Oscars, that Universal Pictures widened the distribution to include major cities. It became a box office success. It made the bucks. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". That's how important, this film, has become to some people. For me, the over amount of praise for this movie is bit much. It's like, some critics don't mention, this film's big flaws in their reviews. Regardless of that, the movie is still worth watching. 'The Deer Hunter' might have starts out slow, but in the end, it's big bang. Highly recommended, checking it out.",The Deer Hunter
49,The-Sarkologist,War changes you,7,23 December 2011,"I had heard a few things about this movie, but one of the reasons that I wanted to see it was because it was on my American History film list as a film to watch regarding Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is classified as a war film, and I guess you can call it that, but I think the impact of the movie comes from the events back home rather than the war itself. In fact, the actual war only takes up about 40 minutes of this three hour movie.The major theme of this movie, and many others dealing with the Vietnam war, is that war changes people. Cimino seems to take the World War One idea here where three friends are drafted into the war, and are going to Vietnam as a sort of rite of manhood. The movie seems to take a number of these rites of manhood into his themes. There is the deer hunt, and one becomes a man after one kills his first deer, there is marriage, and then there is war. The difference here is that the war destroys all of them. One of the three is crippled and left in a wheel chair, another takes his chances playing Russian Roulette, while the third is destroyed mentally. They all leave as friends and all return different people. When DeNiro returns, he goes straight past his welcome home party only to slink in the back door the next day. The friend whom he derided constantly beforehand becomes the personification of everything that he hated about the war, and when at first he would always be out to kill a deer, when he returns, he finds that he can never take another life, whether it be human or animal.The crippled friend leaves a husband, and when he returns he cannot show his face around the city for he feels that he is no longer a man. He cannot walk and thus he feels less of a human being. He leaves his wife and his friends and hides in a veteran's hospital. While the other friend simply vanishes after he decides to take part in a game of Russian Roulette, even though he had watched all of his friends killed when the Vietnamese Soldiers forced them to play it. Even though he hides, he still is able to send all of his winnings back to America to help support his crippled friend.The war itself is not glorified, and in fact there is very little fighting. Instead they find themselves trapped together in a POW camp where they entertain their captors by putting a gun to their heads and pulling the trigger. The whole feeling in this scene is one of utter hopelessness.The Deer Hunter is a long movie that develops its characters well. It is not a war movie, but rather a movie about how war effects those who fight it, and those who support them at home. It highlights how war changes people for the worse, and how these changes are permanent and who it is not just the people abroad, but at home as well. The sombre ending shows us how just one death of one soldier effects not just the soldier who died, but everybody he knew as well.",The Deer Hunter
50,jacobjohntaylor1,people just love boring movies,4,9 August 2017,This movie has an awful story line. It very boring. It is also very depressing. Do not see this movie. If you like boring crap then you should see this movie. It is no 8.2 that is just overrating it. This is a 4. And nothing more then that. I am a young man I am 33. If I were Vietnam Veteran maybe I would have like this movie a lot more. One of Christopher Walken's better movies would Sleep Hollow. And one of the better of Robert De Niro's movies would be Frankenstein. This is not a good movie. If you like good war movies. Do not see this one. This is awful. Do not see it.,The Deer Hunter
51,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,10 January 2006,"A film in which there is a lot that can be discussed, this is a good film overall, but definitely one with some flaws. The film is essentially about the varying possible effects that undergoing torture can have on different individuals. With the Vietnam War in the backdrop, it could be deduced that the film is also about the effects of war on the individual, but such little time is spent war scenes that it is hardly a war film, and war related themes are derived only from the symbolism that one might associate Russian roulette with. Anyway, that should be hardly taken a statement on the quality of the film. Cimino is able to set up some really intense scenes, the acting is generally fine, and the film does have some solid ideas, not only about the effects of torture, but also about strong friendships. The key element that limits the power of the film is a number of plot contrivances, that vary from being rather unlikely to next to impossible, and that is without including some of the factual wrongs with the film. The reoccurrence of Russian roulette could also be regarded as heavy-handed, depending on whether one regards it as a symbol of the futility or chances of war. Could something else not also be used to allude to this? It also is an overly long and drawn out film. The first hour is meant to give us a chance to know the characters a bit better, but even so, it goes on for too long, full of excesses of dance, humorous bits and abandoned subplots, all that inform us precious little of the characters. There is a subplot with two of the characters in the latter half of the film that is undernourished too. The music is not really any help either: it is too sickly sentimental to tie in very well. I found a few others things that I also did not like that I will not mention here for fear of ruining a fresh experience of the movie. It is a good film, even if a grueling watch, despite its drawbacks. As a film about the everlasting physical and mental effects of torture, it does a reasonable job, and as a film about the extreme lengths that one goes for a friend, it also stands up fairly well.",The Deer Hunter
52,briancham1994,Heartbreaking,8,10 February 2021,"This film starts off with an infamously long wedding sequence and hunting trip, showing the raucous, cheerful, all-American protagonists. Their brotherhood in the small working-class town resonates with the audience, no doubt. This is all thrown asunder when they enlist in the Vietnam War, something they speak of as a mere patriotic chore. Once they are captured by the Viet Cong, the true nature of the war is revealed as they experience genuine fear, desperation and brutality far exceeding what they can handle. Each of the characters has their own reaction but they are clearly shattered and can never truly return to a normal life. By the time we get to the end, we have witnessed a heartbreaking destruction of the protagonists into shell-shocked husks. The most noteworthy parts of the film are the acting and the Russian roulette scenes which are extremely tense.",The Deer Hunter
53,johnnyboyz,Somewhat powerful but very important look on how Vietnam affected even those from the very small areas of society.,8,9 April 2008,"I suppose The Deer Hunter's basic three act structure is a fairly basic and easy thing to spot, but the film makes full use of it in the long run. Such is the power and the eeriness of this film, it was not until a few days after I had seen it that the film began to strike a cord with me. Yes, I saw it; really enjoyed it and when the climactic scene came and went, it was heart breaking but at the time I could not accept that it had just happened. Fast forward three or four days later, re-visit the theme tune as produced by Myers/Williams and actually think about what had transpired and it is a shocking and unpleasant feeling that dawns on you.The Deer Hunter at its very core is an obvious commentary on how the Vietnam War as a whole destroyed the people who fought in it. The film is about how the war arrived just when so many people were getting in right and were enjoying themselves without a care in the world right until something as unnecessary and as brutal as the war comes along to destroy it. When Michael (De Niro), Steven (Calzale) and Nick (Walken) finish their front line duty in 'Nam, their lives are changed; so much so that despite being home or at least within the boundaries of a space that is not the war itself, they cannot or find it difficult to re-adapt  Nick for psychological reasons, Steven for physical reasons and Michael just about gets by, but he is still haunted by the actions of his clumsy and now apparent immature friends.And so it is at this point that I give an opinion that will seem insulting and derogatory but is just a humble observation; The Deer Hunter viewed now, structurally, resembles that nasty little horror sub-genre called 'torture porn'. Maybe it is the recent spate of films of this sub-genre, but The Deer Hunter begins with utopia (at least for the characters) before descending into Hell and then ending with a reprieve as well as having to come to terms with what has happened once you were dragged from your utopian haven. For the first third, the characters that are the steel workers are happy and carefree with frequent trips to the bar and jokes with fellow co-workers the enjoyable level of their lives. This sequence feels warm and it feels friendly, lulling us into a false sense. Then there is the wedding; supposedly the happiest moment of anybody's life and once again, the dizziest high achievable is shown and exploited in the opening third  it can only go down from here. Then there is the eerie way Nick and Michael seem to gamble; they gamble on the football game on TV but they gamble with their lives when they undertake a truck on the road  this toying with fate and their lives echoes in future scenes, but it will mature them in the nastiest way possible.There is also the attitude the characters have toward the wedding; this is where The Deer Hunter edges toward the brink of being political. The manner in which the guys fool around and treat a big deal like the wedding in such a carefree manner might be echoing America's methods of dealing with the Vietnam War; 'underestimation' the key word here. But this works both ways, it can be a political statement but it can also act as a brilliant sentimental set up. I especially liked the scenes in which the guys sing to the music and play pool at the same time; it is something most men have done, play pool, whilst the apparent unnecessary action may be questioned; after later events it is something the guys will not be able to partake in ever again  enjoy it and do not question it while it lasts because one day, it may be an impossibility.Then onto the second act and the war itself in which buildings are eviscerated and people are killed. Michael must torch someone alive with a flamethrower and march about seeing other such Americans lie in waste as a result of gunfights. But the capture and the subsequent 'torture' of the protagonists is what people remember the film for. The scenes work because you don't want these characters to be slapped about, treated this way and be shot. True, the 'evil' Vietnamese and the 'good' and innocent Americans are categorised here but I do not feel the representation can be criticised if it is a war zone in which the events are set, with two sides warring with one another. This roulette sequence important because it plays a large role in Nick's future mentality; the scene when he breaks down in hospital is perhaps a realisation of what he went through and for some reason, he must constantly face these demons in future roulette games.When said people do make it home, it is not the fun and games it was. Axel (Aspegren) and Stan (Cazale) are waiting there, no surprise the film did not bring the two least likable guys along with them to the war, and no surprise Michael gets agitated with them when he does, especially when Stan shows off his revolver. The Deer Hunter further intrudes into the political when it includes, I believe to be, real life images and footage of news reports during the war amongst the action. But the film will remain strong and haunting enough for time to age it in that powerful and important manner.",The Deer Hunter
54,filipemanuelneto,I don't understand how he won so many awards.,6,20 September 2020,"I confess that I didn't really know what to expect from this film when I started watching it. I knew it was a prestigious film, considered by many to be one of the best films of the 1970s, and I knew the basics about the plot. In the end, I liked what I saw, but it doesn't look as good as a lot of people say it should be and what should be a film that won five Academy Awards (Best Film, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor) and was nominated for four another categories (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Original Screenplay) in 1979!The script is complex and you should pay attention as each character is introduced. The film focuses on three young Russian-Americans from a rural Pennsylvania community who go to the Vietnam War: Michael is the strongest and most charismatic, Steven is getting married and Nick leaves a girlfriend behind, for whom Michael has a crush. United by friendship, they end up separated by war.Much can be said about the story told in this film, directed by Michael Cimino in the only successful film of his short and obscure career. The first hour cost me a lot: the film takes a long time to start and the introduction is overloaded with dialogues and scenes that could have been cut in the editing room. This part should be shorter, presenting the characters and their environment without bothering the audience too much with details that are irrelevant to the story (such as the details of the wedding and the party). Another problem I felt was seeing the main characters being so immature all the time. For the film to work, they have to win the public's sympathy and not their hatred!After an hour of suffering and looking at the clock, the three boys finally go to Vietnam. And here is another surprise: the Vietnam War never took up so little time in a film about it! I won't be exaggerating if I say that I saw only half an hour of war scenes. I felt that Cimino wanted to quickly go over the war and developing that was not something he wanted to do. But if this is a film about the war and how it affected people it was a major theme and needed to be developed further! We only saw one attack! Was that damn marriage more important?From that moment on the film improves substantially, with the development of a dramatic story around the fate of each of the characters. I have only two objections to make: I am able to understand the symbolism of the Russian roulette, and that Cimino had the idea of betting on it as a kind of... leitmotiv for his film. I understand that. But a question of logic and credibility arises: Michael plays the game about seven to ten times, not counting all the games that Nick will have played... unless he cheats in some way, it's impossible to stay alive so much time. Oh... and that ending, with the whole cast singing ""God Bless America"", seems so absurd that it's even cynical.Let's talk about the cast... and we have a cast full of heavyweights. Robert De Niro offers us an exceptionally restrained performance, but still full of charisma and intensity at the right time; Christopher Walken leaves us the best work of his career, which isn't to say little considering his longevity and the regularity of his work; John Cazale and his wife, the young Meryl Streep, are also in this film, which was the farewell of Cazale, famous for his part in ""The Godfather"" trilogy, and who entered this film very weakened by the cancer who victimized him, days after filming was ended.Technically, it's a film with ups and downs. We have an excellent cinematography which knows how to make good use of light and shadow, create an environment and sensations in the public; the sets and costumes were very well-made and thought to detail, with special attention to the wedding and the jungle scenes. The choice of landscapes and filming locations was satisfactory but not always accurate, considering that Pennsylvania was portrayed and shown in a way that is more like Colorado. The editing is miserable and I remember that the film won the Oscar in that category, which is at least surreal and says a lot about the choices of the Academy. The sound effects are decent but the sound quality is below what we could expect. Much better is the soundtrack, especially the cavatina composed for this film by Stanley Myers.",The Deer Hunter

56,TheMovieDiorama,"The Deer Hunter is like fine wine, the more it ages the sweeter it tastes.",9,27 February 2018,"And boy has this aged incredibly well! 1978 and still utterly gripping and compelling. Is it a masterpiece? No. However to conceive something so bold, daring and powerful is a remarkable achievement. A group of work colleagues and friends from Pennsylvania have their lives irrevocably changed by the Vietnam war. The classic microcosm of portraying small lives to create a scale of grandeur. These steelworkers weren't just representing themselves, but also the idealisms of America at that time. It's a one-sided affair, whether you view that as a detriment is entirely up to you. It does not hinder what is being shown. This is all about the character development, their emotional and physical changes through all three acts. Establishing their close bonds in the first act, putting their survival skills to the test in the second and then dealing with the psychological wounds in the third act. It's the perfect structure. The first act is easily the weakest. Thirty minutes of a wedding ceremony where people are Cossack dancing to the Tetris theme tune feels pointless, could've easily established the friendships in ten minutes. Aside from that, I thought this was pretty darn excellent. Robert De Niro holds the entire film together. Christopher Walken explores his wide emotional range of acting, he was terrific. Even a young Meryl Streep was incredible. Michael Cimino's direction was exhilarating, particularly during the war scenes. Shots were extensive, he took his time with the story and the characters. Then we get to the Russian Roulette scenes. Wow. Never seen anything quite like it. I was on the edge of my seat. Such a simple premise to include in a war film which guarantees thrills and fear. The final roulette scene was gut-wrenching. Captors betting on their survival, it really conveys how chaotic Saigon and the rest of Vietnam became during the war. Descending into a hysterical nightmare. A 3 hour behemoth has never passed by so quickly. Close to perfection, but not quite.",The Deer Hunter

The cast is top-notch and they all do a great job, especially Robert de Niro. De Niro delivers another terrific performance. The movie takes a slight turn for the worse in the second half but its not a deal breaker.

Some people don't understand films, some understand but don't get it and here i said i didn't get it means i did understand it, i did understand everything happened in the film but i just couldn't get why it happened. The Deer Hunter is a story of 3 friends whose lives are changed after Vietnam war.

Second one is back home but doesn't feel like home, why? I didn't get it. He's enjoying love affair with his friends girlfriend without any commitment and hesitation. Dear god please help me here. 3rd guy is gone drug addict and turned a killer gamer why? I didn't get why did he do it. These 3 people seemed like lost minded for me and may be that's why I didn't get the film. The Deer Hunter is one of the top rated and raved film of 70s decade but i didn't get it. May be because i am an Indian and i don't understand how just one war changes young lads lives although i have liked so many war effect films of old and modern Hollywood era. The performances by Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, John Savage looked good. Length is about 3 hours in which hardly there are any enjoyable moment post first half. Michael Calimino's execution looks fine but the conviction seems lose over the content.

60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Non-traditional war film makes us feel the trauma of Vietnam,8,22 June 2009,"The Vietnam War is not something filmmakers have shied away from, so the challenge for Michael Cimino right away was to make ""The Deer Hunter"" something different. He succeeds. ""Deer Hunter"" is a portrait of life for American soldiers before and after war. It's goal is not to expose the horrors of the war or acclaim the bravery of its soldiers, but to show the far- reaching effects of post-traumatic stress. Although the film drags frequently because it doesn't use traditional storytelling methods, the feelings Cimino wants to get across are felt.Unlike any other film before it, ""The Deer Hunter""'s greatest asset surprisingly lies in a plot device: the ""game"" of Russian Roulette. Although a small percentage of this three-hour film, the mere concept of loading one bullet into a six-shooter, pressing it against your head and pulling the trigger is a powerful means of storytelling. All the suspense, anticipation of gore and the fact that the main characters Michael (De Niro), Nick (Walken) and Steve (Savage) have to play it makes ten minutes of Russian Roulette just as intense as a 25-minute battle scene in another war movie. If ""Deer Hunter"" is remembered for nothing else, Russian Roulette alone assures it will never be forgotten.There really isn't a plot in this film in the traditional sense. The characters have no specific goals or desires, no obvious motivation. They have enlisted in the war apparently because they believe it's the American thing to do, but even that's only a sense we get from their limited patriotic dialogue. The only through-line in the entire film is De Niro's character trying, from what it looks like, to get everyone back together again like nothing terrible ever happened. Again, it's not a clearly expressed objective, but when you think about it there's nothing else that could possibly be living for. Basically, Cimino relies on our empathy with these jolly small-town characters to understand what's going on in the film and why it matters.""Deer Hunter"" is a visual film. The setting in both Pittsburgh and Vietnam is a crucial part of Cimino's attempt to create the empathy, seeing as he doesn't provide us any easy access. Dialogue is not his preferred method of revealing character and creating drama -- we have to keenly observe how these characters change from the beginning when they joyously drink and celebrate Steve's wedding to how they cope or fail to cope once they suffer the trauma of Russian Roulette. It's a heck of a challenge staying on board with Cimino's vision, but the Russian Roulette scenes, as intense as they are and as primely located in the film's plot structure as they are, really keep the film glued together as well as our eyes on the screen. Seeing that happen justifies the speechlessness of these characters as their lives continue after their experience in the war. Cimino knows how effective this is because loud noises are planted in the post- war scenes and they always make us think someone fired a gun. When John Cazale's character Stan brings up his little revolver prior to the war scenes, we don't care, but when we see it after De Niro comes back from 'Nam -- instant suspense. It's a shame Cimino never continued successfully after this film. Few films could get away with non-traditional storytelling and manage to leave the impact that ""Deer Hunter"" does.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Deer Hunter

62,funkyfry,"Overly emotional, but effective",7,24 July 2008,"By the end of this very long film, I felt quite a bit emotionally drained and somewhat manipulated. Although I feel like it contained some really great performances, from everyone really including the supporting cast (especially George Dzundza and John Savage) but especially De Niro, Walken and Streep, ultimately I think the film was a bit heavy-handed and at times improbable. The details of the Vietnamese POW camp feel exaggerated, although the two scenes with Russian roulette were very powerful. It was really odd that De Niro could just walk back into Saigon though at that point.What I liked best about the movie was the way De Niro's performance changed so subtly in the parts of the movie when he returns home after the war. He conveys a totally different state of mind -- again the film hammers the point home more than it really needs to by including that whole scene with him deliberately missing the stag he's tracking. De Niro's acting alone would suffice, I've rarely seen him stronger. Same with Walken, he really was excellent in this movie especially at the end when he seems almost literally like a ghost.Was the ending supposed to be satirical? I don't think so but it was a little over the top with them all singing ""God Bless America."" I just couldn't buy it.One thing that I felt was that it is possible to see the movie as De Niro's character being in love with Walken's. At the end he tells him ""I love you"", (SPOILERS) similar to Sam Fuller's ""I Shot Jesse James."" I think that he and the Streep character were basically in love with the same man.",The Deer Hunter
63,jzappa,"Times Have Changed, Thus Has This Film's Effect, But It Is By No Means Bad",8,22 September 2008,"Michael Cimino's curiously hailed classic The Deer Hunter is a three-hour drama in three hour-long acts, a chronicle dropping us into what seems to be the middle of the lives of a group of friends. It is a trace of how the Vietnam War crossed the threshold into numerous lives and distorted them dreadfully without end. What I find wise about this story is its lack of any sort of slant for or against the war. However, times must have changed, because once it was one of the most emotionally devastating movies ever made, and now it is not. That does not mean, moreover, that it is at all a bad film, because it is quite good.I am most certainly disappointed that Michael Cimino became more or less estranged from Hollywood after the disastrous failure of Heaven's Gate, because judging by his work here, he could have contributed so much more to cinema over time. Think about it! Like more European and Asian films have done and American films since The Deer Hunter have scarcely had the confidence to do, Cimino takes his time with the opening scenes at the steel mill and the saloon and especially with the wedding. It's key not just that we come to know the characters, but that we feel immersed into their lives, that the wedding rituals and day-to- day life are more than mere Russian-American fine points. I am sure in 1978 that this technique more than worked.The first act is primarily a wedding celebration as in The Godfather, but made merry by working commonfolk who have come to eat, dance get smashed and bid farewell to the three young men who have joined in the Army. The event lasts for nearly an hour for everyone to become inebriated, and then the newlyweds drive off and the rest of the friends go up into the mountains to hunt, to shoot, to murder, some deer. They are yet at a stage where they believe shooting a gun at an objectified target to be gratifying.Then Vietnam inhabits the screen, all of a sudden, with an abrupt barrage of blasting, blaring racket of helicopter blades, machine guns, and indistinguishable yells and screams, and the second act chronicles the three men's experiences. At the film's heart comes the iconic, and very tense and suspenseful in spite of its familiarity, as they are held captive and forced to play Russian roulette while their Vietnamese subjugators gamble on who will blow his own brains all over the place.Russian roulette develops into the all-consuming representation of the movie: Whatever you can accept as true about the game, regarding its consciously indiscriminate brutality, regarding how it affects the reason and judgment of anyone coerced to take part in it, will be relevant to the war all together. It is shrewd symbolism because, in the story's framework, it renders any philosophical assertion concerning the war redundant.De Niro's character is the one who by some means recovers the power to persevere and to keep Savage and Walken functioning. A great touch of realism is when De Niro comes home and is welcomed uncomfortably by the townspeople. The story moves along, into its third act, into unprecedented territory, but amidst all of that, we find a difference, a big one, in De Niro's attitude when he's out hunting deer.This movie is assumed to be on the subject of countless themes and issues, male bonding, foolishly mechanical patriotism, the demoralizing results of war, the awakening of conscience to violence and killing. It concerns any of those focuses that you want to regard. What is so funny about this film, objectively, as the movie itself is not at all literally funny, is that it has no stance one way or the other on the validity of the war in Vietnam, because it was made afterwards. Everyone realizes the gratuitous wars were wrong afterwards. I would bet that it would have had some sort of slant if it had been made before the war ended. But what it maintains is that we not overlook the casualties of a war.",The Deer Hunter
64,Vartiainen,Epic story about friendship and the effects of war,9,9 November 2012,"What we have here is a slow, thoughtful and intense drama done correctly. The film is a long one, with a running time of three hours, and its filled with scenes that just don't seem to end or to have any particular point. The wedding scene for example just seems to go on and on. In a weaker movie these kinds of scenes would bore the viewer, perhaps even make the film unwatchable. Not in this case. Because this isn't really a movie about the Vietnam war, like so many people seem to think. Admittedly the war part of the film is the most memorable and the one that people bring up most often, but the movie as a whole is more about the friendship between its main characters. The war is always there, certainly, but its point is to showcase how the terror of combat and the mental torture that follows affect people and how we all cope differently. Some of us manage to muscle through and go on to spend relatively normal lives. Some of us crack, however, and the film goes to great lengths to make us understand just how deep that single crack can go. How it can ruin the best of us.But for us to understand we first have to understand the people that are put under this pressure. And that's why those slow scenes of wedding receptions, hunting trips and bar evenings are so important. They have this quality of realism. Like we could be right there next to them, sharing a joke or a drink. I'm sure there are some, who still get bored by this film, but I personally enjoyed each and every single shot. At times the film had almost a dreamlike quality, especially towards the end, reflecting the surrealism that is normal life after you've gone through war. The music was discreet, the scenery slightly blurry and nothing much was said, rather the mood was given time to build. We were given time to ponder and reflect.Add in brutally good role performances by pretty much all of the main actors and you have a film that even Sergio Leone would be proud to call one of his own. The movie actually greatly reminds me of Once Upon a Time in America and not just because they share a main actor in Robert De Niro. The same mood is there, the same gripping touch of real life mixed in with dreamlike hallucinations and larger than life concepts that hide in the background.This is a great film, one that everyone should see. It's subtle and thought-provoking, while still working both as a period piece and a character study. Masterful film-making at its best.",The Deer Hunter
65,JohnSeal,This was Best Picture in 1978?,6,14 December 1999,"It's not even the best Vietnam film of 1978, which of course was Apocalypse Now. The Deer Hunter is a deeply flawed examination of the lives of three Pennsylvania steelworkers who enlist, serve in 'Nam, and suffer the consequences. This is a great film when the actors are allowed to take centre stage: Robert De Niro was becoming America's greatest film actor, Christopher Walken was establishing himself as a brilliant young talent, and even the woman I love to hate, Meryl Streep, delivered a stunningly nuanced performance. The supporting cast is near flawless, and it's always a delight to see Shirley Stoler in any film, even when she's playing a Serbian mama.
The Deer Hunter suffers when director Michael Cimino's need to make a statement and screenwriter Deric Washburn's need for a cinematic metaphor overwhelm what could have been a terrific straightforward story. Cimino's recurring use of the hunting theme is totally over the top, especially when the Serbian church music swells in the background as De Niro stalks his prey. The symbolism in The Deer Hunter is unnecessary and so in your face as to be a major distraction. As for Washburn, all one can say is that he obviously never met a Vietnamese  he didn't hate. To say his depictions of Vietnamese are racist is perhaps an understatement: they are shown as either brutal butchers who have nothing better to do than torture prisoners and shoot civilians, or jabbering idiots who gamble endlessly on the other overworked symbol of the film, Russian Roulette. The fact that The Deer Hunter was shot in Thailand--an American ally to the end of the Indochinese Wars--makes me guess that the Thai crew and actors were more than happy to present their Communist neighbours to the East as maddened animals. All the better to keep Thailand within the realm of American national interests, I imagine. By all means see this film for De Niro and Walken.

66,paul-allaer,"Reassessing ""The Deer Hunter"" now 40+ years later",10,16 October 2020,"""The Deer Hunter"" (1978 release; 184 min.) is the now (in) famous movie about the devastating impact of the Vietnam War on a group of average Joe Sixpack guys in a fictitious steel town in western Pennsylvania. The film in brought in three main parts: the wedding and first hunting trip; the Vietnam experience; and the return home afterwards.Couple of comments: I saw the movie when it first came out in 1979 in Belgium (where I grew up), and remember being utterly shook up by the film. I have seen it a number of times over the years, and now 4+ decades later continue to be drown to it. The film is remarkable on so many levels. First of all is of course the 65 min. opening of the film, where we get to know this group of people and their community. It is an absolute stroke of genius by the director Michael Cimino, very much in the same way how James Cameron opened ""Titanic"" 20 years later with an hour long introduction of the main characters while ""nothing"" is happening. By the time Mike, Nicky and Stevie arrive in Vietnam in the movie's second hour, we are deeply invested emotionally and otherwise with the well-being of these guys. The movie is most controversial with its brutal Russian Roulette scenes (yes, in plural), which are now acknowledged not to be an accurate reflection of what happened in Vietnam. But it doesn't bother me, as these scenes reflect a bigger point about the absurdity of the Vietnam War. The movie is least effective when, against all odds, Michael goes back to Vietnam to lure Nicky back home, literally as Saigon is about to be overrun by the North Vietnamese. But it doesn't deter from the overall movie experience. Be sure to play close attention to the brilliant production sets. Fictitious Clairton, PA is in reality made up of a number of real life cities, much of it to be found in and around Cleveland elsewhere in Northeast Ohio. That includes the steel factory scenes, shot at the U.S. Steel plant. Of course all of that is long gone. In that sense the movie is now a time capsule of what life was like in the early-to-mid 1970s. Last but not least, just marvel at and enjoy the acting performances of Christopher Walken (who won an Oscar), Meryl Streep (in her Hollywood breakout role, and also Oscar nominated), John Savage, John Cazale (in his last major film before passing away), and least but not least Robert De Niro. Wow, just wow.This was director Michael Cimino's second film only, and yet he was given the confidence to make this epic masterpiece, all while running significantly over budget. Would this be possible in today's Hollywood? I seriously doubt it. I watched ""The Deer Hunter"" again earlier this week on Showtime, and while I am entirely familiar with this film, I still cannot get over how good this remains, now 40+ years later. An absolute masterpiece that stands the test of time, period.",The Deer Hunter

It begins with three Pennsylvania steel workers before their adventures in Vietnam. A wedding scene drags on and on to the point of exhaustion ; we get it Mikey, these are regular middle class people celebrating a marriage, learn how to edit. After the wedding of the century, the boys are at war with its usual atrocities and mayhem all around. The three amigos from Pa are captured by the Vietcong and placed in a prisoner of war camp. The evil guards are bored, so they force the American soldiers to play Russian roulette for gambling and entertainment purposes. A cage immersed in water is used to further punish the invaders who finally escape their captors tower up a return to domestic bliss.The third act of a three hour plus marathon, has the boys returning to the USA and the after effects of the horrible experiences of combat.

68,ianlouisiana,Explores the bounds of friendship and community as none since.,10,22 November 2006,"Mr Robert de Niro is often mooted as the greatest movie actor in America if not the world.Well,not on recent form he isn't.He may well be one of the most omnipresent movie actors in the world,but that isn't quite the same thing.There is a whole generation of moviegoers who have grown up since he last gave a performance that wasn't redolent of over-ripe ham. To them let me introduce ""The Deer Hunter"".Not the DVD with its superfluous ""extras"",not the video with its flickering images and muddy soundtrack,but the movie.In all its widescreen,stereophonic sound all - enveloping glory.Make no mistake,the cinema is the only possible place to fully appreciate Mr Michael Cimino's masterpiece.This isn't some overblown TV mini-series designed to be absorbed in 15 minute bites between adverts for dog food or MacDonalds(there's a difference?). ""The Deer Hunter"" is serious movie - making,requiring the viewer to exercise his or her full attention for a little over three hours. Perhaps the present generation find themselves unable to turn their mobile phones off for that long;certainly many contributors to this site seem unwilling or unable to make the effort to give TDH their full attention for all its 182 minutes.Possibly they'd be happier if Picasso had made ""Guernica"" a lot smaller so it didn't take so much time to look at. TDH is a movie about love and friendship.It's about an immigrant community engaged in the intricate process of retaining its ethnic identity whilst assuming that of its host nation.It's about loyalty,loss and the resilience of the human spirit.And some of it is about war.It happens to be the war in Vietnam,but it could be any war. Soldiers die,get crippled,become traumatised,be it Vietnam,Europe or Iraq. If the Russians had made TDH it would have been hailed as a great humanitarian document - another ""The cranes are flying"".But it was made by the Americans whose capacity for self - hatred is exceeded only by that of the British,and was duly trashed by many so-called intellectuals and opinion-makers,all wracked with fashionable guilt. The only salvageable asset in the movie was adjudged to be Mr de Niro's performance.Denigrators and admirers of the movie alike were united in their admiration for his portrayal of Michael (Cimino?),the charismatic slightly aloof natural leader of the group of young men who willingly go off to war,seeing it as their duty to their community and their community's unspoken obligation to the country that took them in. Michael is a strong-minded moral man imbued with the values of both the Old Country and the new one.A Frontiersman born a hundred years too late perhaps.In the sort of role Mr Gary Cooper might have played thirty years earlier,Mr de Niro is truly inspired.Only as the deeply unlikeable Jake La Motta was he ever near to this level of performance again.Mr Christopher Walken has been caricaturing himself for so long that is a surprise to see him as a hungry young actor,intense and seething with inner energy,playing a man so traumatised by his experiences that his post - war life is one long drawn - out act of suicide. Miss Meryl Streep,now a grande dame of the cinema,is so beautiful and vulnerable that you want to weep.Here she has no funny accent,no mannerisms and she lights up the screen.It is the only performance of hers about which I have absolutely no reservations.When her drunken father punches her I would quite happily have taken out a gun and shot him. Mr Cimino is not a flash - bang - wallop director.He takes the time to establish his characters and their milieu,he is in this for the long haul .To me the wedding sequence is the most interesting and best realised of the movie.All the group dynamics are established here and at the deer hunt.Some of the young men go off to war,some stay at home. The community will carry on whatever happens. That is the crux of this movie.That is why it doesn't matter whether the war is in Vietnam,Europe or Iraq. Ultimately it's the survival of the community that matters,albeit at a high cost.In the controversial last scene where the survivors at first haltingly then more firmly sing ""God Bless America"" it's as a hymn to the community and a defiance to ill - fate .Only incidentally is it an anthem of patriotism. There is no doubt in my mind that ""The Deer Hunter"" is one of the great American movies.It doesn't matter that the hunt itself was filmed in the ""wrong"" mountains,that the VC guards would never have given Mr de Niro a loaded gun......this is not a documentary we're talking about here.Simply put,its scope is huge,its performances uniformly magnificent.Its reach,however ambitious,never exceeds its grasp.Mr Cimino set out to explore the bounds of friendship and community and succeeded as no director has done since.",The Deer Hunter
69,CubsandCulture,"Operatic touches undermine naturalism, glacial pace mutes emotion",7,13 January 2019,"The central image and metaphor of this film-Americans being forced to play Russian Roulette by the Viet Cong-is both maddeningly effective as a cinematic device and works against much of the rest of the film. Whatever you wish to say about the senselessness of war, the Vietnam war especially, is captured by the random cruelty and striking brutality of the roulette scenes. It simply works to dramatize the existential dread veterans must feel. Unfortunately, it also dehumanizes the Viet Cong and simplifies the war into a good vs. evil struggle. More to the point, much of the rest of the film has an easy naturalism to it that stands apart from the roulette scenes. One could argue war should stand apart from everyday life but the film includes other operatic touches. Whether it is a few drops of wine split, deer, or the sun dogs the film has just enough of these things to think the roulette scenes were meant to be a tonal extension of the domestic scenes. But it doesn't fully work. Is the final scene irony or no? The tonal clashes present make answer that question impossible.Nonetheless, the domestic scenes are quite strong; the various guys are fleshed out in ways that are human and authentically blue collar. The first hour and the final 15 minutes or so are gripping and emotionally powerful due to this. Much of this is due to the cast being who they are as the pace works against emotional release. Indeed the film simply feels like it stops at times and this creates a weird sense of narrative momentum. The film is bit draining s a result but a slightly tighter editing scheme would have been better.This is an unusual film combining several different sources of inspiration-a heist story, Vietnam, and the director's (alleged) life. The result is a sprawling film that is not as strong as it could have been. But the times it is effortlessly cinematic is worth the warts.",The Deer Hunter

71,barnabyrudge,"Compelling study of the effects of war, excellent in parts but not incisive enough as a whole.",8,1 October 2006,"The Deer Hunter is a powerful, disturbing, but somewhat overlong film about life for a group of young American steelworkers before, during and after Vietnam. In fact, this was one of the first films to deal with the Vietnam conflict. The middle section, set in SE Asia and dealing with the experiences of the men in a Vietcong prison camp, spares us nothing whatsoever in its depiction of the horrors of war.Three young Pennsylvanian steelworkers head off to fight in Vietnam. First, there's Michael (Robert De Niro), an emotionally strong and determined type who is almost homo-erotically protective of his friends. Then there's Steven (John Savage), an unassuming and naïve guy who gets married just before heading off to war. Finally, there's Nick (Christopher Walken), outwardly a normal everyday guy but after the fighting the most emotionally shattered of the trio. After attending Steven's wedding, the guys head up into the mountains for a deer hunt. Soon after that, they head for 'Nam, where they are captured by the Vietcong and imprisoned in a half-submerged swamp POW camp. Occasionally the men are taken out of their cages and forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors, a lethal game in which two men take it turns to place a gun loaded with one bullet against their head  the loser being the unlucky one who clicks the trigger when it gets to the loaded chamber. After traumatic experiences in the Vietcong prison, the three guys finally escape but are separated as they make their getaway. After various adventures, Michael makes it back to America, where he discovers that Steven is now a crippled paraplegic following an accident during his escape from the Vietcong. Worse still, he learns that Nick is still in Vietnam, no longer a US soldier but instead a suicidal wreck who plays Russian Roulette night after night in seedy alleys and bars to make money. Michael returns to Vietnam to persuade Nick to come back home with him, but finds the nihilistic influence of war has pushed Nick's mind beyond the point of no return.The performances in the film are absolutely brilliant. De Niro is memorable as a natural born survivor. Savage evokes aching sympathy as the just-married kid who ends up wheelchair-bound before he can enjoy fulfilment with his wife. John Cazale is terrific as Stan, one of the guys from back home who doesn't go to war and who cannot understand how it is that his friends come back so dramatically altered. And best of all is Walken, simply stunning as the vulnerable man who becomes locked in a doomed obsession with the game of Russian Roulette. Less impressive is the rambling script by Deric Washburn, which features heavy-handed symbolism and fails to make any of the film's three main sections as incisive as they ought to be. The script rises to moments of undeniable power, but in between there's a lot of meaningless extraneous detail to be waded through. The moving score by Stanley Mann and John Williams is actually lifted from an earlier film (The Walking Stick, released in 1970) but suits the mournful mood of this film just as perfectly. Heavily symbolic and flawed as it is, The Deer Hunter is still a tremendously compelling movie. and it actually grows in stature the more times you watch it.",The Deer Hunter

It doesn't hold your interest, and is best seen in clumps. That said, it gives a half way accurate, realistic viewpoint of regular working folks during the Viet Nam War. How it affects them, before they see war, and afterwards. There are liberties taken. For instance, the three home town buddies are assigned together in Viet Nam. I've been in the Air Force, and that's just not something that is done. I'm sure the other branches are the same way. But that is poetic license. The chief character, De Niro, descends into madness. He begins with a very stable attitude. The sort of character you feel won't go berserk.That is what the script intended. He is the stable force, or at least the outwardly stable force. When he returns from the war, he has changed. On his regular hunting trips he reveals the change, until fellow hunter, Cazale, who plays a likable bum, irritates him into near insanity. De Niro issues his famous line ""This is this!"" And of course it is an insane line, but just the sort of line such a man would say. Not for someone who wants a lot of action. In fact, the hunting trip scenes are more interesting than the war scenes. Still, a very good psychological portrayal, and excellent acting make this one what it is.

The movie took the long way in planting the pre-war lives into the audiences' minds, that the contrast in the post-war only need a few sequences to make. The war scenes are also greatly done. This feels somewhat special since the movie doesn't depict much on the war side. Yet the movie succeeded in exploiting the more dangerous side of war, the psychological side of it. The whole psychological game of the Russian roulette gets to be the nice metaphor, getting repeated several times along the movie. The acting overall is just great.

79,Movie-ManDan,An Emotionally Shattering Film That I Can't Recommend Enough.,10,16 January 2015,"The Deer Hunter is a fascinating and intensively depressing movie that speaks levels. It won 1978's Oscar for Best Picture, despite its features. This was before Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. It follows the same pattern of the effects of war, but The Deer Hunter is by far the saddest.The Deer Hunter follows a group of blue-collar factory workers (De Niro, Cazale, Savage, Walken) in Pennsylvania who enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. As a three-hour epic, the film is divided into three parts: before war, war, and after war. The before war bit seems unnecessary and skippable, but it needs viewing just as much as the other scenes. We get a good look at each of their lives, with a main focus on De Niro and Walken. Savage gets married and the wedding bit is long and could be skipped. When the men go off to war, the horrors of Apocalypse Now and Platoon are squashed into less than an hour. Because this is its own creation and did not take anything from any movie, it is unique in that sense. In fact, because all the horrors of war are looked upon and condensed cleverly, and since the characters are so well-developed in the first period, the war bit is sadder and more intense than Apocalypse Now and Platoon. There's Russian Roulette and exploitation that is handled better than these phonies like 12 Years A Slave and Unbroken. When they get out of war, that is when the shattering begins. All men are scarred for life, with Walken a completely changed man whose world is quickly crumbling. He becomes obsessed with Russian Roulette and De Niro attempts to save him. All men are much different than how they were in the first Act. The first Act requires viewing to see exactly how war affects people. The first Act shows how they are, the third Act shows what they become, and the second Act shows how they become it. Because this tends to focus more on the before and after bits of war and not so much of the war itself, it is the best study of war effects and psychological messes. Even if you don't want to see a war movie and are just interested in people's minds and psychology, The Deer Hunter is the movie for you. If you want to see a first rate character study and first rate acting, The Deer Hunter is the movie for you. No matter your intentions, The Deer Hunter will not disappoint and you will never forget the effects on you.",The Deer Hunter

81,eric262003,One to Actually See To Be Intrigued,9,18 February 2013,".In order for you to fully understand the concepts of ""The Deer Hunter"", you have to watch it carefully to get the feel of the movie. May I remind you before I continue my review, this movie is a three hour epic. So with that that in mind those who have short attention spans, it's never too late to turn away now, but if those who can sit through the slow, progressive pace with patience and perseverance, this is truly a treasured movie for the ages. Back in the late 1970's there have been an influx of epic movies that went past the three hour mark. Even though the movie caters to a general audience, it's really not custom-made for everyone to enjoy. It has a cornucopia of genres thrown into the story like romance, drama, mystery, horror and most of all the triumphs and turmoil of the Vietnam War that was still haunting the United States even though the war ended three years before ""The Deer Hunter"" was released. Sure the facets of the film was centred around the concept of friendship, it also gave an insight of the Vietnam War and the physical and mental harm it affected the soldiers who fought in this war.The images captured in ""The Deer Hunter"" was extremely believable. There is no Hollywood concocting or glorifying the dreadful events of the Vietnam War and it doesn't have any artistic merit to the movie though the cinematography is quite sublime. The story often balances of congruency and at the same time it's off its kilter. The characters' development are not entirely coherent as there's little background provided for them and the psychological aspects are not very fulfilling either. What it does have is strong connections to the relationship of the characters which is based on friendship as each deserve our sympathy after what they've experienced during the Vietnam War. There's a lot of shock-value in the story and of course the one that sticks out is the infamous Russian Roulette scenario which was real and quite memorable in a not so good way.Robert DeNiro plays the leading role as Michael Vronsky, an introverted individual who only speaks if there's something that needs to be said and is smitten by a young lady named Linda (played by a young Meryl Streep). Linda plans on marrying Nick (Christopher Walken), who's friends with Mike while their other friend Steven (John Savage) and his new wife Angela (Rutanya Alda). The triad celebrate their enlisting into the Vietnam War. Meanwhile three other friends named Axel (Chuck Aspegren), Stanley (John Cazale) and John (George Dzundza) request to stay behind in the semi-condemned small town of Clairton, Pennsylvania as they anticipate their return. The alliance have quite a few similarities to one another. They all work in steel factory, they enjoy the sport of deer hunting and they all love a harmonious drink of beer. Again director Michael Cimino focuses on the realism of the settings and the characters. There are times when the movie has a few scenes where little action happens and are not in sync with the plot, but as long as they keep it real, is what makes it all the more settling.And just like you would expect on the effects of people who fought during the Vietnam War, psychological scarring takes place and the bonding of friendship begins to falter. The good moments are lost in the carnage as the friends try to rectify what was once the balance that brought them together. Michael is the balance of the scale as he tries to piece together the foundation of the three friends, but he could only do so much even though he deserves an ""A"" for effort. And the more he tries to be the peacemaker of the triad, the more frustrated he becomes as he can find no way to mend this once strong friendship that has now crumbled. Nick has become a shell of his former self as he's now become a prisoner of war for all to see. Steven is now a cripple and is now institutionalized by his wife. In the meantime, Linda has become a lost soul and just wants to be with a man to seek comfort with. The emotions are sad but they play off very gratifying.In all due sincerity, ""The Deer Hunter"" is anything but entertaining. You must be in a certain position of mind when to look for the engaging scenes and which scenes to fast-forward to. If you're like me who liked the movie, please watch again for stuff you may have missed. And for those who can't sit through a three hour epic (nothing bad not everybody can) then maybe this is not the movie for you. There's a lot of gripping stuff that demands our viewing.",The Deer Hunter
82,JuguAbraham,"""One shot"" movie",7,25 November 2000,"Viewing the movie after a gap of 15 years, I was disappointed with the film. My favourite Vilmos Zsigmond (photography) was below average and the film limped along because of above average performances from the players and some fine editing. The ""one shot"" theme of the film is powerful, ""One-shot"" with your fate, your love, your game... but does it make a great movie? You do see the movie go into top gear when you see the silent military man at the wedding. Cimino shows flashes of brilliance but I don't think this movie (forget the subject) is classy at all times.

83,Chase_Witherspoon,This is this ...,9,16 September 2011,"Difficult to encapsulate a three-hour epic which essentially essays two divergent genres; the first hour a drama that establishes the characters as relatively care-free steel-workers in Pensylvania, bonding as deer hunters in their spare time, who volunteer to tour Vietnam, a decision that results in catastrophic consequences for each in different ways. The next hour is a war zone; captured by the enemy, and forced to engage in Russian Roulette, their experience manifests differently in each character - Savage virtually disintegrates, Walken is left battle-scarred and eventually drug-addled, while the once outgoing DeNiro emerges as the most intact.The final thirty minutes illustrates life after the events, a devastating reality that nothing will ever be the same again; DeNiro's attempt to rescue Walken from his catatonic existence while sensational, is still moving and perhaps one of the more memorable moments in film.With classic guitarist John Williams' ""Il Cavatina"" underscoring, a talented cast that includes young Meryl Streep, and some potent battle scenes (the gritty, almost unbearable tension of the Russian roulette scenes won't soon be forgotten), there's plenty of memorable material that make ""The Deer Hunter"" a benchmark in film making.",The Deer Hunter
84,bandw,Loses a lot on a second viewing,7,24 May 2010,"(Spoilers) I saw this movie in its original release and, upon a recent viewing, I could remember the basic idea of the story that follows three steel workers from their roots in a small Pennsylvania town, to a tour of duty in Vietanm, then back home. What I remembered clearly were the Russian roulette scenes. These are big gut grabbers, but when I started to think about them in more detail, I began to question why they were in there beyond their being attention getters. The only reason I can see is their being a metaphor for the random violence and killing of war--but we already knew that. The scenes do not make a lot of sense. The games were surrounded by much chaos and heavy betting. As presented it appeared that a given game was played until one of the players lost his life and, if the betting was on who ""won,"" then it would be a fifty-fifty bet and hardly a cause for such hooting and hollering. If the betting was on how long a game would last, then the distribution of wins and losses would be complicated and require the skill of a Vegas croupier to resolve. In any case the betters are seen throwing wads of money down into a pile on a table and I don't see how the money could ever have been properly split up among the winners. Given how much money Nick sent back to Steven the winner was apparently amply rewarded, but how he was paid off was not clear. By the time Michael catches up with him Nick's mind is so shot he does not even recognize his old friend, so how is it that Nick had the wherewithal to send money to Steven? If so, how did he arrange for that? Where were the betters getting all that money? The odds of Nick's winning as many times as implied would be astronomical. The bottom line for me was to find the Russian roulette scenes quite unbelievable and that undercut my appreciation of the whole movie, since those scenes are pivotal. And is it to be believed that Michael could find Nick in the total chaos of the fall of Saigon?The hunting scenes struck me as odd. Nowhere near Pennsylvania are there mountains like the ones in those scenes. Perhaps those scenes were a warning to the audience that a good deal of the movie is to be symbolic rather than realistic, but I found the scenes precursors to a disjointed sequencing that persisted throughout the remainder of the film. Some of the symbolism is a bit too obvious. For example, during Steven's wedding the bride and groom are asked to drink chalices of wine and if they can do so without spilling any, they will have good luck. Then we see some small droplets of wine spilled on the bride's gown, symbolizing the bloodshed to come.One thing that is well executed is the discrepancy between the youthful (perhaps played by actors not quite youthful enough) naivety of the three protagonists pre-war and the difficult post-war fallout. The bonding of the circle of the male friends pre-war had all of the maturity of early teens. By the end of the movie Nick was dead, Steven had lost his legs and was suffering mental and physical readjustments, and Michael, the strongest, was having his own problems reentering society. In fact the often puzzling reactions Michael had to returning home were for me the most moving scenes in the movie.A good part of the first act of the movie is an exceptionally beautiful filming of Steven's wedding in a Russian orthodox church. That segment is almost worth the price of admission by itself.I can't quarrel with the acting--the fine cast turns in quality performances. The editing is sometimes quite effective. After the wedding sequences we are abruptly put into the middle of the fighting in Vietnam; this emphasizes how the three friends must have viewed the transition. For those who lived through the Vietnam era, this movie will most likely bring back a lot of painful memories.I find that most good movies improve on second viewing. This was an exception for me. I could not get beyond the improbabilities and emotional manipulations the second time around.",The Deer Hunter
85,Takethispunch,Good drama film,10,18 December 2016,"In Clairton, a small working class town in western Pennsylvania, in late 1967, Russian-American steel workers Michael ""Mike"" Vronsky (Robert De Niro), Steven Pushkov (John Savage), and Nikanor ""Nick"" Chevotarevich (Christopher Walken), with the support of their friends and co-workers Stan (John Cazale) and Peter ""Axel"" Axelrod (Chuck Aspegren) and local bar owner and friend John Welsh (George Dzundza), prepare for two rites of passage: marriage and military service. The opening scenes set the traits of the three main characters. Mike is the no-nonsense, serious, but unassuming leader; Steven the loving, groom-to-be, pecked-at by his mother; and Nick the quiet, introspective man who loves deer hunting because, he likes ""the treesthe way the trees are"". The recurring theme of hunting with ""one shot"", which is how Mike prefers to take down a deer, is introduced.Before the trio ships out, Steven and his girlfriend Angela (Rutanya Alda), who is pregnant by another man, but loved by Steven nonetheless, marry in a Russian Orthodox wedding. In the meantime, Mike works to control his feelings for Nick's girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). At the wedding reception held at the local VFW hall, the guys drink, dance, sing, and enjoy the festivities, but then notice a soldier in a U.S. Army Special Forces uniform.",The Deer Hunter
86,sme_no_densetsu,A classic of seventies cinema,8,7 August 2011,"Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" took home the coveted Best Picture Oscar for 1978. However, Cimino's time in the sun was short-lived since the ""Heaven's Gate"" debacle of a couple of years later irrevocably damaged his career. Nevertheless, this film shows Cimino to be an accomplished craftsman.The story concerns a group of working class males in small-town America just prior to shipping off to Vietnam for a tour of duty. The movie opens on the eve of the wedding of one of the three, immediately after which they go off for one last deer hunt. From there, the movie follows them to their destination and back again, focusing on the effect that the war has on each of their lives and the lives of their loved ones back home.The movie sports an enviable cast. They don't get much better than Robert De Niro & Meryl Streep, both of whom garnered Oscar nominations for their performances here. Then there's the inimitable Christopher Walken in his Oscar-winning role. Also in support, John Cazale & John Savage both contribute standout performances.Michael Cimino's direction & Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography combine to produce an exceedingly attractive film. Cimino was rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts while Zsigmond had to content himself with just a nomination (he'd won the previous year anyway). On the other hand, I found the score to be a bit of a mixed bag. The theme (performed by classical guitarist John Williams, not to be confused with composer John Williams) is memorable but the majority of Stanley Myers' music is undistinguished and pales next to the visuals.All in all, the movie shows plenty of technical polish in addition to several fine performances. That being said, there are some who take issue with the film's politics and also the artistic license with regard to the Russian roulette scenes. Personally, I don't see the film as being particularly one-sided and I appreciate the Russian roulette angle as a metaphor rather than a reflection of actual events. But, by all means, check out this thought-provoking picture for yourself and form your own opinions.",The Deer Hunter
87,frankde-jong,The best film about the Vietnamese war ever,9,14 March 2021,"In my opinion ""The deer hunter"" is the best Vietnam movie ever, although ""Apocalypse now"" (1979, Francis Ford Coppola) may be more spectacular.Most of the film is situated in Pennsylvania and only the middle part plays in Vietnam. My experience is that war films partly located outside the frontline are the best. Examples are ""Full metal jacket"" (1987, Stanley Kubrick, about the Vietnam war but also about the trainingcamp preparing for the war) and ""The best years of our lives (1946, William Wyler, about the Second World war and in particular about re-integrating the former soldiers in civilian life again). ""The best years of our lives is a film about (the consequences of) the war that plays exclusively away from the frontlineAs said, ""The deer hunter"" is a triptych of which the first and third part play in Pennsylvania. In the first part we meet the main characters on a wedding, a way of introduction also used in ""The Godfather"" (1972, Francis Ford Coppola). The main characters know each other because they are collegues in a steel mill. The film is clearly situated in a blue collar social environment. Most of the recruitment of the Vietnam soldiers took place in this social environment while the elite was able to exempt their sons in one way or another. The fact if someone had done duty in Vietnam or not was a sensitive issue in American politics for a long time.The third part of the movie again plays in Pennsylvania. All of the main characters have lost something, their legs, their senses or ""only"" their illusions. When they are sitting along a table at a reunion and start singing ""God bless America"" the mood is unmistakably sad, above all in comparison with the wedding from the first part.Most of the criticism of the movie focuses on the second part of the movie. Because of the Vietnamese cruelty shown in this part the film is said to be pro American. I don't agree with this criticism. Yes the Vietnamese are cruel, but the Americans are never portrayed as Rambo like hero's. Besides, the use of Russian roulette is in my eyes a perfect metaphor for the arbitrariness ans uselessnes of war.
""The deer hunter"" was a big commercial success and director Michael Cimino had no problems financing his next project. When ""Heavens gate"" (1980) however turned out to be a big commercial disaster this had a big influence on the film industry of the '80s. The companies became more risk averse and there was lot of milking out successful formula's in the form of sequels.The cast of ""The deer hunter"" consisted of some until then relatively unknown young actors who would rise to stardom in later years. See for example Robert de Niro and Meryl Streep.",The Deer Hunter
88,Xstal,The Deer Hunter Gatherer...,8,1 October 2020,"Nothing prepares us for a life in the so called modern world but we partake in the traditions passed on to us through family, friends and colleagues, at home, out socialising and in the workplace. It's called culture and, for the most part, it keeps us safe and secure, as the bonds we develop make us feel a part of the fabric but it's still psychologically a challenge to the hunter gatherers mind - increasingly so today.Put that mind into war, battles, conflict, abuse, threat and it's anyone's guess what might result. Put that mind into the events portrayed here, albeit quite extreme, and you have the basis for a fascinating insight into the cultural and social destruction that conflict can reap through individuals, as well as entire populations, and continue to do so long after the truce has been declared.Mix into the portrayal some of the finest actors of their generation, perhaps of all time, and you have a genuinely timeless anti-war reflection that, in itself, should be enough to dissuade the most sabre rattling politico, who genuinely cares about their citizens, to put their swords away and resolve any differences peacefully. Unfortunately, recent history suggests otherwise.",The Deer Hunter
89,TheUnknown837-1,surprisingly impressive and unique Vietnam War film that takes on a different perspective,10,16 January 2007,"In 1978, somewhat inexperienced filmmaker Michael Cimino wrote the screenplay and directed a sort of personal film project. Casting future Oscar-winners Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep along with many others, he created a film based on the horrors of the Vietnam War. But what I mostly love about ""The Deer Hunter"" is that it takes on a different kind of perspective than most Vietnam War films do. The movie itself doesn't concentrate a whole lot on war itself, but more on the effects and aftermaths of war. How it can change the lives of a person, or people, forever.This is the kind of movie that should be shown to people who believe that war and combat are fun and enjoyable acts. Because you could be your average, everyday person with a great life (like these characters) and then get thrown into a war you never asked for. Even IF you get out alive, your life will never be the same. You could live the rest of your life without a limb or two, or without your best friend, or just simply live with the fact that you took the lives of another person.""The Deer Hunter"" is made up of three major sections. The first of which is about our main characters and their happy lives before they were sent to Vietnam. The second is their experience in war. And the third, and definitely best, is their new life home, where things will never be the same again. There are several emotionally devastating moments in the film.Unfortunately, after the success of ""The Deer Hunter"", Michael Cimino directed a film that was the exact opposite. ""Heaven's Gate"" was a disaster, a box office failure, and a bad film. So we may never again see a Michael Cimino picture like this. But I will remember it.",The Deer Hunter
90,mstomaso,Powerful Examination of the Effects of the Viet Nam War on the American Psyche,9,24 May 2008,"Michael Cimino's Oscar-winning drama The Deer Hunter, examines the devastated lives of a few Viet Nam veterans and their friends and families back home. The story centers around Mike (DeNiro) a quiet man with a strong sense of responsibility and an ambiguous moral character. In his immediate orbit are his two closest friends - Nick (Walken) and Nick's young wife Linda (Streep). With the war over, Nick wants to put things right in his home town, but finds that his society may not have an easy place for him and his fellow POWs to come home to.Through nicely integrated flashbacks, we learn who Mike and his friends are before and during the war. Nick, Mike and their friend Stevie were captured and forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors. The meaninglessness of life symbolized by this deadly game is an excellent dramatic device alluding to the war itself, and the clash of cultures that it involved. Each man's participation in the game would, to an extent, both literally and figuratively, determine the course of the rest of their lives, no matter how long or short.The entire cast is excellent and Cimino gets exactly what was needed out of them all, but Walken and DeNiro are truly incredible. The two men not only have great on-screen chemistry, but yield performances which, for most actors, would be considered performances of a lifetime. Anybody who has ever questioned the talent of either of these two men should be forced to watch this film.The story is not very highly embellished and will bore those with poor attention spans and/or limited ranges of emotion. The action sequences and special effects are few and far between - and entirely realistic. The soundtrack is virtually unnoticeable and never gets in the way of the story. The settings are lovely and provide an appropriate contrast to the disturbing story.The Deer Hunter is a psychologically devastating examination of a traumatized nation, where those who participated in the war are completely aware in every waking moment of what was lost and those at home have been sold a huge pack of lies. As relevant to Americans of the Bush era as it was to those of the Nixon era, this film well deserves the awards and acclaim it has retained for the last 20+ years.Highly recommended, but not for the timid.",The Deer Hunter
91,mentalcritic,A mixed bag...,8,5 November 2004,"John Cazale's last film is not the one he is remembered for, and perhaps it is best that way. Not that the film is necessarily bad, it's just very mixed. After viewing the film on DVD, the inordinate length of some scenes is enough to make one grateful for the PAL speedup. That the DVD released by Universal Home Video only has sixteen chapter stops, no subtitles, and a somewhat uneven audio mix, only serves to highlight the flaws in the film.Don't think that I am knocking this film simply because I have a short attention span. I have seen enough slow and languid films to know that sometimes, a slow story can be an intriguing story. But in order to make the viewer sit through a slow and languid piece, you have to compensate for the pace with character development and tension. Granted, there is tension in The Deer Hunter, but it is uneven, and insufficient to keep the viewer interested.As often happens in a film with an ensemble cast, the burden of keeping the story interesting falls upon its stars. This is one reason why The Deer Hunter would never be made in today's system. With some notable exceptions, the stars of today are just not compelling enough to hold interest. Robert De Niro demonstrates why he is one of the few stars to have won an Oscar for a role where most of his lines aren't in English. Even his bad films, the Rocky And Bullwinkle revival comes to mind, are a cut above some modern stars' best.John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all demonstrate that they can act circles around most. While Cazale died long before his time, Savage and Walken have since appeared in numerous pieces where they make many other actors look as if they're not even trying. Here, their performances make their characters memorable long after one has forgotten about the story. Which is just as well, because some of the scenes are so distended, and not in a good way, that it truly boggles the mind to hear that there was ever a four-hour cut. The two-hour cut could have told the story with as much detail.I gave The Deer Hunter an eight out of ten. With a different cast, it would have been a four, but Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale all earn the film an extra point each. It's certainly worth seeing for the curiosity factor alone.",The Deer Hunter
92,jaredmobarak,One shot,10,22 July 2006,"Michael Cimino's masterpiece The Deer Hunter is one of the greatest films ever made. Concerning a group of steel worker friends in Pennsylvania, the movie shows us the comradery and good natured fun they enjoy together leading up to their departure for Vietnam. We open on the day of Stevie's (John Savage) wedding, a joyous time before the hell that will soon swallow them whole. A very traditional Russian ceremony leads into a raucous reception at a friend's bar (George Dzundza), where at its conclusion Robert De Niro's Michael and Christopher Walken's Nick make a pact to not leave each other behind during the war. These two are best friends of the kind that nothing else matters. Michael says before their deer hunt, one last go before shipping off, that if it wasn't for Nick he'd go alone, the other guys are just idiots, he doesn't need them.There is an abrupt cut over to the jungles and helicopters of Vietnam. De Niro is killing with anger in his eyes; the hunt has higher stakes now that humans are involved. Who knows how much time has passed, but coming off the helicopter is Nick and Stevie, physically having to hit Michael out of his cold stare to acknowledge the reunion. It's short lived, however, as they are captured and taken to a hut to be used in a game of Russian Roulette for entertainment. Here is where we see the leadership Michael has had all his life come to the front. Only he has the courage to get them through the game for an escape. Once he and Nick carry Stevie off into the jungle and see a friendly aircraft to save them, we reach the moment of disconnection. Savage's Stevie is in no shape to board the chopper and after Nick goes in, De Niro jumps down to save his friend. This one action leads each character down a path they cannot turn away from. Michael knows his friend Nick is safely away and that he can bring Stevie to safety, Stevie realizes the utter futility of his situation and the lack of courage to have pulled through without Michael, and Nick knows nothing of his friends, but the abandonment of being saved and letting them be lost down in the trenches.Stevie's disillusion, Michael's strength of character, and Nick's sense of abandoning those he loved will drive them throughout the rest of the epic three-hour film. The acting is riveting and the emotion palpable. What of their travails can be spoken of upon returning home, shells of the men they were before? The war has scarred them to the point where they are distant to their friends who wish to shower them with love that they don't think they can share anymore. De Niro's second hunt towards the end of the film perfectly shows his evolution, once he stands face to face with his tracked buck and realizes what he must do. De Niro is entrancing throughout and gives one of the greatest performances of his career. He is the tough guy, older brother to his friends who must sacrifice his own happiness for those he loves.Besides the three main actors, the supporting cast holds true throughout. The late great John Cazale plays the friend whose attitude can be forgiven in the beginning, but not post-war, where he becomes childish and unlearned in the real value of life. A late confrontation with De Niro is a powerful scene showing the huge distance Vietnam has put between those who went and those who stayed. Dzundza is a giant teddy-bear of a man constantly shown with an infectious smile and good-natured life. Meryl Streep is top-notch, as always, playing the woman loved by both Nick and Michael. Her photo becomes the main crux of the film when De Niro's glimpse of it tells him he must go back home after he made sure his friends were out of the line of fire and Walken's glimpse just reminds him of those he thinks he left behind and seals his decision to never return to America. Christopher Walken is by far the showstopper. His slow and believable descent into hell is heartwrenching to watch. What once was a fun-loving man, looking to marriage upon return home, becomes a broken vessel with no reason to live. The climax of he and De Niro sitting across from each other in one last game of Russian Roulette will be ingrained in your mind forever.",The Deer Hunter
93,marcin_kukuczka,Serving character development proudly and truthfully,9,13 April 2008,"Some movies are really like wine - the older - the better, the more haunting and the more captivating. That can be said about THE DEER HUNTER by Michael Cimino, a psychological film at various levels of analysis, an entertainment with marvelous performances and visuals and a piece of cinematic work that constitutes a true insight into the decadence of war and, foremost, its harmful influence. Let me look at these aspects in more details.I have encountered few movies that really did so much for the thought provoking character development. THE DEER HUNTER is really a pioneer in this case. Of course, this development goes in pairs with long moments but is it possible to get to know someone, understand their decisions and actions without stopping for a while? From the very beginning, we have an image of who the characters are, what their dreams are, what their relations are built upon. They visit bars, sing popular songs, drink beer, sometimes behave obscenely but know basic responsibilities by working hard in the factory and getting married. Among them is a true deer hunting buff: Michael (Robert DeNiro) who does not skip any opportunity to go to the mountains and shoot the deer. Steven (John Savage) gets married to Angela and what a wedding it is! Nick (Christopher Walken) also has a girlfriend, Linda (Meryl Streep), and plans a life with her, the rest, including Stan, Axel live rather light hearted lives. Yet, politics steps in and Mike, Nick and Steven leave for Vietnam. There, they see what life in hatred is. There, they realize what experiencing war really means. There, they start to miss terribly, miss their families, miss their dreams, miss their homeland Pennsylvania, miss America. Although some are lucky to come back, life's no longer the same. There is a lifelong impact of fighting on the psyche of young men. Killing the deer no longer seems to be so simple, using gun is no longer such fun... since can life, though filled with medals and courage, remain the same after the horror of war? That character development and character change appear to reach such a genuine level that we, as viewers, are constantly surprised with the things the characters do. In real life, we are also surprised with people's actions because, as we know them, we usually do not expect them to do this or that. The same genuine reaction is when watching the film: it seems that we know them and, despite this fact, they appear to surprise us.But except for this purely psychological aspect of the movie (and historical one in the background), the director flawlessly manages to supply the viewer with visual marvels. I will never forget the stunning moment of deer hunting: the mountains, blissful landscapes, subtle soundtrack do make a haunting effect. It is also important to mention the symbolic aspect of visuals. Among them, there is one technically brilliant moment when Nick is in hospital and we see a big American flag. In a while, the camera directs our attention towards background coffins. Naturally, everyone who notices this is led to a sort of reflection: can war mean anything else, anything more than just the destruction of life, the night of humanity? But nice and memorable moments also include wit. Don't skip the pack of friends visiting bars and mountains.The performances are brilliant from all of the cast. Robert DeNiro does a terrific job as Mike. He is a sort of ""macho"" who is also ready for tears and prayer and whose character is mostly touched by the horrific sadness and despair. Christopher Walken portrays Nick, an exceptionally interesting character: absorbed by a trap of the Russian roulette that leads him to personal tragedy... Meryl Streep is beautiful and talented as Linda who looks for love. Her behavior seems to be unfair for Nick yet, it proves her quest for love. The character that always touches me is Steven portrayed by John Savage. His terrible fate in Vietnam brings him to life on wheelchair; yet, finally, he does not lose a smile and optimism.Finally, despite the fact that really much has been said about the movie, I sort of categorized its viewers. It appears that a group of people have criticized it, other group have praised it, and very few viewers remained indifferent. It means that you are bound to evaluate it, you are more likely to be for or against it than stay neutral. One of the reasons for that radical view appears to be the powerful message of Cimino's movie. WHAT, in fact, ARE WAR AND KILLING? I personally consider THE DEER HUNTER one of the thought provoking pearls that says with power: NO MORE WAR... not keeping in mind the idea of war that the hippies spread in the 1960s but the idea of war preceded by lifelong reflections of many people who have seen what this horror means and what impact it has on life and psyche. A highly recommended movie!Yes, let us sing in the final prayer of the movie with the survivors: God Bless America and lead this country out of darkness of terrorism into light of the mountains, lakes and prairies, into the light bringing a new dawn of peace.",The Deer Hunter
94,gftbiloxi,A Deeply Flawed Masterpiece,9,21 April 2005,"THE DEER HUNTER opens with a long and complex sequence depicting events surrounding an elaborate wedding in the Polish-American community of a steel mill town--and then vaults several of that community's young men into a hellish vision of the Vietnam war, from which the survivors return so completely changed that they no longer fit into the community from which they originally came.There are several critical issues with THE DEER HUNTER. When it was first released, audiences were very positive about the film--but they complained about the opening ""home town"" sequence, which they described as slow and over-long. The studio accordingly edited the sequence to half its original length--but when the edited version was shown, audiences were considerably less enthusiastic about the film, and the edited portion was restored.Today audiences still complain about the opening sequence, seldom realizing that it provides the point of comparison that makes the remainder of the film so powerful--and in any case, this fact is something that can only be recognized by viewers in hindsight, a circumstance that does not help them weather the first portion of the movie when they actually see it. Many also complain that the plot is improbable. Once the three leads (Robert De Niro, John Savage, and Christopher Walken) reach Vietnam, they are unexpectedly reunited just in time to be captured and tortured together. In the film's most famous scene, the three are forced to play Russian roulette against each other--and although they escape, one is maimed (Savage) and the other (Walken) so emotionally traumatized that he vanishes into Vietnamese underworld, where he re-enacts the horror of his torture by playing Russian roulette as a gambling game.But for all its glitchiness, THE DEER HUNTER is a remarkably intense, remarkably disturbing film--particularly when the discharged De Niro returns home only to find himself surrounded by old friends whose 'broads and beer' lives seem incredibly trivial in comparison to his own experience. He has changed; they have not; what has been lost cannot be recovered. But there can be a sort of redemption through an acceptance of the change that has been forced upon him--and by trying to bring others who have suffered to that same acceptance.Cimino's direction and overall vision is loose, to say the least, but he draws extraordinary performances from an extraordinary cast. De Niro gives what may be the most subtle performance of his entire career in this film. Christopher Walken's performance (he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) is justly famous, and although often overlooked, John Savage is every bit his equal; Meryl Streep is also memorable in one of her earliest big-screen roles. And bitter as the film is, it still speaks of honor, integrity, hope, and bonds of friendship and community that can never be broken. Deeply flawed--but a masterpiece nonetheless.Gary F.

95,johno-21,Wins Best Picture out of a weak field of nominated films of 1978,7,27 March 2006,"I remember working across the street from a movie theater when this film came out and seeing the theater goers looking depressed and saying nothing to each other as the screenings would let out. I went to see it for myself and could see why they were so affected. It definitely is a dark and depressing movie. Very little comic relief. This film went head to head with another anti-Vietnam movie, Coming Home, for the 1978 Academy Awards. The two films together received 17 nominations and got five wins. Deer Hunter beat out Coming Home with nine nominations and five including the big one for Best Picture. Michael Cimino won for Best Director and was nominated for Best Screenplay in only his second directorial film who as a screenwriter before Deer Hunter he had success with Silent Running and Magnum force. Christopher Walken won for Best Supporting Actor in a role that would help define his career. Best Editing went to Peter Zimmer who had edited Godfather I and II and In Cold Blood among his many films. The film's fifth Oscar was for Best Sound. Rober De Niro was nominated for Best Actor and probably should have won but lost out to John Voight in Coming Home. Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Vilmos Zsigmond was nominated for Best Cinematography. Zsigmond photographed a string of big films in the 70's including Deliverence, Cinderella Liberty, MdCabe and Mrs. Miller and Sugarland Express and was a strong contender for the Oscar for his work on Deer Hunter. This film starts with a wedding and ends with a funeral with the Vietnam War in Between. It's opening is meant to build the characters but is far too long. A lot of the film is so implausible that's it hard to get ignore. lot's of violence here in it's depiction of events that are historically inaccurate that brings fabling to the story. Also in the cast are John Cazale in his last film and John Savage. This film has a lot going for it but I've passed on it many times over the years when it's come on television. It's good film-making with a strong cast but not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",The Deer Hunter

The Deer Hunter was released in 1978. It was directed by Michael Cimino. The film received high critical acclaim, won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and Cimino was even hailed as a genius. The film boasts a great cast, including Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage and Meryl Streep. They all provide stellar performances.The film's story is set during the 1960s in western Pennsylvania. It's about a group of friends from a Russian (or Rusyn, to be more precise) community. The men are steel workers. Three of them (Michael, Steven and Nick) are preparing to be sent off to Vietnam. Steven is also getting married. Michael and Nick are in love with the same woman: Linda (Meryl Streep). The beginning of the film features wedding ceremonies and a long party. Eastern Orthodox Church songs such as Slava and Russian folk songs such as Korobushka and Katyusha are played. Before setting out for the war the six friends go deer hunting. The film documents their lives before Vietnam, in Vietnam, and after Vietnam.Right from the get go I knew that I was watching a great film. Some viewers may think that it's long and boring, but if you continue watching it, it will pay off big time. Character development is significant, and it's a big part of the film. After a while I really began to care about the characters. That's how the film absorbs you, not with action or comedy but by showing the lives and actions of the characters. The scenes in Vietnam are graphic, but well shot. I heard that The Deer Hunter was the first American film about the Vietnam War. What happens in the film is totally believable. If I was told that this was a true story I wouldn't doubt it. There is also a fitting ending. After watching The Deer Hunter I felt better, somehow. It's like it raises you confidence and your understanding of life. I give The Deer Hunter my highest recommendation.",The Deer Hunter

When Marlon Brando gasped ""the horror, the horror"" at the end of Apocalypse Now he could easily have been talking about tedious, navel-gazing Vietnam movies.Maybe it's the subject matter that's so difficult to successfully realise. After all, the conflict is still just two generations away, a painful memory for many, making it a morally dubious venture to serve it up as entertainment. Perhaps as a result, many have tried to disguise the subject, to dress it up with a veneer of pretension. The films are often overlong and worthy, too, with the four I've seen (Born on the Fourth of July, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter) lasting over nine and a half-hours between them. It sounds ridiculous, but maybe a better way is to present the conflict not as a film, but as a movie. A 90-minute popcorn romp that finishes before it disappears up itself, yet still gets the message across. Decent Vietnam films have been made of action movies (First Blood) and sci-fi/horror (Jacob's Ladder) without the need for any great artistic merit.Probably the most disappointing of all four is Stanley Kubrick's resoundingly average Full Metal Jacket (6), which is technically commendable but never as meaningful as it would like to think it is. Apocalypse Now (7) is a better bet, which contains more of the conflict than any of the other movies, a huge celluloid landscape of explosions and death. It lacks a certain something, though, possibly a little depth, that leaves it only on the edge of greatness. Born of the Fourth of July (6), crammed in between Cocktail and Days of Thunder marks one of Cruise's earliest attempts to break free of the bland macho roles he'd previously attempted. Cruise is fine, though the film's lack of subtlety soon becomes tiresome. The incidental theme by John Williams sounds strikingly like his sentimental swoops for Jurassic Park, but then again he'd got away with Superman/Star Wars for years and no-one had mentioned it. Williams, surprisingly, had a (guitar) hand in the gentle and quite moving theme to The Deer Hunter*.The Deer Hunter, then, is the best of the bunch, the best Vietnam movie ever made... at least up until now. Certainly not a film you would watch for pleasure, it contains the most depth, the most psychologically reaching aspects. It's still not as emotionally reaching as I would like it to be, the film perhaps containing a clinical distance between the viewer and its content. Okay, I realise that alienation and the sense of inner isolation is what the film's about, but even before the characters go to war DeNiro's Mickey isn't quite all there. Some of the characters, such as Chuck Aspegren's loutish Axel with his obnoxious catchphrase ""f***in' A!"" offer little empathy for the audience. Yet it's really only Walken, DeNiro and Streep who get genuine characters anyway, the rest are just support.I remember being unimpressed with the film the first time round, and I admit that, in the main, I was wrong. Direction is almost flawless by Cimino, though oddly he's never had great success since, his post-Deer CV including the flop Heaven's Gate. Acting, too, is top-rate, and the realisation of Pennsylvanian village life, juxtaposed with life in the Saigon village, is exceptional. The picture scores because the nature of war as evidenced by most directors (loads of helicopters, macho bluster, explosions, and graphic deaths) are largely absent, the film being an intense, character-based piece. The famous highlighted section of the war is Walken, DeNiro and John Savage as POWs, forced to undertake harrowing turns in a game of Russian Roulette. 8/10.* Edited four years later to add: No, it isn't the same John Williams. There's research for you.",The Deer Hunter
100,gab-14712,Hard to Watch At Times!,9,18 October 2017,"1978's The Deer Hunter is one of the more polarizing movies to come out during the 1970's. It was the first movie with the deeply controversial subject of the Vietnam War to both become a critical and commercial success. However, there were several people who expressed dissent ranging from its portrayal of the Vietnam War to the controversial involvement of Russian roulette to the singing of ""God Bless America."" I remember not being too impressed with the film the first time I viewed it. I felt it was too long and violent. Years later, I am singing a different tune. It's a difficult film to sit through because of its violence and the effects of PTSD (post-trauma syndrome). But it is a highly engaging and effective film and I regard it as one of the more influential American movies of the 1970's. Not the best, but the most influential because there will be more successful films tackling the Vietnam War on the horizon.You can call this movie a symphony of some sort. I sort this film into three major segments. The first segment is the longest because of its lengthy and effective characterization. We meet three Pennsylvania factory workers: Michael (Robert De Niro), Steven (John Savage), and Nick (Christopher Walken). They enlisted in the army to serve in Vietnam. Steven decides to marry before going off to war and this wedding also serves as the farewell party. This section is eerily reminiscent of the opening act of The Godfather. There is lots of partying and dancing. And we essentially get to know these characters. These men are hard workers who get drunk at the party because they deserve a night for themselves. After the party, the trio of friends along with another friend Stan (John Cazale) go into the mountains to hunt for deer for one last trip. Hence the title of the movie. I found this section to be incredibly effective in character-building. Director Michael Cimino took his time with his part because it was important to understand these men before they go into the horrors of war.The second movement of our symphony is the actual war. Just like that with a loud noise, the film instantly changes its tone. From the foggy mountains of Pennsylvania to the tropical war zone of Vietnam we go. In one of the most terrifying sequences ever made, the three men are taken prisoner and are forced to play Russian roulette while their captors are betting who will win and who will die. Just seeing the men's faces as they are waiting their turn in the rat-infested cages are undeniably scary. One of the film's controversies is that roulette was not actually played in Vietnam. According to Cimino, he read articles saying they did play roulette although any of this has not been confirmed. But it's one hell of a way to add tension to the movie. You can also take this as a symbol for the war overall. Roger Ebert puts it perfectly in his review, ""Anything you can believe about the game, about it's deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply it to the war as a whole."" Essentially, this violence stands for the war itself and what these men face. Now our final act of the symphony is what happens after the horrors of the prison camp. Michael becomes a prominent character here as he returns home and is welcomed as a hero by his townsfolk and his girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). But Michael does not feel like a hero. Steven is in the hospital after losing his legs and Nick is somewhere in Vietnam still. Michael eventually goes back to find Nick who happened to take his roulette experiences to heart by playing this game professionally. This section is incredibly sad and moving as here we see what exactly war can do to strong-willed men. It was horrible to watch this transformation on screen. To see these characters we got to laugh with in the first part to seeing them play with death in the final act is sad to see. We also get to see an act of patriotism (or is it?) when the survivors join in a ragged rendition of ""God Bless America"" in the very end. This movie has a very strong cast, although the only star at the time was Robert De Niro. De Niro instantly became the film's leader and he played Michael very well. He became a bona fide star after his work in The Godfather: Part Two, and he put that stardom to work here. Christopher Walken had some of the strongest scenes in the movie because of his involvement with the deadly game of Russian roulette. Meryl Streep is one of the greatest actresses ever to grace our screens, and this was one of her first big roles. We end this paragraph with a sad note. This would be the last movie John Cazale would play because he was suffering from terminal cancer and he died before the film was released. He was very good as Stan, but you can tell in the movie that he was really sick.Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a incredible movie about the horror of wars and it effective covers themes ranging from PTSD to male bonding and friendship. It was one of the first movies to successfully cover the Vietnam War, although I'd say this film may not be the most accurate regarding the actual war. I do commend its effort on conveying the themes of general war though. This film was nominated for nine Oscars and it won five of them including Best Picture. Walken took home the statue for his amazing and tense performance as Nick. The film may be controversial and it may be hard to watch, but it's one you'll remember forever. My Grade: A-",The Deer Hunter
101,SmileysWorld,Some bonds go deeper than others.,9,1 August 2007,"At it's very core,The Deer Hunter is a basic story of friendship and how some bonds go deeper than others.The film makes you look at your own friendships and wonder to yourself just how far you would go for those that you call friends.Here you have six men,who without being mushy or saying the words out loud,love each other very much.They have their spats from time to time,but all friends do.They love their friends and they love their country,and are willing to fight to the death for both.Three of these friends enlist in the army with the intention of doing just that.They face the hell that was Vietnam for their friends and their country.Two return,one is AWOL and they are forced to leave him behind.One,out of love,returns to find his friend and bring him home.Do you have friends like that?Love De Niro,love Chris Walken,love Meryl Streep.The Deer Hunter is great dramatic cinema.",The Deer Hunter
102,ajs-10,"Compelling drama with De Niro, Walken, Savage & Streep...",8,18 September 2011,"I have tried to watch this film a few in the past, but always failed to understand it. This time I cleared FOUR HOURS, taking into account all the little things that distract the viewer at home, and this time I actually got to the end and had some kind of a grip on what it was all about. Here are a couple of sentences about the film before I give you my thoughts.This is a film of five acts; I've called them Home, Hunting, Nam, Home Again and Nam Again. Others may divide it up differently, but that's how I see it. The story revolves around three guys; Michael, Steven and Nick, from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to the Vietnam war full of hope and bravado. It deals with what happens to them there and the effects it has on both them and their loved ones back home. I won't go into specifics, but the effects of their experiences resonate deeply into the community they came from. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will force me to play roulette with some Vietnamese gentlemen.First of all, great music throughout, not least the main theme performed by classical guitarist, John Williams. Also the film was beautifully shot by Director of Photography, Vilmos Zsigmond. Great performances all round, particularly from; Robert De Niro as Michael, Christopher Walken as Nick and John Savage as Steven. These three really carried off quite a performance! They were ably backed up by; John Cazale as Stan, Meryl Streep as Linda, George Dzundza as John and Chuck Aspegren as Axel.Putting aside the great performances, the cinematography and the music for a moment, I have to take a second to comment on the length of the piece. It is far too long; the first two acts take up nearly half the running time and do nothing to further the story that couldn't be done in thirty to forty minutes. The sequence in Vietnam could have been expanded, for instance, there is nothing that tells us just how they ended up in the situation they did (no spoilers I'm afraid). The later acts could have been dramatically shortened also. So I reckon about an hour could have been cut from this film and it would have been just as good, if not better. I am going to give it quite a decent score despite these misgivings because it is still a very powerful drama that I actually found quite compelling at times Recommended (with reservations).My Score: 7.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 104,871 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 45 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",The Deer Hunter
103,FilmOtaku,"Probably more effective in its time, but a good film nonetheless",6,31 May 2004,"In `The Deer Hunter', Christopher Walken and Robert DeNiro play friends from a small town in Pennsylvania who get sent to Vietnam, where they experience horrifying moments together.  While the first act of the film shows us their lives within their town, and the second contains their war experiences, the third act gives us the aftermath of what happened to them after the war ended for the two.What I observed while watching `The Deer Hunter' was indeed a decent film, however also a film that suffers from terrible pacing issues. A half hour wedding scene here, a twenty minute scene of guys clowning around a car there, and you have a film that not only could have used another `go around in the editing room, but a film that is nearly three and a half hours long. I think that my friends and I were all thinking it, but when we finally go through the wedding scene only to then talk by the car' for awhile, we all just kind of blurted out words akin to `I wonder how long THIS scene is going to be' or `Think I'll miss anything if I'm away for a few minutes?' Generally, that's not a great sign for a film, especially when the pertinent plot devices used within a scene can be shared with the audience in a third of that time.  Pacing aside, the film was well-written and featured an amazing and talented cast.  Besides the aforementioned Walken and DeNiro, among them we have Meryl Streep, before becoming this generation's `grand actress', playing a small but important role as a woman torn between Walken and DeNiro's affections.  The script was intelligent in that it supplied small yet integral aspects of the story in a subtle fashion.  The action within the `second act' in Vietnam was the most horrifying  the seemingly non-stop scenes of Russian roulette were important to the story, but after awhile the tension and nauseating display became a little too much  Russian roulette scenes for five, even ten minutes?  Sick, but effective in portraying that aspect of the horrors of this war.  Twenty minutes plus was pushing my personal limit.  Certainly, none of these criticisms should deter anyone from seeing this film, it is a good film  just make sure to mentally and physically prepare for the disturbing imagery and the sheer amount of time spent watching this film  there are many films that exceed three hours that have minimal or no pacing problems, but `The Deer Hunter' is not one of them, so it isn't `easy.'  While in general I thought this was a good film and watching The Deer Hunter' reminded me why I am a big fan of both DeNiro and Walken, unfortunately their excellent acting wasn't nearly enough to totally redeem the pacing problems I felt this film had.  Unfortunately, when a film shows up on a `greatest films of all time' list and is backed up by several Oscars, a certain amount of expectation is going to precede it.  `The Deer Hunter' did not meet my expectations, but it was a good film nonetheless and should be seen so one can decide its relevancy for themselves.--Shelly",The Deer Hunter

105,tonypeacock-1,3 hour characterization that shows there isn't always triumph out of adversity,9,18 February 2021,"My first viewing of this 3 hour long Vietnam War film that shows the effects of service in the conflict have on a group of small town Pennsylvania steelworkers.The film can be split into three acts for ease of description:
1) Act 1 - Before enlistment, character development
2) Act 2 - Active service in the Vietnam War conflict
3) Act 3 - Mental (and physical) effects on the characters on returning home. Or not in all cases.The first act is roughly an hour long and allows for character development as we see a group of friends, work colleagues at a steelworks. It primarily focuses on the wedding of two characters Angela and Steven (John Savage) and features scenes of happiness and wedding night celebration.My first impressions were this act was dragging on, a very slow burner as such. However on reflection it allowed the viewer a sense of getting to know the psyche of the characters and their friendship bonds.The second act switches to the Vietnam War conflict and its mental and physical brutality including the introduction of Russian Roulette amongst Viet Cong Prisoner Of War Guards holding the group as prisoners.The experience has a harrowing effect on one particular character Steven who has to be calmed down by Michael (Robert De Niro).
Michael is the calming influence amongst the characters which for a De Niro character isn't always the case! I'm thinking of his performances in films such as Taxi Driver (1976) and The Godfather Part II (1974).The group do escape but with Steven suffering physical injuries to his legs after falling from a helicopter that require amputation of both limbs.Michael returns home as a hero, Steven suffers PTSD in a hospital learning to cope with his life in a wheelchair and the break up of his marriage.Nick (Christopher Walken) ventures into Saigon after hospitalisation by the US military and becomes a professional Russian Roulette player .The third act shows the characters struggling to readjust to civilian life in the U.S. with Nick A.W.O.L. in Saigon. Michael does attempt to rescue him but becomes embroiled in a fatal game of Russian Roulette a truly shocking scene, one of the most sombre, thought provoking scenes I have ever seen on screen.Listen for some haunting music from John Williams. ""Cavatina"".The three hour run time flies by as you become engrossed in the depiction.
I am the least qualified to judge the conflict but this film is certainly one of the most controversial about it I have seen. A true classic.",The Deer Hunter

High calibre acting, excellent location cinematography, and an intense sense of realism vis-a-vis the characters' interactions made for a memorable cinematic experience. Regarding authenticity, as for example that of the Russian Roulette torture scenes, of course it is usually better to adhere to documented facts, but artistic liberties are not a cardinal sin if the final product can me improved. These things have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Still this film merits a very strong recommendation, 8/10.",The Deer Hunter
108,barryrd,Life torn by war,8,12 June 2016,"Michael Cimino, the director, has left us one powerful piece of work in this movie which is a portrait of small town life and how It is devastated by the war in Vietnam. The character development is superb with an outstanding cast of DeNiro, Walken, Streep, Savage and others. The small community in Western Pennsylvania is beautifully captured in the bar scenes, the wedding, the hunting trip, and the working life of the male characters in the local steel factory. I did notice the snowy mountains which didn't quite fit with my impression of Pennsylvania and it seems these were shot in Washington State. Not a huge deal given the calibre of the movie but I'm sure this wouldn't escape the notice of some viewers. The bond of friendship between DeNiro as Mike and Walken as Nick is sharply defined in the first hour and this relationship Is the basis for the story, which moves from Pennsylvaia to Vietnam and back again. We also see the angst heighten as the characters approach the day of Steve's wedding followed by their departure for Vietnam. The change in settings comes abruptly but flows seamlessly. The movie has dramatic war scenes that contrast with the beauty of the mountains where the deer hunting takes place. Graphic and shocking scenes in Vietnam heighten the sense of alienation from small town life in America. The movie is long but the script, the acting and imagery keep viewers riveted to this excellent story and its stunning photography.",The Deer Hunter

It's Way More Complicated!,9,14 June 2018,"Its running length may annoy some, and it's criticized for being self-indulgent, and for having a problematic message. And while I can see that it could have been more shorter, I think that it has this great emotional impact because Cimino took his time in a very long first act that made us dive into the characters, and most importantly, their relationship. This first act with all its very very long scenes that feel as they were unedited is what made us care deeply about his characters when they were thrown inside a terrifically tense, gut-wrenching second act. That's how Cimino made us thoroughly disturbed, and have mixed, and vague feelings that result in creating a great catharsis at the third act. Every actor gave a very realistic performance, needless to say that both De Niro and Meryl Streep shine, but Christopher Walken's Oscar-winning performance is the standout here. All the characters are fully-developed, and fleshed out, but they are incredibly realistic and three-dimensional that can be analyzed as they are Shakespearean or Tolstoyan characters.I can't believe or describe how emotionally sweeping and overwhelming this epic is.(9/10)",The Deer Hunter

While it is a well-made well acted film somehow the whole story comes off as unrealistic, to me anyway. Had this story been set during WWII it may have been believable but not during the Vietnam War! How many guys who were tight knit like this bunch who worked together, partied together, hunted together left steady good paying jobs to enlist in the Army during that time period? Had they all been drafted OK but to just say, ""Hey were quitting our jobs to go into the Army and fight in Vietnam"" Come on! If that had been the case the Army wouldn't have needed a draft. (With one of them even getting married before he goes into the Army). Then they all stay together throughout Basic, Infantry training etc and then ""ALL"" become rangers, remain together once sent in to Vietnam and all get captured together?

114,movieguy1021,The Deer Hunter: 10/10,10,18 January 2004,"Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just  the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle, but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter, which got him  to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor, he always picks  good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you  can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.  Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage)  sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding  party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the  midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and  eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences  from the war.  It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his  direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film  together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that  has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know  these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if  they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by  these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel  enough for these three basic people to get through the war.  The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete  stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension  on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make  sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known  these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to  die, making them all the more nervous.  The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal  Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed  the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped  make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the  three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for  the better.  De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately  takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he  won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting  character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting,  it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know  how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this  tour-de-force.  My rating: 10/10  Rated R for strong language and violence.",The Deer Hunter

119,Aylmer,"For a movie with so many themes, it doesn't feel like it's really ""about"" anything.",7,8 February 2016,"Working class steel mill workers, friendship, emotionally complex relationships, Vietnam, and Russian Roulette. This film tackles all these subjects with a pretty broad brush and makes no judgment. It's a groundbreaking film though certainly a letdown especially for those going in with the wrong expectations.I've seen this film twice; once at age 15-16 and again at at 35. The first time I saw it, I was immensely disappointed, expecting some kind of PLATOON-style action war movie. After so much time being spent on the wedding, there's really only one action scene presented and it frustratingly cuts away just when the Viet Cong close in. What a missed opportunity it was to show some more De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage desperately gunning down hoards of enemies. No, you're going to have to watch THE DOGS OF WAR or MCBAIN to see anything like that. It's disappointing that is is about as close as De Niro ever got to being an action hero, but this is just not that kind of film. I had heard it's a Vietnam War movie, but it's not. It's really a movie about Russian immigrant steel workers living a bleak existence drinking their lives away in some Podunk Pennsylvania town. It seems that the only meaning they have in their lives is deer hunting and their camaraderie, but even after coming back to this film I didn't catch much character development, especially around De Niro and Walken's characters. The war gives them something to look forward to and ends up shattering their lives.Two decades later I see that this film (especially during the first hour) is more like one of those popular at the time 70's ""slice of life"" movies like FIVE EASY PIECES or the more recent GARDEN STATE, where we just watch people do things and randomly interact in a very mundane way. The only semblance of a plot comes with the war, the Russian Roulette, and the search for Walken's character. However all that maybe takes up 45 minutes of plot in a 3 hour movie. Peter Zinner may have been a legendary editor (though hacking up the U.S. release of KING KONG VS. GODZILLA and making an abortive attempt as a director with the horrible THE SALAMANDER) but here just lets scenes float way longer than they need to. The film would have worked just as well if that endless wedding scene was only 5 minutes long.However, I must point out that the performances across the board are excellent and the emotional buildup to the climax is very tense, cathartic, and ultimately tragic. It's very hard not to get touched by the final death scene, which is among the best work of all involved. Unfortunately things unravel later on when it seems Cimino didn't know how to end the thing. Also you'll be hard pressed to find a film of that year with more captivating outdoor cinematography, which THE DEER HUNTER is worth a watch for even for just that reason.I've seen a few of Cimino's films, trying to understand why he was seen as such a Hollywood prodigy through his career and given so many chances even after the disastrous HEAVEN'S GATE. I consider his best film to be YEAR OF THE DRAGON, a New York police movie that isn't explicitly an action movie, but is edited much tighter and with better character development than this film.",The Deer Hunter
120,PIST-OFF,#15 on my personal top 100,10,10 March 1999,"I love watching the Deer Hunter. It's neither pro nor anti war. It's a movie about some budies that go Deer Hunting one last time before they go to Veitnam and how they are changed when they come back. If you want to see acting see this movie. Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and John Savage all put in flawless performances. This is a man's man's movie that will make most men cry. Watch it with a cold Rolling Rock (DeNiro's beer of choice in the movie) The Russian Roulette scenes are as cool as they are emotional. This is the shattered dream of when you're an 8 year old boy. Going off to war with your budies. But this ain't no dream. This is this!!!!!!",The Deer Hunter

Compared to Platoon where American soldiers weren't heroes, The Deer Hunter is about a group of friends that serve their duty in Vietnam and during the war, they are capture prisoners and that's when two out of three soldiers lose their emotions. Robert De Niro is superb in this war drama that really isn't about war. Christopher Walken who took best supporting actor got my attention.

124,diane-34,A film masterpiece!,10,2 July 2007,"I watched this magnificent film when it was first released and returned to it yesterday so many years later and I was stunned at its magnificence. I know nothing of film commentary so these viewpoints are only the ramblings of a person that saw a movie 30 years after he first watched it and was amazed that so much of film making has gone backwards.The controversy about Cimino and his box office failure, Heaven's Gate, must be the worst catastrophe that has ever struck American film. That miss meant that the world lost a director that saw film as an empty canvas upon which movies could be worked much as 20th century painters reworked painting in new styles. In Deer Hunter we can see Cimino rework film content much as he did in Heaven's Gate, to much less acceptance. Cimino did not create one movie but a series of movies roughly revolving around a centrepiece. He was not making a ""war movie""; rather, he was creating a pastiche of little movies with the same characters, much as he did in his hugely misunderstood Heaven's Gate.For many reasons Heaven's Gate misfired and today we must sit through movies that begin and end virtually in the same time-frame and with a vertically constructed story line. We do not have the great directors of the 70s and 80s to stretch the composition of film as Cimino and some of his compatriots did.Deer Hunter was Cimino's exploration of many of those themes that he was to develop in Heaven's Gate: the use of eastern Europeans as the matrix for the film, long scenes that many viewers saw as unnecessary, scenes crowded with people, long or medium shots rather than the current mania for massive closeups and movies within movies to mention only a few.People have commentated here that the Russian Roulett scene was a metaphor for America's catastrophe in Vietnam; however, I see it as a metaphor for growing up. The potential for disaster growing up in a little steel town is manifest; the only thing that saves your mind is being too young to recognise the dangers confronting you. It is as lucky to emerge from these little towns as it is to live through Russian Roulette and the odds might be worse.Deer Hunter is a massively thought provoking movie that can be enjoyed and milked for its insights many, many times.",The Deer Hunter

As Bacon/Warhol say, it's anything you can get away with. Yoko Ono calls it con-art. Some of the other enthusiastic reviews explain it, up to a point. I give it four stars, since it was interesting seeing, De Niro, Walken, Streep in their younger days. Why did De Niro walk around in his uniform ? I could go on. But won't.",The Deer Hunter

Although this movie does not concentrate on the war as much as e.g. Saving Private Ryan, I must say that the scenes from Vietnam in this film, the psychological as well as the physical torture, is much more disturbing and awful to me than the whole first half hour of SPR. Very powerful. Robert De Niro is as good as ever, but I have to say that Christopher Walken is the one who impresses me the most.

This is why it was absolutely necessary to find the right cast. And the right cast it was. Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep and Chris Walken deliver memorable performances and demonstrate their tremendous acting potential.The film though is not a masterpiece as so many people claim it to be. It takes off due to the performances, for sure, but the script is not that strong. I've found it somewhat incoherent, more of a collection of strong scenes than a flowing story. Also you can't fail to notice the sub-par sound quality and editing.So don't miss it, you have three Oscar-caliber performances in one movie, but having very high expectations may leave you disappointed..",The Deer Hunter
128,ofumalow,"Devastating at the time, uneven and problematic now",6,25 April 2021,"I hadn't seen this movie since it came out 43 years ago, at which point it seemed overwhelming--not perfect, just overwhelming in its scope and intensity. Of course, I was only 17 then, most of the actors were very new to audiences, and much of the content seemed groundbreaking as well as shocking. Seeing it all this time later, inevitably the credibility of the leads as ""ordinary steeltown folk"" would be a bit overshadowed by their familiarity from subsequent decades of stardom. Plus we've had lots of films about the Vietnam War since, and of course the violence is no longer very shocking.But ""The Deer Hunter"" has other problems now--problems it always had, I guess, but which weren't so apparent at the time. The screenplay has scope, yes, but the storytelling just kind of lurches from one incident to another with little connective thread, transitional material or real character development, and the dialogue often sounds improvised, as in kinda-feeble. (Cimino is on the record as saying he told Streep she could improvise dialogue, because in the script her character was basically a complete blank.) There are huge setpieces yet almost no transitions between them,The whole ""Russian Roulette"" thing is problematic not just because it's a gross distortion historically, but because even as a fictive leap of the imagination, it fails-first it's just part of the movie's one-note portrayal of the Viet Cong as monsters, then it's a ludicrous underground civilian pastime that one character even more ludicrously makes his ""living"" at. (Really? That would go on for months? Years? How long can anyone's luck hold out?) The hunting sequences meant to lend some mythic dimension here are just heavy-handed and absurdly action-packed; did no one tell Cimino that 99% of such hunting is patient waiting? The scenes meant to be ""everyday life""--notably that long, busy wedding party--are so overstuffed with forced joie de vivre and actorish ""business,"" they now feel more mannered than ""natural."" (And yes, that definitely applies to the always-controversial ""God Bless America,"" which the movie no longer has enough emotional potency to pass off as cathartic rather than a dramatic limb that shouldn't have been gone out on. I'm not a big fan of John Williams' often syrupy score, either--this film needs something edgier.) It's a bit sad that this is John Cazale's last movie, because his typical problem-causing-weakling character is almost completely extraneous here--he only gets in the way, to a degree where one wonders why any of other figures tolerate him.It's an alternately pretentious and broad movie that nonetheless is visually very well-crafted and has some powerful scenes. It's a pity this director didn't have a slower rise to the top, because winning Best Picture etc. Clearly made him oblivious to his shortcomings (mostly in the realm of storytelling), which became catastrophically clear when he was given free rein with ""Heaven's Gate."" If that movie seems to have been considerably underrated, ""The Deer Hunter"" now looks greatly overrated. They're both impressively scaled, problematic, great-looking, mixed-bag films by a talented director who needed to be kept on a much shorter leash to maximize his strengths and minimize his self-indulgences, and who proved his own worst enemy in recovering from such a drastic reversal of fortunes.""The Deer Hunter"" remains an interesting film, very effective in individual elements if awfully disjointed as a whole. But it certainly would look a lot better now if it hadn't been greeted as a ""masterpiece"" in the first place. It can no longer live up to a reputation it may never have deserved, but which made sense in the cultural moment of its initial release. What impresses now is film's messy ambitiousness, not so much what it actually achieves. In that latter department, you'd have to say that the best movie Cimino ever made remains his first (and smallest), ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.""",The Deer Hunter
129,LloydBayer,An Everlasting Classic,8,30 April 2013,"The Vietnam War which lasted 15 years and ended in 1975, proved to be one of the costliest wars of our time considering its five million casualties, including the lives of over 60,000 US soldiers. Who won that war is no longer important, but the effect that war has to this day is beyond devastating. In what is easily the best and last significant film of his career, director Michael Cimino delivers a film with a prophetic vision just three years after the war ended, and is the first in a string of Vietnam war movies that is still attempted over three decades on.Having also co-written the screenplay, Cimino's story does not entirely focus on battle scenes or the war itself, but in essence, its aftermath on the lives of ordinary people. For this, his narrative spans three hours, of which the first hour is spent in impeccable character development formally introducing his Russian-American characters in a small Pennsylvanian steel-mill suburb.Mike, Nick, Steven, Stanley and John are five buddies in a typical frat-pack where after work hours are spent in male bonding activities of deer hunting and beer lounging. Their last gathering as a group is at Steven's Russian orthodox wedding reception pending Mike, Nick and Steven's enlistment in the Vietnam War. The wedding is a fun filled extravaganza where everyone has more than a good share of the festivities. Yet tell-tale signs of a devastating future are cleverly manifested through the reception, foretelling that things would never be the same again. Cut to war-torn Vietnam, Mike, Nick and Steven are POWs after a short battle sequence succumbing to North Vietnamese guerrilla tactics. Taking advantage over their captor's sadistic torture methods of Russian Roulette and rat infested imprisonment, the trio makes for a daring escape little knowing their physical and mental scars would haunt them for life. In a botched rescue attempt, their party is split and they never really regroup as before the war. Although welcomed back a hero, Mike finds it hard to adjust to his once perky lifestyle. Steven is partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair living in total refusal of his family and friends. The crux of the plot surfaces when Mike goes all the way back to hellish Saigon in keeping his earlier promise where he would never leave Nick behind. What he finds is a ghastly excuse for a lifelong friend who has no recollection of their history. Worse, Nick is involved in a major gambling syndicate the likes of which still disturbs Mike: Russian roulette. Interestingly enough, Francis Ford Coppola brought out the critically acclaimed APOCALYPSE NOW just a year after this film, winning two Oscars in the process for his version of the horrifying atrocities during the war in Vietnam. Though Coppola focused mainly on the war, Cimino's film, metaphorically speaking, is an integration of three acts where graphic scenes in Vietnam form the repugnant sausage in an otherwise edible hotdog. And to think, this film was made thirty years before STOP-LOSS and HOME OF THE BRAVE, similar films about war veterans incapable of reverting to ordinary life. But Cimino had already set the tone of things to come, bagging five Academy Awards including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" out of five nominated categories. The Oscar for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" also went to Christopher Walken for his outstanding role as Nick. Incidentally, this is Walken's first and only Oscar till date. Having secured an Oscar for his supporting role as the young Vito Corleone in Coppola's THE GODFATHER II and nominated for best supporting actor in the Martin Scorsese 1976 cult classic TAXI DRIVER, it isn't surprising that Robert De Niro was also nominated again for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" as Mike. Perhaps playing a mentally unstable Vietnam Veteran in TAXI DRIVER was all the training he required in adapting a similar themed role as the titled deer hunter. Also worth mentioning is a stunning Meryl Streep in her first ever Oscar nominated role as Linda, a passive women caught between Nick's proposal for marriage and Mike's shy charm. Also embedded in the support line up are John Savage as Steven, George Dzundza as the over eccentric John and John Cazale who passed away shortly after his role as Stanley.More than just a multi-award winning movie, this is one of De Niro's and Walken's building blocks to their currently much deserved status as Hollywood veterans. But wrapping up the perfect package goes to Cimino's credit in consideration of the lack of eye-popping special effects of Hollywood yester years. His reliance on stellar acting, perfectly timed suspense in a visionary plot and the birth of a sub-genre ahead of its time justifies why the American Film Institute has praised this film within the ""100 Greatest American Movies of all time"".",The Deer Hunter
130,emperor_bender,Difficult to stay focused but still a very good film,8,28 February 2008,"I had heard a lot about this movie, mainly negative things though. We even had a presentation in English class on the negative effects of cinema violence on society and they showed piece of this film to prove their point. After that, I just HAD to see this movie. I'm easily fooled that way, like when I heard Taxi Driver was an inspiration for Hinckley's assault on Reagan I went and rented it. Anyway, this film started off in a Godfather-type of style, wedding, characters showing their true colors and whatnot. Then it started to become its own film and from then on was excellent. I admit I lost track of the plot a few times in the movie (mainly because I have ADD), but I liked it over all. The story was very original and very bold. Michael Cimino had to have guts to direct such a controversial film as this. Everything was very realistic. Especially the extra-controversial Russian-roulette scenes. I heard at least 70 deaths were attributed to this film but I do not think that they were INSPIRED by the film. The movie wasn't meant to be INSPIRING just....well...raw. The story was great though. The characters were very good as well: Michael Vronsky (Robert DeNiro), Stanley/Stosh (John Cazale), Steven (John Savage), Nick Chevotarevich (Christopher Walken), Linda (Meryl Streep), Axel (Chuck Aspegren), and John (George Dzundza). I was sad to learn John Cazale died after making this film, he was very good here, as Sal in Dog Day Afternoon, and of course as Fredo Corleone in The Godfather Part I&II. However I must give him credit, he pushed himself to finish this film. This movie is a true classic and will make you think after you watch it.

This was the last ""classic DeNiro"" movie I'd yet to see, and I'm almost glad I saved it for so long - truly the best for last.The better a movie is, the harder it is for me to review. There are literally no flaws. Everything about the movie is transcendent. There's so much realism crossed with so much pulpy detail - the 3 hours goes by so quickly, it's never dull for a moment.The cast is so dynamic - every character has so much of their own unique persona, it's wild. It's definitely my favorite DeNiro movie - only The King of Comedy comes close (but I do need to rewatch Cape Fear soon). Meryl Streep is bursting at the seams with repressed emotion, ready to explode. It's Walken's most powerful performance I've ever seen - he brought the tears multiple times - totally worthy of the Oscar win. George Zdundza is a glowing light whose presence is a joy. John Cazale puts in his final performance just before losing his life to cancer, and it's a perfect finale for him - nuanced but complex enough to be gripping. The environments are constantly shifting and so many of them are breathtaking. Photography, writing, editing, writing, sound editing, soundtrack (Stanley Myers' ""Cavatina"" adapted for guitar by John Williams... bellisimo) - all immaculate.Most importantly, it just sucks you in so hard. I've never seen a movie quite like it. I had no idea where it was going to go next, or what could happen to each of the brilliant characters - it felt like a movie with no rules, like the best of them. So, any time there was a threat of danger, I was truly scared, truly on the edge of my seat. I will NEVER be able to think of anything other than THIS MOVIE when Russian Roulette is brought up from now on - I never had any idea that it was one of the main plot devices in this film! Wow! SO INTENSE.If you've never seen this movie - do yourself a favor, and see it...immediately.",The Deer Hunter
133,dansview,Not About War,9,23 January 2013,"I'll get the primary criticisms out of the way first. Thanks to all the other intelligent reviewers, for their insightful takes on this classic.These guys are way, way older than most recruits and volunteers for Vietnam.Considering their age, why were they sharing a crappy trailer and still unmarried? A job at a mill in those days would have paid reasonably well, and by age 30, they would have put some money down on a house. Small town people are also notorious for marrying young. The two unmarried guys in this one must be 33. Enough on that.Although their hometown was quite close to West Virginia, ""The Mountain State,"" the mountains there would not look anything like the Washington State Cascades, which is where the mountain sequences were filmed. It was gorgeous, but they should have stuck to the Alleghenies or whatever mountains are close to where they lived.One other reviewer mentioned that the DeNiro character was disgusted with his friends for behaving like sophomoric jerks in a quasi-holy place like the pristine wilderness. I agree, but I also think he was disgusted because he took Deer Hunting very seriously, and apparently they did not. He was like the way some surfers are spiritual about battling nature, while simultaneously being in harmony with it.How could the Walken character have lasted as long as he did in Saigon, doing what he was doing, and then have his gig come to an end when his friend joins him? That requires some suspension of belief.Did anyone think it was interesting that the characters were Russian-Americans, the war was against Russian-backed Vietnamese, and the characters were forced to play ""Russian Roulette?"" Was this on purpose? They could have been Polish or Czech.Why did John Savage's character have a New York accent, when none of the others did? It was Southwestern Pennsylvania.Didn't the DeNiro character have any parents or family? I would like to hear more about why these guys volunteered for the military. Clearly it was a patriotic town, given the people's gratitude for being in the opposite of Russia. But I needed some dialog from the guys regarding their political feelings, or their desire for adventure.Beyond being a sociological portrayal of steel town life, this movie was about different types of men, and how they react to pressure, adversity, and despair. The ""alpha"" dog usually prevails. That's the way nature intended it, and DeNiro's ""Mike"" was the alpha here. The alpha does not necessarily have to be the best human being, just the toughest, shrewdest, and most adaptable.I didn't mind the long wedding scene, or the three-act nature of the film. It made perfect sense. Having said that, I wouldn't have minded if they shortened it.I liked the way they portrayed these working class guys as slobs with a a heart. No matter how mean they were to each other, they loved one another and that stood out. I also liked how Russian American culture was portrayed. I've never really scene that in such detail.Despite my recognition of the heart of these guys, I will admit that if nothing dramatic happened in their lives, they would probably have continued on as rather crude and shallow individuals. Adversity matures us.I read about all the controversy which accompanied this film back in the day. Especially about the Russian Roulette aspects, and the portrayal of the Vietcong as sadistic barbarians. I know I get upset when Americans are portrayed that way in Vietnam movies.But I don't doubt that some hardened communist soldiers in a third world jungle could produce a few sadists.Nor do I doubt that some Americans were equally sadistic. But regardless of whether any Viet Cong forced enemy soldiers to play Russian Roulette, it is a believable scenario. Why not, especially since the Russians were backing them.The use of classical guitar music for the melancholic scenes back home was very effective. Of course in real life, we don't get a soundtrack to follow us around, so by its' very nature, music in film is manipulative.De Niro and Cazale were no strangers to ethnic scuzball roles. Walken was good, but his character didn't have that much screen time or dialog. John Savage stole the show. I didn't see any comments about this. Meryl Streep was sweet and believable.There really were not many war scenes. You got just enough feeling for what it was like, and very few clichés. I appreciated that.Weaving the ""one shot"" theme into the film via Deer Hunting and Russian Roulette was an interesting plot device. One shot stood between the pastoral life of a delicate buck and death. It also stood between the domestic life of small town men and a bloody mess.*** More importantly, we only get one shot at life, so we better do it right.I think that the Walken character felt ashamed of the way he backed down from Russian Roulette in the classic war scene. That would explain why he became obsessed with challenging himself in this way forever more.Overall, great flick. Watch it, and please tell the next generation to watch it. Sometimes it seems like they have no sense of film history.",The Deer Hunter

Best Picture 1978 On a scale of one to ten.. 8",The Deer Hunter
138,dr_clarke_2,Controversial but misunderstood,8,14 June 2020,"Michael Cimino's Academy Award winning 1978 film The Deer Hunter is not without controversy. Sometimes described as a Vietnam War film, it has been criticised for its depiction of the North Vietnamese as one-dimensional evil sadists, and it was also - unfairly - subject to revisionist reviews following the release of Cimino's subsequent, career-destroying Heaven's Gate. But The Deer Hunter isn't really a film about the Vietnam War, and the downward trajectory of Cimino's later career should not detract from the fact the fact that it remains a remarkable accomplishment.
What The Deer Hunter is about, really, is friendship and the terrible effects of the horrors of war on the lives of those who fight for their countries: as Christopher Walken later suggested, the actual war depicted in the film is irrelevant. Indeed, there is very little here about the politics or the history of the Vietnam War, although the screenplay does include subtle condemnation of it, particularly at the end. Instead, the story focuses on the lives of three steelworkers - Mike, Nick and Steven - whose lives are changed forever when they are put through the meat-grinder of conflict in a distant land.
And on this level, the film works well. Right from the start, the three central male characters are well written and brought to life by naturalistic performances from Robert de Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage. All three actors give performances that allow us to get to know the characters, so that when they suffer it has real emotional impact. Savage is especially impressive when Steven is overcome with terror when he, Nick and Mike are first forced to watch and then to play the Russian roulette game. These scenes are, by any measure, harrowing and De Niro and Walken give incredibly intense performances. The plot is divided into thirds, with the first occupied largely by the wedding of Steven and Angela and a deer hunt by the central group of friends; it advances the plot very little, but it does a great deal for the characterisation by serving to demonstrate the normal lives of the three protagonists, showing the audience what they leave behind when they go to fight a war for their country, full of patriotic dreams just waiting to be dashed.
Cimino's direction is impressive and he manages to create a film that is in some ways broad in scope but intimate in its approach. The vast amount of money lavished on the film pays off, with impressive sets and Thailand location filming that simultaneously manages to be beautiful and oppressive. The lengthy wedding scenes might easily have felt like padding, but a combination of script, performances and Vilmos Zsigmond's gorgeous cinematography means that the film never drags. Indeed, Zsigmond does and outstanding job throughout, and brings a certain grandeur to the scenes inside the church. The location filming for the deer hunt - and the hunt itself - is beautifully filmed. By contrast, the moody scenes in Saigon (actually filmed in Bangkok) are filmed in such a way that everything looks sweaty, seedy and unpleasant.
Editor Peter Zinner provides a swift cut from the elegant scene of Axel playing piano in the bar to the blood-soaked fields of Vietnam; despite frequent descriptions of the movie as a war film, we see very little conflict on screen. Rather, Cimino focuses on the hellish situation that Nick, Mike and Steven find themselves in: the initial Russian roulette sequence shot on the banks of the River Kwai is actually relatively brief. The game - a controversial artistic license on Cimino's part that serves as a metaphor for war - has profound psychological effects on the three characters and the impact of these occupies the remainder of the film. Once the trio is rescued, the film cuts again, with the three dispersed. The final third of the film shows the aftermath of war for each of them; Mike returns home but feels isolated and guilty, and significantly he finds he can no longer shoot a deer in cold blood; Steven has been left physically broken, and Nick has been left mentally broken, symbolically continuing to play Russian roulette in Saigon and ultimately losing.
Whatever one thinks of the story, Cimino's technical achievements in The Deer Hunter should not be dismissed. As well as the three leads, he assembled an impressive cast that included a terminally ill John Cazale (who died before the film's release) and Meryl Streep in a small both well-acted role as Linda, the object of both Mike and Nick's affections. English composer Stanley Myers provides an excellent soundtrack, including the iconic theme tune. This is an impressive film on many levels: perhaps its greatest failing is that remains widely misunderstood.",The Deer Hunter
139,jayjaycee,How war destroys the lives of innocent people...,9,16 February 2020,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a 1978 war drama directed by Michael Cimino starring Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken. Films centred around the brutality and meaninglessness of war have always played a major role in modern cinema and never failed to remind the audience of said aspects. Each and every war in the history of mankind was at least depicted once and, in the most cases, in a super realistic manner. From classic World War II drama ""Saving Private Ryan"" to recently released World War I feature ""1917"" every single battle is at least represented once. The Vietnam war makes no exception in this concept. But before there was Francis Ford Coppola's epos, there was ""The Deer Hunter"". If my researches are correct it's one of the first, if not literally the first film to depict this horrifying time in history that seems to still pose as a trauma in the hearts of countless Americans. And yet, it's not a genre typical movie at all, because the conflict itself is a means to the end. Basically, it's a character study centered around the soldiers in the first place. This three hour long cinematic colossus is principally divided into three stages: Before, during and after the protagonists have been to hell. While it could be seen as a narrative flaw that the scenes are generally stretched and simply too long in the first place, I think that's one of the films extraordinary strengths. In the first act, it intentionally takes much time to build up the character constellation and gives us the chance to intensively get to know them. Before they went to war, they're only a group of best friends from a Pennsylvanian industrial small town enjoying life to the fullest, fooling around, drinking beer and go hunting and celebrating their best friend's wedding as the climax. It's supposed to portray the simplicity and carelessness of life - without any worries and problems. The first hour of runtime literally shows how they do said things. It might be a decision other viewers might dislike, but I personally love this almost tragically slow pace. It had an effect on me, because in this one specific scene where on of the friends quietly plays the piano and the others become silent is just breathtaking, because they all become aware of what will happen next. Supported by the rough editing style, the film then all suddenly switches to Vietnam at a moment's notice. Without any preparation or unnecessary stretching. That's the metaphorical brutality I was talking about. In the second act, the brutality shows itself through blood, gore and nasty violence, what it has literally always been, reaching the top in the first Russian roulette scene. High tension and brilliant acting at it's finest, gut-wrentching and shocking in both effects and narration. Surprisingly, of it's whole duration the film spends the shortest amount of time on the battlefield, as it then focuses on the three individual cases of the now separated friends: DeNiro's Michael comes home to find himself in a place that doesn't feel like home anymore and seems to no longer enjoy the things that used to make him happy, Savage's Steven is crippled and physically suffers from the effects of combat and Walker's Nick is AWOL and sick of the pointlessness of fighting. It mercilessly continues to show how a meaningless war destroys the easy lives and friendship of simple men and disrupts them irreversibly. Astonishing character development included. It's ingeniously underlined by two prominent metaphors. The first being the Russian roulette that occurs in the context of enforcement, entertainment and free choice and is supposed to show that anyone can die in a war that was motivated by many different aspects and may cost the life of anyone, out of nowhere and randomly. The second metaphor is the meaning of the titular deer hunting, as it's supposed to boldly show how senseless killing of any living creature is. All in all, this touching character study relentlessly depicts how a meaningless war impacts the lives of innocent and happy young humans permanently. It's absolutely brutal on many levels, from visuals to emotional depth and once again shows through unusual, yet excellent writing and acting performances of its leads that nobody ever wins at war. An important entry to the genre and magnificent example that a three hour behemoth can feel like a ninety minutes feature without any problems. That's cinema at it's finest.",The Deer Hunter
140,Hunky Stud,This movie is too long!,7,9 June 2008,"I have heard about this movie for a long time, but I never got a chance to watch it even though I am already familiar with the theme music. I was finally able to check out the DVD from a local library. I was surprised that it is 3 hours and 3 minutes. I thought that it was the extended version, it seems that the original movie is really that long!It certainly is too long, especially the first half of the film. It has many unnecessary details. If it didn't win the best picture of 1978, I would have stopped watching it entirely. It has a lot of unnecessary scenes. For example, it has several long minutes of people dancing at a wedding party at the beginning. Sure, if the director want to show people how happy they were before going to the war, after all, this is not a musical film.The color of this film is mostly dark, it is lack of bright light. That made this film less appealing. The performance was solid though. The closed caption sometimes referred to those vietnamese people talking as ""speaking Chinese"", that is not correct.",The Deer Hunter
141,jackasstrange,It's all about repressed sexuality,8,10 December 2013,"This film is not about war. This film is entirely about repressed sexuality. Impressive to know how so many people don't get that Michael was a repressed gay. Not jokes. Remember in the beginning of the film, when the guy calls him gay because of Michael's weird behavior in relation to women? This was the first hint. The other hint was the allegory of the deer. As we all know, the deer became known in the popular culture for representing the 'homossexual'. Michael was pretending all time that he was a man by being the best in killing deers, which may represents 'killing his repressed homosexuality'. This happened before the war. He needed to kill the deers, while his friends did it for 'fun'. Nicki also has a gay side, he is the other who takes 'killimg dears' very serious, and definitely liked Michael as a lover, but he don't how to deal with it. This 'homossexual' side in Michael always left him uncomfortable, we can see how closed and cautious he is in relation to other people. He don't understand why he has this 'homo' side, so this is why his behavior is likely shy when he is with other people.After the war, he understands that he can't kill the deers anymore. This represents a transformation on his life, he is not repressing his feelings anymore. He starts to accept what he is.This also explain why people are so embarrassed when they are talking to him in the ending of the film. His friends did avoid to look at him when he was talking to them, but they are always looking at him at his back. Definitely thats was the situation of the homosexuals back in the 70s.Also, 'The Game' played in the film only represents the 'will' of the gays about their situation. As we can see, both Michael andNicki are repressed lovers. The death game represented the constant situation of their minds. In one side, the will of life but the inevitable need to repress the feelings, and the other side was simply die. For Nicki, the latter option fitted better after his agony.Anyways, that is what i think of this film. It is really weird to know that almost no one got this message. 8.3/10",The Deer Hunter

143,GeorgeRoots,Pretty Unforgettable.,10,8 September 2014,"Where do I begin to tackle ""The Deer Hunter""? Obviously take into consideration that this was one of the first movies on the Vietnam War. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) was a year away, ""Platoon"" (1986) & ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) would soon follow. That said, imagine how controversial this film must have been being released just 3 years after the end of the war.Another thing I gotta make a point about is that many of my peers have seen this movie and say it's boring and depressing. True I admit that first act is pretty lengthy, and depression is the core driving force of the whole movie anyway. War is S*^t, with a capital ""S"". I find the movies subtle beauty quite remarkable, and a few hours after watching the film did the whole message really sink in and leave me exhausted. The movie is still widely regarded as one of American Cinemas greatest film achievements, right up there with ""The Godfather"" (1972). It had really left its mark on me at the time I saw it, and I once considered it in my all time top 5 favourite movies (Only to be replaced by ""Apocalypse Now"" 1979, which I saw a year later).Don't come looking for ""Platoon"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"", this drama is about the consequences and after effects war has on the psyche. The physical and mental wounds given to these three friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage) take their toll, and all of them end up suffering their own kind of personal hell. The performances are incredible with Robert De Niro is in his prime, and as always keeps getting better with every movie at the time. Christopher Walken gives an Oscar winning performance, and I also really ended up caring for Meryl Streep's character which remains extremely grounded. It's surprisingly well done how all three actors work around this 3 way love triangle, which really aids this post traumatic stress between them all.The 3-act movie structure is pretty obvious here. From the small Pennsylvania town wedding, to the friends in conflict forced to play Russian roulette (These scenes are brutal, and have been hailed as a metaphor for the entire War). Finally the third act depicts the effects it has had on everyone, with an ending so downright cruel in some ways it becomes difficult to explain in print.Final Verdict: Overall this felt less like a film and more of an experience, or at least a bloody well made reconstruction or biopic. It's one I think everyone should have to sit down and watch sometime in their life. After everything I have wrote and all the horror and wonder you'll experience, I still find this movie unexplainable. 10/10.",The Deer Hunter
144,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"One of the greatest ever!, best De Niro, movie since, Taxi Driver!",8,20 June 2008,"Winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, The Deer Hunter is simultaneously an audacious directorial conceit and one of the greatest films ever made about friendship and the personal impact of war. Like Apocalypse Now, it's hardly a conventional battle film--the soldier's experience was handled with greater authenticity in Platoon--but its depiction of war on an intimate scale packs a devastatingly dramatic punch. Director Michael Cimino may be manipulating our emotions with masterful skill, but he does it in a way that stirs the soul and pinches our collective nerves with graphic, high-intensity scenes of men under life-threatening duress. Although Russian-roulette gambling games were not a common occurrence during the Vietnam war, they're used here as a metaphor for the futility of the war itself. To the viewer, they become unforgettably intense rites of passage for the best friends--Pennsylvania steelworkers played by Robert De Niro, John Savage, and Oscar winner Christopher Walken--who may survive or perish during their tour through a tropical landscape of hell. Back home, their loved ones must cope with the war's domestic impact, and in doing so they allow The Deer Hunter to achieve a rare combination of epic storytelling and intimate, heart-rending drama.",The Deer Hunter

I read a few comments by others, not all of them for they are too many to deal with. I see a movie with emotional eyes and this one worked so well for me. The critic often made about the weeding scene and the length of time and questioning its need to be there may hold for some. But if one goes to a museum one would see that some of the visitors are on the go at all time whilst others pause and take time to look at certain display. In a cinema this isn't possible one is at the mercy of the film speed, so I guess it's up to the director to make those choice for us. In this case it work for me. I won't go in detail why since it's been commented already by many previous entries. All I'll say I liked very much the ""display"" of the wedding and found it fundamental to this work. Although I feel it has lost some of it's freshness, The Deer Hunter somehow remains at the top of my list. MB",The Deer Hunter

The movie starts with an elaborate wedding sequence all the while introducing us to the characters, their relationships and expectations. Michael, Steven, Nick and Stan are buddies who went to school, work etc together. The name of the movie is drawn from Michael's expertise and passion for deer hunting and does not mean anything further. When 3 of them enlist and pack off for Vietnam war, they see and face things that will change them forever. With the kind of talent available here, there is only a very little I can say that has not been said about the performances. Meryl Streep looks gorgeous and plays a significant role in the way the protagonists react. Soundtrack is amazing and the war in itself subtle, sporadic and effective. More than the war itself, it is the mindset of people involved before and after the process. A major flaw in the movie is its runtime against the content.

Its an automatic ten out of ten, but it would be un-wise to watch this Classic too often. I can only view it..occasionally. The scenes in Vietnam are gut wrenching, and very authentic. All the acting is first class ...and no-one needs to be praised above any of the whole cast. Directed with faultless precision by Michael Cimino this 1978 movie is so classy and timeless. The futility of war is there for all to see. There are ""no rules in war"", and this is painfully demonstrated.....by mans inhumanity to man.....in the pure hell, that is war.

149,OldAle1,overwrought epic of Vietnam and the homefront,6,21 April 2008,"Vilmos Zgismond's cinematography is the best thing about this overwrought, overlong male-posturing saga. In the beginning, the accents and locations ring false -- if this is supposed to be realistic, it doesn't work as the huge cathedral where the wedding takes place clearly doesn't belong to small-town coal-mining PA anymore than the deer-hunting sequences obviously shot in the Rockies do. Had the film seemed more naturalistic or expressionistic, this wouldn't have bothered me but instead it seemed like a situation where director and writer did their homework, then just threw away what they didn't like. The wedding sequence was intolerably long and pointless; the Vietnam sequence harrowing but disturbing as much for being devoid of any political context as it was for the horror of what was going on. I found it fantastic that there is virtually no discussion in the film of the morality of the war -- not whether the characters or filmmakers are for or against, but that they show almost no opinion -- what's on screen certainly shows us something of the damaging effects of conflict, but it could be any war. Perhaps that was intentional, but to me the tension between this heightened reality (Vietnam is all wars) and the more mundane elements just didn't work, and I couldn't tell if it was intentional. I liked the sequences of DeNiro coming home and readjusting the best, and his was for me the richest and deepest performance, and character. I'm surprised that Walken's (good) performance of a much less complex character won the Oscar.Still, it kept me going, and there are moving sequences.

151,revival05,...wow,10,10 October 2000,"SPOILER ALERTJust got off THE DEER HUNTER about 20 minutes ago, I haven't seen it before and I don't really know what to say. I rented it along with three other movies, including SHINDLER'S LIST and THE PLATOON and THE DEER HUNTER striked these two out (even though ""Shindler"" came pretty close).Sure, THE PLATOON, is a better war-movie but to claim that this movie is a war-movie is just a sign of stupidity and saying it's dull, sorry, I'm afraid that if you think you are some kind of movielovers I can assure you you are not. THE DEER HUNTER is a description of four friends and their life in a quiet town in Pennsylvania, before, during and after the Vietnam war. The war itself is just there, the story doesn't focus at the war. The movie focus on these four people's changes and, often heartbreaking, destenys.
People who complain over that there is a hole in between the big explosion and the concentration camp, and totally ignores the scene where Walken dies are probably people who were, or are interested in the war and want to see if it's realistic and don't care if it's emotional or not. Well (almost) the only thing this movie offers is emotions. The scene were Walken shoot himself in the head, because of the sadistic ""russian roulette"" some people tastelessly called it on this page, is one of the most frightening and emotional moments of film I've ever seen in my life, no war-movie I've seen, and I've seen almost all of the known ones, has had the same effect on me like this did, and still I find the war-movie a very underrated genre.
But, as I said before, this is no war-movie. The Vietnam war is in the movie, but it's only there to change these four people's lives. It's simply if not the most heartbreaking and sad, then it's very close, movie I've ever seen. Shouldn't be seen as a war movie, shouldn't be compared with war-movies. Should be compared with SCHINDLER'S LIST, CHINATOWN, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. That's movies that goes on similar themes and similar greatness. 9/10",The Deer Hunter
152,mcjensen-05924,This Was One Awful Movie By Any Standard,2,14 August 2021,"Bad. Really, really bad. Soundtrack is grating. Editing is non-existent. Dialogue is horrendous and simple minded. It's hard to know where to begin because it failed on every level, and the fact it's supposed to be a superior example of film making staggers my imagination. It gets worse each time I try to endure it. Where as the wedding scene in Godfather served a purpose and set the tone for the movie, the wedding scene at the start of this was an ordeal to suffer. So much awful music and dancing I had to mute it. Even fast forwarded it a bit. Just a bunch of guys slamming booze and acting like fools. Then a hunting trip where they act like fools some more. DeNiro was an immensely unlikeable jerk who acts all tough and smart but wouldn't even borrow a friend a pair of boots. Seems like he's a petty fool. Then off to Nam where somehow they all end up together as POW's playing Russian Roulette. Completely fabricated nonsense that negates any power the war might have added to this petty drama. After the war, back in Pennsylvania, things resume and everyone acts like buffoons again. All through the movie the scenes are drawn out and waaayyy too long. The way everyone relates to each other just doesn't seem like they knew each other at all. Streep was gorgeous but her role plays shallow because the writers never gave her any depth. So many things happen that would never happen, in USA and in Nam, that the whole movie fell flat because it was tripping over it's own tediousness and incompetentness. The grit and desperation of the steel town was conveyed somewhat effectively, but all the inhabitants came across as maroons. Especially that bartender guy whole persona is just over the top goofy. It simply didn't age well. In fact it was garbage when it came out, but seemed to grab everybody's attention as a milestone of great acting and film making. It's not. It's either just silly or monotonous or stupid. Drink. Dance. Drink. Hunt. Fight. Hunt. Have meaningless talks. Act like dopes. Really fun viewing experience for imbeciles. The music is extremely horrible and distracting. My gosh man who needs to listen to opera and choir music again and again? Just another thing to detract from a storyline that is already failing. Some nice nature scenes while hunting, but it was obvious it was filmed somewhere other than where they were supposed to be. I've never seen DeNiro play such a turd. Walken & Savage were eaually absurd. I honestly don't know what anyone was thinking while filming these scenes. How could they not know they were assembling the worst pile of crap ever?

The movie is overlong, and far too much time is spent on certain scenes (such as the wedding).  Pacing is not so great.  Cinematography is only average.Overall, I give ""The Deer Hunter"" 8/10.  It scores (especially in the acting department), but in my opinion doesn't stand up to many later war films.

Rest is Drama/Romance/Thriller with scenes in the hometown back in the USA and in a city in Vietnam.
The main theme of the movie is actually an allegory for the Vietnam war and does not show what actually happened back then.
Not too much of 'deer hunting' going on and when it does happen, I wouldn't say it is a crucial part of the movie or maybe I just haven't seen the importance and REAL deeper meaning of it yet.
I like the main idea behind the movie (the allegory I was talking about), also good actors with DeNiro, Meryl Streep (I liked her more back then) and Christopher Walken.
I recommend watching it with breaks or in 2 steps since some scenes seem slightly trivial, but overall it shows great sceneries and creates a story worth watching.

156,fimimix,..a realistic story of what war does to men..,10,28 September 2006,"Please read some of the other reviews to get the story of this momumental film.I was delighted that so many people caught the intention of this movie - another great one from the 70s - to give a commentary on how such brutality completely destroys everyone who is involved in it. The Vietnamese War actually ruined many lives of people who never were there; had I been a parent in that era, I would have gladly sent my sons to Canada to prevent them from being drafted. Some ""users"" state the term ""enlisted"" - voluntary. Maybe a few did, but the majority of the men sent there were drafted; because the story was about White Russians in Pennsylvania, there weren't many African Americans in it. How ironic that is, because that race toward the end of the conflict, when troops were getting scarce, were the predominant men (barely out of their teens) who were sent to war. I think Cimino did a disservice to them; there should have been more in the hospital scene. I saw one.Younger people may not be aware of the uproar against this war. Just as President Bush has had to be slightly ""untruthful"" about his reasons for the ""war on terror"" in Iraq, Lyndon Johnson did not tell the whole truth about many actions he ordered for Vietnam. He was so distraught when the truth was made public, he decided not to run for re-election. Richard Nixon, along with the many other despicably criminal actions he was involved in, lied about heavily bombing Cambodia (""The Killing Fields""), he resigned the presidency rather than face being impeached. While shouting ""democracy!"", some of our presidents became meglamaniacs with the power that office holds. We can only wait to see how history handles Bush.......unfortunately, the world is heavily peopled with Muslims. Not all of them want to become Americans nor democratic; they know little of that. Their cultures are so much older than ours.There are a lot of films that depict the dreadful battles fought in Veitnam; ""The Deer Hunter"" mercifully showed only one major one, while concentrating on how brutality eventually causes insanity, with the total insanity of the Vietnamese to get out of Saigon. Our government turned its back on thousands of boys-hardly-yet-men, closing its eyes on their torture once they returned home. ""The War on Terror"" has produced almost as many ruined lives, plus sending troops ill-equipped to fight. Hmmmmmm.........DeNiro (Mike) actually prepared for his role by visiting steel-mills and meeting the workers and their stouthearted families. No wonder they drank so much ! ""Trivia"" also tells us the entire cast and crew slept on the floor of a warehouse for five days while those scenes were being shot. This is by far one of DeNiro's best roles; he was young and so energetic, and was given a beautiful script by Deric Washburn. Bravo! to DeNiro. Again, Bravo! to Christopher Walken (Nick) for his brilliant performance, and also John Savage (Steven) for his stellar acting in all of his scenes. Realism to the extreme. Meryl Streep (Linda) was so into her role, she actually adlibbed most of her lines; this was her audition for ""Sophie's Choice"". Johns Cazale (Stanley) was his usually obnoxious character, giving his final, great performance. Po Pao Pee (the ""Russian roulette"" referee) was the epitome of total detachment in those harrowing scenes, showing that some folk CAN ignore their participation in brutality - the bosses of the game stoically ate their meal and raked-in the cash for the final game. Julien Grinda (Pierre Segui) was the sole character left from decades of French colonialism in Vietnam and the mess they left it in, portraying people who manage to live through situations they cannot control. Cinematography rates a 10, at least......Yes, we needed that hour at the beginning of ""The Deer Hunter"" to become acquainted with those naive men who lived their lives to the fullest, before going off to war. It was necessary to know them to compare the misery all of their lives became. Several of the actors were injured; it was a dangerous movie to film. ""Steven's"" realization his wounds made him unfit for family life; ""Nick's"" addiction to heroin gave him the stamina to ""roulette"" for money; ""Mike's"" guilt for coming-out of it all whole, and failing to save ""Nick"", then loving ""Nick's"" lady; the introversion of ""Steven's"" wife; the solemn funeral and breakfast for ""Nick""; all of this is the real ""Deer Hunter"".Life is like that. During ""God Bless America"" at the end, all of the characters knowing they intensely loved their country, no matter what, broke my heart. Yet, it also gave me strength to realize we Americans ARE a truly heroic people - not perfect, but mostly good - this is one of my favorite films, and again I want to rate a 50 to honor the gigantic effort it took to bring this thriller to the screen -",The Deer Hunter
157,basrutten,"Lots of atmosphere, little story",5,4 October 2005,"I generally like movies dealing with the Vietnam war. Several of them, like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Platoon"", and ""Apocalypse Now"" I consider to be true classics. I had heard many good things about ""The Deer Hunter"", and thus I had quite high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.""The Deer Hunter"" focuses on how the Vietnam war changes the lives of three all-American friends, Niko (Christopher Walken), Michael (Robert DeNiro) and Steven (John Savage). They live relatively happy, normal lives in a small American town, then get sent to Vietnam, where they become heavily traumatized (to say the least) and upon returning to the USA, realize that nothing will ever be the same again.That's certainly a relevant and interesting story for a movie, and when ""The Deer Hunter"" first came out I can understand that it must have hit like a bomb since it dealt with a theme that most people weren't prepared to face just yet, and it does so in a pretty outspoken manner. More than twenty-five years later, though, I can't help but feel that it's not really such a good movie.The first problem is the pacing. The movie weighs in at about three hours, but there's just not enough happening to justify that running time. The director spends an inordinate amount of time on scenes that are merely meant to establish the atmosphere instead of developing story or characters. During many of the sequences, either nothing or something very mundane happens. Yes, I understand that the main characters are supposed to be normal American boys so many of the things they do are mundane, but Cimino is way overdoing it here.The slow pacing is even more jarring given the fact that the movie's story isn't told very well. It's not very coherent, there are some rather large leaps in time during which it's left totally unclear what happens to the characters, and some of the things make very little sense (e.g. Walken's character surviving dozens of games of Russian roulette...while that's not impossible, it's very very implausible). Some of the time spent on fleshing out the atmosphere could and should have been used to improve the flow of the story.That being said, the movie definitely isn't without its moments. The Russian roulette scenes are spine-chilling and really deserve the legendary status they have achieved. The acting by DeNiro and Walken is great as well, and the music is beautiful and fitting. Unfortunately, Meryl Streep and John Savage are a lot less convincing. Streep is melodrama at its worst here, and Savage overacts heavily, if you ask me.Finally, it's a bit of a shame that the movie takes such a one-sided look at the Vietnam war. It only looks at the effects of the atrocities committed by the VC on the Americans, not at the validity of the war as a whole or the role of the USA. You'd think that after being heavily traumatized, the three boys might at least become a bit angry with the USA for sending them into such a senseless war, but instead the United States are glorified in the cringe-inducing final scene. I understand that the time wasn't right for a real analysis of the Vietnam war, but the approach taken here (evil VCs traumatize innocent American boys) seems to be a bit too simplistic.So, in the end that leaves me very disappointed with this movie. While it's certainly a relevant movie about a relevant subject, I don't think that subject was handled all that well. A couple of brilliant scenes and some good acting IMHO fail to make up for a really slow pace, a so-so story, and a very one-sided look at the Vietnam war..**1/2 out of *****",The Deer Hunter
158,asifahsankhan,The most emotionally shattering Vietnam War movie ever made!,10,25 July 2017,"Michael Cimino's filmmaking journey was hardly a bump-less ride. It seems that his name is unfortunately doomed to go down in history as of a director whose third film completely ruined his career—Heaven's Gate not only led a distinguished American studio into bankruptcy, but also enraged critics and the audiences to a degree of making every Cimino's future project destined to fail, both critically and commercially. After his second feature, the world simply expected him to keep delivering in the future. It's extremely difficult to live up to that kind of expectation when you introduce yourself to the world with a film like The Deer Hunter. The gloomy all-American epic story of three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania deeply and differently affected by the Vietnam war completely swept the United States off their feet back in 1978, earning five Academy Awards and turning the world's spotlights on Cimino in the process.The movie has two important themes: friendship and war. With ""The Lord of the Rings"" featuring a somewhat full-blown friendship between Frodo and Sam (that sometimes borders on being overly- sentimental but works), ""The Deer Hunter"" represents a portrait of true, powerful friendship. This is superior to any of the scenes between Frodo and Sam in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the characters here are more realistic and empathetic, the performances more convincing. When he finds Nicky surrounded by men putting wagers on his life, Michael tries to bring him home, but Nicky just spits in his face. To reveal his feelings for Nicky, Michael holds a gun to his own head. ""Is this what you want?"" he taunts. ""I love you, Nicky."" And then he pulls the trigger and the barrel clicks: empty. Michael's face suddenly drains, a reflection of his inner relief.The reason why the film is lengthy is because it rolls out like a legend rather than a documentary and its greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Savage, John Cazale and Christopher Walken. But it's the De Niro character, Michael ""Mike"" Vronsky, the one that somehow finds the strength to keep going and to keep Savage and Walken going. Both on and off-screen, De Niro, as usual plays his part brilliantly. He survives the prison camp and helps the others. Then, finally home from Vietnam, he is surrounded by a silence we can never quite penetrate. He is touched vaguely by desire for the girl that more than one of them left behind, but does not act decisively. He is a ""hero,"" greeted shyly, awkwardly by the hometown people.The film perfectly manages to close it curtains (for America as well) with everyone at John's bar, singing ""God Bless America"". And they reverentially (freeze-framed) raise their beer mugs to Nick, as Michael toasts ""Here's to Nick.""In truth, Cimino's The Deer Hunter has not aged as well as its younger brother, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), but there are many legitimate reasons for this. Apocalypse Now was always imperfect, and, in ways no one could have anticipated; its very messiness, inscrutability, and shoehorned ending only gain stature as the perfect metaphor for the imperfect fiasco that was Vietnam.",The Deer Hunter

This is a powerful statement about the effect of war on men-- some get stronger, some get weaker and some never recover.  The ensemble works well here- Deniro as the strong one, Savage as the wounded one and Walken as the one who is destroyed.  The Russian Roulette scenes are the most powerful ones in the movie.  A tour-de-force of film making showing the Vietnam era in a small industrial town.",The Deer Hunter
161,ferdinand1932,A minor footnote,3,13 April 2015,"The skill of a director, like a painter and a writer, is to be able to make the right choices: to be able to prioritize elements into balance relative with each other over the course of a movie, a book or on canvas. This makes the meaning of the artistic object stronger; it helps convey its purpose, it defines the good from the great artist with all the requisite skills.This quality is brought out in Jackson Pollock, whose works baffles and angers many as just a plane of drips of equal measure without focus or balance. This is of course utterly wrong as Pollock's work is highly structured, layered; the operating intelligence and skill forms the work.To a degree Pollock seems like a good simile to this film. It has a vast canvas, it is along work and yet it exemplifies the narrow ability, the stunted skills. For instance, real time and cinematic time are often rendered in the same way so there are many long sequences of no real value which strain interest but as they progress, rather like cinéma vérité, they intend to add to the truth of the representation but do not because the cinema is not reality. It is this essential flaw which then weighs down the entire film to the result that all the major scenes are very long, overly so, and they are given almost equal screen time, as if to articulate that all is of the same significance.This is defect is a cardinal error in an artistic work. Imagine a novel doing such a thing, the minutiae would be so enormous the writer would be crippled typing it all.It is said that in post-production Cimino could not remove sequences - that he succumbed to the basic mistake of not being able to give priority to the material. However it's not that editing could revise the movie into a tighter more engaging experience with better perspective. If that were possible it would cut the duration and truncate the material which would in all likelihood yield another 'Days of Heaven', a meandering narrative disaster itself. The fault with 'The Deer Hunter' lies in the script, it has everything tossed into it: friendship, love, war, ethnic culture, the US; the list goes on and on, and with all that it its architecture is riddled with dry rot.The result is monotonous, pompous, rambling and inevitable.Not even the technical qualities can salvage something despite excellent photography, and the sense of place and location is very good too, as are the performances from a major cast; and yet, the most important decisions about balance and proportion were not made because those that should have known how to do it had no skill. This deficit would be demonstrated in the subsequent work.",The Deer Hunter
162,talisencrw,Rightfully considered one of the finest American war films ever made!,10,18 July 2016,"With director Cimino's recent death and his reputation in tatters since the debacle of 'Heaven's Gate', I decided to visit 'The Deer Hunter'. Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS? Many film lovers who despise Cimino's work instantly clam up when 'The Deer Hunter' is mentioned...and there's a reason for that.

It has little if anything to say about Vietnam, and pathetically little to say about human psychology in general. It's just endless and empty.About the only decent bit is the Russian roulette sequence. Yes, this is indeed gripping... or, at least, it could have been, within a less bloated package. As it is, it only seems to add insult to injury - as if to say, THIS is how interesting your three hours COULD have been, IF we could have been bothered to come up with an actual story, not to mention the discipline to tell it economically.In a way, the Russian roulette metaphor IS appropriate.

This movie brings out the very worst in man and portrays it as if it is in every one of our actions. The deer hunting scenes were comedy. They drive a couple of hours from Pennsylvania and hunt in high mountain peaks with glaciers... Terrible continuity. During the stalk of the same deer, they show several different canned shots of several different deer. The ONLY shot of substance was near the end, when the hunter didn't shot the deer. Many men have said it different ways but in general, 'If you have ever hunted man, all other hunting pales in comparison.' If you've burned out your brain blowing dope you might like this movie...

The beginning was good, it gave us a chance to know better the characters of this movie. The Vietnam scenes were also great and even shocking, I almost felt what they were probably feeling during Russian roulette scene. But after that many acts of characters didn't make enough sense to me. Like Christopher Walken's character's behavior. I could not understand it.

The performance's are often brilliant as is Cinimo's type of directing. It's bold and often daring, but Cinimo pull's it off and delivers a powerful ballad of film-making.Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken both play their characters to an extent that you could almost feel like you could fully connect with them, and Cinimo has conquered this exuberantly well. Especially De Niro who gives his best performance yet as the warm-hearted Mike. The bondage between individual characters is sublime and powerful.Cinimo moves the camera from scene to scene like a painting; beautifully illustrated and detailed to the point of near greatness.The music is immensely bold and chilling every time it's being played and adds a certain depth and movement in the characterisation of the characters.Verdict: A god among any film about Vietnam and definitely provides a strong-held suggestion of being one of the great's of cinema.",The Deer Hunter
168,PCC0921,Depression in Three Acts,8,10 January 2021,"This film is depressing, but effective. The grainy film stock used in the film gave the film a certain reality factor, like it was almost a documentary. That was felt even in the first hour of the film, in which we are introduced to the characters and have to sit through a wedding, which annoyed me a little, but the director, Cimino, was able to force the depressing edge, even into the wedding and that gave the film an interesting dimension that would bring me back into the story. The second part of the film is the war section and that was done quite well capturing the horror and the sadness of Vietnam. The third part brings it all together, but there never really is a feeling of finality or an achievement in not feeling depressed. Hailed as a great film, I personally feel it was a little slow.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",The Deer Hunter
169,JaydoDre,Good atmosphere but rather inefficient,7,28 November 2014,"This film takes a reeeeeeeeeealy long time setting up its atmosphere and characters, an entire first hour in fact and then some. I found many scenes to serve no other purpose but that. The atmosphere is important to the film and it is created well, but the movie may lose your attention a few times in the process. There is not much symbolism or story or tension inserted into all those extra scenes; not much for the mind to chew on.The film is about the life of several people from a blue-collar immigrant community before during and after the Vietnam war.It is a fairly heavy and gloomy film. Even when the characters are laughing and having fun, you feel the sobering weight of their lives. The soundtrack blasts Russian choir in the mountains. There are a lot of twilight and night scenes.The film has one of the better performances from Christopher Walken and John Savage. The latter is a bit boring in the beginning but really stops you in your tracks later in the movie. Robert De Niro shines in the lead role as usual, but that is not a surprise. On the other hand, I think Meryl Streep is much better than given credit to. She has a very natural delivery. Robert de Niro is good but he is still acting. Meryl is like a real human being filmed with a home camera.Deer Hunter has good actors, good acoustic soundtrack, good atmosphere and some strong story moments, but it also has too many empty scenes. It is a bit like really good jam spread too thinly over the bread. If the makers just really wanted for the film to be 3 hours long, they could have concentrated a bit more on the life of those characters left behind in the US during the war, who instead get completely forgotten while the 3 main characters are off at war.Nevertheless, this epic feels solid enough and is worth your time. I personally do not even mind the window dressing because the film still works. It is more of an issue from a technical point of view that could have been avoided.",The Deer Hunter

172,Ozzy2000,A classic Vietbam War film,10,26 May 2008,"Written and directed by Michael Cimino was one of his few films and was one of the very first Vietnam war films. Originally Hollywood would not back the film but eventually did during its making. Set in the sixties it is about a group of Russian -American men young men who work together in a Pennsylvania steel foundry and also go deer hunting together in the nearby mountains. The three main characters Michael (Robert De Niro), Stephen (John Savage), Nick (Christopher Walken) are heavily ensconced in the local Russian community and party and hunt together with their other friends Stan (John Cazale) and John ( George Dzundza). Michael and Nick also share a strong and competing affection for Linda (Meryl Streep) but she is with Nick. Stephen gets married and then the three main character's enlist to fight in Vietnam. In Vietnam they get captured and all become separated and the tragedy of the war begins for them. Their Viet Cong captors force them to play ""Russian Roulette"" which Michael uses to successfully overcome them and escape. They subsequently become separated and Michael returns to the USA to learn the fate of his friends and deal with the emotional aftermath of their community. He returns to Vietnam in an attempt to rescue Nick who has succumbed to drugs and the seediest side of South Vietnam.Great and strong performances from all the actors earned the film 5 Oscars including best supporting actor for Christopher Walken who got paid $US25,000 for his role.The film skillfully juggles between the chaotic miasma of Vietnam and the small American Industrial town. The ""Russian Roulette scenes have become a film legend. There is a sort of irony in this 1st major Vietnam war film in that the Russians were fighting with the North Vietnamese and the protagonists were Russian.

Robert De Niro puts in arguably his finest performance. This was made at a time when he wouldn't appear in just any old film, and he seemed to have a knack of picking classic films to appear in. It would be unfair to expect every role an actor played to be a classic, but to be honest the Robert De Niro of today seems a million miles away rom the Robert De Niro that appears in The Deer Hunter. Everyone thinks of the Russian roulette scene when they think of this film, and its probably be mentioned in most of the comments here, but I don't think I've seen a more powerful, amazing and realistic performance than what De Niro does in this scene, he's quite simply bloody fantastic, what an actor. Also of course this wasn't a one man show, Christopher Walken deservedly won an oscar for his role here. Meryl Streep is brilliant, actually the whole cast are. Sadly this was John Cazale's last perforance, he died shortly after filming, at least he left us with this last great appearance in film. The director Michael Cimino made an amazing film here and its baffling he's never come close to making a decent film since. Robert De Niro, you're simply the best. *** 10/10 ***",The Deer Hunter

Screenwriter Deric Washburn knows how to create real characters and he knows how to introduce us to their inner life with tiny details. But still, the film doesn't really work for me. I appreciate the basic idea behind it. I think the decision to spend this big amount of time letting the audience get to know their characters is brilliant. So the first hour is the one that works masterly for me. But also the final hour, with the boys coming back from Vietnam (or not, as in Nick's case), is crafted well. So, what works in Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" is the character drama that shows us the consequences of this war for the individuals and as a result of that for the group. What doesn't work is the middle part in Vietnam. The Russian Roulette is terrifying but doesn't fit into this context.

The best two performances though out of many great ones are from Christopher Walken, and Robert De Niro. This is Walken's best performance, and De Niro delivers powerfully.

178,cdjh-81125,Not A War Film But A Character Piece,9,4 December 2016,"At first glance Michael Ciminos, ""The Deer Hunter"" would appear to be a war film but it's not really like this it's really about a friendship that is torn apart by the Vietnam War and this makes this film a much more compelling film to view and a damn good one at that. I loved The Deer Hunter mainly because of its characters and how the film takes the time to build them up. This film uses its extremely long run time to its advantage, so that it can fully take the time to explore its characters and how their experiences effect them. The friendship in this movie is a believable one, they feel genuine because that do things that real friends do, they argue and make fun of each other but ultimately respect one and other and that makes the characters seem more relatable in the eyes of the audience. Robert DeNiro is fantastic in this film, De Niro pulls of his character with style he makes him a wounded soul but one that is still loyal I could not have seen anyone else play this character. This is easily Christopher Walkens best performance because he gives such a genuine performance in all aspects of his character when it comes to his likable and childish character but also his traumatised persona that is made very believable through the films fantastic writing. Meryl Streep was really good in this film I do have a few issues with her character that I will elaborate on. Now this film doesn't have many action sequences but when they come they are extremely brutal and realistic because of the time Cimino took to build the stakes of them and the Russian roulette sequences are incredibly intense and extremely well directed. This film has an excellent way of analysing the effects of war of its characters you get the idea that they don't want to be viewed as heroes and I loved the last act of the movie that explores this idea. I suppose my biggest issue with this film is the eventual romance that blooms between De Niro and Streets characters and it's mainly because I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between them and unlike other aspects of this film such as the central friendship and the war sequences it just didn't feel genuine and was extremely forced. The Deer Hunter is an amazing film, it's a film that any film fan looking for substance and well developed characters should watch, its a film that never feels fake and has some truly amazing performances and is easily one of my favourite Best Picture Winners. 92%/A",The Deer Hunter
179,movieman-200,Still Too Long But Better Looking Transfer This Time Around,7,6 September 2005,"Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978) is perhaps the most aggressively critical and monumental critique of the Vietnam experience ever put on film. The story is a frank, brooding and foreboding deconstruction of lives plunged into the horrors of war. Michael (Robert DeNiro) is an honorable loner who doesn't perceive much to be admired from his life as a Pennsylvanian steel mill worker. His one ray of sunshine in an otherwise dismal and inescapable future is Linda (Meryl Streep). She is seemingly pledged in marriage to Nick (Christopher Walken)  if only he'd realize it and ask her to marry him. But Nick is a hot shot first and a lover second. Knowing full well that Linda will wait for Nick, presumably forever, Michael keeps an honorable distance from his own foolish romantic fancies. He also plays big brother to naïve Steven (John Savage), the youngster of their motley crew that includes boorish, John (George Dzundza), laconic Axel (Chuck Aspengren) and meddling Stanley (John Cazale). Indulged by misguided patriotism Nick, Michael and Steven go off to Vietnam shortly after Steven marries his beloved, the pregnant Angela (Rutanya Alda). They are captured by the Vietcong, brought to a prison camp and forced to play Russian roulette against each other. And although Michael's quick thinking affords them the opportunity to temporarily escape, they are soon separated once more  and arguably forever ripped from the binding mindset that once united them. Cimino (whose critical misfire on Heaven's Gate would effectively end his all too brief directorial supremacy in Hollywood), labors intensely on this film and at an excruciatingly slow pace. Indulging is every whim in very long takes (and for that matter, scenes) the story is told around four pivotal events in these character's lives: Steven's wedding, the deer hunt, the nail biting roulette game and Nick's death and aftermath. Clearly, the film is an opus magnum of self-indulgence for the director  shot sometimes in an almost documentary style (as are the opening scenes in the steel mill or the evacuation of Saigon, that actually employs news reel footage to help fill in the blanks). Yet Cinimo has forgotten a fundamental of film making: that economy of the shot is usually best to appeal to the tastes of a wide audience base. For those who are first time viewers more attuned to contemporary editing style this film is a decided change of pace. It refrains from tedious exposition but replaces dialogue with stagnancy of the narrative. Hence, The Deer Hunter is NOT for everyone  even in 1978. But as time rolls on it seems to narrow its fan base considerably. At 3hrs. 9 min. it is apt to put many to sleep.The Deer Hunter was made previously available from Universal in one unworthy transfer recycled twice in different packaging. This new 2-disc edition is an improvement on the previously issued disc, if only that it has been enhanced for 16:9 displays. When displayed on a widescreen television the resolution on this transfer is considerably improved with rich colors that, on the original disc, were muddy and undistinguished at best. Flesh tones are remarkably realistic (consider the vintage of the film stock). Fine detail is fairly well realized, even during the darkest moments in the film. Only the vintage stock footage of the actual conflict in Vietnam betrays their origin with a considerable increase in film grain and age related artifacts. The rest of the film is, by far and wide a very smooth, grain free visual presentation. Universal has also remastered the audio to 5.1. The new mix exhibits a sonic characteristic that is dated but very well delineated across all five channels of one's home theater. My biggest bone of contention with The Deer Hunter: The Legacy Series DVD, is that it is embarrassingly scant on extra features  especially for a 2 disc set. Disc one contains only the film with a new audio commentary by cinematographer Vilmo Zsigmond and journalist Bob Fisher. Disc two contains several deleted scenes (not remastered or presented anamorphically) and the film's rambling theatrical trailer. Both are presented without any fanfare or introduction and in the poorest of video and sound quality. Truly, there is NOTHING to recommend the inclusion of that second disc. And for a film that  at its initial release  was hailed as an enduring masterpiece (though arguably, it's not)  the absence of any retrospective documentary or at least interviews with some of its stars is a general embarrassment to Universal DVD. Perhaps we'll eventually see The Deer Hunter: Deluxe 'Absolutely Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About The Vietnam War But Were Afraid to Ask' Edition somewhere on the horizon.",The Deer Hunter
180,Kubris,What a profound effect.,8,22 June 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 134Usually when someone references a film, you say something along the lines of, ""Oh yeah! That one! Awesome film."" Even if its something serious with merit, not just a blockbuster. I don't think I'll be giving that kind of reception when The Deer Hunter comes up in topic, if it ever does. It's an excellent film, but having seen it now I find myself with this feeling of loneliness and sadness. Despite appearing to be a war film, there's very, very little actual war. Most of the film takes place in a Pennsylvania steel town, showing the social lives of a group of blue collar friends. In fact, that's the first hour. It certainly feels long, and after at least 40 minutes one wonders if the plot is ever going to move. But then, very abruptly, it does and one of the most famous scenes in film comes around which you've no doubt at least heard about. Russian roulette. The tension is unbearable. The film eventually gets back to Pennsylvania and shows the effect of the conflict on the returning soldiers and the town. Today it seems most war films carry the ""this is a war film so we have to show how wasteful war is"" motto. That worked for All Quiet on the Western Front and Paths of Glory, but with the news today and knowledge of history, we get it: war is terrible. So films like this get points for thinking differently, in this case focusing on the characters not as soldiers, but as men. Many war films try to add depth by having soldiers talk about ""back home"": The Deer Hunter shows it for two hours. That's why I have the sick feeling, because of what the film tries to say that is less frequently explored.It's all so believable because of the terrific acting. Robert De Niro leads as Mike, the cool bearded deer hunter who tries to keep his friends together, who won't give Stan his boots, and who yells in the face of death. I've always admired De Niro's work and this is one of his best.But De Niro isn't the only artist in the cast: Christopher Walken, Oscar winner shines as Nicky, the boy who became a man, or something. His eyes change as he does. Stevie is emotionally draining in his scenes, for like Nicky he is out of his element and can't cope. This is a film that doesn't get justice in writing. It needs to be experienced, but not everyone will enjoy it. For two hours there is only talking, and it can grow tedious at times but there is payoff in the end. A piece of art that leaves you unhappy, but satisfied. 8.5/10",The Deer Hunter
181,schroederagustavo,"One of the greatest, most disturbing films I have ever seen",10,10 July 2020,"I was deeply moved by this epic film in many ways. I wouldn't call The Deer Hunter a Vietnam film, and I would hesitate to even call it a ""war film"". More than anything, I saw the film as an exploration of how war affects the lives of people, not just the people that actively participate in the war, but also the people close to them. In The Deer Hunter, it is an exploration of regular American citizens in small-town USA, Pennsylvania to be exact. Some people may say the scenes in the opening are too stretched out, regarding the whole wedding and the deer hunting, and that the Vietnam scenes are occupy too little screen time. I would respectfully disagree. If you go into this movie thinking it will be a war movie, you'll be disappointed. It's a drama, a flawed drama about flawed people in a flawed town participating in a broken war. I loved every second of it and was captivated profoundly by it. It is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen.",The Deer Hunter

It is certainly one of the most powerful films I have seen. While this movie is looked upon as a war movie I think it is much more than that, I think it is a character study of how war affects people, not just the people involved in the war but their families also. There are moments in this film that I will never forget, like the absolutely terrifying russian roulette scene, if you think about the situation the characters are in it is very terrifying. An emotionally shattering experience.",The Deer Hunter
184,Camoo,Flawed but Powerful Masterpiece,9,6 April 2007,"There is no doubting that is a great film, a monument to a tremendous amount of work and care, a showcase for some of the best actors in a generation, and stunning cinematography. And it was John Cazale's last film, a brilliant ending to a short but incredible career. It won many awards, fixed the director a place in history (and possibly enough power to never have to work in this capacity again), and has gone down in history as one of the greatest films of all time. But it is a flawed masterpiece, as much as those flaws don't ultimately matter when surrounded with such mastery, I couldn't help but notice them on my last viewing. The unconvincing and jarring mid-section surrounding the classic scene with Christopher Walken playing Russian roulette seemed stapled together, from when DeNiro returned to the States, only to return to Saigon and find Walkin's character with such ease and join him at the roulette table. Somehow this seemed forced... But, well there is not much else. The scenes in Vietnam are some of the most realistic and disturbing images ever burned to celluloid, however the Asians in the film come off stereotyped into typical enemy roles (Cimino was later criticized for stereotyping Chinese in his film 'the Year of the Dragon' - apparently he doesn't learn well!), but I suppose thats missing the point- the film is about brotherhood, war, peace, love, devotion, and patriotism. I preferred this to 'Apocalypse Now', another epic Vietnam film by a director who was in no way involved in Vietnam...",The Deer Hunter
185,paulijcalderon,An affecting exploration,9,9 February 2017,"Michael Cimino may have been difficult to work with, but you can't say he didn't make a good film. ""The Deer Hunter"" is at its core a very tragic story that will stay in the viewers mind for a while.It showed less about the Vietnam war than I thought it would. But this film is about much more than just that. It's main focus is the story of a few friends and how they all change in different ways, even if they had to endure the same horrible things. It makes you think how some things they went through would affect you. It doesn't move quickly at all and takes its time.I know a lot of War films are about similar subjects, but I think most of them explore it in different and unique ways. This one has its own way of exploring how lost you can become without degrading any other War film out there. It's a very long film, but it's really worth experiencing at least once when you have the time. It's a very affecting great story.",The Deer Hunter

A dramatic and sensitive film, that alternates moments of happiness and poetry with extremely violent and shocking sequences, as the combat scenes and in prominence the cruel and almost unbearable torture that Christopher Walken's character suffers in his enemies' hands. Directed with accurately and realism by Michael Cimino,  ""The Deer Hunter"" is a  faithful portrait of the sequels that a war leaves marked in the soldiers, and, more than that, this movies denounces the disdain that sometimes the society has for them .

187,blazesnakes9,The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978,10,30 September 2013,"In 1975, America was leaving Vietnam as the communist Southeast Asia country fell under communist control. Hollywood at the time had already made a Vietnam movie and that film was John Wayne's The Green Berets. That film became the first pro-war film about the Vietnam War. In other words, the war is good. Well, that didn't fit well with the critics. Critics in that time in 1968 wanted a serious movie about the Vietnam War. It wasn't till 1978, about 10 years later, that Hollywood made the first anti-war about the Vietnam War. That film is, of course, was The Deer Hunter. It told the story about three Pennsylvania steel-workers who are having the time of their lives. Among the ordinary jobs they have, they also have a wedding before they are send to Vietnam to fight. The three men are played, very through and very strong, by Robert De Niro, John Savage and Christopher Walken, who won a Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The three men leave the USA to go to Vietnam. They had no idea what kind of physical and mental destruction awaits them. The three men are forced to play Russian Roulette in a Vietcong hut. They have to survive the war and their aftermath. But, tragedy strikes and changes their lives, forever. As I said before, The Deer Hunter, has a lot of great performances by the three leading men and also, Meryl Streep, who is so effective as the role, Linda. The Deer Hunter took home 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. I felt that the movie works on character development. And, when we see the aftermath of the war, we see the aftermath of the three men. Director Michael Cimino tells this tale of war very thoroughly. Even though it runs 3 hours, it never runs out of steam. And even in the Russian Roulette scene, I felt so choked up that I felt like someone was strangling me. The suspense of that scene put me on edge. There's no doubt in my mind that The Deer Hunter is the best film of 1978. After The Deer Hunter, other great Vietnam movies came along. Movies like Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July and Platoon followed. And even when The Deer Hunter was released in 1978,other films told different tales about the war. Go Tell the Spartans was another film that dealt with the topic of the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter is a shattering, heroic and deeply effective war drama. ★★★★ 4 stars.",The Deer Hunter
188,eastbergholt2002,Film about malaise in 1970s America,7,27 December 2008,"I recently watched the Deer Hunter for the first time in 30 years. Back in the late 1970s people were trying to make sense of what happened in Vietnam and the Deer Hunter was one of a number of films that offered an insight into the war. It won five Oscars including Best Picture and became a powerful indictment of Vietnam. The film focused on ordinary working class draftees and presented a horrific view of the war. The film entered the mainstream and helped convince most people that Vietnam was a tragic mistake. It also played a role in persuading middle America that fighting wars in foreign countries should be avoided. Many of the film's most shocking scenes now seem dishonest and manipulative. There is also an underlying subtext of self-loathing and pessimism permeating the film which probably reflects the post-Watergate mood in 1978. These days it all seems strange and depressing.The Deer Hunter almost seems like two movies. The first is set in Pennsylvania and is the story of three young men: Michael(Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage) before they are sent to fight in Vietnam. It has a rawness which is missing from most of the formulaic movies of today. The film doesn't conform to a preconceived view about how films should be structured. It provides a gritty depiction of life in a small close-knit steel-town. The men are the children of Russian immigrants. The American dream almost seems to have passed them by. They live in a world where men get drunk and the women get slapped if they step out of line. The movie shows a small town culture which in later years became a victim of globalization. Peaceful Asian democracies displaced low-tech American jobs. The U.S. scenes now seem the most interesting. When the film moves to Vietnam it's less credible. Some elements of the story seem so far-fetched that they would fit into a Rambo movie. The film has a surprisingly xenophobic view of the world. Vietnamese men are sub-human sadistic monsters, their women are either strippers or prostitutes. There is even a cynical Frenchman who helps corrupt Christopher Walken. What the French were still doing in Saigon in 1975 is not explained. The Americans from Pensylvannia are depicted as innocent victims in a world full of depraved foreigners. Most of the scenes in Vietnam involve men playing Russian roulette, which although dramatic only make sense as a metaphor for war in general. In reality these episodes are pure fiction. The film tries to convince you that the Vietnamese were beyond help and not worth saving. Back in 1978, I concluded that asking young men to fight in such a conflict was unfair. The college kids who opposed the war do not appear in this movie. The film focuses on a group of Americans who appear to have no political opinions and do not question why they are sent to Vietnam. They are uneducated, inarticulate and just trust their government. In mays ways this makes what happens to them all the more chilling. The film makes no attempt to explain what the war was about or why Americans died in Vietnam. Without the political context, the film leaves you with a very muddled view of this period in American history. The lack of a broader perspective leaves something of a hole at the center of the film. Watching this film is not a fun experience.The film calls for a talented cast that can display a range of emotions and all the actors are excellent. De Niro plays a stoic hero who believes in honor and duty and doesn't talk about his experiences. Walken is outstanding as Nick, and was never as good or as animated again. I had forgotten that Meryl Streep was once young and beautiful and it's fascinating watching her play a shy and vulnerable supermarket worker. The movie shows that war is hell, but war has always been hell. You feel that the negativity and despair portrayed in the movie had a lot to do with the fact that the U.S. lost the war and was suffering a crises of confidence. The U.S. eventually recovered its swagger and by the 1990s was prepared to send troops into combat again. Although it's an interesting historical document, The Deer Hunter now seems flawed and exploitative. Looking back, it's not the definitive movie about Vietnam but it says a lot of the mood of the country in 1978.",The Deer Hunter
189,SeminolePhenom,An incredibly visual and realistic story of the war and its effects on those who served..,10,21 October 2005,"Michael(Robert De Niro), Nick(Christopher Walken) and Steven(John Savage) join the battle in Vietnam together leaving their friends and lovers in their small town in Pennsylvania. While fighting, they experience horrors unimaginable and leave Vietnam traumatized beyond reason.With such an amazing cast, it's hard to believe that The Deer Hunter could fail as a film. But nobody could have expected that this could have been one of the greatest war movies ever made. With gripping visual images, The Deer Hunter took audiences to an unknown place where fiction meets reality.The Deer Hunter is set in a some-what Godfather tone. The movie is dark but light-hearted at times. The main character is De Niro, its exceedingly violent for it's time, and it even has a time-consuming wedding scene in the beginning. This is done very well and I must give a complement to Michael Cimino for the great writing as well. It may be a little slow at times but it makes the story flow and lets the camera-work shine.The main theme of this movie is a game of roulette that the prisoners are made to play while being kept prisoners in Vietnam. The characters are made to pull the trigger on a gun at their head repeatedly until being killed as the Vietnamese gambled on them. Their courage is shown by them taking their own lives instead of letting the enemies execute them as well as the massive amount of hysteria it caused from pulling a gun to one's head. Overall, the movie is an all-around great movie that includes a great cast and convincing acting.I highly recommend this movie.",The Deer Hunter
190,Hawkensian,"A vast, multi-faceted, albeit slightly maudlin epic with a beautiful score, striking cinematography and gripping acting intensity.",9,9 August 2012,"A sprawling epic of three hours, 'The Deer Hunter' is a striking, moving film. It focuses on a group of working class men who live in Clairton, Pennsylvania; which whilst is an industrial town, is a pretty and tranquil part of the world. However, this is strictly the film's depiction of Clairton; it was actually shot in various locations across Ohio. These men have firm working class sentiments, they work in the steel factory together and, once their shifts are over, drop by the local bar to shoot pool and have a few drinks; this is the men's comfortable existences, however their lives are soon to be turned upside down. The men are called to serve their country in Vietnam, where they are to be subjected to an array of abhorrence that will change them forever. It is a striking film in every sense. John Williams' score, the acoustic 'Cavatina', is blissful; it complements every scene it features in. Its sequences of natural beauty and Clairton life are starkly juxtaposed in the film's second act: the infamous Russian roulette scene. It is acted with truly remarkable conviction; the actors must have forced themselves into an unpleasant place to produce such harrowing realism. The scene is so visceral and intense that it creates a disturbed silence amongst an audience; even its biggest critics would have to try very hard not to be affected by it. Normally a critically acclaimed film, 'The Deer Hunter' hasn't been devoid of criticism. It has been labelled melodramatic, and it does indeed have its maudlin moments, I agree, but it has also been accused of being 'racist'. It may be a one sided account of the war and I appreciate it was released during sensitive times shortly after the conflict, but I do not agree. Does a film have to cover every aspect of an event? Does it have to cover every perspective? Of course not. 'The Deer Hunter' reflects one case: one group of men and their exposure to a small group of sadistic belligerents. Some say the depiction of the Vietcong is racist, but to rational, informed people, I think it's clear that film the isn't suggesting that the entire Vietcong was like this. We realise that atrocities similar to those seen in the film are committed by both parties in times of war; to proclaim that the film is trying to tell us otherwise is false and preachy. I concede that the majority of the Vietnamese are, to understate somewhat, portrayed unscrupulously, but the extent of one's criticism should be that the characterisation is flat, certainly not racist. Additionally, there are pedants who moan about how there were no cases of Russian roulette documented over the course of the Vietnam War - it's called artistic licence. If you're so bothered by 'The Deer Hunter', if you yearn for fair portrayal, balance it out by watching Oliver Stone's vitriolic 'Born on the Fourth of July', which is a scathing attack on the United States' behaviour in Vietnam and their military and political ethos. Returning to another popular comment; I do concede its melodrama, especially during a scene where the American National Anthem is sung in unison: far too gushing and 'American'. However, overall, any flaw is completely pushed aside by its ensemble cast, its aural and visual impact and its ability to keep your attention for 180 minutes and leave a lasting impression on you.",The Deer Hunter

If you can't make stuff this simple into a shorter movie, then you have obviously failed miserably. It is artsy and boring so some people of course like it.Sometimes I also enjoy slow and boring stuff, but I find it incredibly hard to care about people celebrating imaginary weddings when I could just go to real weddings instead.

Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, star as the friends keeping up a happy loving family of friends that still hold up friendship even when the bad luck haunts them. Winning best director, Editing, Sound, supporting actor for Walken and Best Picture, the Deer Hunter lives righteous as a classic and portrays a striking reality during the time and wonderful blend of performances.A group of steel worker friends living in Clairton Pennsylvania, (De Niro, Walken, John Savage, and John Cazale) share fun loving banter together as they prepare for one of theirs weddings, go hunting, and as they go across the world to serve their country. When three of the good chumps eventually make it to the Vietnam war, they enter a world that they may not all return from and try to find themselves again back home.All cast displaying awe inspiring characters, De Niro doing what he does best, Meryl Streep also portraying a very lovely performance. But as the Academy did rightly justice to Christopher Walken's outstanding performance gives the film the heart that is at its focus, especially delivering the real pounding emotion in the third act of the film.Set during one of the most important times in world history, the Dear Hunter truly express's impact that tormented America and it's people at the time. A very solid piece of perfect story telling and directing creating magnificence in heart-breaking traumatising format.The Deer Hunter is a very powerful piece of cinema and propaganda even, discovering more about impact of the Vietnam war, and very correct win of Best Picture at the Oscars.

195,TheNabOwnzz,Heartbreaking story about the personal consequences the Vietnam war has on a group of friends,8,1 May 2018,"The Deer Hunter is not the typical moral confliction of soldiers in war kind of motion picture but one that instead focuses on the consequences the war has for people that have participated in it, and for the people related to them.It is a character picture, focusing on its vast group of characters as its main focus. We get to know all of the main characters ( and the three of them that leave for Vietnam ) in a lengthy opening hour of the movie so we can relate to them better when the scenes in Vietnam do occur. It is a movie divided into three parts: The pre-Vietnam phase in which one of the three protagonists leaving for Vietnam gets married, which also features a very large wedding scene. The scenes in Vietnam themselves & the post-Vietnam phase. Obviously the whole point of this film is the last hour of the movie, but this would not be as powerful or emotionally rich without the first two parts in which we see what the characters are like and ( by the time they reach Vietnam ) can relate to them and root for them to escape with their lives. The acting for all of the main characters is absolute world class, with Cristopher Walken seemingly the greatest of them all. While the characters might not always seem likeable, they are portrayed realistically and their friendship feels genuine due to this.The musical score by Stanley Myers captures the emotional intensity of the movie perfectly due to its peaceful bittersweet kind of sound which fits just right into the theme of the movie about friends trying to reconnect with eachother after a series of brutal events.The cinematography is beautiful, especially the scenes with Michael ( Robert de Niro ) deer hunting in the mountains are just visually incredible due to their gorgeous backdrop mountain shots. Tension is only something that is build up for the Vietnam scenes, but this is done beautifully in the form of Russian roulette games that feature exceptional acting by de Niro whose electrifying presence further heightens the tension.The final part of the movie where one of the protagonists tries to reconnect with his former life and friends is ofcourse where it really shines. It accurately shows the consequences of the dehumanizating nature of war and how the lives of the participants and their relatives are affected by it, often resulting in heartbreaking scenes.Unfortunately there does seem to be an abundance of constant background sounds or indistinguishable dialogue that makes it quite hard to follow what is going on, and that the scenes seem to jump a bit too quickly from one place to another ( probably due to its already long running time, but still ). Yet these things are not so noticeable that they significantly lessen the cinematic experience.It is an emotionally rich statement about how war affects us all in a negative way, and by showing us the first hour of pre-war character development, Michael Cimino allows us to see the changes this causes to ( especially ) our three protagonists who have left for Vietnam.",The Deer Hunter

197,Det_McNulty,The Definitive Anti-War Statement Told Through Life-Affirming Drama; Showing How War Is A Cruel and Deceiving World Covered Up By Medals and Media Glamorisation,7,19 December 2006,"War has always been a touchy subject in cinema and one that has been show through different parallels throughout the history of film. Some films have glamorised or justified it, some have been an exercise in propaganda, others have been strong anti-war statements and some have just told a story with all the facts. As a genre the same tales have been told over and over, yet what has made seeing the same story different is the fact that you're usually seeing the film through a perspective of the events.The story of The Deer Hunter is a straightforward one that revolves around a group of close-knitted friends living together in an industrial town. You'll be revealed people's love, secrets, desires and frustrations with life, all this helps to characterise the film. The story shows the life cycle of the years before and after Vietnam, ultimately showing the psychological affects of the war through cold drama.The Deer Hunter is a film that for the first seventy-five minutes builds up the dramatic experience, it's a cinematic device used to help you understand the characters and their lives. In some way it's a trick because it makes you like (and for some dislike) the characters before they're plunged into the living hell of Vietnam causing extreme devastation to their lives forever. Even though the first part of the film has been deceived as ""slow"" or ""laborious"", I consider it a highly important aspect of the film as it helps us understand the natural reality of the character's lives before they're plunged into the war-zone. At closer look you'll notice that during this first half of the film there is a somewhat premonition of the future events that will unfold. This is all shown through a series of metaphors, scattered cunningly throughout the first half's series of events.Because the film's characters are ones who make their living through backbreaking industrialist work they consider the opportunity of war a new hope for them. This is showing how the US government prayed on people who were grief-stricken and usually not very well off to join the army. For a film that caused questionable controversy on release from war veterans and the Vietnamese. It managed to still defy audiences with the legitimate outcry of America's isolation after Vietnam and then took away 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. There has always been the added controversy about the film's supposed ""gay undertones"" which are slyly hinted and yet not proved with any justifiable evidence.The film uses very interesting techniques to help us understand the characters; they're generally people we can all relate to. All the flaws in human characteristics are there because we all have our problems and characters such as Stanley (wonderfully performed by John Cazale) help us realise that we can all be overwhelmed by arrogance at times. By the end of the film you'll understand that the power of true friendship is the basis of human nature, it sums up how people can stick together in even the darkest moments of existence. It's a ""dog-eat-dog"" world and that life is not always beautiful. The crisis of vulnerability gained during war can be alleged only by the men who survive it and when you faced with a genuine life-and-death situation only then do you really understand life. These are just some of the many examples that are detailed through The Deer Hunter.The film's cinematography captures the spirit of natural beauty, the dirty industrial suburban town and the repulsion of the war-zone. These are all places that were nature, but were destroyed through industrialisation and the violence from war. The only place that remains the dreamlike getaway for the film's characters are the North American mountains and the glorious amount of nature and wildlife surrounding the area. The stunning glimpses of the gloomy weather clouding over America's mountains and the shots of the rivers glimmering underneath, these are shots to adore showing the joy of the photographic eye. The film rarely moves away from its foggy and overcast weather helping to set the ""polluted"" mood the film embraces. The clean-cut editing is very smooth and polished to the finest grain. The score is musical perfection and that recognised and hauntingly striking guitar work is admirable.The acting is magnificent and you'll surely notice performances develop. Character's emotions and features become beautifully apparent as the film gradually moves along. Robert De Niro gives a career defining performance that has been unmatched in the emotional power and the philosophical subtext his character claims. John Savage gives a shy and overpowering performance bursting with intensity and with heart-wrenching accuracy of a human reaction. Christopher Walken gives the film's defining performance and the greatest touch, he's a character you will be instantly be fond of for his great sense of human and likable personality. And finally you have that riveting and disheartening performance from Meryl Streep.Michael Cimino, famous for being a one-hit-wonder of cinema never managed to regain the level of exquisite direction The Deer Hunter holds and after all the critical acclaim The Deer Hunter has been given over the years he never managed to live up to hype that was expected after the film. Thankfully Michael Cimino managed to create one of the most important samples of American cinema that deserves all recognition and the must-see acclaim it has gathered.To truly appreciate a film like The Deer Hunter it needs repeat viewings as you'll find new messages, meaning, morals and observations. Without a doubt a life-affirming piece of cinema that captures the singular beauty of the innocence in the average man and how it can be taken away through the atrocities of what adds up to ""meaningless violence"". Cinema is rarely this flawless in capturing the essence of life with such remorse beauty. It's tragedy through brilliance.",The Deer Hunter
198,mcsheehey,A Potent Anti-War Film,10,16 June 2007,"With the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Hollywood began bursting with a new crop of war films. These films weren't about American honor and the land of the free. Instead, they were about the tragedy of war and its negative effect on people. Some of these films were met with critical contempt and disgust, while others were met with near-universal praise and love. ""The Deer Hunter"" fits into the category of the latter.The acting in ""The Deer Hunter"" is its greatest element. Robert DeNiro is pitch-perfect as usual in a great performance as an intelligent man who finds that his life is spinning and changing rapidly as he goes to war in Vietnam. Meryl Streep is fantastic as well in her star-making performance as a struggling woman who finds herself losing her lover(s) to the terrible war. John Cazale is also very good as one of the more under-the-radar characters. Still, the gold medal for this film belongs to Christopher Walken, who rightfully won the Oscar for his performance as a troubled soldier who handles his losses in the worst ways possible. I won't give anything away, but in the final moments of the film between Walken and DeNiro, more emotions erupt and sadness ensues than in any other war film in history. In fact, I feel almost stupid to call it a war film. It's not really. though some of the sequences in the film are set in Vietnam and involve fighting, this film is not about the fighting and the battles. It rises above films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" because it's not about the battles themselves, but the people who fight them. It's a tale of love, friendship, loss, life, and death. This is a cinematic masterpiece in which characters are presented realistically and action realistic ways. It's sad but intensely accurate: one of the great films of the ages.",The Deer Hunter
199,chas437,A Vastly Overrated Film That Has Aged Badly,1,13 January 2018,"I saw this film in college in the early-80s. At the time, there was so much hype around 'The Deer Hunter"", I felt I almost had to love it. I was greatly disappointed and never gave it a second thought. A film group I'm in viewed this recently, and WOW, it hit me, this isn't just a bad film, its aged horribly. Nonetheless, my contemporizes continue to heap praise on the film.Lets be clear, the film is way too long, tedious and unrealistic. The wedding reception goes on forever, and for no apparent reason. The director was obviously going for some sort of effect here, but he failed, and today's audiences would simply walkout on this.The hunting scenes are farcical. Last time I checked, the Canadian Rockies aren't in Pennsylvania.The war scenes are offensively bad.So, how did this film come to be so highly regarded when, in fact, its a terrible film? I believe its an exercise in mass delusion. So, this was the first big Vietnam War film to hit American theaters in 1978, AND it was meant to show the war in a very negative light. Well, that's all film critics and movie ""aficionados"" needed.",The Deer Hunter
200,Chuck-149,"The one movie with ""The godfather"" to which I would give an eleven out of ten.",10,1 June 1999,"This movie is the best movie with ""Platoon"" to show the horror and stupidity of the Vietnam war. Beginning with Nick questioning Michael about if they'll come back home after the war, the movie just keeps getting better and better.The whole Russian roulette scene in the Vietnamese prison camp is purely genius.  Ad to that, the relationship between the men is at no time forgotten during the movie and the scene where Nick kills himself playing Russian roulette is probably the hardest psychological scene I've ever seen in a movie. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep lead a terrific movie supported by an excellent screenplay.  This is the kind of movie that you want to see a 100 times no matter how hard psychologically it may be. I've seen three times and won't stop seeing it until I die.",The Deer Hunter
201,CinefanR,Very impressive,10,11 May 2012,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a gut-wrenching story about friendship and war. I caught it accidentally one night on TV, it was late and I didn't even know what movie I was watching. It left me speechless. Only a few actors could match the emotionally devastating performance of Christopher Walken and John Savage in ""The Deer Hunter"".I hope the ending is an ironic commentary meant to suggest that even after all this tragedy, these characters still fail to understand that patriotism is just a notion that governments use in order to manipulate masses. To politicians, soldiers will always be nothing more than statistics and a good topic for a speech. The absurdity of war and its inherence couldn't have been better suggested.",The Deer Hunter
202,Ralpho,Overrated,5,10 March 2002,"I bought this movie on DVD because it's a classic and because the DVD has closed captions, whereas the videotape in my local rental store lacks captions.I watched the movie in March 2002 for the first time ever and was disappointed.It's full of contradictions and improbabilities, and the director doesn't seem to care if the viewer can follow the story or not.For example, the information on the back of the DVD case and in the special features write-up indicates that the events of the film take place over a 20-year period. Yet it obviously begins in 1968 and ends in 1973. Secondly, if Nick goes AWOL in 1969 to play Russian roulette for money, it is highly improbable (maybe impossible) for him to still be alive in 1973 when Mike returns to find him. Regarding Mike's return: How is it that the Army lets a mere sergeant return to Saigon to run a freelance rescue mission for a soldier who has been AWOL for four years?Lastly, director Michael Cimino makes it impossible to follow the story without guessing at several points, particularly when our heroes are in Vietnam. It's left unclear as to how Mike winds up the sole survivor of his unit, and it strains credibility that he should wind up a prisoner AFTER being rescued by Nick and some other soldiers aboard two or three Hueys.
I can go on... Why didn't the helicopter return for Mike and Steve after they fell into the river? Isn't it convenient that Mike carries Steve out of the river and two minutes later finds a South Vietnamese jeep to lay him down on? I suspect this movie benefited from the widespread notion among Hollywood types that it was an ""important film"" about the affect the Vietnam war had on people. And so everyone overlooked the flaws. I doubt if it would win any awards if it were released today instead of in 1978.",The Deer Hunter
203,vovazhd,Beautiful production about the importance of home and friendship,9,9 January 2008,"The Deer Hunter is about a band of close friends that is broken apart after three of them decide to serve the country in Vietnam. It begins with many celebrations; a wedding, a deer hunting excursion, and a night at the bar. The gang drinks heavily and does many foolish things (such as swerving in front of a semi with their car), but are tied together by friendship and have genuine care for each other. When Mike, Steven, and Nick leave for Vietnam, the whole group is forever changed.Robert De Niro does an impressive portrayal of Mike, the one who has the most success in Vietnam. The majority of the film is witnessed from his perspective, which makes sense since he retains his mentality the best. Christopher Walken also does a notable performance as the disturbed Nick, who is dragged into betting with his life via Russian Roulette. There two characters are the main focus of the plot; Mike witnesses Nick's gradual decline and attempts to save him.Russian Roulette is an interesting way to illustrate the impact of Vietnam on soldiers. This is probably the thing that most separates it from the other Vietnam movies around. The Russian Roulette scenes are disturbingly tense, despite the fact that they are quite predictable. The other Vietnam scenes are beautiful and realistic. It is overflowed with detail that makes the whole thing believable. You don't just watch the transformation happen; you feel it.The non-Vietnam segments are interesting and important, but I would say they are a bit overlong. The wedding part was especially long; I got the point after the first ten minutes of it. The deer hunting segments make up for it. The mountain scenery is simply magnificent (to the point that I swear that I could feel the mist). I suppose the advantage of spending extra time on the homeland scenes is that it makes you grow attached to it. The whole town (primarily the bar and Mike's house) feel reassuringly familiar, especially in contrast to the chaotic maze of Vietnam. This is a great contrast that is important for when Mike returns from Vietnam to revisit home.The Deer Hunter is among the best Vietnam films around. Currently, it rivals Apocalypse Now for my personal favorite Vietnam film. The thing that makes it so powerful is that it compares Vietnam chaos with benevolent life at home.",The Deer Hunter
204,tjsdshpnd,Average Movie,6,10 January 2010,"There are a lot of Hollywood movies created taking the Vietnam war as a backdrop. The Deer Hunter is one such movie but is different in the sense that it focuses more on character development than the actual war scenario. Based on a small town in America, the movie starts with the introduction of a group of town dwellers who are hard-working as well as hard-partying and whose favorite pass-time is hunting deer. Three people of the group are enlisted in the army and are bound to go to Vietnam. The war, their capture, the game of life - Russian Roulette, their escape, the consequences and the changes in their mentality and life as a whole is the movie. Each of the three men loose something valuable in the war and their happy -go-lucky attitude changes drastically into something which changes their way of life. The story is good and the acting exceptional. But it did not appeal to me as a movie. The movie is very long in my opinion (3 hours). I do not have problem with long movies. But aimless long movies are the ones which I hate. The screen time is increased in the name of character development which was unnecessary IMO. (And the movie has got an Oscar for best editing.). This is not the only problem I have with the movie. It's treatment of the Vietnam war is completely one-sided, tilted towards America. I have a keen interest in history and I felt there was injustice against the Vietnamese. The acting in the movie perhaps is the thing that makes 3 hours endurable. DeNiro and Walken are the stand-out performers. Walken is a very under-rated actor IMO and this is perhaps his best acting stint. He overshadows Deniro in some scenes. Meryl Streep has done a fine job. John Savage is also noteworthy . This movie is rated very highly by movie lovers and I may hurt their sentiments by this review. But this is my honest opinion after one viewing and it may not change ever (Because I cannot give 3 hours of my life again for this movie)Rating : 6/10",The Deer Hunter
205,Deckard-16,An almost too-powerful and wrenching drama.,10,2 August 1999,"There are a handful of truly excellent movies that I only want to experience once and this is one of them. Michael Cimino's sweeping portrait of men drafted into war to commit atrocities against other men is harrowing. The survivors suffer more than the dead. I know a lot of knee-jerk liberals read a lot of jingoistic patriotism into Cimino's script especially when the movie ended with singing of the Star Spangled Banner (or another ""patriotic"" song), but I saw it as a ironic, if not sardonic, touch. This film could have been set in any war. I didn't see it as being specifically about Vietnam and thus the hotly debated use of Russian Roulette throughout the movie was an extremely effective metaphor rather than an historical fact or fiction. (I could care less whether it actually was used as a torture technique or not --all I know is that is moved me to the depths of my soul.)I was moved to tears by it. And of course the acting was brilliant. DeNiro gives one of best performances ever (and that is saying a lot) and he is matched by an excellent supporting cast. But as powerful as DeNiro is who can ever forget Christopher Walken's shattering performance in his Oscar winning role? The effect that Man's capacity for inhumanity had on him and everybody else was as tough to to watch as anything in movie history. His death was real shocker (in a very bad sense) and I don't even like remembering it as I write this. The Deerhunter is easily one of the top 20 films I've ever seen and is probably a top 10 pick. Its Oscars were richly deserved.",The Deer Hunter
206,flimbuff,THE DIRECTOR MISSED HIS OWN POINT,5,29 July 2001,"This movie became popular and vastly overrated because most viewers thought it was the first time that Vietnam had been put in the perspective of actual American soldiers and not politicians.Well it tries but then loses itself because of unrealism and I'm not talking about the combat scenes.The idea of showing an American deer hunter transposed into an entirely foreign land faced with ""trip mines"", ""boobytraps"" and a totally unknown enemy is what this started to be. But we have Robert DeNiro with his full beard parading around as some kind of typical American when no draftee was allowed facial hair unless he had a skin desease. That sort of takes some of the realism out of it from the 'get-go'. Then we have the 'russian roulette' game that was only rumored about at the time and just adds a nauseating aspect to the film.The acting is fine and the helicopter scenes amidst the elephant grass are realistic but the director lost touch with the theme.We were not the evil large civilized force picking on the poor ragged asian minorities. We were ill-trained foreigners invading a foreign country, ill equipped and not trained to fight foreign soldiers on their own turf, who would have slaughtered us without the benefit of our air support.This film was nothing more than a try to show that American soldiers were not just ""baby killers' as so many of the anti-war protesters of the time claimed. We were people too but the movie misses badly.This does not even resemble the magnificent film ""Platoon"" or even come close to the vastly underrated ""Go Tell the Spartans"" with Burt Lancaster.Over publicized garbage akin to the ""The Green Berets"" only with better acting.** Stars out of 6, because of the acting and cinematography.",The Deer Hunter
207,Streetwolf,Was not what I expected.,2,9 November 2002,"I can't believe I got this movie. After the first 10 minutes, the boredom of the plot kicked in plus the never-ending wedding!Summary: The story revolves around 3 friends, Mike, Nick and Steven, who have enlisted themselves and are on their way to Vietnam to fight the war. With only the weekend they have left as free men, Steven (John Savage) is set to get married. The wedding, which doesn't seem to end lasted well over an hour of the movie, then skips over to Nick and Mike, who decide to go with some friends and kill a few deer before they get sent away. Then the gigantic leap, the 3 guys are in Vietnam and are held prisoners by the Vietcong and there they learn to play the game of Russian Roulette...guys taking chances to see how long it takes them to empty the gun before the single bullet left in there blows ones head off for no reason...must be a guy thing. Then they escape and Steven ends up losing his legs and his arm and can't stand to go home so he stays at the Veteran hospital. Nick vanishes into the crowd of Saigon  trying to find more action with Russian Roulette and Mike heads on home and shacks up with Nick's girlfriend. 3 hours of complete torture, I found it amusing to see Robert De Niro (Mike) running naked in the middle of the night on the wet streets of Pennsylvania. I wonder if it was really him because that took guts although I really didn't understand why he felt the need to do so, okay I understand De Niro probably got paid enough to do that, but still, it was a shock! Nick, played by Christopher Walken was good, his attitude as the cold as ice guy, who stopped caring about his life and wanted to see how long it took for him to die was well thought out. It suited him. John Savage is a wonderful actor but he gets the worst roles I've seen to date. I must admit his only performance that I've really enjoyed is in the T.V series Dark Angel (Now canceled). He still brings out the best in the dead characters he plays.I rate this movie a 2/10 ok that's too low, let's say 3/10.
Thank god I somewhat missed the 70's.",The Deer Hunter
208,ragpap93,Sorry but the movie was too long,5,3 August 2015,I don't know about everybody else but to me the movie was too long. The first hour was slow but it was pointed out by others that this was intentional so as to show a sudden contrast to the intense war scene. The war scene was the best part of the movie and probably even ahead of its time but then we come back to after the war and it was slow once again. Also this time it was gloomy compared to how cheerful it was before the war. I do appreciate the comparison and it was almost poetic like a play but this was not what I was looking for in this movie. However even if this was what I was looking for it would still be too long. Red stain on the wedding dress and maybe the folks were very cheerful before the war sets the tone for what was about to come. On an entirely unrelated note the main character hunts deer for sport hence the deer hunter. In my opinion not worthy of being in the top 250 at least not anymore as there are lots of well deserved movies waiting to take its place.,The Deer Hunter
209,arturmachado-29588,The futility of war,6,9 August 2017,"Drama/war movie about three friends that have enlisted in the army and go to fight in the Vietnam war.With a running time of 3 hours, the first one is filled with scenes from a marriage that serves to introduce the characters, but it becomes extremely tedious due to its duration - it should have been shortened quite a bit! After that we have a brief deer hunt in the mountains and then it cuts abruptly to the action in Vietnam. Some of those scenes are ones of the most memorable in war movies, but it does not serve to save the film that although it has great names in the cast (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryl Streep) with excellent performances, is too long and with notable American patriotic denotation and western stereotypes. It would be assumed that these soldiers' experiences in the futility of war would lead them to have an anti-war attitude, yet we are presented with an end where they are all around a table in mourning but singing a hymn to the American motherland, as if extolling the future dead of the coming wars and the horrors associated with it. On a positive note it is a tribute to the long-standing friendship and fraternal bonds that are created by living together in community.Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture and 4 other nominations. A film above average, but nothing highly recommendable to the casual moviegoer, at least on my part; but for lovers of war movies or true cinema enthusiasts it might well be worth it.",The Deer Hunter

The vietnam scenes are gripping enough and truly horrific images of war appear on screens and the secoind half of the film is better than the first.Cimmino was lucky with this film he is not a good director,this film is a good hour too long,I guess this film is more popular in the USA than the UK.

212,richkiel,What was it all for?,1,21 August 2021,"It's an ok script, but ultimately it leaves you feeling empty. When it was over, I couldn't help but wonder what the point of it all was. Several scenes from this film have become iconic, and there is a lot in the film that is truly memorable. But In the end, I didn't really care about any of these protagonists, and their destinies meant little to me. The tragic ending is very suspenseful, but beyond the suspense there is virtually nothing. A film is ultimately an emotional experience, and it has to move your emotions in ways that are satisfying. A tragic ending can be satisfying, provided we care for the protagonist. But I didn't care for any of these characters. They are all dull and pretty bland. I just don't care.",The Deer Hunter
213,Manthorpe,Life and War.,10,30 January 2004,"Possibly my favorite war film, The Deer Hunter is also a movie about life in general, real life. It's not just a war movie and it's not just a film about simple life. It's a balanced story made to compare and contrast the people's lives surrounding the Vietnam War and the consequences of war itself in the eyes and emotions of the people involved. I simply love De Niro in this film. He displays a range of emotion that his characters usually don't allow for him to portray...yet he remains the tough guy. Any De Niro fan owes it to themselves to watch this heart-wrenching epic. One of my favorite De Niro performances. Christopher Walken and Merryl Streep also create some remarkable performances in their own right.Some will think this film is slow or is too long. Kill yourself now as you entirely missed the point of this work of art and are of no importance to society. You have no attention span worthy of forming any relevant opinion and all reviews given by you shall be deemed as wasted server space. With that out of the way, I will admit that this movie is long but I feel that it works for the movie and not against it. It's meant to establish the characters and their relations to each other in the beginning and to set up that bond between the main characters before they're off to war, which is complimented in the post-war scenes. To get the true effect of contrast to work properly, you must be able to get used to and care for the characters and their environment before throwing them into battle. I will even go as far to say that I thought the beginning was dragging myself, but then completely reversed that opinion once the post-war scenes came along. It's necessary, and is one of the reasons I like this film so much.The simple realistic ways that people interact together in the film makes it very believable...it is very much how life would be if these characters existed and were in such a situation. The acting performances are definitely enhanced by the wonderfully written script and dialog. They're all completely realistic and believable as they should be.For war film buffs, there is a scene in this movie that will blow you away, literally. The whole Vietnam part of the film is completely brutal and harsh, even compared to most war epics. Some of the images are quite disturbing, but it's war, that's life. One scene in particular when they're in Vietnam will stay with me forever as one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen depicted on screen. Watch it and you will know exactly what I'm talking about. Great stuff.The ending is tragic and sad, but completely suiting to the rest of the film. One of the easiest movies I've ever scored.10/10",The Deer Hunter
214,eschetic,Brilliant cast and director; overpraised twisted propaganda,4,27 June 2007,"Coming soon after the United States had suffered a humiliating defeat trying to prop up a corrupt minority government in Vietnam and the unemployment rate in the ""rust belt"" was making national news, rising but fiscally uncontrolled director Michael Cimino assembled some of the greatest of the new generation of university trained actors for what amounts to a phony artistic commercial pandering to the great middle American ""silent majority"" who didn't know (and didn't care) how the world could have turned against them.Because the story seemed ""edgy"" with extreme, seemingly unmotivated violence (the Vietnam torture and ""Russian Roulette"" scenes are all many of its fans remember from the film) and justly flaunted the layered performances which Cimino drew from his superb cast and cinematographer, many if not most critics (and the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences) hailed it as a major work of art. It holds its reputation today because the world (for many of the same reasons - not to mention the self centered world view of a couple ""cowboy"" presidents) has remained a violent place and frequently unfriendly to well meaning Americans. What THE DEER HUNTER actually is is a piece of S&M pornography stroking ""Middle America"" with the illusion that nothing is their fault and the rest of the world is even more mindlessly violent than the unemployed steelworker who defines his existence by how freely he can kill animals with his (unregulated) gun. That they can identify with; it takes no deep thought or understanding.The tragedy (and irony) in the over-praise heaped on the excessively unpleasant (but well made) DEER HUNTER is that some years later, when Cimino directed an actual masterpiece tying together the mythology and history of the American East and West - with an only slightly less accomplished cast - HEAVEN'S GATE was eviscerated for all the same excesses the director produced to far less effect in THE DEER HUNTER, the film proved a financial disaster and destroyed the producing studio.While the later film was epic in proportion and had sex and violence aplenty, IT lacked the S&M, torture and kinky sexual overtones - and sadly, the audience that flocked to THE DEER HUNTER. One must suspect the two were not unrelated, and THAT'S a real shame.",The Deer Hunter
215,Daniel Karlsson,Almost...,7,7 September 2003,"Possible spoiler.This movie has all the ingredients to become a masterpiece yet it somewhat fails. De Niro is my favorite actor and I have seen him in many pictures, but in this film he is not close to his best performances; still ok but nothing special. Meryl Streep impresses me the more. Overall the acting is pretty good.I have seen more beautiful films but there are some really spectacular scenes in the mountains. The movie benefits strongly of Myers' beautiful Cavatina score. Like I said in the beginning, this could have been a really masterpiece of a movie. De Niro comes back from Vietnam, remembers the past, sees the woman he loves, he has changed, the music plays...etc. The most disturbing thing I think that spoils this is the Russian-roulette gambling scenes. I liked the part in the Vietnamese prison, that was exciting. But again, and again, and the absolute worst is when De Niro goes back to Vietnam once again...there we have the roulette again. The whole movie gets more centered around the roulette than the deer hunting. I would have preferred an ending half an hour earlier; before De Niro goes back for Nick. But obviously Cimino really really wanted to show the audience what happened to Nick, or he was obsessed with the roulette game himself. Not much happens between Niro and Streep in the end either...On the whole I liked the movie, a lot due to the score and the story, but I am also very disappointed; it could have been so much better.7.5",The Deer Hunter

Really? A year or more over there and you don't recognize that? Millions of Americans go to Thailand or Vietnam as tourists, and none of them noticed either?I bring this up because any drama in those war scenes was ruined. It'd be like watching a WWII film where the Nazis spoke French. You just couldn't take the film seriously.Not just that, but all the other war scenes were equally ridiculous. Hand held flame throwers? Nope, they were just used by armored vehicles. Hand held ones blow up easily.A rat cage in the middle of the river? Nope. US infantry as POWs? Unusual. Most were pilots shot down and held in the north.Going straight from the US into combat? Have they never heard of basic training? And friends are not going to be put into the same unit, not unless you have powerful friends to pull strings.Unlike many of the other poor reviews, I don't think the scenes at home were badly done. It shows the closeness of those friends, and how ""ethnic"" whites and working class whites were the only whites that were drafted. Even the long wedding scene I think worked very well.I think most of the higher ratings are looking at this through their personal experience at the time. No one else had yet made a major Vietnam War film and Cimino deserved credit for that.But it's really obvious he needed to talk to vets not to make all these ridiculous mistakes.",The Deer Hunter
218,Mobithailand,The Deer Hunter has stood the test of time and I am sure it will still be eminently watchable in another 30 years.,10,6 May 2016,"The other day I dipped into the past and had a second viewing of Michael Cimino's Deer Hunter. It is a 3-hour epic about three blue- collar Pennsylvania workers who enlist to fight in Vietnam and about their friends, wives, and lovers that they leave back home. The film, which was made in 1979, was the only really successful movie in Cimino's brief directorial career and some maintain that the sheer effort of getting this masterpiece to the screen was so draining on his creative juices that he was subsequently washed out as a director for ever more.I have no idea if there is any substance to this, but, watching this film, after a break of some 30 odd years, I still find it an extraordinary piece of filmmaking, and it must surely be in anyone's top ten of all-time greatest movies. Apart from arguably, the overlong wedding scene, (about 51 minutes!), the film just flies by. The film is not really about the Vietnam War. It is about a group of men whose lives are changed forever by the horrors of war – it could have been any war – and more of the action actually takes place in America than in the 'war zones'.As with any great movie, the cast is superb, without a single weak link. Leading the pack are Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and John Savage – a virtual who's who of Hollywood's greatest and they certainly pulled out all the stops here. Deer Hunter is a very moving, very scary, electrifying, extremely thought-provoking film. It explores the conflicting reactions of regular, working-class Americans, when they are transplanted into a totally alien, hostile, tropical climate - to a country where life means nothing and where the American psyche suffered a bloody nose. The Vietnam sequences were actually shot in Thailand and I happened to have been there at the time and knew many locals who were involved in the production. I also recognised many of the 'bit-players' and the nightclub sequences that were shot in the Patpong red-light district of Bangkok.So it was really turning back of the clock when I watched this movie the other day. On the first occasion, I watched it in a cinema in Bangkok, which was packed to overflowing due to the publicity it had received as it was partly shot in Thailand. The film actually flopped at the box office in Thailand as the Thais just didn't get it and I am sure many walked out before the conclusion of the notorious 51-minute wedding scene.But there is no doubt in this reviewer's mind that The Deer Hunter has stood the test of time and I am sure it will still be eminently watchable in another 30 years. Movie lovers out there who have not seen The Deer Hunter would do well to seek it out and see how an old-fashioned piece of American filmmaking can still move you and inspire you.Happy movie watching, folks",The Deer Hunter

Sudden switching of events, sudden casualties, unexplicit behaviour and useless behaviour. In my opinion, this was the great movie but the worst to win Oscar, although it was the only choice that year because there were no better films.The movie is certainly watchable but it lacks the real or powerfulness.

Basically, the ethos of a religious, naive small-town in America (who do not, maybe cannot ?) question the American-Vietnam war; after all, the propaganda ""We serve God and our country"" is deeply embedded in this community, who are all affected by the Vietnam war.The acting is good - ensemble work - and the scenes of violence are realistic and disturbing. The film is relevant today - what right has Ammerica to be in Iraq? What support exists for brutalised young men and families that have had to cope with senseless deaths and wide-spread injuries.The deer is a symbol of the effect of war - it cannot be pinned down or shot by the marksman at the end of the movie.

She is now the most nominated actor in history. It was named the 53rd greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI). The film's initial reviews were mostly positive. It was hailed by many critics as the best American epic since The Godfather. The late Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars and called it ""one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made."" This film is an American classic. It is my favorite drama, and perhaps my favorite film of all time. It even holds up nearly 40 years later. My willingness to try older films, any films, was because of this picture. Movies are like these are why film lovers should really give older movies a shot. I suggest the AFI's top 100 films as a starting point. The Deer Hunter is a masterful piece of cinema that explores the human condition in a way few films do today.",The Deer Hunter
222,xmdbx,A Different Type of War Movie,8,3 April 2019,"The Deer Hunter is a different war film than most. There aren't any battles or last stands or any of the typical war games. Instead, it is a look at the people involved and a look into a particular piece of culture associated with the Vietnam War. Clocking in at over 3 hours, this felt like a long movie to me. Parts of it were overlong (like all the pre-deployment stuff, particularly the wedding) and other parts were long enough to get the viewer understand the gravity of the situations that are unfolding on screen. The length of the film worked both for and against it. There is some cheesiness that I didn't enjoy like the random breaks into song, specifically the ""God Bless America"" at the end came off a little too propaganda-ish for me. However, what carries the film is the psychological effects the war has on the characters and how compelling the Russian Roulette scenes are. Both of these are mostly products of the actors. De Niro, Walken and some of the Vietnamese characters are fantastic. The decision to focus on Russian Roulette is also an interesting one because it's one of the only things that can compare to war in terms of limits of the human experience. The stakes are so high already but when it's put on top of war it becomes something else entirely. The climax of the film is one of the darkest that I have seen. There is also something to be said that this film was made not when Vietnam was a memory like most films we know but instead while it was still a relatively fresh scar on the American populace.",The Deer Hunter
223,mrspasm,One For The Fearmongers,10,17 November 2010,"The second World War II was a terrible time for the US. Thankfully this film follows the more enjoyable Viet Kong War, where Robert Mitchum, Christopher Biggins, Fredo, and Diane Keaton find their small town lives disrupted by invading bad guys. They like to spend their weekends hunting harmless animals and drinking Bud but this peace is disturbed when the tables are ironically turned and they become the hunted. They hide in the jungle for a while and meet a young group of teens called the Wolverines who are also hiding out. This young group includes various Shat Pack members- Rob Lowe, Michael J Keaton, Emilio Eckhart, Patrick Swayze, and Baby. The kids have hunting rifles too and decide to wage war on the Vietnamese who have enslaved their village, but they need a distraction. De Matteo, Biggins, and co etc decide to flee and force the bad guys to follow them, giving the Wolfers enough time and freedom to free the city! Unfortunately Robbie, Chrissie, and Fredoie, are captured and pitted off against each other in a terrifying game of life and poker. 2 prisoners are picked at a time and given a deck of cards- each takes a card and whoever has the lower card gets shot with a knife while the bad guys, laugh, bet, and have a generally knee-slapping time. Our heroes have been watching this, understandably horrified, waiting for their turn. Bob De Bobbo and Baggins are pulled out for their turn, but luckily Bob gets his hands on a flame thrower and toasts the bad guys- toasts them good and quips 'You talking to me? Not anymore!' They get back to town to find that the Wolfies have chased the bad guys away and all is well, although there have been casualties- Swayze's mullet got trapped in a harvester he was driving and he was torn into confetti. Usefully though they used this confetti for the celebratory parade so it wasn't for nothing. Just when you think the film is ending though it takes a sinister turn; it turns out that Baggins has become addicted to the deadly card game which he names Park The Fleece, Master Flip, and has been running underground tournaments. When someone challenges him to a game (he has only been watching before this) he gladly accepts to prove he ain't chicken. Frodo and Nero hear about this and race to the rescue but only make it in time to see the knife penetrate their friend's brain, and watch him fall to the floor, deading. It seems the Deer have claimed their final victim.Best Scene: When the friends are being airlifted out of the forest by Mountain Rescue, De Nee decides to tickle Fredo with a feather and he falls to the ground, losing his legs. De Lite feels guilty about this for the rest of the film, but to rub it in he shags Fredo's wife.",The Deer Hunter
224,mts43,Still one of my All Time Top Ten,10,8 September 2020,"When the audience I was in left the theater at the end of this film, their reaction was just like I remembered when I saw ""Midnight Cowboy"" nine years before -- a ""stunned silence"". Earlier that day I'd gone to see ""Coming Home"", a highly rated film, which I thought was pretty good. But there was no comparison between that film and ""The Deer Hunter"". This was the week following the Academy Awards when ""The Deer Hunter"" won Best Picture and four other Oscars. It's not a ""Vietnam War"" film in the same way ""Platoon"" was, but that is how it is usually remembered by most. By the way, I used to have a friend whose wife was from Mingo Junction, Ohio, where the Bar scenes were filmed. He said the film crew had to ""dirty up"" the place to make it look older and more run down. They also bought the big TV that was in the Bar, then gave it away when filming was complete.",The Deer Hunter

The only scenes that really did anything for the parts in vietnam. At the same time as someone who thinks hunting down animals for sport is disgusting. After watching a bunch of drunk losers kill a beautiful animal like deer for no reason but ""sport"" it was hard for me to feel sympathy for them. The way the filmmakers depicted the people of vietnam was simplistic and offensive. As if they did nothing but russian roulette.

226,qeter,very huge problem with this one,7,31 October 2016,"Seen at the Viennale 2016: The movie was screened in one of the oldest cinemas, the Metro in Vienna. We were lucky to see an old 35 mm copy. It is always interesting to see older movies on the big screen, especially in their original analog way. You can see the history with all the scratches and partly changed colors. At the same time you see paintings of the past. At the beginning we see some sort of steel mill. The colors and shades of the fire - up to today only analog film material can produce such a beautiful image of fire. Look at Meryl Streep in her first scene. All the freshness of her youth is underlined by the painting art of exposed celluloid. What a cast! What a director! And partly, what a script! If I could rate this movie at parts: 10 for the nearly one hour long marriage and wedding party, 10 for the first and the second deer hunting, 10 for all the scenes in the home village, 10 for the scenes between De Niro and Streep, 10 for the playing of Walken, 10 for the final scene, 10 for everything, but not for the pictures of the war. Sadly, the Viet Cong fighters were shown as brutal sadists only. Sadly, the script writers included this unnecessary Russian roulette as key element. Because, this is such an important anti-war movie these mistakes are inexcusable. Too many people get a wrong picture of history due to these unnecessary historical (partly racist) untruths. It is a pity, because otherwise this movie would be one of the few perfect movies in history.",The Deer Hunter
227,kevandeb,Immense poignancy,10,18 January 2006,"I cannot fathom the absolute horror that war brings to a persons life, but never has a film depicted it more harrowing than The Deerhunter. At 182 minutes, it seemed to fly by, leaving me wanting more and wishing this would not end. all facets are explored, all people's emotions are laid bare, not just the combatants. If we obviously did not know better, one would have to say this was a British film, as it has all the best elements that British movie making displays. i can eulogise for hundreds of lines, but this really is the ONLY American movie i can think of (others? apart from taxi driver) that is RAW. A strange word i know but the movie oozes a raw edge to it. Immense performances from all concerned, and if i had to say, i believe i have not seen Christopher Walken in a better role. One of the very few films i deservedly give 10/10. A must for any collection and a stunning example of every aspect of film making coming together, albeit for a sombre depiction of life.",The Deer Hunter
228,severindringel,A film with two very different halves,8,24 August 2021,"Another of those (anti-)war films that you ""must"" have seen. Three aspiring young men who live a happy life of friendship in a working-class town in Pennsylvania volunteer for the Vietnam War. This fundamentally changes their lives from one day to the next and we get emotional insights into the emotional states of the protagonists as they live through a world of extremes.War films are often ensemble pieces that usually have a ""hidden"" main character. In the case of The Deer Hunter, it is Robert de Niro, who here embodies the uncharacteristically subtle role of Michael. Initially driven by a lust for life and slight playboy traits, Michael becomes aware of the seriousness of life in his time as a war soldier in the harshest of ways. The disturbing Russian Roulette scenes he gets into as a prisoner reveal a new, fearless side to the character. It is only in the aftermath that one notices the emotional emptiness Michael carries from his Vietnam experiences. While the actors split screen time in the first two thirds of the film, De Niro clearly takes centre stage by the end. After not having many opportunities to develop beforehand, he goes all out in the role towards the end and gives a heartbreaking performance. Christopher Walken provides this from beginning to end. His character Nick captivates you from second one. At the beginning you are happy for him, enjoy watching him dance and fool around and are also infatuated with his bromance with Michael. From the first Russian Roulette scene, Walken does a 180° turn of emotions and the optimistic sunshine turns into a desperate trainwreck. The kink happens in a devastating hospital scene where Nick bursts into bitter tears after a near-death experience and you realise he's never the same. Despite less focus on his character, Walken manages to usurp the film as a scene-stealer and even outshine De Niro. In their moments together, the very young Meryl Streep as Linda also succeeds. She is deeply sad, naive and torn about which man to love. After disappearing in the middle, Streep goes all out in the last act and equally goes through a rollercoaster ride of emotions that makes her one of the most sympathetic characters in the film.The Deer Hunter is a three-hour drama that, despite its epic running length, doesn't feel like a classic war epic. The film has a big impact and high production value, but is very sedate and quiet in its staging and atmosphere. There is little talking, rather the focus is on conveying the emotions of the traumatised soldiers in every single scene. War action is scarce, so the genre ""war film"" may be overstated. Director Michael Cimino has created a drama that, from the middle onwards, completely disconcerts and touches you. From the change of location from Pennsylvania to Vietnam and back again, The Deer Hunter is a terrific film. However, it takes a good 70 minutes to get to that point, during which pretty much nothing happens. Yes, they're partying exuberantly before the tragedy kicks in and counting down their last hours before enlistment. Due to the slight irrelevance of the first act, the film feels rather indifferent until the middle.",The Deer Hunter
229,bulleetz37235,One Shot... watch it.,10,8 July 2005,"This should be a lot higher up the list. It is definitely for me if no one else, the best war film ever created. It revolves around three steel workers of a sleepy Pennsylvanian town, who after basking in the delights of family and friends, and taking the time to go deer hunting in which they find happiness and freedom, they come face to face with the horrors of war. The hour long introduction to the three main characters played sublimely by Robert DeNiro (Michael), Christopher Walken (Nick, Who won Best Supporting Actor at the 1978 Oscars, and deservedly so), and John Savage (Stephen) offers a long and beautifully slow view of these people who by the end of the first hour you really feel close to. And then everything takes an abrupt twist. These men are thrown into the Vietnam war, out of the niceness comes the horror, and I think the contrast is amazing. (The long introduction that shows the cosiness and happiness these men once knew shocks you to the core and I think Michael Cimino shows this part off brilliantly. I have heard many say the first part drags on too long, yet I think this adds to the impact when the war is suddenly turned on). They end up in a POW camp being forced to play Russian roulette or else they die. This is probably one of the most graphic parts of the film, and it clearly shows that friendship and unity prevails as they do end up escaping desperately, trying to keep their lives in the place in which to keep it is a very hard thing to do. The war aspect is exceptionally well filmed by Michael Cimino and illustrates the darkness that you would expect from war. You won't find many better pictures of war better than this.As the men separate after escaping, they end up in different places, Nick stays in Vietnam and plunges himself into the dark underworld that breathes beneath the surface of the war, although he pleaded for Michael to make sure he got home during the first part of the film (So clearly the first half of the film lingers on, and you really can feel the heartbreak as they are split up). Michael goes home, and Stephen winds up in a disabled hospital for veterans of the war. As Michael tries to get back to the sleepy attitude of the town he ends up being awash with guilt and returns to Vietnam, on a mission to reunite himself with his friends, and the end scene between him and Nick is heart-wrenching, and one of the best finale's to a film you will ever witness, it is unbeatable. I love it, you will too, it is a long one, over 3 hours long, but the length does not harm the viewing pleasure. It is an epic, watch it please you've only got one shot.",The Deer Hunter
230,markymark70,"Too long, too choppy, not as good as they lead you to believe.....",5,7 April 2009,"The Deer Hunter is one of those revered films out there in critic-land which I have always wanted to see and examine for myself what all the fuss is about. The DVD presentations - Special Edition / Ultimate Edition / Bonus Discs etc. - almost tease you into buying it. Thank God I caught it on TV instead. The winner of the Best Picture Oscar in 1978 is a disappointment to me. I'll try to articulate why: 1. The actors - this is a misnomer - there are no problems here. De Niro is good and Walken too. Both have their own head-jerking, body-twitching thing going on there but they are solid - even if they do look off screen at some non-existent object quite a lot. But I must admit De Niro did start to grate on me as the film wore on - the mono-syllabic grunts, the thousand yards stares all get a little tiresome after 3 hours. But as problems lie - acting was not one of them.2. The story - For me the story of friends joining the army, fighting in Vietnam and then returning to the world broken men - if they return at all - is interesting and the Russian roulette element adds a definite spice. However - the movie is just way too long, too drawn out and too clippy in the scene cuts. There is lots of time invested in the build up of the characters but wasted in my opinion as it never drives on the narrative. The wedding scenes are a prime example - you can fast-forward these wedding scenes completely and not miss a beat of the story. The fact there was a wedding at all serves the purpose - but to show dancing, drinking for over 20 minutes is lazy.3. Pacing - so slow it almost stops. And when we do get to some action - Russian roulette scenes - we simply arrive there out of the blue, do the action and get out as quickly as possible. After spending far too much time with a irrelevant wedding - we jump in and out of the torture scenes with incredible speed.4. Reality. Now I don't know much about war or armies or anything but a few things stand out here. The guys get wasted the night before they fly out to Vietnam? No training? They all end up in the same platoon? With their long hair still intact? De Niro's character in particular seems to be able to do what he wants, when he wants and answers to no-one. He walks around Vietnam alone? Grows a beard in the army? Goes home to the US and then decides to go back to find Nick? How - on Uncle Sam's meal ticket? He arrives in Saigon when every man and his dog are killing each other to get out? He finds Nick in a city of millions without a second thought? He has money to burn - paying 1500 dollars to get into a barn? What? What's going on here? De Niro seems to live in a universe where there are no limitations on travel / money / relationships / pain / injury. Also De Niro was supposed to have humped crippled Stevie through the Jungle to ""civilization"", only to dump him on the hood of a jeep and walk away ? 5. Coincidences - De Niro seems to be a Green Beret - how did this happen? His buddies look like ordinary grunts yet they all joined together. Nick and Steve just happen along De Niro in the Vietnamese jungle when they jump from a chopper? What's the odds on that? 3 bullets in the gun which never goes off when it is pointed at their own heads - but which fires every time it is pointed at a bad guy? Convenient. Too many things to mention here that just happen for the sake of it.6. Editing - even at 3+ hours - the finished product looks chopped to pieces in the editing room. Plus the scene that promotes the name of the film - The Deer Hunter - seems tacked on and looks completely out of place. It is almost as if they didn't know what to call the movie - invented this monicker - and filmed a quick couple of scenes to back it up.I am not sure how this film is in the top 250. Cimino has proved since that he was not up to it as a filmmaker. This is an overlong, slow, muddled movie which does not deserve the glory bestowed upon it.5/10.",The Deer Hunter
231,twhiteson,Indulgent Tripe,4,26 May 2017,"During the midst of the malaise of the late 1970's, Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" inexplicably hit a chord with critics and movie-audiences.The story is about working-class pals from a Pennsylvania mill town who end-up being destroyed physically and/or mentally due to their experiences in the Vietnam War. The characters are Hollywood script-writer stereotypes of blue-collar America: mill employed, cheap beer swilling, and deer hunting macho-men whose misguided patriotism led them to believe that fighting in Vietnam was the right thing to do. These were the dummies who got duped into fighting while all the ""smart"" kids headed for Canada, enlisted in the National Guard/Coast Guard or hid-out on college campuses.""The Deer Hunter"" was one of the first films to actually address the Vietnam War and its alleged effects upon its veterans. Hollywood had for the most part studiously avoided the subject. Yet, three years after the war's ignominious end American film audiences decided that it was time to view the subject. However, why they thought ""The Deer Hunter"" was the proper vehicle to address America's hangover from the Vietnam War is beyond me.This is an overlong, over-indulgent, and incoherent film that says a lot more about its director's ego than the Vietnam War. The Vietnam scenes are beyond silly which consist mostly of our lunch-pail heroes being forced to perform Russian Roulette for the entertainment of their Viet Cong captors. B-grade Hollywood Korean War films about the Commie brainwashing of GI Joe POWs are more realistic and honest. It would take another eight years before Hollywood actually did Vietnam War veterans some justice with Oliver Stone's ""Platoon."" However, until ""Platoon,"" ""The Deer Hunter"" stood as one of ""the"" Vietnam War movies.The late Michael Cimino is now mostly forgotten. However, for a brief moment he was mentioned alongside Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and others as a top director of American cinema. The critical and box-office success of ""The Deer Hunter"" was responsible for that reputation. However, the seeds of Cimino's downfall from the A-list were planted during the making of that film. Cimino's penchant for budgetary excess and exceeding perfectionism were already on display with ""The Deer Hunter"" which saw delays and went seriously over-budget. An example of Cimino's over-excess was his decision that the Allegheny Mountains and Whitetail deer of Pennsylvania were not picturesque enough so he had the entire production moved to Washington so he could film in the Cascade Mountains with imported Asian red deer. ""The Deer Hunter's"" success allowed Cimino to get away with those kind of excesses, but he and United Artists would not be so lucky on his next film- the disastrous box-office bomb ""Heaven's Gate"" which nearly bankrupted UA and practically destroyed Michael Cimino's career and reputation.One last thing is that despite Cimino's reputation as an arch-perfectionist the overall look of ""The Deer Hunter"" is wrong. The bulk of the film is supposed to take place in the mid-to-late 1960's, but everything about it looks like the late 1970's. Yes, actors in the late 70's were loathe to cut their hair because they knew it would make getting other acting jobs more difficult, but still if one is going to make a period piece then at least try. George Lucas got his actors to wear appropriate hairstyles for ""American Graffiti,"" but crazy perfectionist Cimino couldn't get his cast to do likewise?",The Deer Hunter
232,johnmschofield,This film didn't do it for me in the Seventies and thirty years later it still doesn't,5,4 March 2010,"I didn't like this film much when I watched it for the first time and I have to be honest and say that I have watched a few times since and it hasn't improved with age. It is not a bad film but then again it is not a good film either. For me the film is stitched together like a modern day Frankenstein and does not work on any level save one. It works reasonably well as an anti war propaganda creation but then I have seen better. The cast and crew must have been professional enough to work on this job and probably tried their best to produce a really classy film. Unfortunately the end result is not good. On more than one occasion I fell asleep while watching the film and not only during the extended wedding footage. The film just doesn't do it for me and I doubt it ever will. If I was on a podium my message would be that war disrupts everything, is completely and utterly pointless, millions of people die or are maimed for life and then those who are left have to rebuild again and the poor are still poor; the tragic consequences are the poor have probably lost what little they had and the well off survive like they always have throughout history. Whether I am wrong or right doesn't matter but if I was speaking for too long the message loses its power and this film is far too long and self indulgent and by the end I was glad it had finished. I have no doubt that my comments will be waved away as some loony person from across the pond but like I have said before its only my 'two cents' opinion and opinion is all. I would however recommend anyone watch this film just make sure you have legal stimulants available or have someone you know well keep you awake.",The Deer Hunter
233,Dark Eye,Vietnam flick? I don't think so.,9,22 March 2002,"Face it, all movies about the Vietnam war sucks. When will writers realise that the Vietnam war so much more than having psychologically disturbed soldiers sneaking about in a jungle with facial paints? Might as well watch Rambo. Where are the innocent Vietnamese civilians... have we forgotten how much they suffered as well? When Brando muttered ""The horror, the horror"" he must have been talking about the state of Vietnam flicks produced in Hollywood.Contains ending spoiler -So how come The Deer Hunter is still emotionally powerful after all these years? Essentially, this movie is often mistaken as a pure Vietnam war flick, but I found that to be untrue. Emphasis is placed squarely on character development, and here lies the strength of the film; three tragic characters who are forever changed by the war that they were involved in - because the war setting serves as a mere background noise that drives these three close friends to the brink of insanity. At the end of the film, I could only shook my head in pity as the principal characters gathered together around the table, singing the American anthem like a bunch of broken, tattered warriors. War is horrible, but they choose to remain patriotic until the bitter end. The sad irony of life! By doing so, they ask the audience to feel sorry for them as opposed to sentimental sympathy because war is wrong, not just an empty spectacle made for popcorn-munching theatre goers.",The Deer Hunter
234,Sleeper-Cell,"Without purpose, without depth.",1,21 September 2017,"I first saw this film as a kid, one of many films that I saw at a far too young age. I was about 11. I thought it was boring back then. So I decided now as an adult to watch it again to get a better perspective on a film that is often lauded. I don't see the big deal. The film starts off OK, we see a small country community, very working class. People are planning for a wedding, which we also see. We get a bit of an insight into the characters, but not a great deal. Three of the men are going to Vietnam the next day. The next day? They are not serving soldiers. They have not been drafted and even if they were they would still receive training. So the film flashes forward from the wedding where our three heroes try and speak to a Green beret who has walked in and has no time for their nonsense to Vietnam. We get our one and only battle scene, not much to it, helicopters fly over an empty village burns. One of our heroes goes berserk with a very non military looking flame thrower. Have they been there a while, is it the next day? Maybe it's mentioned but I didn't care enough to notice. The battle isn't even over before we flash to the next scene. Our heroes seem to be prisoners now. Very non military looking Vietnamese guard them poorly. They play Russian roulette. Why the guards would bother with this, I don't know. Surely they could just torture the Americans. Our heroes manage to escape and we see what is probably meant as an attack against the war or the American military a helicopter pick them up but not assist 2 of them to actually get on. They fall off the landing gear and into the river. The film is already sloppy at this point but it really starts to fall apart now. The Russian roulette has messed our heroes up and now we flash forward again back to the home town. The DeNiro (Michael) character walks around in his uniform, non regulation beard, promoted too heavily and too many medals and ribbons for one tour of duty. We finish up with Michael returning to Vietnam to bring Nick (Walken) back to the USA. Nick is still playing Russian roulette games for big money in tournaments. A lot of fuss is made over the Russian roulette games but they look comedic. There just isn't any depth to this film. The characters also look too old for Vietnam era soldiers. We don't see any of their war time experiences, it's all Russian roulette. For a film that runs for 3 hours you expect more. Over rated.",The Deer Hunter
235,mpofarrell,The Seeds of Destruction,8,6 April 2003,"For all its faults (and there are many), Michael Cimino's Vietnam war saga THE DEER HUNTER is a movie that leaves a lasting impression. The story of three steel mill workers who leave family and friends to go fight in Vietnam, become embroiled in the horrors of war and return to their Pennsylvania hometown in varying states of mental and physical breakdown seems more powerful now than when it first premiered in 1978. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is its uncanny ability to convey the everyday milieu of fictional Clairton, Pa. ; its depiction of blue collar workers, most of Russian descent who are closely tied to family and cultural tradition, who unswervingly believe in God and Country, may not appeal to the more Liberal audience. Indeed, the movie was castigated by many Vietnam Veterans as a false depiction of the times, a simple minded multimillion dollar action flick that reduced the Vietnam Conflict to a John Wayne -type polemic with nary a peace sign in sight. Director Cimino had always claimed that his film was a story of how war effects the ordinary man ; the fact that it took place in the Vietnam Era was incidental. With unstinting mastery Michael Cimino guides the viewer on a lengthy journey into the heart of darkness that was Vietnam ; how it broke the spirit of its fighting men and the devastating consequences the war had on those men when they returned home. THE DEER HUNTER is not a casebook study. It plays fast and loose with the facts, nowhere more apparent than in the horrific Russian Roulette sequences that dominate the middle and final third of the picture. These scenes , the first of which is set in a prisoner of war camp, are among the most harrowing ever filmed. As a display of action , violence and unbearable tension, it is a stupendous piece of film-making ; it is also cunningly manipulative. For a movie that covers such a large narrative canvas it is remarkable how the pace almost never flags. But THE DEER HUNTER does have an Achilles heel , and it is a serious one. With a screenplay by Derek Washburn and story contributions by Cimino and two other writers, the film is an incoherent mess. Dialogue tends toward the fragmented and clearly thought -out sentences are discarded when the trite and obvious will do. What goes a long way in saving the picture from disaster, in fact miraculously lifts the movie to another realm is the director's astonishing technical mastery. The great tragedy of Michael Cimino's career was that he was never able to speak as eloquently as he was able to visualize. He got away with it in THE DEER HUNTER because his crudely spoken story was enveloped in some of the most most atmospherically drenched, scenically stunning widescreen cinematography ever put on film. From the dark cavernous interior of an enormous Russian Orthodox Church to the outlying depressed steel mill town and the majestic snow covered mountains that surround it; the verdant greens of Vietnam and the blast of orange fire killing everything in its path; and the smoky, hellish interior behind a Saigon storefront, where the stakes are high and a friend's life lies in the balance. Adding immeasurably to the film's power is a superb cast, headed by Robert DeNiro as Michael, whose ""one shot "" code of ethics used in hunting deer becomes a metaphor for the entire movie. Also impressive are John Savage as a boyish bridegroom , John Cazale as a hot-headed drinking buddy and Meryl Streep as the girl who's left behind. But the most unforgettable performance is given by Christopher Walken who plays Nick, Michael's loyal, sensitive friend and hunting partner who becomes lost in the murk and mire of Vietnam. Walken 's portrait of a man scarred by life with eyes that seem half -dead will haunt you. The critical and popular success of THE DEER HUNTER emboldened Cimino to try his hand with an even bigger project for his next movie. But implanted in THE DEER HUNTER were the future seeds of destruction. HEAVEN'S GATE, released in 1980, was Michael Cimino's epic western of Wyoming's infamous Johnson County War. The new film had all the elements that distinguished THE DEER HUNTER : brilliant pictorial composition, stunning locales and riveting action sequences. It also had an unintelligible screenplay, one so inept that no amount of technical resources could hide it. A fine cast was lost in a sea of unfocused characterizations and unclear motivations. The result was an unqualified disaster that brought down a studio (United Artists) and stalled a promising career. Michael Cimino had an unparalleled gift for visual composition equaled perhaps only by David Lean and a few others. HEAVEN'S GATE is worth a look just for that fact alone. Profligate film-making is what got Michael Cimino in the end. But he is without doubt a born film director, and with THE DEER HUNTER he reached boldly, if perhaps imperfectly, for greatness.",The Deer Hunter
236,tom-456,Back when Russian Roulette was Vietnam's national pastime.,2,1 February 2016,"Three white, northeastern factory workers in their thirties and early forties, from a tight group of five buddies, somehow manage to enlist in the army during the Vietnam war. This, even though the U.S. military in that era was made up predominately of draftees in their late teens and very early twenties, and even though a disproportionate number of them were black, because few blacks at the time could manage to get the student deferments that kept most white kids out of the war long enough for it to wind down to the point where they didn't get drafted. They are magically transported to Vietnam. Without engaging the enemy, they are taken prisoner and end up as pawns in a gambling game where prisoners are forced to play Russian Roulette. Even though their captors have several rifles trained on them at close range, a miracle happens, and they somehow escape. While still in Vietnam, one of them learns that this variation on Russian Roulette is the national pastime for the Vietnamese. They become separated while in Vietnam, and two of them return home separately. By the time these two meet up again, it has most likely been at least five years since they joined up, but they are all still the same age, still in their mid-thirties and early forties. And still not one black soul, anywhere to be seen. You would think that no black people fought in the Vietnam war. But one of them got stuck in 'Nam, playing Russian Roulette professionally, and evidently was very skilled at it, since he has been sending piles of cash to the one who came home in a wheelchair. The one that ended up in the Rangers, the Deerhunter, goes back to 'Nam to find the one stuck playing Russian Roulette. The Deerhunter finds his old friend Nick in a hidden away, secret room full of Vietnamese gambling on the Russian Roulette game, apparently the same marathon game that has been being played continuously for a number of years. Even though Nick has had the presence of mind to send money regularly to Steve, when Deerhunter finds Nick, Nick doesn't recognize Deerhunter and seems not to have any idea where he is, but knows that he is a professional Russian Roulette player. Deerhunter buys his way into the game, in order to try and talk Nick out of playing. To show Nick that he still loves him, Deerhunter takes his turn. The hammer falls, and Deerhunter is still lucky. Deerhunter again begs Nick to come home with him, but Nick takes another turn, and that's the end of Nick. Deerhunter escorts Nick's body home, and there is a funeral, not attended by any black people.",The Deer Hunter
237,Nat-21,Emotionally gripping; an oustanding film,10,23 February 1999,"""The Deer Hunter"" ranks among the best films of the 1970s, a long but not overly long saga of three Pennsylvania buddies whose lives are dramatically changed when they go off to fight in Vietnam.As with many viewers, the Russian roulette scenes stand out most in my mind. They are painful to watch, but graphically capture the controlled-but-random nature of war, especially the Vietnam War. Christopher Walken gives a remarkable performance that has seared his character into my memory.A minor point I was pleased with: De Niro's character is treated as a hero when he returns. I was happy to see this reaction, which was more accurate - especially in small-town America - than the Veteran As Baby Killer stereotype found in so many Vietnam War movies.",The Deer Hunter
238,cengelm,Russian Roulette with Predictable Outcome,7,5 September 2001,"The film starts with the often used slice-of-life episode which introduces us to the characters. For my taste this part was about 20 minutes too long. Once arrived in Vietnam we learn how Russian Roulette is played. There wasn't much tension for me, though, because I always knew the outcome. DeNiro must go on with his show so he won't die. He's the usual ultracool guy who doesn't mind about life or death which unfortunately hurts the quality of the film. He travels to Saigon to get Nick out of the hell in the last minute possible. And then again he plays Russian Roulette where either he or Nick will certainly die. Will Nick be able to find his way home alone? Hardly. So it's better when HE dies. The Vietnamese are stereotype bad guys and lack any individuality. Overall I was disappointed after 3 hours. Good cast and technically well made.7 /10.",The Deer Hunter

A lot better I' d say. For example there are so many notes from the Godfather - why would it have to be so? For the recipe of success no doubt. The essential messages of the film are there to be seen of course but they are obscured Mr. Cimino by all that noise. Vietnam scenes are the required noise but the wedding? I don't consider him a master of his means, he just has too many things on his mind and is burnt out eventually. He should watch how the old masters (Henry King) delivered a story even when they had much less to say...",The Deer Hunter
240,josephrygaard,Before Watching: The Deer Hunter (1978),9,6 September 2019,"""The Deer Hunter"" (1978) is a gripping presentation of the impact of war on ordinary people. It is tough, and if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:One of the most important things to know about this movie beforehand is that despite it being a war movie, Deer Hunter isn't really a war movie. It does feature the Vietnam War, but there are no grand skirmishes or heroic sacrifices like other war movies often tend to include. Instead, Deer Hunter treats the Vietnam War as a rough and even life-changing bump in the road for the main characters, who tries to cope with it the best they can. The war comes, and it goes. Most of the movie is made up of before-and-after, so do not expect longer elements of guerilla warfare. Expect instead to see life, as ordinary and mundane as it might be, and the devastating impact of the war on the minds of those who experience it.With that clarification understood and accepted, it is critical to understand that this movie is still violent, disturbing and intense far beyond ordinary movies of today. Thanks to the built-up connection to the characters, the movie makes you sit at the edge of your seat for a good two hours straight. The occasional violence spikes through whatever defense constructed, all the more impactful thanks to its non-glorified yet brutal way. The mood is intense, even afterwards when it shouldn't be. You cling on to small events and minor dialogue like if it's were the very rope of your own life, and when it hits, it hits hard. This movie requires quite a psyche and mental endurance indeed.There are minor things that should be addressed too that can add understanding and caution. Some of the details around the wedding stems from Russian tradition with added wedding rituals and manners. There is frequent profanity throughout the runtime, and one of the male characters is completely nude at a point. The film is also littered with symbolism, which certainly can be more greatly enjoyed at a second viewing for those who can mentally endure it twice.All in all, the Deer Hunter is a hard-hitting, gripping drama that is sure to leave you a bit differently from what you were. Embrace yourself, and allow it to sink it.My personal grade: a shocking 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",The Deer Hunter
241,hbdave_77,A saga of courage & freindship in Vietnam war,8,11 November 2008,"The movie bagged 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture (Michael Cimino), Best Actor (Robert De Niro) & Best Supporting Actor (Christopher Walken) in 1978. Its definitely critically acclaimed, extraordinary, powerful film featuring a group of steelworker friends. The story takes turn towards their deer hunting grounds & gradually to lethal Vietnam War. Well the story turns to different trajectory once they signed for Vietnam War. Its compelling drama of friendship & courage among adversity, difference of personality & a shattering emotional experience. The film has strong casting with De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, & Christopher Walken in memorable roles. The only drawback which I found is its tad 3 hour length & with director's penchant for detail, some time film becomes so slow & boring especially in the first half which is wasted on long wedding ceremony for character development. But the second half is totally absorbing, dark & realistic. Watch out De Niro's mind blowing expressions in the scene on betting gun table where he & Walken were constantly slapped by Vietnamese soldiers or the scene where he ventured 12000 miles away to get Walken & he refused to identify him on gunning table once again. Sure give it one shot.",The Deer Hunter
242,rchrdshelt,"Despite being slightly too long, well worth watching due to some excellent performances and powerful scenes",9,20 September 2006,"Having finally being able to see this film recently, I have to say it did live up to my expectations and is certainly a very good film. Although I don't think its as good as Apocalypse Now or other war films I've seen, it is still an interesting study of the effects of war people.The performances are all great, particularly DeNiro and Walken during the Vietnam scenes where the terrifying and brilliantly filmed Russian Roulette sequence takes place. Although the film is slow moving during the first hour it is never boring and always keeps you interested.An interesting and occasionally harrowing film. 9/10",The Deer Hunter
243,PathetiCinema,"Pretentious, meandering nonsense.",4,26 July 2008,"If any film goes around in an ever decreasing circle, it's this pretentious effort from Cimino. The title is misleading for starters. If I see a movie called The Deer Hunter, I want to see DEERS. Lots of them. Instead we are given pointless scenes of war and weddings that do nothing but get in the way of the deer scenes. The deers in this movie are particularly lovely. Grazing and galloping all over the place. Nasty Robert De Niro nearly kills one but it psychically tells him not too and it's all OK. This film could be better if edited down to just the deer scenes and we can all enjoy it without blood and guts getting in the way of the light and enjoyable stuff.",The Deer Hunter
244,TooShortforThatGesture,"War is hell, but so is watching this movie.",4,15 October 2004,"Wow. What an overrated movie. Alternately dull and incoherent. The pacing (both too slow and too fast, depending on the scene) lends support to the idea that everyone in Hollywood was doing drugs in the 70s. Frequently unbelievable in silly ways. (When the steel workers sit around in the bar and quietly listen to their buddy play the piano? When DeNiro's character manages to get back into Vietnam via a copter ride to US Embassy roof DURING the American evacuation?)The worst part however is watching every cog turn while a group of young method actors, mostly from rather artsy East Coast backgrounds and educations, try like crazy to BE the down-trodden denizens of a Pennsylvania mining town. FEEL the grit. SENSE the hopelessness. TOUCH the importance of faith and loyalty. MAKE YOURSELF ONE with the poverty.Feh!(By the way, I have nothing against artsy East Coast credentials -- I carry them myself -- or method acting per se. I just found them cloyingly obvious in this movie.)Try Platoon or Apocalypse Now instead.",The Deer Hunter
245,SixtusXLIV,"A Dramatic Masterpiece, but is it Cinema?",7,29 August 2011,"I have seen this movie at least 5 times, none in a theatre. Since the movie is mostly dark I decided to see it in BluRay. It is still dark, but a bit more detailed on a BDP-83 and Kuro TV. Cinema is the ""Art of Movement"", ""Theatre is the Art of words"", someone qualified wrote. Masters of Cinema never forgot this. Even Stanley Kubrick in ""Barry Lyndon"" a slow paced film, never forgot that. His scenes are individually kind of slow, but there are so many, your forget it's slow.Michael Cimino is not a Cinema man. He takes 3 hours to tell a story, when at most 2 was enough. I can see that David Lean, a great master, faced an identical problem with ""Doctor Jivago"" a slow-paced novel,like most Russian Romantic and post-Romantic literature. He managed to escape and made a cinematic version. Michael Cimino is slow, his films are boring. What makes this film watchable are just the Great male Actors and Meryl Streep.",The Deer Hunter
246,berberian00-276-69085,Deer Hunter jubilee,10,17 August 2013,"I want to say few words for this movie which is landmark for the end of Vietnam era. I know that it hurts for the American people to recall over and over again for this social experiment, so to call. I am not an American and if it was 40 years ago I would have never had a chance to write this review. As an Easterner we people from the Soviet bloc showed solidarity to the fight of the Vietnamese people and strangely enough I remember that some alimony and other salvation stuff was gathered from the civil population. I also know but can not support it with figures that the Warsaw Pact had sent some military force to Northern Vietnam; so it was not war America vs. Vietnam, but America vs. Vietnam plus Allies. Those are general truths and I am not withholding some state secret.Now let's talk about the movie. If it was only for the death of one of the principal actors in the film (John Cazale), that movie wouldn't have been worthy. Unfortunately, the movie received much spit from its critics and intentionally didn't received its full acclaim as first one shot at the war theater - before ""Apocalypse Now"" and before the Rambo series, etc. Bad luck was also that at Oscar 1979 it had to compete with another equally shattering film (""Midnight Express"" - about life in Turkish prisons) which I think that is no less valuable than the Vietnamese saga, with remarkable supportive role from John Hurt. And also ""Superman"" (1978) was there and how is it possible not to receive a nickel. Thank you!",The Deer Hunter
247,michelleoverton,Classic Movie with the best actors,10,27 December 2020,This is one classic movie. I just love how they followed these guys through their lives and the actors did a great job of making you feel their emotions. War is the worst of our existence which makes it a difficult movie to watch. These men were the best of the best. I've seen it more times than I can even count.,The Deer Hunter
248,batzi8m1,"Not a great Vietnam movie, a great portrait of Americans",8,10 November 1999,"I've seen Deer Hunter twice since I saw it in first run, and I liked it.  It doesn't compare to Apocalypse now, which had a much broader focus, nor to Full Metal Jacket, which was more about individual psychology.  I dismiss Platoon as a standard brand war movie.  Like FMJ, this one has that long opening to contrast normal life for these characters, to what their subsequent experience turned them into.  These are no pacifist whimps.  No, they like shooting and killing for sport.  But after their experiences one comes home to be a peaceful thoughtful husband while the other stays behind as a suicidal junkie with a death wish who plays russian roulette for money. Why?  How do they resolve this?  Every war since recorded history has left its shells of homeless beggars and lost souls in the countryside, heck Ulysses wandered for twenty years.  This film is one of the few that attempts to explore this from the perspective of two archetypical American male stereotypes.Not the most amusing or moving entertainment, but a must see for anyone into historical films that make any attempt to gain insight into what war does to the human soul.  (This should also be the perspective from which we should see the portrayal of ""The Enemy."")",The Deer Hunter
249,garrettderose,Most overrated movie of all time,2,28 July 2009,"This movie is a disturbing piece of 'epic' crap that I feel is a waste of time and a waste of money.I admit, I do have a Christopher Walken bias. He's the only character I liked in the movie. The Vietnam scenes kicked rump!!! The rest of the movie... dealing with that Pittsburgh-ish town... WTF? That stuff is so boring and retarded. A bunch of drunken ugly people running around and clipping out the set-mics with their terrible yelling and singing. What the heck? I mean, SO much of this movie is dedicated to scenes of people doing stupid stuff. The wedding scene was like 45 freakin minutes long. A standard length movie is like 90 minutes.I don't see any sort of memorable significance to a bunch of people dancing around at a wedding, or a bunch of guys yelling inaudible things in a bar - then singing a cheesy song in unison out of nowhere.Am I supposed to 'get to know' these terrific characters and understand their deep complexities through scenes of them doing random and useless crap? There are some good/meaningful scenes in the movie. De Niro not shooting the deer at the end, Walken blowing his own brains out, De Niro taking that skinny dudes gun away from him and showing him how hardcore nam-vet he is. That's pretty much all. Oh yeah, when they escape captivity back in Nam.The other 2+ hours of footage is lost on me. I can't believe someone would destroy such a good idea for a movie with useless clutter. Oh, the ending scene was hard to watch. Not because it was sad, because it was a total piece of turd-matter. Porkey pig going into the kitchen and crying over the news of his friend (walken) offing himself in Vietnam(after he was pronounced missing/AWOL WAYYYYYY earlier, quite possibly monthsago in the movie). Everyone else sits around and sings ""God Bless America"".Wow, way to drive the point into my soul *vomit* If this is considered the cinematic eye-opener about the damages of the Vietnam war to communities, well I feel sorry for the American public.I think a lot of people trick themselves into liking this movie way more than any human being should, just because it has a way-rad classical guitar piece throughout all of the poorly executed 'dramatic' scenes. (Cavatina I believe it's called) I have a couple of friends who bring this movie up when we talk about awesome movies everyone should see. WTF? It's in the top 250? HA!",The Deer Hunter
250,ctrout,A Tearjerker For Men,10,28 December 2006,"I saw The Deer Hunter at a young age, knowing that it had won all of those Oscars and that it had earned its place among the elite films of the 1970s. Going into it, you can tell that I thought it had a lot to live up to. Its reputation had become pretty big and I think that if it were any other film, it wouldn't have worked. That's right, I loved this movie.It opens beautifully and simply with a wedding. We see and get to know each character through their conversations with the others and their reactions to everything that's going on. That environment brings out the true emotions of these people and the movie really couldn't have done it in a better way. It was a brilliant decision to start the film with something that would show us exactly what we're getting into and what the filmmakers are setting us up for.We are then led to the everyday lives of the characters. They're steelworkers, hunters, husbands, and friends. They're your friends. They're the people YOU know, the people YOU love. The film goes so far in depth that it seems as if YOU are a character as well. You feel what they feel and you believe what they believe. You're taken in by these average Americans and you live their lives.Having just made so many friends while in Pennsylvania, you realize what the movie is about to do to you. You're about to be taken on a journey into the ""heart of darkness."" With other war movies, you learn about each character as the battle rages on. That's where this one is different. You already know who you're fighting with and that you're not alone.That's what makes this film so powerful. It builds everything up to the point that you know and love each character. you actually CARE about each character so that when something tragic happens, it's the end of the world. No other movie has ever done that to me, whether it was before I saw this or after. No film had ever made me cry, literally bring tears to the eyes of a man. You know you're dealing with something special when that happens.I won't go any further with this for fear that I might give too much away to those of you who haven't seen it already. If you are one of those people, then I urge you to check this movie out. You might not be as moved as I was, but I'm sure the film will stay with you for a while. Even if you're not a fan of war movies, this still works as its more of a human drama. The fact that only about one third of it is actually war may make you want to see it and please do. It's movie-making at its best.",The Deer Hunter
251,Paul-103,Uncomfortably powerful,9,28 April 1999,"Another movie I saw years ago and just revisited.  What a rich and powerful movie!  The portions of the movie that dealt with life in a Pennsylvania steel town were rich in character interaction, as well as setting (I could feel the cold of the town).  However, what really grabbed me the first time AND this time I saw it, was the depiction of the insanity that occurred in Vietnam.  This was the first movie that I ever saw that began to open my eyes as to the true horror and insanity of war. I say the movie was uncomfortably powerful because I found myself to be very tense throughout the war scenes of the movie.  Honestly, I wasn't able to imagine scenes as horrible until they were shown to me.  Once again, it gave me a new respect for those that have fought and withstood the horrors of any war.

Or maybe one of those old Russian hairnet honies in the wedding scene could have went old-school on Deniro's character by placing him in an unrelenting scissors hold during the fight scene.The writers dropped the ball in this regard.Perhaps it's a lack of artistic creativity that caused such a glaring omission.

It concerns a close-knit group of friends from a small Pennsylvania town who all work together in the steel mill. Robert De Niro is astonishing as Michael the natural leader of the group in a magnificent performance that earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Christopher Walken is sensational as Michael's sensitive best friend Nick in a star-making performance that won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and John Savage delivers an intensely effective performance as Steven the youngest member of the group who just married his pregnant girlfriend. They all proudly go to serve their country in the Vietnam War, totally unaware of the nightmarish horrors that await them in that brutal war. They are all captured and sent to riverside Vietcong prison camp where their sadistic captors make them play Russian roulette with each other as they bet money on which one of them will survive, these shocking scenes are some of the most excruciatingly disturbing ones ever filmed. Masterful Oscar winning direction by the late Cimino, with extraordinary supporting performances by Meryl Streep who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in her film debut, and in his final screen role that late great character actor John Cazale delivers an impressive turn as their neurotic friend Stan. George Dzundza delivers a wonderfully amusing performance as John their giggling bar owner friend. Striking Oscar nominated cinematography by the legendary Vilmos Zsigmond. This now classic motion picture shows the incalculable damage that this awful war did not only to the soldier who were psychologically devastated by it, but also to the soul and conscience of America. ""The Deer Hunter"" swept most of the critics awards including the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture, and won 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Michael Cimino.

254,bellabanana93,Great Movie On Vietnam War,9,13 October 2017,"The Deer Hunter is a Drama/War movie starring Robert De Niro as Michael. Robert plays the role of Michael well and portrays his character as a friendly, polite, creative man who likes to pull people's legs, and he is also a control freak. His goal is to always kill the deer on the first shot and takes this very seriously. The Deer Hunter takes place mostly in Pennsylvania and is about how the US-Vietnam war effects a small industrial town. This is one of the most interesting and unique war movies that I have watched. The way music is used in the production, the excellent work of the cast and the amazing authentic set designs make this film stand out from other war films. The film was a bit longer than I would have liked it to be and there are not many battle scenes. The beginning of the movie has some very light and funny moments which quickly turn into a dark and scary atmosphere, and then into a sad and dramatic mood. The music suits the atmosphere throughout and does an excellent job at taking you through the different settings and allowing you to connect to the characters and story on an emotional level. The timing of the music or lack thereof is done on purpose to add dramatic effect and to give the viewer an idea of what is to come. In the light and funny moments, there are fun love songs playing and being sung and danced along with by the cast in a very entertaining way. The dark scenes are accompanied by scary and mysterious music at the beginning of the scene before any dialogue begins. The actors that were chosen to play each part were authentic, intriguing, and excellent performers. Robert De Niro does an excellent job as the lead of this film, commanding every scene. From the beginning of the movie, this facial expressions and tone reveal much about his personality. In the locker room, we see De Niro character interacting with the other men in the room by shaking each person's hands and grinning profusely. Later on in the film, De Niro must portray the guilt that his character Michael is feeling after falling in love with his injured best friend's partner. Words need not be spoken to convey how Michael's character was feeling inside about the entire situation. The Deer Hunter had beautiful and intriguing set designs. It is obvious that a big chunk of the budget as well as a lot of time, research, and creativity was put into each one. My favourite setting was the church that the wedding was at. It was stunning and it looked very authentic for the time and location that the movie takes place. The church was huge and white with many candles all around and on the pews. There was a choir performing at the front and the aisles full of attendees. There were Jesus and Mary paintings all around and glass stained windows. The big grand chandelier was lovely and romantic as were the many vases of white flowers. I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of Classic Drama War movies to give this film a watch. Although the film is over 3 hours long I feel that it is worth the time that it takes to watch it since there are so much depth and so many interesting scenes. For a war movie, you may expect there to be more battle scenes that are shown in The Deer Hunter, but this is because the movie focuses more on the effects that war has after the battle is over. If I did not already have free access to this film through my Netflix subscription it would be worth it to purchase it as I will definitely watch it again someday. The Deer Hunter is a film that will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotion's as it takes you through the lives of young men and women living in a small town during the war. The boys go out hunting after the wedding is done and before they head out to the war knowing that their lives are about to change forever. This movie is great to watch because of the intense music, the incredible performance of the actors, and the beautiful settings. I would give this movie a 9/10 for the effort put into casting, writing, and creating the costumes/settings.",The Deer Hunter
255,Slime-3,Is that what all the fuss was about in 78?,4,7 June 2003,"Is that it? Is that the famous Deer Hunter which provoked the studios into giving the same director a seemingly limitless budget for Heaven's Gate? What were they thinking? Perhaps from this distance in time it's hard for someone, already familiar with the string of very unpleasant Vietnam movies which followed, to appreciate the impact this movie made on first release. It must be said APOCALYPSE NOW , though earlier, stands up much better and is certainly superior in it's production values, direction and plot. Viewing THE DEER HUNTER in the 21st century , it seems like a rather dull character piece which just happens to involve a 'Nam subplot but could equally have been set in the 1940s and involve Iwo Jima or Anzio. It also features a massivly underedited wedding scene which goes on and on and on.OK for those interested in how it's done in a Russian Orthadox way, but very self indulgent of the director. In truth the wedding itself with endless dancing, and song adds almost nothing of remote importance to the movie. It colours the background, but that needed only a five minute sequence which, if edited well from the footage here, could have been quite visually arresting. It really seems a waste of what must be more than 30 minutes of film(maybe longer I wasn't counting, I was almost snoring).It also seems to ape THE GODFATHER in some respects. There are redeeming factors. Industrial Pensylvania with it's grim steel works and nightmare landscape, is well photographed, reminding us of the how the back streets of New York were presented in MIDNIGHT COWBOY. The glorious mountain country of the deer hunting scenes also looks great, but the plot is so dull,so predicatable and so heavily laced with allegories that it negates all those positive aspects.  DeNiro is good. Nothing more. Walken is probably better, but then his role is more interesting. Streep actually looks really good - we forget how attractive she looked at this time before sinking herself into character roles that didn't require such. She plays her role well but it's woefully underwritten. War movie cliches abound, even if we allow for the fact most Nam films since have drawn heavily on THE DEER HUNTER , I am sure most of these 'war is hell' cliches had been formed in Audi Murphy and John Wayne movies decades earlier.The whole point of the title is a scene so predictable you can almost count yourself into it at first viewing. There's also some truly clumsy use of stock news footage of Saigon at the end of the war. It looks like someone pasted this in having forgotton to shoot the scene, and not relaised untill the movie reached the editing room! Even if the budget was small there was no need for this in my view . None of the stock footage images are of any great dramatic importance and could easily have been dropped altogether. All in all I must say a huge disappointment for a movie I have waited 20 years to catch and which has such a high rating in the all-time-greats. Like LORD OF THE RINGS it's a monument to hype over content.",The Deer Hunter

257,andy-933-696608,The Deer Hunter movie review,10,22 January 2011,"In the time that I've observed this movie, it plays itself so beautifully that just the idea of watching it end is as sad as its story, and its tragic ending. ""The Deer Hunter"" is very different from most films. Aside from having some the best performances ever witnessed, the direction of both the films and its character's contribution to the film is like a play divided into acts. Act one centers around a group of Russian American Steel workers, Michael (Deniro), Nick (Walken) and Steven (Savage) all prepare for a journey that will change their lives, as much as those whom love them most. The setting is 1968, Clairton Pennsylvania, in the dark times of Vietnam. The film's leads are preparing for their service into Vietnam, enjoying their final days of fun and freedom with as much free spirit as any other day they went drinking, only to at some point lose that very spirit of hope at the wake of the dark times ahead. Aside from having the well talented leads, lets introduce the other members of this laid back, and almost family bonded group of friends. There's Axel (Aspegren) and his poetic ways of talking, Stan (Cazale) their womanizing, gun flinging nut, John (Welsh) their bartender, and Linda (Streep) Nick's girl. Just from seeing them sing so cheerfully in the bar, celebrating Stevens wedding to be, shows just how close this group is, and how devastating the very events to come will be. As many can remember, Vietnam was a Hell America never wishes to revisit. The damage done by Vietnam is well examined in the ""The Deer Hunter"", as it shows the effects of it's mental and social damages to so much more than just it's 3 leads. Michael and the gang prepare for quite a good bye, in their last Deer hunting trip, traveling up to the mountains. ""One Shot"" a quote made by the proud and very direct leader Michael. Michael character is both a likable, but on some occasions a very questionable guy, using a calm and serious attitude to motivate his actions through most of the film. He hunts deer with complete discipline, and he follows his friends with absolute loyalty. In the wake of the films second act, the Vietnam arc, we witness torture, inhumanities through the sadism of Russian Roulette, and even a mental penetration through the 3 friends, especially Nick, forever damaging their hopes of living a normal life. Michael comes back in one piece, Steven not so much, and Nick doesn't even come back home, using his pain and convinced belief of his friend's demise to bury his old life, and start a new, and only more tainted way of living. The 3rd and final act flows more nicely, as Michael's return home is explored with the typical mental anguish of all Vietnam vets, feeling not right in the head, as well as having a much more valuable understanding of life. With his one shot code, he misses his chance in hi latest chance at a deer. His bonding with Linda, grows even more, as his personal feeling for her become more open and more real, in the midst of their lips touching. Despite how charming the tone of the3rd act seemed it all came to end with the death of Nick. Upon discovering he was alive, Michael traveled to Saigon, hoping to keep his promise of never leaving him there, and bringing him home. His attempts at finding and returning Nick home are almost as chaotic as the images of the fall of Saigon. Nick's made quite name for himself in Russian Roulete, making the concept of gambling so much worth while in the eyes of the money grubbing monsters. As the American attraction, his state of mind is both cold and shattered, for upon his reunion with Michael, there is nothing. His memory is somewhere else, all caused by the drug abuse, and the very image war has caused for him. Michaels loyalty to his friend was strong enough to break through, but not enough to save him from what had already consumed him, or his friends war. ""The Deer Hunter"" is both a riveting exploration into the very damage done by war to both soldiers, and their surroundings. Director Michael Cimano gives each character something to have been affected by Vietnam. Michael no longer hunt deer, seeing the true nature of taking it's life, Nick couldn't even think right anymore that it drove him to running away and burying his old life in drug abuse and sadism. Steven's loss of his limbs affected both his marriage as well as his capabilities of talking to his wife. Basically Vietnam affected all of them. This whole group of friends began so happy, and ended so miserably, picking themselves off in Nick's funeral with the glory of America's national anthem, thus lifting their spirits from the dark abyss life had put them in. On a personal note, I think of this film is so much more than just an examination on the effects of War. I think it goes to examine the concept of life, and how it can just change so easily, affecting the way people continue, or chose to live it from that point. Aside from that note, it's a movie that I can call a personal favorite and truly extraordinary in both the acting and direction. It's also very oriented on trademarks, especially on the uses of its Russian religion in both the wedding scenes and even during their attributed toasts. The memorable trademark is the use of Russian roulette. I know it's very sick, and almost hard to watch, but it establishes itself as main negative factors towards several of the character's inner destruction.",The Deer Hunter
258,someokiedude,Harrowing...Not Much Else to Say,10,17 July 2020,"""One shot...""It is often the case that a director crashes and burns after they make a great film, it happened to Shyamalan, the Wachowskis, Besson, and countless others that I could name. But none ever happened quite as dramatically as it did to Michael Cimino, who went from making what many, including myself, consider to be one of the greatest films of all time into making Heaven's Gate, which is considered one of the biggest box office and critical disasters of all time. But while Heaven's Gate has gained a cult following in recent years, it shows that when you capture lightning in a bottle, you can never fully retain or recreate such an experience.While Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket are happy to explore how war affects a man, The Deer Hunter decides to step back into mundane reality and ask how does war truly affect a man. How can a man live with the horrific things that he had to see and do while in combat? It is the uncomfortable questions that people would want to ask their fathers and grandfathers who fought in a war, but can never bring themselves to that The Deer Hunter is interested in. The answer is that it either forces the person to silently accept and live with the atrocities and violence that was experienced, much like with Michael or it can break people entirely, much like with Nicky.Despite great writing and directing, what truly takes The Deer Hunter to the next level is its acting. Never has Robert De Niro seemed more natural in a role than he was in this film, we also see Christopher Walken before he became the eccentric oddball that we know and love today, showcasing that despite his eccentricities, he is more than capable of holding his own against a great like De Niro. One can also sense the connection and camaraderie that is between the cast, particularly with Walken and De Niro, we also get an appearance from John Cazale before his unfortunate death in 1978 from lung cancer, and the sense of loss is felt throughout the film, not just of him but also the innocence of the characters and of the lives that they once had, with the sobering realization that life will never go back to 'normal' for them.As I often say, there is no such thing as a perfect piece of work, and The Deer Hunter is no exception. It can feel meandering at times in its infamously long beginning, which has been criticized in recent years for being meandering and boring. While I can say that it does sometimes drag with some of the character drama, but for the most part I think that it works. I also found problems with its portrayal of women, while Meryl Streep's character Linda is given some depth, the other women are once more trapped in the 'madonna-whore complex' that is found in much of fiction. There is also the film's use of extremes, and while it works for the most part, there are some scenes where I was tested, like when Michael points the gun at Stan's head.While I prefer the more operatic Apocalypse Now, I've never felt that any film ever came as close to capturing its dark energy as much as The Deer Hunter did, though I found that The Deer Hunter was far more subtle and personal in approach, keeping the dark psychology and explorations of the savagery of man while showing how war can affect a man even in his personal life, and how one might never truly be able to move on from such horrific experiences.",The Deer Hunter

They spend their time drinking and not saying much, so we don't know who they are. Hmmmmm. Eventually we learn that these guys are going to 'fight for their country in Vietnam' (apparently without joining the army first.) At this point, you'll really start to go 'hmmmm....' The guys, who work in Pennsylvania, leave the wedding reception, still boxed out on beer, and travel (a 45 minute drive) to the Canadian Rockies to hunt elk. Hmmmm. Next, they show up in Vietnam. Apparently they made a special deal with the U.S. Army to serve in the same squad. Hmmmmm.Next, they are all in a hut in the jungle playing Russian Roulette. I think they are being forced to by sinister villains, but I'm not sure. Hmmmmm.Two of the guys are rescued, but one guy disappears, to pursue a career as world reigning Russian roulette champion. Seven or three or five years later, DeNiro goes back to Saigon to rescue him. Apparently the roulette champion had been lucky enough to last years playing this deadly game and made a fortune. Will his luck hold out? Hmmmmmm. Anyway, The last day the Americans are in Vietnam, and refugees are killing themselves to rush the last helicopter at the embassy, DeNiro shows up on a commercial flight, casually strolling through the Saigon airport. Hmmmmm.I think they call it suspension of disbelief. Hmmmmmm.",The Deer Hunter
261,yawn-2,It was 1978 and everyone in the audience was about to wet their pants,10,6 April 2006,"No, this is not the best film about the Vietnam War; it's hardly about Vietnam at all. The vets who don't like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.After seeing it in a very high quality theater on its initial release, I walked out thinking it was easily one of the best movies I had ever seen - and that I never wanted to see it again. But I looked at it today on cable and found that not much had changed about it, or me. I don't want to see it again...but I want you to see it.Even now, the Russian Roulette scene (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I've seen; it makes the end of ""Reservoir Dogs"" seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting.

266,AnAverageNerd,A tale of two halves,7,15 August 2021,"The Deer Hunter epitomises the disparity between normal western life and the horrors of war (in this case Vietnam). The film spends a significant period of time introducing us to the characters and their dynamics with each other. I feel this is drawn out unnecessarily and if anything leaves the watcher with two many assumptions and presumptions going in to the second half. However, the film takes a dark turn in the second half and pulls no punches in highlighting the terrors of war and viscousness of human beings. I feel this film does one of the best jobs at presenting this side of war and really makes the watcher recoil at the events on screen. Overall, this is a very good film and the performances are excellent and presents a very accurate portrayal of life during the Vietnam war.",The Deer Hunter
267,Oblomov_81,One of the few really great films about Vietnam,9,20 August 2001,"I doubt that there ever has been or ever will be a greater movie made about the Vietnam War than ""The Deer Hunter."" The film succeeds not only in its truthful portrayal of how the ""police action"" brutally affected the ordinary lives of everyday Americans, but also in the subtle way in which the story is told. Whereas most Vietnam films have a tenancy to deliver their message in a strident and sometimes heavy-handed way, ""The Deer Hunter"" refrains from overdramatic moments where the characters break out into soapbox monologues about the horrors and immorality of war. It does not hit the same pot-holes that some generally well-made movies on the subject (such as ""Apocalypse Now,"" most of Oliver Stone's contributions, and, for that matter, the same year's ""Coming Home"") have encountered. Rather, it respects the intelligence of its characters and its audience.The people in the story are lower-class citizens who are content with their existence and do not think much of the world outside of their small Pennsylvania town. They volunteer for service in Vietnam because they still hold on to the belief of the pride and dignity of serving one's country in battle. The first act of the film concentrates on the strength found in male bonding, marriage, and sport. The story then cuts immediately to Vietnam. It does not bother with scenes involving sign-up, training, or deportment; instead, it gives the viewer a feeling of interruption, with the characters yanked out of their homely lifestyle and dropped into the middle of raging chaos. The prison camp scenes arrive with a quick, horrific shock. We ask, are these the same guys who were dancing at the wedding just twenty minutes ago?Some critics have noted that there were no actual incidents of Russian-Roulette being forced on prisoners or played for past-time. Fine, that doesn't matter. It is used as a symbol of the random destructiveness that accompanies war; not simply in the physical death of the body, but the emotional death of sanity and spirit. The three men survive the camp and escape to safety, but they are not the same inside. Something about them was, indeed, left for dead on the battlefield. Nick (Christopher Walken) has lost touch with reality and can only live on in Vietnam through chance and violence. Steven (John Savage) is laid-up in a vet hospital after losing his legs and is afraid to return to his wife. Mike (Robert De Niro) is the only one who returns home, and is shrouded in a silent, withdrawn attitude that cannot be penetrated. The only person he really responds to is Linda (Meryl Streep), Nick's girlfriend, who provides him with sexual comfort. Mike has too much difficulty trying to re-connect with his old pals and eventually realizes that he cannot be a whole person again unless he brings Nick home. We often see De Niro in roles where his character is mentally unhinged and physically destructive, but here he displays a strong-and-silent performance in the style of Gary Cooper.The final scene expresses a kind of patriotism that had not been present in film since the days of John Ford, and has rarely been seen since (if at all). The idea of getting such a fine cast to sit around a table and sing ""God Bless America"" may sound hokey, but it works perfectly when placed at the end of this story. Not once in the entire film is the audience yelled at or a message hammered into their heads. ""The Deer Hunter"" is a passionate, meaningful, and understated masterpiece.",The Deer Hunter

It's important not simply that we come to know the characters, but that we feel absorbed into their lives; that the wedding rituals and rhythms feel like more than just ethnic details. They do.The opening movement is lingered over; it's like the wedding celebration in ""The Godfather,"" but celebrated by hard-working people who have come to eat, dance and drink a lot and wish luck to the newlyweds and to say good-by to the three young men who have enlisted in the Army. The party goes on long enough for everyone to get drunk who is ever going to, and then the newlyweds drive off and the rest of the friends go up into the mountains to shoot some deer.

Baddies like Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Leather face, etc...never really got to me. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying I am totally bored by the horror genre, but it takes a lot to scare me.In 2005, my good friend told me I must watch THE DEER HUNTER because it was an experience I'd never forget. I took three hours out of my day and watched it. After those three hours I was speechless about what I just saw. Not only that, but I was scared out of my wits and the film actually depressed me for the next few days because I couldn't stop thinking about it.What makes this movie so scary that it is realistic and can happen to just about anybody. Have three life long friends? Have a possible scenario where you three can be drafted into a war? With a post trama happening to all three of you, you have just experienced what these three characters in the Deer Hunter face.The first hour of the movie is just a simple wedding that introduces all three men. While I was watching this, I kept thinking, ""why are they spending so much damn time with this wedding?"" After the movie ended, I wouldn't have had in any other way. The wedding is what creates this bond that is true between these men. Without it, the ending wouldn't be so heart breaking.Without spoiling the ending for you, let me just tell you it is haunting.

274,Waerdnotte,Just As Relevant 35 years On,8,3 March 2012,"Watching this film recently I was struck by how things haven't really changed. Men are still defined by their (un)employment and their communities, and use the military as a means of escape, often in the belief that it is a worthy and romantic course of action. But what is touching about The Deer Hunter is how we see a naive immigrant community feel the need to give something back to their adopted country. Young men join the army unaware of the horrors that await them, and the film essentially shows us how the lives of the whole community are irreversibly changed by the horror of war.The hour long set up lets us into the heart of the community, the love and friendships, the closeness of the people. This is essential and is what makes the rest of the film so powerful. The second and third acts of the film then reveal the horrors that befall the three men, and the devastating consequences of their time in Vietnam. The end is one of the saddest I have seen on film, with the remaining friends ironically singing God Bless America around the table after the funeral.The film at times felt like it had been edited down from an even longer running time with jumps from their home town to the violence of combat. From the meeting of the three to suddenly them as prisoners of the Vietcong. The film relies on its story for effect, so there is no great cinematography or snappy dialogue, but there are some great acting performances from De Niro and Walken, but for me George Dzundza is outstanding as John, the bar owner and musician.A sad indictment of war and its effect on working class people and their communities.

It's impossible that Uncle Sam would make such an arrangement for them pals.Secondly, Meryl Streep and some friends are gathered in their home town to welcome De Niro as he is returning from battlefield, but he avoids seeing them.

It doesn't have the mystery and the action (or, dare I say, ""the horror..."") of Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" which was released a year later and it is certainly a lot better than Oliver Stone's 1986 effort ""Platoon"", which I was more than a little disappointed with.The main strength of ""The Deer Hunter"" lies in the ensemble acting.  Robert de Niro, hot property after ""The Godfather Part II"" and Scorcese's ""Taxi Driver"" takes the lead role of Michael but his performance is bolstered by the support players, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and John Cazale who sadly died of cancer weeks after the film was released.The film is perhaps too slow for some people's tastes, there is a drawn out wedding scene at the beginning, which is reminiscent of the opening section of ""The Godfather"".  Michael and his friends are planning to go hunting so as to have lasting memories of one another before they set off for Vietnam.Once there, they discover just ow awful war really is and there is a truly horrifying and disturbing scene in which Michael and Nick (Walken) are forced to play Russian Roulette.  The scene is so brilliantly played that you simply cannot take your eyes off screen.To be honest there isn't really a solid plot to the film but the message it carries (as so many of these films do) is that war is a terrible thing.  The difference with ""The Deer Hunter"" from many other Vietnam films is that you feel that those involved truly meant it.",The Deer Hunter
286,films42,Sorry Folks but we STILL Don't Agree,7,12 March 2001,"THE DEER HUNTER played on cable this weekend, so we watched it.  We'd seen it when it was first released & we'd both thought it was highly over-rated. Many times opinions change with the years, but not this time.  All the performances were ""good.""  The exceptional performers were Streep & Walken. We both remembered how terrific Walken was in this film.  We were somewhat surprised by how good Streep was so early in her career.  Still, we just don't understand the passion this film inspires.  You don't see these men ""at war,"" you see them in a made up game seemingly designed to emphasize the inhumanity of ""the enemy"" (""the other"").  It's hard to tolerate such a one-sided view.",The Deer Hunter
287,vivesi-1,Withstands the test of time,10,6 August 2003,"I've just viewed the film in its entirety for the first time and already know that this one of those film experiences that will never leave me. It's as powerful a film as I have ever seen. I don't understand most of the criticism from IMDB users about this movie, though I did notice that a lot of it seems to come from people who seem to be generally anti-American so I can roundly disregard those opinions (because they're about something else, not the movie). Then there's the young American viewer who spent several paragraphs describing how they ""didn't get it"" (hahahaha) and ultimately blamed the filmmakers for the viewer's own lack of historical knowledge and perspective. (I don't know whether to laugh or curse at that.)Time after time, people said that the movie is overly long and that the wedding scene in particular is long. Yeah, on both counts, but this movie wasn't made in 2000; it didn't star Bruce Willis and it wasn't aimed at adults with the attention span of five-year-olds. Many dramas made in or about the 70s took on that style of filmmaking--long scenes that build slowly (i.e., Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, All the President's Men, Marathon Man, Dog Day Afternoon--to cite just a few examples.)If you like gritty dramas, can take brutality onscreen, know anything or are just interested in the Vietnam era and, above all, know a little bit about even recent film history, you will love this movie.",The Deer Hunter

289,ChiBron,Long and Overrated.,7,3 October 2004,"Best Film and Director? Why? For a 1 hour wedding scene to prove how close and happy 3 friends are? U don't need 60 freaking minutes to showcase something that could be done in 15-20 minutes. Did Cappola need the entire wedding of Talia Shire in The Godfather to prove how Michael(Pacino) is different from his family and isn't involved in the business? NO. He needs a two min. story(an offer he couldn't refuse) and Pacino saying ""That's my family Kay, its not me"". BOOM. That's all u need!The funny thing is u don't even truly understand the depth of these guyz friendship cuz so much time is wasted on the female characters, cultural dancing and unnecessary extras who provide nothing to highlight the movie's theme. What's the point in showing drunk men acting like idiots?The war scenes are too gory and pretentious. BLOOD, not the main characters, is what the director seems to glorify here. After the war the movie is HARDLY about the ""3 friends"" and more abt Michael(DeNiro) and the effects of war on him. That's the only part where Cimino seems to know exactly what he's trying to convey. U can feel what Michael has gone through.....and his distant/empty behavior is understandable. By this time though, his two friends are completely forgotten until the end where the movie seriously starts to get draggy and u're just thinking ""c'mon, let this end already"". The screen play is hardly something that would keep u hooked. I got no problem with slow movies that have a theme. But here the director seems confused as to what he's trying to convey. Is this just abt Michael and his experiences at Vietnam? Is this abt his relationship with Linda(Meryl Streep)? Is this abt 3 friends and how the war has changed everything between them?The performance are def. the best thing abt the movie. DeNiro, although a little wooden and expression-less sometimes, gives one of his 10 best performances. Streep is a total natural and wonderful to see perform. Walken was good, but Oscar material? Uhhh...i don't know.Overall, The Deer Hunter suffers from length and a poorly written screen play. The wedding + the final half hour of the movie is just too long. The characters would've been able to register a bigger impact had the direction been more subtle(The Wedding), and a screen play that focused more on the 3 friends, rather then just Michael alone.",The Deer Hunter

292,doire,The heart of darkness.,10,20 July 2001,"Having seen The Deer Hunter on the big screen in 1978, I watched it again today on video and was pleasantly surprised that the enormous power the movie generated in 1978 is still very much in evidence today. A dynamic anti-war film, TDH has numerous layers of meaning, allegory very much to the fore. It was an incredible performance by both De Niro and Walken, ably complemented by the other leading artists, particularly John Cazale. I do feel though that the movie was a little too long and would agree that the wedding scene was overplayed, but then again from a group of Russian-Americans at a Russian-American wedding to a trio of Russian-American soldiers being forced to participate in a fatal game of Russian Roulette perhaps requires a lengthy introduction to characterization so that the full horror of their prediction can be appreciated. Indeed, there is a lot to compare and contrast in TDH and the imagery flows thick and fast. Everybody is touched or corrupted by war and human life is cheap, both to the VC soldiers playing Russian Roulette with their prisoners and the Southern Vietnamese playing Russian Roulette with unfortunates so desperate for money that they are prepared to sacrifice their lives in the pursuit of a quick dollar. Still, I do have my criticisms of the movie. Nick does not know who Michael is when he returns to Vietnam to take him home yet he must know who Steven is since he has been sending Steven money home regularly to his ward in the Veterans hospital. How come he would know Steven but not Nick who was, after all, his best friend?. And how come a drug-riddled Nick has been so lucky at this cruel game of Russian roulette?. The luck of a man living in the heart of darkness perhaps?. In any event, this film is a masterpiece of movie-making and worthy of all the critical acclaim bestowed on it.",The Deer Hunter
293,Lord_Crypto,The Best Film Ever made about War,10,18 June 2007,"Most of you after reading my title are already going to be upset. I do consider this to be the best film ever made about war. I do not look at this film being about the Vietnam War. I look at this film being about war (Period).I think this film is as excellent as it is for one good reason, showing the effects of war. True, we see the films where men are shaped by war, what events make them who they are, and how the events of war transform them. It is mainly about what the war has done to them. The Deer Hunter takes a bigger step back from that and shows the entire character transformation. It does not just show the transformation of a soldier, but also the transformation as a civilian. You spend a good 40 minutes in the Deer Hunter getting to know the main characters and getting a feel for their personalities. The first 40 minutes is about character development and almost getting an attachment to those characters. This makes their transformation more effective for the viewer and they almost feel for the character and what they are going through. Than those characters get thrown into war and you see the events that change them. The things they had to experience as a soldier. And than, most importantly, we see the changes in their characters after the war. And we do not just see the changes in the soldiers, we see the changes that their friends and lovers undergo as a result of the war. We are not just looking at one soldier, we are looking at a network of friends and how they are changed due to the war. Even those who did not go to war are still effected. And the fact all the characters are from a small town makes it that much more powerful. The Deer Hunter is a powerful film about how war effects everybody, not just the soldiers involved in it.The cast is terrific! Robert De Niro, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryll Streep, and Christopher Walken. Need I say more. Christopher Walken won an Oscar for best supporting actor in this film. The script is beautifully written and the movie is filmed perfectly. I can find nothing wrong with anything about this movie. I mean, it did win 5 Oscars in 1978 including Best Picture and Best Director for Michael Cimino.This movie is emotionally powerful. I can not say this film is accurate about war, I can only give my opinion and take from the film what I can. I am an 18-year old teen who has an almost complete control over his emotions. This film brought me the closest to tears I have ever been by a movie. It is an absolute masterpiece. This is one of the greatest films ever made. Take the time to watch this film, it is a classic that hits you the hardest emotionally.",The Deer Hunter
294,Tgrain,"Frightening, extremely real, and unusual, all the same excellent.",9,21 November 1999,"Cimino takes the new wave cinema approach together with his own unique, somewhat Kubrick-like style, and paints a picture that is frighteningly too real for words. The performances are 100% true, the photography of Zigmond is seamless - one senses a camera was planted into real life. The performances are always interesting, and never overdone. The casting is fantastic, each actor works to their extreme.The lack of the usual Hollywood melodramatic approach and political correctness is extremely welcome here, as it gives the audience a lot of room for it's own judgements. The understanding of the subject matter is profound. The film shows what an American can expect to find fighting a foreign war, and how a man can become a foreigner for a long time after he comes home.",The Deer Hunter
295,andysevenfold,Robert De Niro was fantastic,6,4 November 2019,The Deer Hunter (1978) is a psychological thriller about the effect that the Vietnam war had on a trio of friends. Robert de Niro and Christopher Walken play their parts fantastically and the famous Russian roulette scene had me on the edge of my seat. The criticism I have of this film is that the hour long first act wasn't needed at all and it could've been trimmed down to make the movie go by a little quicker. Robert De Niro was the stand out for me.,The Deer Hunter
296,craigdoolan,Time flies by in this masterpiece,9,15 June 2021,"This is one of those movies where three and a quarter hours is barely enough. It is a beautifully well made and superbly acted film, one of the best Vietnam war films (in a category with stiff competition).De Niro plays the awkward anti-hero, typically of some of some of his best roles and the movie rightly made a star of Christopher Walken. There probably could have been more of Meryl Streep and John Cazale is great again, just months before he died, with arguably the most perfect filmography in movie history.I actually think the best parts of film are back on American soil, where the impacts of the war on a small town are beautifully shown, as their menfolk go to war and the women are left behind to pick up the mess. There is a lot more to this than the famous Russian Roulette scenes, although the first one is amazingly powerful.The only thing that could have been improved is the plotting, which is a bit disjointed, stopping the film from being truly great, but it still deserves its place among the great American films.",The Deer Hunter
297,Michael-96,Possibly one of the most over-rated movies of all time,2,1 February 2002,"The Deer Hunter claims to be a film about war, and to believe the hype you might think it was a good one.  It is, unfortunately, neither.  The film consists of a series of disconnected, almost unrelated scenes - you're never given the time to form any emotional attachment to the characters.  Huge swathes of time where this could happen - time that would be the meat of any good movie - is completely skipped in what seems to be an attempt to prevent that bond from forming.Without emotional attachment, the film is boring, trite and cliched.  An obsession with a Russian Roulette theme doesn't make a good movie, and that (apart from some fair acting when dealing with the truly terrible script) is about all the Deer Hunter has. The real question here is how this movie has appeared in the IMDB Top 100 movies (99th at the time of this writing) when it doesn't have a coherent plot, has only average acting and really has no story to tell.There are many much, MUCH better war movies out there.  Give this one a pass, and try any of the others - whatever you choose, it is bound to be an improvement.",The Deer Hunter
298,RJ-21,Did I miss something?,6,26 November 1998,"I'm sorry to all those people who think it's a masterpiece.  I just don't see it that way.  All right, I saw it twenty years after it came out, but I found it difficult.  I found the first hour or so slow, the last hour and forty minutes pretty good, but the best part of the entire film was the Russian Roulette scene. It was completely brutal, I know, but it was harrowing and awesome.  I agree Chris Walken (what happened to him? - now all he does is shady evil guys) deserved his Oscar, but I didn't think too much of Meryl.  DeNiro was as good as ever, though. A good film, but I think I saw it twenty years too late.(Better than Platoon, though)",The Deer Hunter
299,daniel-ambia,This movie sucks,3,3 March 2007,"First of all, The Deer Hunter is boring. In the tradition of the Godfather there is a forty-five minute long wedding scene in the beginning where we learn absolutely nothing about the title characters except for that they are Eastern European, that they all like to get drunk and that three of them are joining the army even though all of them look well above maximum enlistment age. Then they go hunting and you learn that, okay they are all hunters. Next, with absolutely no back story, Michael (Deniro) is in the middle of a Vietnamese village when he reunites with his two friends from home. Then all of a sudden they are all in what looks like a POW camp where they play Russian roullete with the guards. Due to limited dialogue and even more limited plot structure most of this film makes absolutely no sense. Although the actors gave critically acclaimed performances, none has the opportunity to shine in my opinion. Also the director obviously had no military advisors on set because he would have known not to put in several details, (fellow soldiers could point them out immediately). Overall I was disappointed because the cast is very promising and even the concept is kind of intriguing, but the movie is just a mess and too poorly edited for a plot to be deriven from it at any point. This should not be called a war film just a boring ass movie wherein Christopher Walken looks really young, that's all. Oh and Meryl Streep looks pretty hot.",The Deer Hunter

First off, keep in mind, this (Deer Hunter) is fiction. Not based on any events other than a war and a steel mill. One rater says how they just suddenly were in Viet Nam. No basic or anything. How long would you want the movie to be?! All 3 going to the same place? It's called ""The Buddy System"". You could request to stay together. The brass didn't care as long as they had warm bodies. One rater with his ""Hmmmmm..."" He needs to do some research. How do you people know what went on over there? Russian Roulette? All kinds of ""stuff"" went on. Mostly torture and starvation. No medical help (ask John McCain). You doubters need to understand: Viet Nam was not a ten year long ""Rambo"" movie. They didn't fire 600 continuous rounds from a single magazine. One guy wonders why they went from the U.S. to combat/P.O.W. camp within a minute or so. Ever watch ""Pappion""? Steve McQueen does 5 years in solitary in about 15 seconds. It's only a movie, guys! To all you Vets out there who read the drivel from the Rambo-loving non-vets, I apologize. They don't have a clue. Maybe they should join the Military and get some education on what really happens in the Military. The Deer Hunter is a great movie.

302,critical-escapist,Weekends of deer hunting turn into days of the Vietnam War.,9,13 April 2006,"Shocking, fascinating, and controversial, The Deer Hunter is a great film with jaw-dropping images of war and the way of life of a few friends of Pennsylvania. The film is quite lengthy, with three significant parts. The first part shows how normal these people are  working at the local factory, attending a wedding, drinking at the local bar and enjoying weekend deer-hunting trips. Michael (Robert De Niro) is the apparent ""big brother"" of the bunch who keeps things under control. When Michael, Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) get drafted to war, they are shown of war's circumstances and how it affects people's lives dramatically. When they return, nothing seems to be the same: Michael is somewhat alone, returning to Linda (Meryl Streep), Nick's girlfriend, and Steven is in a hospital, almost abandoning his wife, Angela (Rutanya Alda).One of the most unforgettable images of this film is when the friends are captured and must play Russian roulette against each other. I have never seen anything more horrific than the stares they gave each other, what they said to each other, and the screams. That one scene is much more terrifying than the rip-off scene we get from scary movies. It is not only jaw dropping, but it defines the struggle of soldiers in the Vietnam War (as far as film-making is concerned).The performances are fantastic. One thing that I absolutely love about films from the 70's is that you an get De Niro, Streep, Walken, Savage, and John Cazale on one screen and make sure they are not making some holiday movie crap  they are still trying to achieve their names as actors, and they are fantastic at it. There are rarely any actors like that now (so who's the next superstar? Orlando Bloom? I doubt it). There is perfect chemistry between the actors. Christopher Walken, in his Oscar-winning performance is brilliant in here: The scene in the Vietnam hospital where he is trying to keep from crying in just one great scene. Meryl Streep (in her first Oscar-nominated performance out of her record 13-nominations and 2-wins) is also incredible as Linda, who is torn between her boyfriend who doesn't seem to be coming home and Michael, her boyfriend's best buddy.The director, Michael Cimino makes The Deer Hunter like a history lesson without making it too melodramatic (which is the word people often use when they don't like it). It has a great story and every scene seems to count  even the later Russian roulette scenes with the characters we do not know the names of. I have not seen a better cast than The Deer Hunter, which even improves the film. Even though the ending is a little unsatisfying, what happens is heartbreaking and memorable, as they sing ""God Bless Americans"" like true Americans who appreciate the country even in such a terrible time.",The Deer Hunter
303,imdbfriend,Good War Movie!!,10,14 July 2008,"The long wait is finally over for me and I can't believe it took me so long to watch this masterpiece especially this being Robert De Niro's movie and who is my all time favorite American actor. Acting needless to say is high class and not just from ever formidable De Niro but from other cast too but worth mentioning here is Christopher Walken in one of his best roles ever and he totally deserved the Oscar for that part. I can't believe other filmmakers failed to utilize his talent in much deserved bigger and challenging roles throughout his illustrious career. Nonetheless De Niro's and Walken's performances are one for the ages. Direction by Michael Cimino is excellent and I read in some other reviewers comment, him being a one movie wonder and me too haven't heard about him for any other movies, but will definitely try to catch his other work to conclude. There are many reasons for why I loved this movie, some of them being: 1. the introduction sequences for all the characters and their lives which takes about one hour of the movie time and sets the right mood for the later parts of the movie. 2. Deer hunting scene 3. Less importance to the war sequences but rather to the psyche of the soldiers. 4. Russian roulette sequences, 5. Ending sequence where everyone gathers around the table, and many more scenes that keep with the pace of the movie. Overall I would say 3 hrs well spent on the weekend.",The Deer Hunter

Half of the film is happy moments in the wedding and deer hunting session, the other half is the Russian roulette bloodbath scenes. This is an extreme heart-braking drama that blends in with a very critical action sequences. And trust me...you won't believe Chris Walken and Rob De Niro in their roles.

This movie touches that side of me I keep tucked away deep within me so I can play the game of lies our society unfolds every day I walk the streets. I must because of my 4 year old daughter. After I returned from Iraq in 2003, this American dream looked disgusting. Each year, it continues to get worse as I age (my perspective).I forced myself to watch this movie today because it's more real than any escape from reality Hollywood produces for $$$$. I thought the acting was surreal, especially the POW scenes. After the POW scene escape, the after effect was to strong to escape, hence the continuous Russian roulette. The PTSD monster had a stranglehold and already won the death prior to the bullet in the head.The movie really did not help my depression at all, but I cope with a power greater than myself which is my 4 year old daughter; otherwise I never would have watched this movie again.

It's extremely unrealistic. It's also way too long",The Deer Hunter
307,Tet-5,"One of the most powerful, moving pictures ever made.",9,15 February 1999,"During the first hour of this movie, you are drawn into the lives of Michael, Nick, Steven and their friends. I can't think of another movie in which a close community has been represented so real, so convincing. The Deer Hunter really takes its time observing these people, living their ordinary lives. Some viewers complain that these scenes are much too long, that there isn't happening enough. I don't share their opinion. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that you know the three friends, that you empathize with their feelings and their way of thinking. And all this is accomplished thanks to this first, absorbing hour.The Russian Roulette-scene is very famous. When I first saw it, not yet 20 years old, I was extremely shocked by it. Never before had I seen such brutal violence in a movie. The tension is so perceptible. The confusion, felt by Nick. The heart-rending fear of Steven. The almost maniacal determination of Michael to get them out.I'm twice as old now. Lots of movies I liked when I was 20, lost its power of attraction as I grew older. But not The Deer Hunter. The Russian Roulette-scene still is one of the most compelling pieces of movie I've ever seen.When Michael returns to the United States we witness several other great scenes. Because the first hour gave us the opportunity to get to know the friends who stayed behind in the US, we now understand the enormous gap between them and Michael. Although it never becomes overly sentimental, Michael's coming-home is an emotionally shattering piece of movie.The actors all are sublime. Lesser actors never could have shown us this much, with so few means. It's absolutely great how they created these real, convincing characters. I'm still amazed that Jon Voight won the Oscar for best actor. I'm sure lots of actors could have created his role in ""Coming Home"" as good as he did. But very few are capable to do what Robert De Niro did in The Deer Hunter, it's his best role ever. I also was touched by the hardly ever mentioned part of George Dzunda, who played John. It was small, but great!Unfortunately, I also do have some comment. I really can't understand how Nick could possibly have sent money to Steven. Neither of them knew the other one was alive. Nick never could have known where Steven was staying. I think this is an enormous blunder in the script. I also had some difficulty with the last scenes in Saigon. When you consider what chaos Saigon was in at that moment, the events happening there weren't very realistic.If these flaws wouldn't have been there, I surely would have given The Deer Hunter 10 out of 10. Now, unfortunately, I only gave it 9 out of 10.",The Deer Hunter

It's a shame that the few powerful moments and fine performances that are here are completely wasted.  Who on Earth wants to see long, boring, and totally pointless scenes of monotonous daily life amongst a bunch of uncharismatic people?  Character development is one thing.  We don't need to see two hours of beer drinking, pool shooting, and especially the extended wedding sequence if absolutely none of it is relevant and not the least bit entertaining.

310,jacob rosen,Comes Close,9,14 December 2001,"Michael Cimino's ambitious goal of creating an epic about the impact of the Vietnam War on ordinary civilians falls a little short of its goal--Cimino's attempts at creating mythology through his characters doesn't have as much substance as it would appear on the surface and a lot of the moments aimed at reflection seem empty; on a larger scale, there might be some trouble understanding what it all means. But when Cimino concentrates on the smaller, intimate interpersonal relationships--of which there are many--he succeeds brilliantly and the anguish of the war's aftereffects are clear, keenly felt and far more engrossing. Robert DeNiro heads an ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, John Heard, Christopher Walken and the sorely missed John Cazale; they do justice to the script (by Cimino and three other writers) even when it shows its limitations. The middle section is a justly celebrated Russian roulette game played in a makeshift POW camp; while it underscores the unfortunate aspects of the screenplay, it is a harrowing experience that makes the performances that much more powerful. It could have been shorter but it is still a worthwhile experience, if not quite the masterpiece it was intended to be.",The Deer Hunter
311,surfsaltwater,Wow! A powerful film everyone must watch,10,8 September 2021,I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started watching it but as the story goes on it just gets heavier and heavier by the end of it you're pretty much Ball in your head out. This is got to be the saddest movie I've ever seen in my entire life because of the truth. Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro did an amazing job. Such a powerful film about such a controversial war. I think the directors did a phenomenal job explaining everything about war and the effects it has on the average soldier and their families. This film needs to be a requirement in every high school in the country. Such a sad ending.,The Deer Hunter
312,landfather,Don't EVER do that to me again.,4,12 November 2018,"I don't think there's ever been a movie more dedicated to making me feel just awful. I realize how horrid and cruel war is, but to have it shoved down my throat in such a brutal manner was very unnerving and only left me with an upset stomach and shaking my head. I don't know just how accurate it's telling was, but all I could do was cringe and look away through most of it. The only reason I gave it four stars was because of the stellar acting performances by DeNiro, Walken, Streep and the others. In fact, I think it was their believeablity that made me have such a strong reaction to the film. There's nothing I appreciate more than our soldiers and veterans, whom I feel are getting the fuzzing end of the lollipop when it comes to what they deserve for their service to this country, and I'm sure that's one of the reasons this movie left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. This is one of those films that you either hate or love and it seems there's really no in between with it's ratings. Sorry all you The Deer Hunter fans, I know where you're coming from, but for me, this movie literally hurts too much to watch.",The Deer Hunter
313,Meiling2Movie,How come Michael survived,10,7 January 2021,"I have watched many Robert De Niro movies and had impression he often act as a tough man and I think Robert De Niro fits perfect in the role, so I would give credit to the casting teams.
Three out of five close friends joint wars and Steven lost legs, Nick had serious PTSD and only Michael came back without physical harm and serious psychological trauma. So I wonder how come Michael survived despite having horrifying experience of wars.
Firstly, Michael was the lucky one that he didn't serious injury.
Secondly, Michael was too busy with saving his friends. For Michael, Nick was the best friend among the four, they were always hunting together. I remember Michael said something like he will not go for hunting without Nick and promised Nick to bring him back.
Because of extreme experience, Nick remained in Vietnam and kept betting his life in Russian Roulette. So Michael went to Vietnam to bring Nick back despite dangerous situation there and despite romantic relationship with Linda.
In a way, Michael's life is not normal.
So I think the movie showed three victims, not two and the message is in war, no one wins.",The Deer Hunter

But enough nit-picking.The tag lines from The Bridge on the River Kwai and Apocalypse Now come to mind here. ""Madness, madness."" ""The horror, the horror.""

316,jrc007,What's the big deal?,1,27 June 2002,"Spoilers are possible, so proceed at your own risk.I watched THE DEER HUNTER for the first time last night. I was interested in seeing it because of its status as Best Picture of 1978. After sitting through the three hours, I had one question in mind: what's the big deal?This film, so widely praised in the annals of film history, seems to have no reason to support this praise. The story is drawn out, the characters lack depth (save Christopher Walken) and you cannot identify with them. Robert De Niro, who I usually like very much, does not give his usual bravura performance we're used to, as in RAGING BULL, TAXI DRIVER, and THE KING OF COMEDY. He seems to be just going through the motions. Cimino's direction lacks a certain style that Scorsese, Coppola, and other modern-era directors so painstakingly thread through the film. The acting beside De Niro is stale (with the exception of Walken, who can be called about ""average."")
The first hour, while thought to be the highlight of the film, is still too long and causes even the most intent viewer to look at his or her watch once or twice before the men go to Vietnam.The film had an interesting idea behind it: divide a film into thirds and have the first third show the life of Pennsylvania steel-workers, the second third show their ordeals in Vietnam, and the third show how they changed when they came home.The problem I thought was this structure was that during the last third, the characters (except De Niro) hadn't changed greatly (or at all) from the first half! They still engage in the same adolescent horseplay and do not seem a bit stirred by their experiences in Vietnam. Christopher Walken is the only exception to this, and his reintroduction into the film near the three hour mark was too drawn out to achieve the artistic status that Cimino was trying to achieve.There was too much Russian roulette! If I had to watch one more game of Russian roulette, I was going to shoot MYSELF! (Just kidding). It was too much, though. These scenes in Vietnam involving this deadly game were too overdramatic and drawn out.Although this wasn't the worst of the Best Pictures (that honor goes to GIGI, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, and the ones from the late 20s and early 30s), it is only middle of the road as far as Vietnam movies are concerned, as it suffers in comparison to FULL METAL JACKET and especially APOCALYPSE NOW, but is superior to PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.My rating: 4/10 (That's being generous).Highlights: None that stand out.",The Deer Hunter
317,rudy-46,Powerful drama,10,21 February 2000,"A compelling production with a strong anti-war statement. Fine acting by De Niro, Walken and Streep.

318,miguelangel-23,powerful,7,6 April 2003,"The story is not much about war as it is about friendship, however, it is a little bit to long and to slow, I think it can bring the point and the message saving us all the dull environment.Any way it was a good job, and a powerful deliverance from De niro, Streep and Walken. I give it 7/10",The Deer Hunter
319,EraserheadDr,A Captivating Vietnam story.,10,24 May 2009,"One of my favorite Vietnam war flicks from the late 70's that has an amazing cast starring Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. A story about a few men that are going to the Nam and find themselves captured by Vietnamese.A popular scene from the film would be the Russian Roulette sequence. A very thrilling and fearful scene. Some of the acting and creative work done is some of the best acting, best story play that i've ever seen in a war motion picture. I thought ""Platoon"" was a brilliant film that shows a lot more Vietnam description than this one. But as for ""The Deer Hunter"", it may not show a whole lot of war scenes or action, but the powerful beauty of it really shows it's emotional side in the film. De Niro later on in the film goes deer hunting once again and to me I think he realizes that ""why shoot such an animal like a deer, when I lived through a living hell in the war?"" To me the acting is by far the best i've seen in quite a long time in a 70's film.The ending of the film is also an emotional and heart-trembling moment in the film where you are really torn up by. I enjoy watching the ending over and over, but somehow it catches me as a disappointing and saddening, realistic ending. It gets to me every time. I highly recommend you experience a motion picture like this one. Films like this catch an amazing amount of power to it, and great symbolism with them deer hunting.

320,Oscar85,Gripping,10,28 August 2000,The Deer Hunter is one of the most compelling and dramatic pictures I've ever seen. How it truthfully depicts how the effects of war can change the lives of normal people completely and forever is amazing. The russian roulette scenes are the hardest to watch. Christopher Walken delivers a dynamite performance that more than warranted him the Oscar. This is a great film. (9.9 out of 10),The Deer Hunter
321,electronicparty,Emotionally Intense Film,10,25 March 2006,"This movie is very emotionally intense. It spent a lot of time developing characters. I began to either like or dislike characters. It was particularly hard to watch the Russian Roulette scenes. This movie brought out many what if questions in me. What if I were in their situation, what would I do? How would I handle it? The answers were tough to deal with. This defiantly isn't a movie for the faint of heart. The violence is particularly painful to watch. It's done in such a way that it peers into the soul. I honestly haven't saw a more character driven film. This was a tough one get through. I expected the bad to occur and didn't want it to. When it did it was worst then expected. It's slow to start but really drives it's message home. Keep your word, help your friends, and never give up until your dead.",The Deer Hunter
322,chrismulkeyisgod,"A masterpiece that will make you re-examine your life, gun laws.",10,30 December 2006,"This film captivates with all of the imagery and sounds that it has to offer. The pictures move flawlessly and there is sound dubbed perfectly in to match the motion. There is also audible speaking--the entire thing feels very Kafkaesque for this reason and one can only assume that the messages wrapped tightly within beneath the exterior have a lot more to do with LIFE than what the director of the moving film would otherwise lead you to believe. Music flows freely within the audible background of the film, pushing the dramatics and playing with the hearts of the viewers (like a cat batting around a ball of yarn that's entirely made up of cram).There are many parts of the movie that I identified with, but only because I am so introspective and intelligent. The entire thing seemed like a lucid notion and one of my favorite hobbies is scuba diving. I'm not sure why more people didn't like this movie (I can understand some of the movie being a little ""gross"" or ""sad"" but sometimes we have to overlook things like that in film because life can also be ""gross"" and ""sad"" too; art imitates life). I originally read the book for this, and so was obviously expecting a lot from the film. This film met my expectations I am glad to say, and I'm not sure what everyone else's problem is.

323,travisyoung,"A poetic, emotional odyssey",9,2 November 2007,"A baroque tragedy portrayed in three emotionally shattering acts set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. But it's about more than Vietnam: The Deer Hunter chronicles the effects of violence upon ALL people, not just those whom participate in it. I will be careful not to spoil or expose the crucial elements that truly make this film greater than the sum of its parts. We are pulled delicately by both the head and the heart to not merely watch but actually experience the normal, even mundane lives of steel workers as their relationships and the story unfold in a small Pennsylvania town. And maybe it all plays slowly at first - granted the film is not densely plotted - but that's precisely the point, because it's about the people, and not anything else. Amidst the awesome beauty of the Cascade mountains (a more than comparable filming substitution for the Appalachians) the iconic parable of the hunter poetically emerges, unifying the narrative and the roles these men play in each other's lives, and in the world. Then Vietnam. Three go in, and are irrevocably changed by 24 hours at a riverside POW camp...and you will be too. You will never be the same after these few scenes. This is by far the most psychologically intense sequence I have ever seen played out on film. Back home in small town PA the effect is much the same. The cold of late fall underscored by a haunting virtuoso guitar solo encapsulates the loss of innocence and the guilt of living in a world that seems broken. Relationships bloom and wither out of season, and again the hunter, the deer, and the bullet find solace and unexpected reckoning with one another. As the story again shifts to Vietnam, we discover that true insanity is not war or violence, but fulfilling a promise of love in the face of it. Beginning with a wedding and ending with a funeral, you will be devastated by The Deer Hunter. It has been said that the movie is about many things: war, patriotism, violence, friendship, Nixon, religion...far too many topics to list here. And even if it is about any or all of those things, what makes this picture overwhelmingly moving and disturbing is the fabric of love woven through every frame. Although lauded by many technical awards, many of the more superficial, aesthetic characteristics such as cinematography, editing, and sound dubbing are either hit or miss (usually in equal shares). But this movie excels far above and beyond almost every other film made in the past 50 years solely by the strength of the material and the powerful performances. DeNiro for once is simply life-like (as opposed to typically being larger-than-life). Streep is complex and yet pleasantly provincial in this her second film. Walken transforms from a character into a person...and through all of it, we can't help living inside their skin for three hours, because we all know people just like them...we ARE just like them.",The Deer Hunter

Now 5 years later or so I decided to watch it again on dvd... Brilliant movie is what I can say this right moment. Started out boring, but it was needed to make this movie turn out so good, all the characters are deployed very well, they all have their fears and pain.--------MAJOR SPOILERS------------- The fun, the friends, home sweet home, the parties, love....all the things u never knew you would loose them. Michael (De Niro) is the main character which is followed throughout the whole movie, and his performance is brilliant, in the beginning before he goes to war you can feel with him, you feel the fear he has, the fear of maybe not coming home ever. Then fast forward we see the disturbing world of terror, humiliation and inhumanity, and the scar it has made on the three friends, Michael comes home and feels that it's not going to be ever the same again, he tries to find inner peace, but everything he has gone through sticks in his mind, What follows is the fight against himself, trying to forget the past, but somehow he can't. --------END SPOILERS----------------The movie shows very well what war can do with people, war kills, not only people but also hearts from those who survived. I read this movie was shot after the Vietnam war. I think many should watch this movie again, because the same is going on right now in Iraq.If you wanna feel what war can do with people this is certainly a movie for you, it's depressing but it's reality, and it's beautifully made.

327,ellieforpeace,Has the Deer Hunter Become Outdated?,7,11 July 2009,"The Deer Hunter is a post-Vietnam war movie, one of many of its kind, although this one is a bit different, in that it doesn't focus on Vietnam at all. People laud it as a great anti-war movie, but it most certainly is not. If anything it could be called an anti-torture movie, because the only scene that drives the movie in the war zone, was in a POW ""camp"" I suppose is the word, inadequate as it is. But much of the movie falls short of the ""classic"" status it has today.It's about a group of coal miners who go off to war. The leader is Robert De Niro's character, accompanied mainly by John Cazale, John Savage, and of course, Christopher Walken. The characters are greeted at home by Meryl Streep's character. It's a very realistic film. Long shots are taken from their lives, all part of character development, sure, but it just goes on, and after a while goes from joyous to tedious. There is one brief battle scene that could have been focused on more to show the horrible war that was Vietnam, and though the editors think that less is more with the war, they don't take that opinion with the horrible torture scene, upon which the whole move rests. It's a brilliant scene, and perhaps would have brought the movie to a higher rating if it weren't for the following scenes. They're long and meandering, and while Robert De Niro's character is believable, none of the others really are. The awkwardness of adjusting back is shown brilliantly in him, but less so in the others, and very much less so in Nick, Christopher Walken's character, the one that so took the original audience by storm, an iconic character.But to me, it just all falls short. Especially the editing. It is a long movie, with long shots and long scenes, lifelike, but not cutting enough for a movie. It's less like a knife and more like a blunt hammer. The editing is simply bad. It cuts from one part to another haphazardly, most likely trying to juxtapose the two lives, show the impossibility of adjusting between them, but only serves to be jerky. And the fate of Nick is just improbable, they don't even try to make it make sense. It's not like Apocalypse Now, a genius post-Vietnam film, one that again, doesn't focus on the actual war, but another story. It was edited amazingly, it was improbable and yet realistic, and it showed a truth greater than the actual period in which it was made. It was universal. The Deer Hunter doesn't quite have that effect.It's not a terrible movie, though. It's good. That's all I would call it. It's a movie that tries very hard for greatness, but fumbles along the way, at least in my head. It doesn't live up to its original glory for new viewers unlike other similar films. I'm in a very small group on this though, so judge for yourself. I'm not always partial to war movies anyway.",The Deer Hunter
328,abelardo64,A War Like All Wars A Film Like No Other,10,31 January 2010,"""The Deer Hunter"" is 32 years old. How extraordinary to sit through it now. Walking over the politics that divided , somehow, all of its admirers then. ""Great film but..."" How silly to think of it now. Michael (a sensational young Robert De Niro) is as extreme a character as Rocco was in ""Rocco And His Brothers"" His goodness, the one that was always there but that he discovers under the most horrendous circumstances, underlined by Stanley Mayers's ""Cavatina"" permeates the entire film. I remember thinking, when I saw the film for the first time, that I couldn't or wouldn't spend ten minutes with Michael and his friends, the ones we meet at the beginning of the film but by the end I thought of them as brothers and I loved them. I actually loved them. That in itself is a sort of film miracle. John Savage will break your heart, it certainly broke mine and Christopher Walken is absolutely riveting. How strange to tho think that Michael Cimino, still a young man, is nowhere to be seen.

I've seen a lot of films about Vietnam war but this is definitely one of the best. The film is brilliantly directed and the style its done in is terrific. the wedding scene seems to go on forever but i quite enjoyed it because it makes you understand how happy one man can be on his wedding day and the next hes off to war and possibly never coming back. Russian Roulette would have been majorly influenced by this film because the scene is so well established.

330,hptmbedra,Really overrated,2,30 April 2014,"Another big letdown. I don't simply understand what the others find so amazing about this film. The rating absolutely doesn't fit. The Deer Hunter is long and boring, insulting, full of nonsense and misinformation.One big disappointment has come when I found out that this is no war film. There is a little footage from Vietnam and almost nothing from combat. It is called war film so I expected war. I don't want to speak about the nonsenses like Russian roulette all over Asia, 7 years long Russian roulette career, saving friend from Russian roulette through playing Russian roulette... Man I got sick of Russian roulette here, too much of it. These things have been already mentioned in other reviews.I want to talk about the editing and script. As I thought The Deer Hunter is a war movie, I've expected something like 10 - 15 minute introduction and then training or directly Vietnam war where you can see some gradual character's development through the realism and horrors of war. I was mistaken. After first promising 5 minutes comes the 50 minutes long(!!!) wedding situation which is probably supposed to teach us about the main characters and get like them, but it goes on and on and seems like never-ending bore! It is literally empty! While watching this I was at first like: ""Ok, this will last about 10 minutes, no problem."" After another 10 minutes: ""Ok, half an hour, I can take this."" After 45 minutes: ""God, it looks like the first half of movie is just wedding!"" The pace was so slow and it didn't change during the whole film. Additionally, the amount of information you learn during this sequence could be told in 5 minutes. You learn that our friends like drinking alcohol, doing mess, hunting, shouting, fighting, wasting beer, being loud all the day and that they eventually go to the Vietnam. I've seen movies where such behaviour was funny or at least tolerable, but here it is so annoying when it occurs like each 5 minutes! On the other hand there is nothing told about their background, their motives, how and why did they get to Nam war... I really wanted to learn why Cazale (Stanley) is such an idiot, pointing that little gun at people all the time. The characters are really unlikeable since the beginning except for DeNiro and Walken maybe. The wedding and hunting situation ends with moving moment where one guy is playing piano and others are staring at him.After long 65 minutes!!, the movie immediately moves to a village in Nam, where DeNiro shoots one VC and then meets his friends (what coincidence). There is no explanation of how they joined the army, how they got there, nothing. 10 seconds after meeting, few grenades explode outside the village and at this point the film immediately jumps again to a scene where our friends are imprisoned in a tiger cage in a VC camp. And again no explanation of what and how. While watching the Deer Hunter, I was getting the feeling that the movie is somehow ripped apart, incoherent.This brings me to another issue. I didn't find out what is the main story to follow. Is it the wedding and DeNiro's secret love to Meryl Streep? Is it the promise that DeNiro will never leave Walken in Nam? Is it about the way our friends deal with war? What is it? I think there should have been some main plot, otherwise it's difficult to follow the movie.DH contains heavy load of scenes which are unnecessarily long or unnecessary at all with meaningless dialogues. Consider for example the sequence where they argue about the boots before they go hunt. First of all, Cazale gets out of car and repeats five times: ""This is not it."" Then they eat, do mess, shout, fight for mustard, throw bags, waist beer and throw food again (Everyone who likes order must find it disturbing and I do). Then, Cazale asks DeNiro if he could borrow his boots. DeNiro says no. Cazale doesn't know if NO means NO or YES so they argue, DeNiro says Cazale forgets boots every time, Cazale says that DeNiro is gay, DeNiro says couple more times NO, friends wonder what is the matter with him and both Cazale and DeNiro end up angry. This lasts almost 10 minutes and every bit of the scene is meaningless! And impact of this scene? It has no impact on the story at all! Movie goes on after this and DeNiro and Cazale behave like nothing has happened. The editor could have cut out this scene and nobody would even notice! You don't see any explanation for what has just happened or what was DeNiro's motive to be so strict about the boots, but it's typical for the Deer Hunter. It is not like there is some room for you to guess how it could have happened. There are some serious story holes in the film.The scenes like these, especially wedding situation where 10 minutes would have sufficed, should have been reduced or deleted and Cimino should have paid more attention to explanatory scenes, which could have made the movie cohesive.Last problem I want to mention is the sound of Deer Hunter. Have anybody of you noticed too, that The Deer Hunter is pretty loud? I mean the voices of our characters are silent in comparison with the noise in the background (factory, wedding, Saigon...) and in order to hear the voices I had to keep volume on higher level, which has made watching the movie really uncomfortable for my ears. I actually loved quiet moments in DH.All in all, The Deer Hunter is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced in film watching. I gave one star more for DeNiro who was in spite of all the cons good as always.",The Deer Hunter
331,SnorriGodhi,"Major flaws, with a long movie wrapped around them",1,5 July 2006,"Clearly, there are many people who value this movie. I have no problem admitting that I just ""don't get it"" -- as long as those who like this movie are open to the idea that, just possibly, there is an elephant in the room that they are overlooking. Actually, from some other comments, it looks like some other people have seen the elephant, but think that it fits well into the room.My case rests on the fact that this is meant to be a ""serious"" movie, but I have had less trouble suspending disbelief with the X-Men than with this movie: if the main characters had escaped from the Vietcongs using their super-powers, that would have left me less uncomfortable than what I have seen in this movie.Some other IMDb reviewers have mentioned the extreme improbability of Nick making a living out of playing Russian roulette professionally. But the weirdness does not end there, because his buddy Michael returns to Vietnam to rescue him from his insanity. How? why, by playing Russian roulette with him, of course! You might think that this is the action least likely to bring the two of them back together to the USA -- and you would be right, because Nick shoots himself during the game. The way it looks to me is that Michael unwittingly ends Nick's successful career.The earlier escape scene is also absurd. It makes sense that Michael and Nick plan to escape by using the gun they are supposed to play Russian roulette with. It makes sense that they figure they need three bullets to escape. It might even make sense that, before starting to fire at the Vietcongs, they want to be sure that the next chamber has a bullet in it (although the way they make sure would mean a very likely failure for their plan, in real life). But why did the Vietcongs let them keep a gun with three bullets ready to be fired? The escape plan boils down to hoping that the Vietcongs will let them keep a loaded gun, if they survive Russian roulette. Nothing wrong with trying; but the scriptwriters should not have allowed them to survive both the odds of Russian roulette and the odds that at least one of the Vietcongs would use his brain.The Russian roulette scenes are surreal. Watching them, I could feel no suspense whatsoever, in spite of the characters screaming themselves hoarse: I simply could not suspend my disbelief. I had the uncomfortable feeling of missing something: perhaps they were playing some other game that looks a lot like Russian roulette, except that the person with the gun knows whether the next chamber has a cartridge in it. That might help to explain both the escape from the Vietcongs and Nick's survival as a professional player, but it would introduce other difficulties, such as Nick shooting himself.Now, all of the above comments are about the Russian roulette scenes, and it might be said that i am overlooking the rest of the movie: that this is not a war movie, but a movie about the trauma of war. Maybe so, but suppose that you had seen the movie without the Russian roulette scenes: would you think that the movie could be improved by adding a few silly scenes?For me, the addition of silly scenes means that i must take away one or two points from my rating. My rating is already pretty low because I ""don't get"" the rest of the movie, and in addition because I had high expectations for this movie and was disappointed; so i am giving the minimum rating to the movie as a whole.",The Deer Hunter

336,em-632-781000,"Sad, beautiful film.",9,23 July 2012,"This film always breaks my heart, and it does it on a number of levels. All the joys and sorrows are there in these characters, all their longings. Nick, who liked the way the trees looked. Beautifully acted by a young and handsome Robert Deniro, and a radiantly beautiful Meryl Streep, still in her twenties when the film was made. Chris Walken's benchmark performance that is so memorable. All of them so young, and at the top of their game as actors, immersed so completely in their roles. America in transition, and involved in a war that no one really understands. Having worn the uniform during that period of time, having been to some of those places, although not in combat, but still physically there, with life running through you like electricity, you feel a kinship with those characters, and you remember when every soldier wanted to look like DeNiro, with his beret and trench coat, and neatly pressed uniform. War is the crucible where all these emotions are melted together, a terrible war, as all wars are, that continue to claim casualties long after the last shot is fired. The music score, the casting, and the direction are all excellent. A truly worthwhile film. Here's to Nick and Mike, and all the boys who fought that war, especially those who didn't come home. See this film.",The Deer Hunter
337,redeagle717,Awful- hardly a classic,9,16 January 2006,"I have no clue why this film was received so well. It has nothing going for it. There is hardly anything strong in Christopher Walken's acting, he had a very short performance- why did he win the Oscar? I can't see the point of the movie. The only point that was really illustrated was that people who come out of the Vietnam War were, for the most part, screwed up and brain washed. The wedding sequence is incredibly boring, it is truly a film about trailer trash America, and it seems that Robert DeNiro is the only one who shows good acting along with Meryl Streep. The only scenes that really give the film any hope, are the deer hunting scenes in which incredible choral music is heard. This film is not great- but it isn't bad.",The Deer Hunter
338,solitaryman2,The shocking analysis of a loss.,10,8 February 2000,"Cimino doesn't picture the war directly, yet ""The Deer Hunter"" is the most profound film about war of all times. Maybe it's just because the war is so untellable in its atrocity that Cimino prefers to underline apparently external aspects of the Vietnam tragedy. Anyway no war-movie has been more poignant and shocking than this one and not only thanks to the performances of Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken but above all for the magniloquent and passionate direction of Michael Cimino, who concentrate the narration on the sense of inevitability of loss and does it through unforgettable sequences (the wedding, the Russian roulette), which render the movie extraordinarily exciting. To be brief, one of the best and most important movie of ever.",The Deer Hunter
339,joe_momma9,The Ultimate Guy Movie,9,4 February 2006,"The Deer Hunter is, and will forever be, the ultimate guy movie. I'm not saying the ladies wouldn't enjoy it. I think The Deer Hunter has some qualities to it (mainly the performance of Meryl Streep) that women would appreciate, however, not on the level that a guy would. And it doesn't matter who you are, male female, if you were not on the edge of your seat clinching the arm rests during the Russian roulette scenes, check your pulse! That was the fastest my heart has ever raced during a movie. The movie has only one flaw; the wedding reception scene went on way too long. The editors could've cut at least five minutes from that scene. Intense and emotional, The Deer Hunter continues to move audiences even after almost 30 years since its release.",The Deer Hunter

I rented this movie expecting another amazing Meryl Streep performance, but got much more than that.""The Deer Hunter"" is an emotionally powerful film about normal men who went to war and their lives were changed forever after it. Not only is Meryl Streep in this film, but so is one of the greatest actors of all-time, Robert De Niro. When you have 2 amazing actors together in one film, it is bound to be excellent. Also in this film is a very young Christopher Walken, John Savage and John Cazale (this film is the last out of 5 films he made). I like War films a lot. My favorite war films are Vietnam films (for what reason, I don't know). Out of every Vietnam film I saw, this is the most powerful, saddest, yet beautiful one out of all of them (and there are so many great Vietnam films). It shows what happens to innocent people when they are forced into the horrors of war. It's heavy, emotional, and ... well, I know i've called it this word many times in this review, but it's beautiful. Plain and simple. It is definitely worth your time. 10/10",The Deer Hunter
341,HomieG,Accurate and sad depiction of life during and after the Vietnam War.,10,24 July 2001,"The Deer Hunter concerns a group of deer-hunting friends in Pittsburgh, PA who work in a steel mill.  Their lives rapidly change, however, when they're all drafted for the Vietnam War.  Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken (who won an academy award for his work in this film) are two of the main buddies in the War taking place before them.  This film won the Best Picture Oscar in 1979 and rightfully so.  One of the most memorable parts of the movie is the Russian Roulette scenes which create some of the most tension ever for a drama.  After ""The Deer Hunter"", director Michael Cimino unfortunately struck out with his bomb effort ""Heaven's Gate"" which lost tons of money and was panned by critics. 10/10",The Deer Hunter
342,Deimos-remus,Very tedious.,5,26 July 2010,"I borrowed this DVD from the library . I had pretty high expectations, considering all of the rave reviews, it being heralded as one of the best war movies of all time, and the fact that it won some Oscar awards. Instead I was treated to seeing a 3 and a half hour long melodrama, where every single scene was dragged out as long as possible.I know that this film was more about the effect war had on soldiers, their friends and family, as opposed to being in combat, like most other war films, which is why most of the film took place at the home front, rather than on the battlefield. The film was basically divided into 3 parts. The first focused on the main characters, and their relationships, and should have been dedicated to developing the characters, but instead you have to endure watching over an hour and a half of people dancing at a wedding. I constantly found myself fast-forwarding through scenes like these. Another example of this tedious style, is the scene where the guys are driving down the highway, and they pretend to ditch one of their friends. You then have to watch the car drive off way out in to the distance, turn around to come back, only to start it all over again, 2 or 3 times. Moving on to the Vietnam war, this film makes you think that the whole war experience is about playing Russian Roulette. Flashing forward, De Niro's character comes back from the war for a short period of time, only to go back to try and find his two friends, and you're forced to believe that Walken's character has been surviving for who know how long, playing Russian Roulette in a fighting ring.What I find extremely funny about the high status the film has, is the fact the film's director, Cimino, was universally panned for his film, ""Heaven's Gate"", which is directed in the exact same dragged out style. I'm just glad I didn't have waste any money to watch this film, however, my time wasted will never be refunded.",The Deer Hunter

345,phoeniks-1,A major work,10,14 May 2007,"Michael Ciminos masterful movie remains to this day a disturbing and truly compelling story about the experience of war and the importance of friendship. Without doubt a milestone in American cinema and perhaps among the ten best films of the 1970's! The cast alone is exploding: De Niro is fascinating to watch as the sensitive but ultimately strong Michael, who manages to hold the remains together, but Meryl Streep, John Gazale and particularly Christopher Walken are equally great! Perhaps to a lesser extent a movie about the anatomy of war (maybe ""Apocalypse Now"" is a greater film in that specific regard?!) and to the greatest extent a story about the necessity of being loyal to your friends despite the obstacles from an outside power. Maybe Cimino try a bit to much for pathos in the epic moments, whereas he succeeds to the fullest in the passages of describing the strong bond between the men, especially between De Niro and Savage's off course. In any event, it is a remarkable movie that does not show its age. I think the movie will remain as fresh as it is today for another 30 years! At least!",The Deer Hunter
346,jackamccallum,Great Film with Incredible Second and Third Act but Let Down by its First,8,31 May 2019,The Deer Hunter is a great piece of cinema no doubt and is superbly directed by Michael Cimino but that is not to say it is not without flaws. The first act of the film which revolves around before and after a wedding among the main characters and their friends goes for an hour with only ordinary dialogue and minimal character development there to keep people entertained. However t does provide a purpose to introduce us to the characters and make the audience care about them but it surely could have been done in at most half an hour. I am one who personally doesn't mind long movies and can sit through a lot but the first part of the film I struggled with. The second act however in Vietnam has one of the most tense scenes in cinematic history: the infamous Russian roulette scene. The tension of who could die at any second and how our hero's will escape is nail biting. Robert De Niro's performance in this film is breathtaking with the rage and loss and sadness being apparent in his face in any given scene. In the Russian roulette scene you can feel the hatred seeping out of him towards his captors and the result is truly incredible. Christopher Walken also holds his own against De Niro but subtly shows his thoughts and emotions until the third act of the film where they all come pouring out in a truly horrifying way. The third Act while not as good as the second is still gripping and brutal and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fallout of the second act is truly haunting and seeing the results it has had to the characters you've gotten to know over the course of the film is devastating. The Deer Hunter is by no means a perfect film but is still an important part of cinema's history with incredible acting especially by Robert De Niro and a gripping and depressing tale about the effects the Vietnam war had on America.,The Deer Hunter

When this film came out I went with some friends to the cinema to watch it. I had no idea what the film was about, I did not know any of the actors. I was too young what did I know?After I left the cinema I felt overwhelmed by this huge film. I thought the acting was absolutely fantastic (apart from Meryl Streep, who I never liked in any role).Robert De Niro was for me the best actor ever after this film.I have seen the film several times more, also recently. It still brings the same emotions. Still very much overwhelmed, but also confused, sad. My feelings about the performances of the De Niro and Streep did not change either over the years. But obviously not just De Niro was fantastic in this film.John Savage and Christopher Walken were heartbreaking! And what about John Cazale?

DeNiro is perfection, and should have won an Oscar for this. I think Voight won this year, but I'm not sure. I don't think this won Best Picture, and I can't understand why. Everyone was marvelous, as always, including Meryl STreep. Her ex-boyfriend, Cazel, was wonderful. What a great actor he was. Seeing him reminds me of how great he was in Dog Day.

350,TheRagingBull94,A True Masterpiece Worth Cherishing For Decades To Come,10,23 May 2011,"Anybody who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema and has not seen The Deer Hunter, I urge you to stop reading this review right now and go rent or buy the movie. The reason I say this is because The Deer Hunter is simply one of the best movies ever made and acts as a constant reminder to me for why we as people go to see movies. To be taken out of our world, be entertained in any way, and by the end feel refreshed, educated or stimulated in whatever the aspect.The plot follows a group of Russian-American industrial workers in a small town. Our main characters are Michael (Robert De Niro) and Nick (Christopher Walken), two close friends who love deer hunting and drinking. The first hour or so of the film does not move the narrative forward but is reserved for character development. The wedding and hunting sequences both work well in establishing these characters and how they act in their world. We grow to understand them and feel involved as an audience.The rest of the film chronicles their experiences in the Vietnam war and the aftermath. The second and third act are for contrast with what the characters were like during the first act. It ultimately gives us an important message about how war effects people, but this film goes one step further and also examines how war can effect family and friends on the homefront. Linda (Meryl Streep) is the primary example of this. A beautiful, young woman forced to accept the losses of close friends due to a conflict that she didn't want anything to do with.What also should be noted is the excellence of Michael Cimino's direction. Some criticize the movie for being slow moving, but I've always felt that the movie goes by all too quickly and it's 3 hours long! Cimino appropriately makes the dramatic scenes emotional and the violent scenes terribly shocking, but ultimately compelling. It's a shame that he never hit these levels in his future works, but it does demonstrate his overall directorial potential.It's a film about the negative impacts of war as a whole and the message isn't limited to just Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is extremely well acted, well directed, well written, powerful and sad, but it ultimately leaves you with a great feeling. One of amazement and envy. It deserved the Best Picture award rightfully so. This movie is an absolute masterpiece and I simply cannot recommend it more. 10/10.",The Deer Hunter

352,dpaterson-2,US Govt / Pentagon Propaganda,1,4 March 2021,"The Russian Roulette charade gives us a big hint as to why Michael Cimino would con United Artists into giving him For Knox to produce Heaven's Gate -- his final catastrophe. He lies, mainly to himself, about who he is and what he's doing. The roulette scene is the most intense in the film for most people, and it is a fraud, a lie, and a flagrant. Total invention of history -- a history we will have to continue to revisit because of films like this. Remember, Cimino said he was in the Vietnam catastrophe. There was only one people truly suffering in this Govt/Corporate war for profit and rank advancement -- the Vietnamese. Three million of them died, countless more suffered horrific injuries, and the country to this very day continues to repair the countryside and land that US munitions made in some areas unlivable for decades. I tip my hat to US veterans, among whom Cimino was NOT one, though he claimed to be. A liar for life. Real Vietnam vets got horribly used in a policy that was doomed from the February 1965 beginning, from the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and from the US turning down Ho Chi Minh's appeal for peace directly after WWII. Because Johnson and Nixon were bigger liars by far than Cimino.",The Deer Hunter

I never got a chance to see it all the way thru. I had to have the tape back before I had a chance to finish it.  I recently purchased it on DVD because of what little I remembered of it years ago and because I fell asleep during its first viewing.  I just watched it on DVD..... and again, I almost fell asleep.  DiNiro was great, as usual and so was Streep. I would never say this movie ""sucked"" or was bad but I have to say, it seemed SO slow to me.  I mean, an hour of footage at the wedding was just too much.  I really don't see what the fuss was all about.

Any film that runs three hours or more had better have a good reason for it...this one, simply put, had no reason at all.This film is just BEGGING to be cut, with tons of unnecessary footage that makes each scene seem drawn-out and tedious. It's almost as though the director was trying to make this a long movie. What made it even worse was the gritty and unpleasant nature of most of the film, which creates viewer unease that the film length only protracts. Sheesh.

358,Danherb,Touching drama about the ruin of a group of men's friendship by war,9,30 June 2005,"""The Deer Hunter"" is not a film about the Vietnam war, as it is wrongly said in many cases.""The Deer Hunter"" is a film tells the story of 3 friends within about 5-6 years, during which their friendship is repeatedly put to the test.It is primarily a picture of the contemporary life of a group of people around 30 living in a small American town during the Vietnam war.The first hour of the film portrays the every day life of three friends Mike (De Niro), Steven (Savage) and Nick (Walken), who look forward to Steve's wedding but at the same time have to prepare for their commitment in Vietnam. The main actors (above all De Niro and Walken) perfectly picture the character's inner conflict between their easygoing home town life and the forthcoming assignment in Vietnam. Despite this conflict the characters don't show their concerns to their environment.Particularly Nick is worried about him and his friends leaving his home town and perhaps never coming back, but he only tells his best friend Mike of his thoughts, who is much more resolute and sees their engagement as a strong masculine act.Cimino manages to show the simple irrationality of young men, going to a senseless war from which they might never return for the only purpose of glory and approval, and abandoning their settled and happy life for it. The spectator just can't understand why those young men voluntarily sign for the army and give up everything they have. The passage from the small-town-idyll to the war cruelty is greatly pictured. Cimino does not show the three friends' way to Vietnam or the training, he immediately switches from a happy get-together to the cruel war captivity of the Vietcong. This passage perfectly underlines the contrast and the inexplicability of the three men's actions.Although the passage that is set in Vietnam is only about one third of the whole film long, the war is omnipresent at any time, which is probably the best benefit of the whole film, Cimino does not need to bomb the spectator with pictures of crying children, mutilated soldiers or desert battlefields in order to illustrate the cruelty of war. Far from it! The changed behavior of all characters after the friends' returns tell more about wars' capability of changing someone's life, than anything else.And the fact that the many dreams that these three friends had before they went to Vietnam didn't come true, because of their longing for recognition by becoming an acclaimed veteran can even pluck your heartstrings.Cimino's great directing and the cast's awesome acting provide for a touching and honest drama about the friendship of a group of young men, that is destroyed by the Vietnam war.",The Deer Hunter

The movie was so boring but i thought it would pick up and it never did. a good chunk of the movie is a wedding scene with almost no dialogue. They shouldn't called this movie wedding rehearsals,3 minutes of deer hunting, 10 minutes of war and an ending that just pisses you right off. This is by far the most over rated movie of its time, excluding blade runner a decade later. There is almost no real entertainment to be had in this film. The messages of the movie are cliché's about how war changes people but its been done much better other films. If you want to sit there for over 2 hours and watch a tedious wedding rehearsal with a few minutes of actual content then you'll love this, if your not then avoid this like the plague and just watch the 5 minute trailer everything that this movie has to offer is shown in the trailer on the DVD, including the ""surprise"" ending.",The Deer Hunter
360,Andyh74,Unorthodox masterpiece,10,6 March 2000,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS REVEALED!!!I felt that ""The Deer Hunter"" is a disturbing and unique film because of how the effects of the Vietnam War are portrayed.  The one thing that I admire about Michael Cimino here is that he had the courage (in my opinion) to throw out parts of the story that he felt had nothing to do with the points he wished to make.  For example, Cimino includes no concrete information as to why Nick, Mike, and Steven (played by Christopher Walken, Robert De Niro, and John Savage, respectively) are going to Vietnam, because he isn't concerned with WHY these men went to Vietnam.  Cimino is concerned with WHAT happened (physically and mentally) to these men once they experienced the war, and so he makes a daring decision to bolster his themes and statements at the expense of character motivation.  Cimino's methods of storytelling are very unorthodox but gutsy moves on how to tell a story in an American film, since normally in a film we expect to see what motivates the characters, and here Cimino violates so-called bedrock rules about narrative in American film.  Also, we see the psychological changes in Nick, Steve, and Mike through their actions after the war, not through espousions of philosophy about the war.The Russian roulette scenes are very powerful, even more so during the climax, since it is near the end of the war and yet the contest is still being staged for betting spectators.  The scene evokes for me images of the Roman Empire putting Christians to death for their amusement while Nero's Rome burns, and therefore it's very disturbing and a bit unsettling.  Also, there's the curious fact that Nick, Steve, and Mike are Russian-Americans playing Russian roulette.Finally, I have a theory about the film.  If you use your imagination and think about Mike's feelings towards 1) the theory of ""one shot"" as it applies to the war and to deer hunting; and 2) Nick's girlfriend Linda (wonderful Meryl Streep), and combine these thoughts with what happens in the film, the film emerges with a new theme.Superb acting by all, unorthodox but inventive directing by Cimino, and great cinematography/music, make ""The Deer Hunter"" a unique must-see.",The Deer Hunter

Some people complain about the first hour of this film as boring, but not me. It sets all the backstories and what the characters are like perfectly.

The effects shown on the characters is what we see on returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regardless war is still the same and has lasting effects on the participants just as this movie shows. The acting is good because they are all professionals in the true sense of the word. The script is good because all of it is true to some degree for veterans of the Vietnam debacle. the scenes are authentic-. Racist against Vietnamese-it is what it was.

364,Marty L.,Real people in Reel life,10,18 September 1998,"Michael Cimino's ""The Deerhunter"" is, quite simply, a masterpiece that ranks as one of the greatest films of all time.  The strength of this movie does not lie in its subject matter (as we all know, Vietnam movies are a dime a dozen), but in the presentation.  The characters are all *real* people. Conversations are natural and fluid, and actions are believable because the characters have been portrayed as capable of carrying them out.  Also, they *look* like real people.  They sweat, they are rumpled, etc. All performances in the movie are wonderful, standing out are Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, and of course, the MAN, Robert De Niro. 
The movie flows very naturally, while the plot structure is not wholly open, it does not have the artificial, closed structure that is commonplace in Hollywood movies.  This allows you to accept the film as a real course of events, ""real"" life which becomes ""reel"" life.  The movie is long and at points slow, but this is not a weakness.  The strength of the film is that it does not simply manipulate emotions to elicit a response.  It is subtle and touching, and rather than being shown how you should feel, you come to an understanding with the characters on your own.  You empathize, not just sympathize.  You have to be in the mood to sit through ""The Deerhunter"", but if you do, you won't regret it.",The Deer Hunter

De Niro is my favorite actor. The cast and the acting were great, but this movie was interminably slow. Three hours could have easily been shortened to about 100 minutes. The wedding scene went on for days. The Vietnam scenes were very good and the scenes with Nicky were great, but I could never sit through that again. I can see why Cimino had a reputation for indulgence.",The Deer Hunter

Douchebag one returns home to continue living the redneck life and steal Doughebag 2's girlfriend; Douchebag 2 can't find his way off the war set, gives up and shoots himself in the head; Douchebag 3 returns home and doesn't speak another coherent sentence for the remainder of the movie.

The one thing I really liked about the Deer Hunter was the bond and obligation that soldiers have for one and other and I feel that no other movie has accomplished that quite like Deer Hunter. Go into it with that perspective and it's like no other movie about war that has ever been made.",The Deer Hunter
370,Baker0927,"A ""One Good Scene"" Type of Movie",5,24 November 2017,"Just got finished watching this movie for the first time ever. For years, I had heard nothing but great things about ""The Deer Hunter"", such as it's a masterpiece, a classic, etc. Because of this, I went into this film with high expectations and was sorely disappointed with what I had seen.""The Deer Hunter"" is one of those films that has one (maybe two) fantastic scenes and the rest of the picture is complete rubbish. A similar film is Inglorious Basterds (another war epic) with the opening scene at the farm being terrific but the rest of the film is just awful. In this sense, The Deer Hunter reminded me a lot of Inglorious Basterds. The Russian Roulette sequence in the Vietcong hut is absolutely breathtaking- the acting is high caliber, the tension is through the roof, the cinematography perfect. This scene is one of the best in film history. However, this one scene cannot cover the other, various issues that plague the film such as meandering plot, useless and overlong (way overlong) wedding scene, annoying characters, unsatisfying ending, choppy editing (Oscar for Best Film Editing, seriously?), and unwarranted three hour run-time. The entire first hour is a poor and overlong build up to the fantastic Russian Roulette scene in Vietcong hut. After this scene, movie goes nowhere for another 2 hours.I understand this was the first Vietnam movie to come out in the wake of the Vietnam war. As such, it struck a chord and was a big deal in 1978. However, outside of one scene I cannot say that I really found this to be an enjoyable or even a thought-provoking war movie like Platoon (1986) or Full Metal Jacket (1987). Ironically enough, the first Vietnam movie to be made is the one that had the least impact, at least for me. 5/10 stars for the Russian Roulette scene only.",The Deer Hunter
371,kenorton-246-495155,The classic movie about war and man,10,2 February 2020,"First, I am a veteran of the Vietnam War. Second, I have watched this movie at least 10 times and learned something new each time. Yeah, there are flaws. The hunting scenes are in Washington, not Pennsylvania. Many of the Vietnamese in the movie are played by Thais. No, Russian roulette was not a part of the war. But, that is pale compared to the real horror of the Vietnam War. The movie, thanks to Michael Cimino, captures the disgusting realism of the war - from the crowded streets of Saigon, reeking of God-awful food, urine, feces, marijuana smoke and the pathetic, almost pre-historic ignorance and living conditions of the people of Vietnam to the total effect it had on our soldiers, ruining their lives and that of their families. The depiction may err in some areas, but the gut-wrenching feeling you get while watching it is real. And, having worked in and around the VA hospitals for years as a sales rep I can say authoritatively that as awful as it was in the movie, in real life it is much worse. You should see this film if you are a veteran or a member of a family of a veteran of Vietnam and understand more those whose names are on the wall and those who have somehow recovered, many with lifelong disabilities. And those of us like myself, who have suffered the effects of Agent Orange, a herbicide that the government knew was going to poison our troops and did it anyway, have pity. And for all the kids out there who love to play video games where you kill and then are killed yourself but just re-boot to get a new life - you need to see what real war is and the effect it has on everyone.",The Deer Hunter

Meryl Streep, John Savage, Robert De Nero and Christopher Walken are exceptional. This film took out so many awards at the time it was released and deservingly so.

In this regard, the tale is astoundingly successful, and the long, but unceasingly moving journey through the lives of several young people from the steel mills of Pennsylvania to the killing grounds of Vietnam and back again, brings to mind similar epics such as the immensely lauded Once Upon a Time In America.Eerily realistic performances by the cast of early career Hollywood stars (Walken's hospital scene in particular), punctuated by the achingly beautiful score by Stanley Meyers make The Deer Hunter a timeless classic, a must-see on any movie lover's list.",The Deer Hunter

This movie is about a few blue collar workers who go to vietnam to join the war. For one thing, the Direction and Screenplay are horrible! With such a boring plot, you can't even feel for the characters for what they go through. It's too long unecessarily and shows us a one sided perspective of the Vietnam War. It also has too many sidestories which ruins the pace of the movie. I would suggest you to skip this Garbage. Not worth watching!",The Deer Hunter

However, slowly, the more I think about it the less cynical I become. You can't fault the first Russian roulette scene - just a great summary of what war probably feels like, making it hit closer to home and feel more real than any battle scene ever could. I suppose the film nicely demonstrates the way the Vietnam War caused irreversible damage to communities and friend groups. It's a pretty unique perspective of the war compared to that of other films like FMJ, Platoon, or AN.That said though, I wasn't particularly hooked throughout most of my viewing, and I didn't think I felt as connected to the characters as the film wanted me to be. That half-hour long wedding scene ate up too much of the runtime, and although necessary, it didn't do a good job of investing me in the rest of the story. Just cause a movie's a slow-burn classic doesn't mean I'll absolutely love it by default.Looks like another film that made me feel inadequate in the sense that I finish it, mentally note a 7.5/10, and then see all my mutuals unanimously rate it a 10.

Yes, it's pretty long, but it's worth watching every minute. De Niro at his finest. If you don't know whether to rent this or say, Showtime, well, maybe you don't know much about movies. The music is perfect in setting the mood. It's even got some humor in it. So sit back, relax, and get ready to see one of the films that attempts to show what it was really like in that war, although perhaps no one can really tell you what it was like, unless you were in it.",The Deer Hunter

I enjoy movies about real people, and much of Deer Hunter is devoted to making the characters and their relationships genuine. But that's not what made it big.Christopher Walken makes my blood run cold every time I even think of the movie, two years now since I saw it.  My God he was so scary that I thank you every day that I was born too late to go to Vietnam.

As the story unfolds, we see the film isn't about 'deer hunting' at all, but about the tragic consequences of the Vietnam War. Three of the main characters, Michael, Steven and Nick become captured by the Vietcong, and are forced to play Russian roulette, where bets are made on their survival. Eventually, most manage to make a close and gripping escape, but are suffering from terrible, emotional and physical stress. Michael later returns to Saigon to fulfill an old vow to one of his friends who was forced to stay behind, making a horrific discovery. It's a situation where Michael will either return home with his friend, or return home alone!The film, although extremely harrowing, will stay with you long after the film has finished, and is a genuine achievement in film making history!!Well done to the director!!!",The Deer Hunter
384,ohthatgigi,i love you bay-bie!,10,27 April 2014,"Without conflating the movie itself to a higher cause of anti violence and caustic tirade of American's reckless and disproportionate decision of Vietnam war, I think deer hunter is The most well-made war movie I've ever seen, for its sheer richness of emotional depiction of each character in the movie, which further correlated to the audience and induce psycal analysis which transcends the movie in every possible way. One thing about war genre is that director can be obsessed with the infeasible idea of depicting the cruelty of as many people as possible, but deer hunter has no such ambition, it simply tells us a story between three blue-collar workers' life, totally changed by the harrowing war. But the pain is self explanatory, it is simply out there that we automatically internalize it without the necessity of the movie itself conflating it to the dark nature of humanity and warfare.Normally, what kind of director have the guts to hold the camera steadily to a wedding for so long unabashedly, to meticulously and objectively observe every particulars and trivia happened there, thus allow the audience themselves to see each character's mindset and personality, each sparks and subtle fermentation between those young people, each encounters reflective of their unpreparedness of life and more solemnly and impending, the war, each purposeless and dare-devil machismo's ludicrousness, which only serve to contrast the utter atrocity and macabre of the war and even make the former seem juvenile and pediatric. The movie moves slowly as if it has all the time in the world, and it is about to show us the deeper reality between figures, we see Michale has this huge impulse to kiss Linda but his restrained it, this two-second moments has more romantic tension than all your contemporary New York City love stories can ever get in sum, and its not a punch in the stomach, we always sorta of getting it, Meryl's role in this dabble and cul-de-sac town is a marvel to everyone, she's vulnerable and delicate, has a drunkard abusive father yet she can maintain her breathtaking grace and have fun with her friends, she is meant to be something that has the chemical so powerful to change the route of the movie. We also see a grim-faced veteran sitting taciturnly at the bar, refusing to engage in the tumultuous and cheerful background, and the drunk crowd's amazing numbness show their unpreparedness an ignorance of the war, they have zero knowledge of what could be after them, possibly because of their youth and stupidity, but more likely because of their subconscious refusal to think about what is awaiting their far away from home, that's why when they are so heavily drunk and running naked on the street, they promised each other of never letting each other alone in the war,its a bit of martyred romanticism and adolescent promise, but its still effectively spellbinding immediately and Michale did realize its promise. And I really just enjoy the way they sang together in a bar playing snooker, ChristopheR Walken has such a style, as alway.The whole movie's opening is linear, chronically developed with steady pace without letting one single shot being wasted or redundant, shows us each person's traits and prebolds their destiny. The crowd's bantering and even verbal altercation on their deer hunting shoot ed in such a joyous way, that I simply give up my compulsory psychoanalysis and just enjoy their dialog, this part could have worked as a audio-book. It's natural, plain and very characteristic, with the composing foggy sceneries of the valley, the happiness ofcommaraderies between the crowd is escalated to a ecclesiastic level, more like a ritual for them to re communicate and re unionize. Michale's stubbornness and his swerving principle has always accompanied him, (if he refused to lend a pair of boots, he wont do it), and that's probably another reason why Michale turned into a resolute and granite soldier with an uncompromising and courageous spine, though going through the same ordeal as nick and Stevie, he's the only one who still has the strength to try, try to assimilate himself into the old small town lifestyle, still has the power to purge the harrowing and slit-throat memories out of his brain while nick and Stevie had succumbed themselves to the inflictions and haunted fears, one physically and one mentally. Of course the most carving image of deer hunter is the notorious Russian roulette, probably the most nerve cracking moments on big screen with exactitude and genuine that I can barely watch through, which is the award-winning moments for Christopher walken as he gradually has a nerve breakdown under the audience's eyes. But the when the war ended, this sort of gambling is continued, thus I'm not sure if the director is predominantly inclined to flagellate the inhumanities of war, but how the war can bring changes to innocent individuals, with the side dish of the classic gravitas of war. Seriously I don't particularly see deer hunter as a war movie, but a movie consistently and continuously spanned around three friends' lives, from one of them's wedding to another's funeral, war is just one of the many important event that happened in their lives, the accentuation is surely not the war, it's the influence it has upon normal small-town human being, the antiwar sensation is something we can possibly deduce from the particulars of the movie, it never is the central topic, and it's the way I love to depict the war.",The Deer Hunter
385,david-86864,One of the best films ever,10,22 May 2016,"This film is one of the most watched movies of my life, not just because it reminds me so much of my own Pennsylvania upbringing, but because of the masterpiece that it is. Unquestionably flawless in its theme, choice of actors, music, script, and accent on locations, the story well displays the great, great sacrifice of the blue collar community borne out of a sort of naive love of God and country.It was my fortune, in the early 70s, to be skipping from one African and Middle Eastern port to another as a Navy seaman where skirmishes were near nonexistent in that part of the world. Iraq was unknown to Americans then. While I experienced rough waters and hurricanes at sea, in another part of the globe, U.S. soldiers were serving in the killing fields of Vietnam. Not one single man did we lose, compared to the large number of casualties in Nam.Cavatina, the moving soundtrack written by Stanley Myers and performed by John Williams, adds immensely to the film. Its tenderness fills scenes where loss and hardship saturate the atmosphere to carry with it a sense of hope and restoration.Robert De Niro is the strength of the story, the glue that keeps all the parts connected, and he plays that part superbly. This role made him a legend in the industry, beyond the fame he acquired from acting the younger Don Corleone in ""The Godfather"". Sadly, these days, I see him in far too many lifeless films. They have no equal depth, which is what I look for from him.Meryl Streep and her, at that time, boyfriend, John Cazale, appeared to have no relationship at all. That part of their real lives was well hidden and a surprise to discover months later. So heartbreaking was Cazale's death due to cancer shortly after the finish of this movie. Throughout, Streep was beautiful in appearance and character.John Savage (Stephen), as a quadriplegic, was most convincing, as was his wife, Rutanya Alda (Angela), the disheartened silent victim of circumstance. Christopher Walken, the winner of the best actor in a supporting role for his portrayal of Nick, the mentally ill drug addict and suicide prone member of the trio, was well deserved. One question surfaces regarding Nick: just where did he find the insight to send his winnings to Stephen who was staying in the VA nursing home? My recommendation is to view this film numerous times through the years. Its impact will remain with you throughout your life.",The Deer Hunter
386,vaneyck,As great as ever,10,12 June 2002,"I've now seen this film three times with a decade or more between viewings, and every time I see it I come away feeling that movies can't get any better than this.  People always comment on the Viet Nam scenes, and it's true that they are as powerful and intense as any war scenes ever filmed.  The Russian-roulette betting game, in both its up-river and Saigon venues, may be the most riveting, shattering plot device ever invented, as measured by the pounding of the heart. But it's the 'home front' scenes that stick with me through the years.  I think all the steel town scenes are nearly perfect, untoppable.  And that very much includes the Eastern Orthodox wedding and its sequel.  When anyone tells me they were bored I just shake my head.  There's no arguing with short and shallow attention spans.  You're either capable of appreciating art or you're not.   I do have a quibble or two.  The deer-hunting scenes looked like nowhere I've ever seen in Pennsylvania, or anywhere else East of the Rockies.  I think Cimino deliberately picked an ethereal location above the clouds as a contrast to the steel town.  When John Cazale and the others get loaded and act like jerks it jars on Michael, because they have brought the stupid distractions of ordinary life to an extraordinary place.  This would matter less if the 'genius loci' were not so strongly present in the other home front scenes. I wish he had used the soft, green forested hills of Pennsylvania for the hunting.  And some of the dialogue--Meryl Streep's in particular--wouldn't work on the page, and only first-rate acting by an inspired ensemble--has there ever been a better cast of young actors?--pulls it off.  But these are forgivable errors in one of the finest films ever made.",The Deer Hunter
387,Vike-3,best Vietnam film to date,9,11 May 2001,"It's not the greatest film of all time, maybe not even the 113th greatest film of all time, but it is the best movie made of the effects of the Vietnam War on average individuals to date.  While most Vietnam movies dwell on the absurdness of war and continue to trot out the fact that most, if not all, Vietnam veterans are ticking time bombs ready to explode, director Cimino chose instead to concentrate on the development of three characters (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) before, during, and after the war.Before: If I got the plot right, I think one of the characters from the Pennsylvania town the movie is set in got drafted.  His friends felt bad from him and so a few them decided to enlist, but only two qualified for the army (except the character played by Cazale--in his final role--who is too absorbed in himself to want to go to Vietnam.) In case something does happen in Vietnam, the characters partake in some of life pleasures before they go. The opening hour of the movie consists of Steve's (Savage) wedding and Cimino beautifully shows the traditions of a small Russian community, without making them seem strange to an average viewer (the only other movies with small town traditions seem to be those lame ""the town is actually cult"" films.)  After the wedding all the friends go hunting deer for one last time before the three main characters go off to Vietnam.  Everybody has a good time, and they all avoid hurting each others feelings and only playfully tease each other.  Mike, Steve, and Nick all think Vietnam will be sort of an exotic ""hunt.""During: Mike becomes a killing machine who is just focused on destroying the Viet Cong (or anyone Vietmenese who happens to be in the area.)  He doesn't even stop to talk to Steve and Nick in a chance encounter, and when the three end up as POWs he gets upset at Steve reluctance to play Russian Roulete when they are paired against each other.  He does have good intentions though and manages to comfort his two friends and orchestrate a breakout from the abysaml prison camp. (Note: there are no documented records of Russian Roulete actually taking place in Vietnam).  During the escape everyone gets seperated, Steve becomes paralyzed and Nick (Walken in his Oscar winning role) makes his way through the diplomatic and physical horrors of Vietnam before stumbling into organized Russian Roullette.After:  Mike is the only one who returns home, and everyone treats him as a John Wayne-ish war hero.  However, Mike is ashamed that he shot innocent civilians and let military matters interfere with his friendships. He tries to take advantage of Nick's abscence by courting his girlfriend (Streep) but just ends up feeling guilty.  He goes hunting with his homelocked buddies but can't bring himself to shoot deer anymore.  He wants people to stop congratualting him for his patriotism.  Eventually Mike tries to get Steve and Nick back in hopes that he can carry on before like nothing ever happened, but each one doesn't want to leave his own post-war world.The ""God Bless America"" ending is kind of disappointing, but the movie is well worth the 3 1/2 spend.",The Deer Hunter

393,SidelinePictures,The Deer Hunter: The Best 'Nam' Film Of All Time,10,23 August 2007,"'The Deer Hunter' will amaze the audience, hands down, on the extremely dangerous, yet realistic events that the characters portrayed by Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage, and John Cazale's emotional characters go through before, during, and after the Vietnam War. For all them are very close hunting buddies from Pennsylvania, until they must endure the horrific experiences of bloody battle, right after a cheerful wedding no less. It leaves them scarred internally and externally, letting you feel their pain and hardships. That is what makes a great war movie, let alone a drama. The acting is right on the money, as to how a real person would feel and react toward their situation, not just some written down character in a script. It is extremely realistic, giving you the full experience of this motion picture. Christopher Walken won his very first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this amazing film, and he deserved it too.You haven't seen Russian Roulette on screen until you watch this movie. My heart pounded as well as yours, I'm sure, during a suspenseful Russian Roulette scene as if the gun was pointed to my head. You will walk away remembering that feeling and that scene forever. This classic drama is fantastic to say the least, for the determination of friendship holds strong, even after heart-breaking events. The after math of the war is as raunchy as the war itself, due to the crucial bonds that have been broken, and the love that lingers alone. And when legendary actors including Merryl Streep pour their hearts into these roles, it is nothing but entertaining. Overall 'The Deer Hunter' is a Vietnam War masterpiece, and the best of its genre, no question.",The Deer Hunter

Well it s really funny how can people give this a 10 and some of the say that people that disliked this movie are MTV viewers?''The worst blind is the one that choose not to see.I m giving a 2 because despite all these problems the main characters are performed by great actors and that s the only good thing about the movie.",The Deer Hunter

But what I need to say is that these guys supposedly live in Pennsylvania. Yet, after short car rides, and in order to hunt deer, they magically transport thousands of miles away to somewhere like the Swiss Alps.It's not believable, it detracts from the movie, it assumes the audience is stupid and isn't going to notice - but we do. (Pennsylvania has spectacular mountains, but nothing anywhere near the scale of the mountains in this movie. Jagged snow-covered peaks everywhere?? Are you kidding me? What alternate-Pennsylvania is this story taking place in?? Anybody who has so much as PASSED THROUGH Pennsylvania knows the mountains don't resemble anything to the ones in this film.)Imagine I have made a movie about life near a pond, but I use the Atlantic Ocean to fill in for the pond, because the shots are more grandiose. It makes no sense.Here's a novel idea... just set your movie near the ocean to begin with.",The Deer Hunter
397,drosey,The best Viet Nam era film. Still packs a punch two generations after the war,10,26 September 2005,"This is by far the best Viet Nam era film. It tells truth that are hard to consider entertainment. For the few that have been living in a cave and haven't seen it most poignant moments are. When Michael risks his life and lets go of the helicopter to save Steven. Then it's the scene where DeNiro's character is sick of killing and lets the deer go. excellent acting all around. Russian roulette did happen there. Some guys who were there said they were into that. The commies loved games. we should never have been there. Iraq is so much a rich mans' war like Nam. was. A true disgrace. But politics/opinions aside this is my favorite Viet Nam story, sad, beautiful and ultimately inevitable in many ways.",The Deer Hunter
398,dlevitt-1,most overrated film ever,1,11 January 2005,"This boring, overlong, implausible excuse for a story has psyched out a surprising number of people, thanks to a strong cast (Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken), phony but emotionally exploitive material, and American audiences desperate to demonize the winners of the Vietnam war.Any scenes that might have shown combat, snipers, or something that could have really happened in Vietnam are jarringly missing - it practically cuts from Pennsylvania to a POW camp. Then the famous ""Russian roulette"" scenes are utterly invented, and never happened to anyone in Vietnam (and probably not in any other war). Any honest viewpoint on any war would be preferable. Nam veterans aren't fooled; they hate this movie.Finally, they eliminate Walken's character in a twist that should logically have occurred many years earlier, but happens to take place just as his best friend arrives after ten years. Please! The most amazing thing about this movie is how many people say they loved it. Somehow the alternation of pretentious slowness and violence is manipulative. Its success so confused its director that he became delusional and made an even longer and far more expensive failure, so infamously bad it actually brought down United Artists studio. Still, I suspect I'd like it better than The Deer Hunter.",The Deer Hunter
399,cannonball66,Just Too Slow,8,11 February 2010,"It took me far too long to see this movie, and I am glad I finally did. I love the minimalist approach to the first hour of the movie before they go off to war. And I am a patient viewer - I don't need a plot to keep advancing at a rapid pace, I can appreciate a great character study. But even by those standards, this movie is just too darn slow in 2010. I would have given this a 9 or 9.5 if it had been 2 hours. In fact, I'd love to see it edited down to 2 hours just see what it would feel like. Honestly, I'm writing this review before I've even seen the entire movie - I am about 20 minutes into the war segment...but I'm at a point where I just can't take the slow pace anymore. Is this an American Classic? Sure, it probably is - but when directors get gratuitous with the length of their movies because they just don't feel they can cut anything out - well, that's just hubris. Walken is great in this movie though, even with all his verbal ticks that continue throughout the rest of his career, he's better than DeNiro in this. You can see how DeNiro patterns his later roles after his earlier ones - I'm seeing a DeNiro I've seen many times later in his career here. Cazale is great. The rest are adequate. Could always use some more of Meryl Streep back in the day - she is just radiant here.",The Deer Hunter
400,BeMi21,Disappointing,6,9 June 2014,"First of all I have to say, that I was completely aware that this is not a movie that will (only) show the war in Vietnam but that it's more about the characters who go there. Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed. In my opinion the movie is just too long. The beginning was quite promising: You see that the friends don't know how serious and dangerous this war is, they consider it more as an ""adventure"" and are actually looking forward to it. But the only ""helpful"" or meaningful scenes at the wedding (which I found almost boring) were the scene with the returning soldier from Vietnam and the proposal by Nick to Linda. Also the hunting scenes could have been shorter. The part in Vietnam is really great. I don't have to say much about that, it's really breathtaking and shocking and when Nick is questioned at the hospital his traumas are intensely shown. The third part has its strength and its weaknesses. The beginning is quite good, we see that Michael wants to avoid what seems to the others his ""old, normal"" life. But still, to me Michaels problems stayed superficial, maybe I expected too much. The last encounter between Michael and Nike is very moving and intense, I don't think there is much to discuss about that. So all in all I'd say the movie consist of a much too long ""introduction"" (I was completely aware that they don't take the war serious enough and of their ""normal"" American life after 20 minutes), a great second part in Vietnam and a good third part with some lengths which could be forgiven if the movie wasn't three hours long. But I won't understand what makes this movie to a masterpiece. Could the time when it came out have an effect on that? The Deer Hunter was one of the first movies that characterized the senselessness and insanity of that war and made you think about it. Still, I think that the absurdity of violence and war as well as posttraumatic stress disorder have been better illustrated in other movies by now.",The Deer Hunter
401,rbap,De Niro Wins,7,25 April 2012,"I expected more from The Deer Hunter, but that's probably because of the reputation it enjoys. After watching the film, it's clear that the hype comes by way of Robert De Niro's performance; believable and entirely authentic to his character. The Vietnam war itself is more of a vehicle to the centrepiece scene in the film; POW Russian Roulette and the ensuing results. Indeed, if you watch this movie, this is the once scene that makes it truly worthwhile because it was otherwise too long and not in the least gripping. If anything, the way it dragged on -particularly at the beginning- could be seen as the director's way of demonstrating that life outside of the war-zone is insignificantly mundane compared to what goes on in a shorter time span with death always moments away. Out of the 7/10 I'm rating it, six points go to Robert and one to the Roulette scene. Not that the other acting was bad, nor that it was a terrible movie, but not much else stood out for me in the three long hours it took to tell the story.",The Deer Hunter
402,darlingmagic,Sublime,9,27 November 2020,"One of the greatest movies ever made, and Robert De Niro during this time period was nothing sort of other-worldly, the best actor ever to grace our screens,I'd also like to take a moment to mention John Cazale, how he put in such a stella performance whilst dying of a terminal illness is beyond me, and although he died before i was born, (i was born in 1980), and although he never had the chance to make too many movies, the movies he did make were absolute classics, and he will always remain one of the greatest actors that ever lived in my eyes,",The Deer Hunter
403,stumattana,War's Reach Greater Than We May Realize,10,8 February 2004,"The Deer Hunter may be the definitive movie about how war affects people. It achieves this result by focusing on the hometown of those who go to Vietnam, and those in their lives.Many movies do a better job of showing how war affects the soldiers who have to endure it, or how the spouses and girlfriends are affected.  Like so many, however, I've never experienced war or been a soldier.  The impact of war to me, like so many others, was measured by deaths and injuries, and soldiers coming back intact seemed largely unaffected and prepared to resume the lives they left behind.  Until I saw The Deer Hunter, that is.I learned that war's impact on soldiers is not only physical, but mental and emotional, and that war's reach extends not only to those that participate but, in varying degrees, to all those in their lives.I strongly recommend Deer Hunter as a movie that will sensitize the viewer to the breadth of war's reach.",The Deer Hunter
404,KP-Nuts,One Of The Best Movies Ever Made!,10,10 May 2007,"The Deer Hunter is one of the greatest movies ever made. Ironically when I first saw it I was not overly impressed, but for some reason watched it again. I ended up watching it many in times in a short period as I fell in love with the piece and still view the movie regularly.The story is about three men from Pennsylvania who go to fight in the Vietnam War and who's lives are forever changed by their experience. Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage play the three friends Michael, Nick and Steven respectively. They are brilliantly supported by the likes of Meryl Streep and John Cazale (who was dying from bone cancer during the filming).The movie is well known for the infamous Russian roulette scenes, in some ways too much as the film is so much more than that. The film is a film of two halves - one pre-Vietnam and one during/after Vietnam. The first half is an almost perfect study of real life, the characters seem so real you can believe it is a real community. This is due to both the excellent work of the actors and fine direction by Michael Cimino.There are many great scenes of interaction between the characters simply living a ""normal"" life in their small American town. It is a stark contrast to the Vietnam part of the story and amazing performances by Walken and De Niro especially make you believe the change in them following their ordeal.It is quite simply a classic and a permanent member of my top three films of all time.",The Deer Hunter

406,rdama,Average Film,4,10 December 2005,"I had heard a lot about this film, so made a major effort to rent and watch it. I was somewhat disappointed. I could not figure out if this film was meant to focus on the portion on life in PA, or in Vietnam. It's almost as if there were 2 films made ""Life in Average-ville, PA"" and ""Horrors of Vietnam War"" and they were fused together. Somehow, I did not feel any sorrow/angst for the people who were playing Russian roulette for money, which made the end of the movie somewhat 'blah' for me. The POW-Russian roulette scenes were very gripping. The movie focused so much on this Russian roulette issue that I was beginning to wonder if this is the national sport of Vietnam. Is it? Does anyone know? There were several other ways to show the 'impact of the war'  focus on the loneliness of the widows/wives left behind. Or, show some more of the suffering of the Vietnamese people. They seemed to be mere 'extras' in the movie.",The Deer Hunter

410,Moviestar-6,It's OK to cut scenes!,6,19 July 2005,"I am a huge fan of both Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, so I have wanted to watch this film for quite some time. De Niro's and Walken's performances are outstanding, and Walken most definitely deserved his Oscar for it. My issue is with the director.I noticed the slow pacing within the first five to ten minutes. I have nothing inherently against slow pacing (I also am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan), so I am not completely a victim of the MTV, attention deficit crowd, but surely there must be a line. However, I continued watching. I watched as the characters prepared for a wedding. I watched as they had the wedding. I watched the wedding reception. All of these events, taking place, I assume, over the course of a week or two, seemed, in my mind, to unfold in real time.There then came a scene with the characters hunting deer. When Robert De Niro's character raised his rifle at a deer, and the deer ran away, and he lowered his rifle, I became convinced that the director was determined to capture a deer hunting expedition with such realism and accuracy that I myself wanted to fall asleep behind a deer blind. Or else perhaps take the role of the deer itself, who seemed to have the most exciting part, and was put out of its misery before the boredom became intolerable.When the film finally got around to showing Vietnam, I was overjoyed, thinking that perhaps something would happen other than people sitting around, smoking, drinking, and talking over one another. I never was a fan of King of the Hill, and I certainly don't want to watch the movie version. And relatively speaking, the Vietnam scenes WERE more exciting. Although, disillusioned from the first hour, I nearly had the overwhelming urge to play Russian Roulette myself. But still, the moments of action in the Vietnam portion of the film were sparse, and liberally cushioned by long moments of silence, the likes of which would make Samuel Beckett hit ""Stop."" After two hours, I became distinctly aware of the rising coldness in my stomach that indicated it would not be getting better. Already I had almost completely taken my attention from the movie to more action-packed distractions like reading a book, or clipping my toenails.I had not heard of the director, Michael Cimino, before The Deer Hunter, and having seen it, I'm not sure I will be rushing to the video store any time soon to watch any of his other work. Although I am not a professional filmmaker, and he is, I can give this much advice: it's OK to cut things out of your movie. I know, you are quite convinced that everything you left in was absolutely essential to the artistic success of the film, but you don't NECESSARILY have to show a hunter preparing to shoot a deer, only to find the deer run away. This is not something vital to the integrity of the picture. It's OK to remove that. It's not entirely necessary to show every dance that the wedding guests go through. You can cut a couple of them out.I have nothing against movies with slow pacing. It's not the pacing that I have a problem with. I don't need constant action, just substance. There is a difference between lack of action and lack of substance. You can have a perfectly substantial scene with zero action, and there is an alarming number of examples of movies that have plenty of action, but zero substance. This film had a lot of dead air, a lot of parts that had no action and no substance.Now, if you'll excuse me, I've thought about the film too much, and I need to take a nap.",The Deer Hunter
411,b_u_n_44,One Shot,10,7 June 2002,"This movie will haunt me until the day I die. I know when you think of the word haunt you would think of it in a bad way, but in this case it is not. There are things about this movie that will always bother me. The many times Nicki had to rescue himself from the world that was Vietnam. The way the vietminh soldiers threw the U.S. soldiers into a pit of water and left them to die, and their bodies to the rats. But these are things soon lost in the mix when you get caught up in this epic of a movie. Robert DeNiro is one of the geatest actors of all time. I know many people say once a person is in a role nobody could have played it better. But this is trully a case where noone could have played the role of Michael better than DeNiro. He brings you in from the beginning and never lets go. Just as the movie does. There are so many different emotions you are forced to feel as the piece goes along it's hard to focus on just one. But if anything jumps out at you the most it's friendship. It's never leaving someone behind. These men have a bond that others only wish they could achieve as friends. They are inseperable. But that turns out to be the problem for them. Being serperated causes a mental anguish so strong that they become trapped, a world they would never escape. There are many sad feelings from this movie, but also many feelings of pride. As well as many times you will find yourself laughing right along with the men from the small Pittsburgh town. The Deer Hunter is a movie that should escape noone's mind.",The Deer Hunter

It is a  wonderful portrait of industrial and ethnic (Russian) small town America, for example.  It is also a tragic story of working class men (and the women they left behind - Streep is wonderfully fragile) who went through the ordeal of the Vietnam war, with varying, but ultimately equally poignant outcomes (broken in body and spirit Savage; unreachable, suicidal Walken; seemingly strong yet bereft De Niro).  And then it is a story of the powerful yet never articulated love of De Niro for Walken and its tragic conclusion.

415,fable104,Long but Powerful,9,15 May 2008,"Rather than focusing the entire film on the Vietnam War, Michael Cimino chose to emphasize character evolution and the aftermath of war on a small blue-collar Pennsylvania town. This not only removes The Deer Hunter from the war movie category but makes it so much more. While the first third of the film is long and parts can be cut (say what you will but the marriage scene could have been slimmed down and the scene when the guys kept on driving off without John (George Dzundza) was almost unnecessary) this is an excellent film that continues to shine more than twenty-five years later. The talent in this film is immeasurable with an all-star cast including Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, and John Cazale. While everyone at home goes about their everyday lives, Michael (Robert DeNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage) go through a war that shatters their enthusiasm. The war continues to ravage their lives even after they are done fighting: Michael can no longer hunt, Nick's mind is broken as he sits playing Russian roulette in Saigon, and Steven is paralyzed. Meryl Streep deserves accolades for this film as well as she plays the woman torn between Michael and Nick. Her character demonstrates war's power in affecting those who stayed at home. Unlike so many films that romanticize wars as honorable and good vs. evil, The Deer Hunter shows that war is a hell that follows you home. The last scene in Saigon will catch you by surprise every time you watch it.",The Deer Hunter
416,ryandschreiber,I disagree...,5,1 October 2010,"This is the third time I have attempted to view this movie. The first time was in a drive in and I was approx. ten and of course didn't understand any of it. The second time was as few years ago and I fell asleep before the the deer dropped. Tonite I decided to give it a fair chance now that I'm 43 and can think for myself when not snoozing. lol. But In MY opinion, yes this movie is very realistic and made me feel like I was with my high school buddies cutting up and getting in trouble and all that. I just feel that it is on the slow side and couldn't watch it in just one sitting. Yes, I liked it, but it ain't all that. At least I know all the in's and out's of how to play Russian Roulette now. Just kidding. Just MY opinion, so no biggie. But again, it would be so easy for me to just act like myself and be in this movie. Escpecially the wedding part. It ain't acting if you're doing what you would normally do, right?",The Deer Hunter
417,pattikawa,"Troubled, fascinating film!",10,13 August 2011,"I love this film because it took me a lot of emotion to be able to watch it to the end. The first scene of Russian Roulette (RR) in the jungle really made me tremble and shiver. I guess I love films that trouble me.It tells the story about friendship in a small Russian community in the US (Isn't a coincident: Russian community, Russian roulette?). The people are very much connected with each other. The three friends: Mike, Steve, and Nike were just about to go to Vietnam. But there were still wedding party and deer hunting to be done. This first part introduces the characters and their carefree life before going to the war.The film brings you abrupt to the second part: the hell. The three men were in captivity and were forced to play Russian roulette, for the sake of entertaining the Viet Cong. They luckily (?) survive this and made a run. Along the way they were separated.The final part shows that even though all three survive the enemy captivity, there were parts of them that are dead. Steven became paralyzed and could not face the family at home and prefer to stay in the institution because it feels like vacation there with its Bingo and basketball playing. Nick survived the war but mentally he is a dead man. Mike's attempt to rescue him seems to be doomed because Nick was already dead in a way. Mike went home and found consolation in the girl he loved, Linda, Nick's girlriend. Linda, who also desperately lonely found also comfort in Mike but still feels sad about Nick who did not come back. This is one of the reason, I think, that Mike went back to Vietnam searching for Nick. It was an attempt trying in vain to put all the things right there just like the old times. But sadly the damage has already taken place and even Mike could not turn the hands of time.Like many all said, RR is a perfect symbol of going to war. Th dispute whether it really happen in Vietnam is for me not important. It's about the story, and for me the story is credible and heart breaking. The first part of the movie contains funny scenes, though, and shows beauty and innocence that are soon destroyed. The singing ""God bless America"" at the end seems to present the irony of the war. Patriotism is often a label used to cover the absurdity of war. The deer symbolizes the innocence and beauty that Mike came to realize at the end. The activity of deer hunting itself shows the joy of men bonding together in a small traditional community. Mike can not enjoy this activity any more after the war.The story begins with wedding and ends with death ceremony, which represents the dark nature of the story. It is NOT a feel good movie, but one that definitively fascinates me.",The Deer Hunter
418,sachsad,Not without flaws but the most real portrayal of Vietnam I've seen,8,8 June 2004,"I had difficulty with the first hour of The Deer Hunter.  My two problems concerned technicalities and length.  In a three-hour movie, I feel everything should function in the narrative or inform the viewer's understanding of the narrative.  That being said, I felt there was a lot of fat that could have been trimmed in the very opening of the film, and especially the wedding.  Meryll Streep's first appearance seemed unnecessary, her getting a drink with Robert De Niro's character, the very opening with the truck, and various shots could have been cut down-production companies might have seen Cimino's future mistakes with Heaven's Gate coming had they paid attention to these issues. I also felt at first that the cinematography and sound quality were poor. It didn't look visually real when I felt it should have, and there seemed a lot of audio inconsistencies (ie background noise that changed from shot to shot).  THAT being said, these concerns were soon put to rest when I saw the reason for cinematography that wasn't aesthetically pleasing.  Once Mikey, Nicky, and Steve went to war, I realized that this movie was meant to seem like a documentary in a way-no fancy cinematography so the viewer could notice a certain amount of work put into aesthetics and think more about that than context.  I felt like I was there and everything was shot on location and the Russian roullette scenes were really happening.  It seemed to me the most real portrait of the Vietnam War I've seen, and I now appreciate movies like Full Metal Jacket which didn't resonate prior to seeing the Deer Hunter. Christopher Walken also gave his most powerful and unforgettable performance that he has not outlasted since.  I wasn't watching Christopher Walken; I was watching his character Nick. This movie is not to be missed, and you won't forget it.",The Deer Hunter
419,Hobbes2002-1,Didnt Blink,8,28 February 2004,"A haunting movie that is just so sad and so tragic.  Robert DeNiro, John Savage, and Christopher Walken are three good friends who just are so optimistic and to see there dreams crushed and there lives fall apart you cant help but be moved.  This movie just really tells it how it was.                             *Spoilers Ahead*The government lied to them and they just wanted to serve their country and the results leaves one paralyzed, one dead emotionally, and one dead.  This movie just shows how war really does destroy lives.  This movie is a perfect example.  The wedding scene shows there last few happy moments but as is foreshadowed bad times are ahead.  This movie is not for the squeamish.  The images will stick with you for a very long time.  Do not see this movie unless you are prepared to be moved, shocked, and sickened with the plight of the three heroes.",The Deer Hunter
420,whitecaps,Mixed review,5,29 May 2018,"I suspect many of the people who have a high regard for this movie are of the generation who were old enough to appreciate it when it came out, not only in the effect the Vietnam War had on the people who fought in it and the U.S as a whole, but also in the nature of 1970s art.I had a mixed reaction to the movie. Some people have commented that the first hour dragged on too long, I'm a patient person, but I thought pretty much every scene in the entire movie dragged on too long.In that sense, the best comparison I think with the 1970s isn't even other films but rock music: the songs that had long guitar solos. Like those guitar solos, all of the scenes in this film were ultimately indulgent, but some of them were interesting, some of them were entertaining and some of them were boring.",The Deer Hunter
421,whitecaps,One of the interesting parts of this film,5,29 May 2018,"Given Robert deNiro being in this movie and his later work with Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, It seemed kind of interesting how similar the John Cazale character Stan is to the Pesci character in Goodfellas. (And probably a lot of other Pesci characters.)",The Deer Hunter
422,snix_rocks,Long but good movie!,8,24 January 2013,One of the first things I liked about this movie is how they set up the whole beginning of the movie. They set it up to let everyone get a feel where everyone was from and what relationship they had with each other which I think was cool. When they went over to fight in the war I think they didn't do enough of setting that up. They just kinda started after they had been there for awhile. I think that some of the stuff that happened when they were captured was pretty crazy and I wonder if stuff like that really happened. Its pretty crazy what they had to go through. So I don't blame them if they were really effected by all that. I think there could have been different endings that could have been better but that is just me. I thought it was also interesting that when they went hunting again he couldn't deal with anymore death so he didn't shoot his buck he was tracking.,The Deer Hunter
423,jmeltzer07,Phenomenal,10,30 May 2006,"The Deer Hunter tells the story of three very close friends, Michael, Nick, and Steve, who decide to go serve in Vietnam after Steve's wedding. The movie describes the experiences of these three men in Vietnam and their experiences afterwards. While in Vietnam, they are captured by the Vietcong and submitted to a game of Russian roulette, which consists of you having to point a gun to your own head and pull trigger hoping that the bullet won't go through your head. The three friends are able to escape one of these ""games"" thanks to Michael's cunning. However, shortly thereafter, Michael, Nick, and Steve go their separate ways. Michael returns home safely, Nick stays in Vietnam, and Steve comes home without legs.Like most Vietnam veterans who came home, Michael was a completely different man because of what he had seen in Vietnam. He has a different attitude toward his friends at home and he became more of an isolated figure. All over the country, returning Vietnam soldiers were affecting the towns they came from. Originally proud that their boys were leaving to serve their country, people began to grow uneasy and skeptical of those same boys when they returned from service. However, experiences in war can change a human being and give them a different outlook on life and the main characters of The Deer Hunter.There was a reason that this movie won five academy awards in 1979. Christopher Walken (Nick), who won for best supporting actor, Robert De Niro (Michael), and John Savage (Steve) are all excellent as the three friends who go over to Vietnam as close friends and come back as completely changed individuals. The Oscar-winning direction of Michael Cimino gave the film its overwhelming emotional intensity and steady pace despite its 3 hour time length. However, the best part of The Deer Hunter is the message that it conveys, which is that no matter how emotionally tough you may think you are, war can break you with ease and it not only affects you but the people around you as well.",The Deer Hunter
424,alisonmoffat65,"A fantastic, tense, exciting and re watchable war epic",9,26 August 2014,"My personal favourite war film of all time as the focus is less on the action (although when it does appear it is exhilarating)and more on the brilliance of the three main characters, Robert DeNero, Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken (who took home a Oscar for best supporting actor, which he deserved. The script is perfectly written, but dialogue is surprisingly scarce, focusing more on breathtaking vista shots. My favourite scenes are the ones where DeNero and his fellow Steelworkers, go Deer Hunting. The landscape is very appealing and the music and atmosphere are just absorbing. The famous Russian Roulette is very tense, and features some great acting, even though the way they escape is quite frankly, ludicrous. Finally this film has one of the most memorable last acts in movie history, finishing off with a song, quite fittingly, with a song about America. This song sums up the entire films plot, it is a film about America.I highly recommend you watch this film. For the performances, camera work and the complex characters.",The Deer Hunter
425,tonygumbrell,"Hollywood, pure Hollywood",1,25 March 2010,"All one has to do, is to read the plot synopsis given here by IMDb, to see how ridiculous this movie is. 1) The steel workers in the movie appear to be in their late twenties or early thirties (the actors were all in their thirties at least). They were too old to be drafted and sent to Vietnam. Men like that didn't have to join the army (which at the time would could result in their being sent to Vietnam). They would have hung on to their jobs and gotten married. 2) If by some miraculous twist (practically impossible) of fate they wound up in the Army, they wouldn't have served together in the same outfit in Vietnam. 3) The Special Forces were an all volunteer outfit made up almost entirely of career soldiers who had to meet special qualifications to be selected. 4) Very few of our soldiers were captured by the enemy (most of the POWs were downed pilots). Bamboo (tiger) cages were a scandal notoriously used by our side (not theirs) to imprison enemy ""Viet Cong"" or NLF combatants or suspects (this was turned around cleverly in the movie, so Americans (the audience) can feel themselves victimized). 5) The absurdity is taken further with the Russian roulette hokum. This is utterly contrived to show the insidious brutality of the ""oriental"" fiends who seek to unman our red-blooded, masculine, all-American steelworker heroes. While nothing like this ever really happened, the point however is to mimic the famous scene (viewable in the documentary ""Hearts and Minds"") in which the Chief of Police of South Vietnam puts a pistol to the head of a prisoner with his hands tied behind his back and shoots him dead point blank, again the movie turns the imagery completely around. Lastly, the big lie in the movie is that we poor Americans have been victimized by the diabolical, insidious, inhuman orientals. Our big, strong, hulking men have been rendered temporarily impotent and defenseless against this nefarious surreal menace. In the end our boys loyalty and patriotism sees them through, though they may be physically maimed and will be emotionally scarred for live by what has transpired on this heinous foreign den of inequity. Almost nothing in the plot makes sense nor could it ever have happened save in the fertile imagination of a cunning Hollywood hack. If you like this movie, you've got some growing up to do.",The Deer Hunter
426,Patrick G. Smith,A magnificent look at war and its tragic effects.,10,27 October 1999,"The Deer Hunter is the most sad, and emotionally draining film I have ever seen. It is the greatest anti-war statement in film history. Robert De Niro particularly, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, and John Savage provide just terrific performances. The film demonstrates the devastating effects of the Vietnam War on a small Pennsylvania town. Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Apocalypse Now are also great Vietnam movies, but none are as tragic or as powerful as the Deer Hunter. The best war movie ever made.",The Deer Hunter

I have seen every movie ever made by this incredible actor and although many of his performances are wonderful, this is the one that can still bring me to tears every time I watch it. Just try to find a more powerful scene in any movie than the game of russian roulette that these helpless men have to play in that nasty Vietnam War.

429,Belgand-4,"Good, but an artifact of its time",7,19 December 2002,"This is definitely a film with a heavily divided opinion. Some chide it for being long or boring, others over-praise it as powerful and emotional. Myself I respect it as a rather good film, but cannot see it as a great film. Having been born in '81 it's a product of another generation and something that try as I may I can't fully relate to. To the generation that produced it and lived through the Vietnam war I can certainly understand how it would have much greater relevance and impact. This is not only one of the earlier films to deal with issues raised by a highly controversial war, but also one to be done in a humanistic manner focusing on the lives of the people effected by it. Reasonably they are the ideal audience for the film. To those of us following this generation we do not have the same experiences and I feel the film is less prepared to speak to us about more universal experiences as it is rooted in its own time. Not that this is a bad thing, but it will definitely detract from the film's appreciation by a modern audience.Overall I would give this film a 6 or 7 out of 10. It is above-average, but not great. If you were around during the war and aren't looking for a more action-oriented film add a point or two, it's your film, not mine.",The Deer Hunter
430,carltonnick,the most potent drama I have ever seen,10,23 October 2001,"To call Deerhunter harrowing is an understatement. The first time I saw this at university in a large lecture hall I was not prepared for the impact it would have on me. I thought that the Russian Roulette scene between the Vietcong and their prisoners was bad enough, but the climax that had Robert de Niro beseeching his best friend Christopher Walken to come back home was almost unbearable.Deerhunter is such a deceptive movie and that's what gives it its remarkable emotional punch. The first phase of the movie trundles pleasantly along as we observe a pleasant small town in the backwoods of industrial America. There is a great deal of male bonding and general machismo as we see a close-knit bunch of friends doing what boys do best - hunting, fooling around, drinking at the local bar and playing pool. The wedding just emphasizes the joyous innocence of this backwoods idyll.
The viewer is, as a result, reassuringly relaxed, after the opening section of this movie. However, we hardly pause for breath when we are suddenly plunged into the horrors of the Vietnam war. The psychological anguish of the prisoners forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors certainly takes you aback, wrenching you out of your lethargy and dragging you through this world of squalor and despair. I believe that this movie addresses the ultimate human predicament and that is what gives it such force: committing suicide when you are loathe to be dead. I cannot think of any more appalling confrontation. Moments like that inevitably leave scars and so that is what happened to Christopher Walken.Robert de Niro's heart-rending scene when he tries to drag his best friend away from his nightmare and ultimately fails made me so emotional. I don't think I have ever wept so much in a movie. Just to exacerbate that misery, when all the friends are back in Pennsylvania and mourn over Walken's death there is such an epic pathos that when you leave the cinema your eyes are hardly dry. The first 10 times I watched this remarkable movie left me blubbing at the end and I still get emotional when I watch it now. I don't think there has ever been a drama with more emotional punch than The Deerhunter. It flings you straight into the maelstrom, taking you completely unawares, and never lets up as it puts you and the characters through torment after torment. There is a dignified beauty about the main protagonists and how they are able to deal with such tragedy. The power, brevity and loyalty of de Niro's character is quite simply majestic. When you come out of this movie you feel as though you have experienced a major slice of life and you feel changed in some ways. That is what great art does.",The Deer Hunter

The Deer Hunter was not my war, nor that of any of my Veteran friends.  It tripped fewer of my triggers than any movie I have watched on the subject so far.  I cannot, and do not, relate to it.  Of course that is not to say anything about the quality of the acting and filming of the movie, just the content.If you want to see something that says more about the subject than any other that I know of see, ""Dear Mom: Letters Home from Vietnam.""

I saw this at the theater as a kid expecting it to be more of a war flick than it turned out to be (meaning more battlefield action) but having seen it over and over again as an adult, it has grown to be one of my favorite flicks of all time - occasionally topping ""my list"" as number 1.

The beginning drags on and on, then when the characters are finally in Viet Nam, the scene is ludicrous.For a movie that is suppose to show the effects of war on a group of people living in a small steel mill town, it fails miserably.Seems to me the character development was very weak to begin with, and just gets weaker as it goes. I was so bored and disappointed towards the end of this mess of a movie, that I finally turned it off about 15 minutes from the end. I figured it was a lost cause to continue, and I had already wasted over 2 hours of my life watching this crap.Aside from being painfully boring, with no real character development, ludicrous war scenes, a complete failure to get any point across, and totally non-rational events, I guess it was OK.

I mean they took 3 hours to utterly fail to create insight or empathy towards any of the main characters, and resorted to gross saccharine music abruptly dropped in as needed in the absence of actual narrative or film craft.
Even Di Niro is awful...but I can't really blame him.
After 42 years I just watched this again and to my immense surprise - because there are so many times over a lifetime we have good reason to reappraise initial responses to artworks, the benefit of age and perhaps wisdom (!) - it was every bit the same boorish, clunky, self indulgent piece of sappy rubbish as I thought the first time round.

The long ""set-piece"" scenes (wedding, Russian roulette, etc.) are much discussed, usually either in the context of being ""essential for character development"" or ""boring"". In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything ""happen"" narrative-wise.De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause.

This film reminded me how two so-called straight male friends will die before admitting their love for each other. As a Marine, now retired Merchant Marine, I saw these friendship develop. Before you throw stones at me, I am straight, although I have had friends and relatives who are gay. I am sorry to see such a fine anti-war movie with deep emotional feelings not be fully understood.

It makes me glad that I didn't grow up in those war torn years. Apparently, the Vietnam scenes were shot blind due to political instability in the shooting location making this movie even better.Hold your breath during the Russian Roulette scenes.

446,Steve Liu,"A powerful, emotional ride.",9,20 November 1999,"Cimino's 1978 effort is one of the most moving films of the decade. Deniro, fresh off of his Academy Award for Godfather II, is brilliant as Michael, and Walken rightfully wins Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Nick.The story revolves around a close group of steel workers in the blue collar town of Clairton, PA. Three of the six men are off to Vietnam in a few days, and the film examines the effect of major stress on their friendships. Michael is the quiet leader of this group, and he joins Nick and Steven in Vietnam. Before they make that journey, Steven gets married. The remaining five men go on one final hunting trip together, the ""Deer Hunter"" being Deniro's character. Here we learn of Michael's one shot philosophy when hunting deer. One shot - an important theme of the film.The first half of the film is devoted to outlining their lives in that mill town. The complications that come with everyday life, the intricacies of friendship, trust, love, fear, confusion, and Rolling Rock. Once in Vietnam, the men undergo changes that will alter their lives forever.The roulette scenes which make this film famous may be entirely fictitious. It does not matter. Cimino presents them in such a realistic and powerful manner that you cannot help getting caught up in the scenes. Particularly toward the end of the film, you will find your heart racing. This movie was one of the first films involving Vietnam, yet the film is not about war. It is about the effect of war and stress on a friendship and how some things can never be the same.I give this film 9 stars out of 10, with a point deducted for a mediocre final scene. The score is powerful, the cinematography is exceptional for the seventies.In a final note, John Cazale, most notable as Fredo Corleone, gives a great performance as Stan, the weak and nearly pathetic friend of Michael. He was once engaged to Meryl Streep, who plays the lead female role. This was his final performance, as this wonderful actor was dying of bone cancer while filming.",The Deer Hunter
447,dj_intrepid,So bad it hurts too watch it.,4,21 October 2007,"This is not the most realistic film about Vietnam ever, in fact, it is so completely unrealistic that I couldn't help but become agitated at nearly every turn.First, the opening of this film drags on for way too long and the style of the wedding sequence is a total rip off of Godfather and any John Cassavetes film. Every point it gets across could have been established much more effectively in a shorter period of time.With that said, all of the Vietnam sequences are completely contrived. I noticed that a few others have pointed out the same mistakes that I saw, like, there is no way in hell that all three of those guys would wind up in the same village at the same time during a one year tour! Robert Deniro was Special Forces and the other two were regular army. If you don't know what I mean by that statement, then do some research people! Robert Deniro with a full grown beard in uniform? Yeah right! The Russian Roulette sequence? Yeah, country villagers turned Vietcong would know what Russian Roulette is. Sure! And they would bet on it too! How very western an idea! And that ending... By the way, where did Deniro get all of that money? He certainly didn't get it from the sock drawer! I could go on a lot more pointing out all of the ridiculous things about the film that ultimately make it unworthy of even watching. There are a few smatterings of realism spread throughout, but they're overshadowed by contrivances. One of those smatterings is John Savage's wife's reaction to the loss of his legs.

448,molotov85,Horrifyingly boring,8,17 September 2000,"For a film that was made twenty two years ago(1978) you'd think that with the growing graphic intensity of films this would be a lame, weak film. If I take an example of a recent war movie, say Saving Private Ryan, yes it is more gory (much, much more gory : think the D-Day Landing scenes) but is it more horrifying and unsettling for it? No. Simple as that : no. The Russian roulette scenes although they take up quite a major part of the story and are shown frequently still shock, horrify and with the voluntary 'RR' scenes dismay. Russian roulette is a 'game' in which a six-shooter is loaded with one bullet and then the chamber is spun and slammed in, so you don't know where the bullet is. You then hold the gun up to your head, pull the trigger and hope. In the Vietcong concentration camps where they are being held captive they are made to play this for the purpose of amusement and for gambling purposes. The sight of grown men being reduced to crying and shaking is simply terrible especially when you know that if you don't do it you are put in the 'cage' (a bamboo cage held in water with about two inches of breathing space left, which presumably when the waters rise, drowns you). It is the concentration camp scenes where one of the films almost fatal flaws comes to light. How did they get there? How did De Niro get from deer hunting to Vietnam on his own? How did his friends in a helicopter find him? How did they then get from there to a concentration camp? How did De Niro find his way through the forest, with a disabled man on his back, to a main road? How did Walken remember his disabled friend enough to send him money yet couldn't recognise De Niro? What were they saying at the beginning? Why does the film have to be so long? The film is an epic at around about three hours but you get the feeling with all of these gaping plot holes it was cut down from five hours! The wedding scenes, which took up an enormous chunk of the movie, bored and didn't seem to get anywhere in terms of anything. The Godfather's wedding scenes were great - there was enough going on to keep you attention, some of the films greatest moments occurred there (the 'My Father made him an offer he couldn't refuse' speech deserves to go down in film's history), the scene was set beautifully and the characters were introduced brilliantly like you knew them personally. The Deer Hunter's wedding scenes did none of this, bar a quite good pre-wedding bar scene involving the song 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You', the characters developed slightly but couldn't they do this in ten minutes and then jump to the deer hunting scenes? The dialogue may have left a bit to be desired as well. I put 'may' though as I couldn't hear it most of the time as what is supposed to be background music was made foreground music with the speaking taking a back seat. I appreciate that it was loud there and it was hard to make yourself heard but the person that they were speaking was right next to them and I don't make a habit of standing next to my telly so I couldn't hear what they were talking about! Turning the volume didn't help as that just made the music louder! I have knocked this quite a bit haven't I? So I wouldn't give it a good mark, right? Wrong. I think this is a brilliant film although it has shortcomings I forgive them all for Walken and De Niro's last frenzied scene, which is perhaps the most powerful, brilliant and shocking scene ever!

The acting by DeNiro is absolutely top-notch and perhaps unrivaled to this day in any picture I have ever seen! (my personal opinion of course). Christopher Walken's performance was voted in Premiere Magazine's top 100 performances of all time as No. 88 and it certainly deserves it's high ranking. Meryl Streep does a truly fine job too playing the naive and simple suburban girl in love with Nick (Walken's character).The style of the movie is very calm except for when war & it's consequences play out! The scenes depicting Micheal (DeNiro's character) & Nick's experiences in the war are very disturbing, yet they are so very powerful, and have (as Quentin Tarantino put it at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0u4POopKo0) some of the best cinematic shots ever to be seen in movie history!!! I couldn't agree more with QT! Plain and absolutely fantastic direction, script and photography make this movie a 10/10.

That probably took no more then 30 minutes but I would swear it seems like 90.  Robert DeNiro doesn't recognize his friends at first, somehow he just has lost it, never an explanation.  They get captured, play russian roulette, escape, Christopher Walken gets left behind, blah, blah, blah.

The first hour is about one of the friends getting married, no joke an hour. Honestly you would have to watch the ceremony, a lot of dancing and a lot drunk people yelling and screaming, but in no way does this really develop any of the characters.There is also about an hour and a half of dialogue, but the run time is a little over three hours. I'm not saying a movie needs to have dialogue through out the whole movie, but come on that's an extra hour and a half of nothing.I love movies and would never tell anyone to not see a movie for themselves, but this is the first time I have been angry watching a movie that so many people rave about.

This movie has erased all the good memories I had in my short life and have replaced them with a horrendous 3 hour torture. I also believe that this movie is very heavy, the pseudo critics and brainwashed zombie fans have made this movie so heavy that it has become a near black hole with so much mass that while watching it the time kind of stops almost, and the three hours of torture seems like an eternity of hellfire. I was made to watch this movie as part of my rehabilitation program for scoring less in a test in the school as a punishment, I never made any mistake in the class anymore. the shrieks we used to hear from the video room ran shivers through my spines, finally someone called human rights who put a ban on this horrendous practice. since then the number of kids who passed out as socially awkward incompetent fools from the school has dropped by 97%.",The Deer Hunter

The raw power-house performances by Deniro and Walken melt together with the beautiful cinematography and rich directing. But what's almost more sad to me, then the film, is that Michael Cimino's career nearly ended after his following film.

Some of the characters are driven truly insane. Upon their return form war, the audience can see the damaging affects the war has had on the lives of the townspeople.Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep, and Christopther Walken give stunning performances, that truly define the phrase: ""Character Development"".

457,dick.spencer,One of the best war-movies ever,10,16 May 2001,"""The Deer Hunter"" is in my opinion, one of the two best war-movies ever made (""The Thin Red Line"" being the other). Both TDH and TTRL show war as something to really consider, to think about. TDH doesn't tell us much about what's happening during the war, as before and after the war. We get to see how the characters struggle to pretend that everything is as it used to be. (TTRL on the other hand doesn't tell us much about the fighting at Guadalcanal, but it puts the war into another perspective, contrasting the furious fighting with beautiful sceneries, very much alike the finnish writer Väinö Linna's ""Unknown Soldier"".)This is what war-movies should be about, but mostly they're not. Mostly they're just dedications to ""those who served and gave their lives for their countries"", when what we really need to ask is why these countries keep asking us to kill for them. TDH is not celebrating the victims of the war, but remembering them and trying to tell us that we can't let this happen again. I don't see how people interpret the song ""God Bless America"" in the end as a patriotic stance. Isn't the grim irony obvious? When these people finally realizes what the war really was about, what else could they do beside putting their faith into that their sacrifices ""for their country"" weren't meaningless? What else could they do besides asking God to bless their country and eventually confirm that it was all necessary and for the best?""The Deer Hunter"" has it's flaws, but I've seen it at least ten times and still feel the tears well up in my eyes every time I see it. That's another reason why I wouldn't dream about giving this movie anything less than a ten.",The Deer Hunter

This was very well made and I actually at moments felt as I was in the film itself. I feel that Walken gives a wild performance here.  I truly would say to see this film.

This is a film which will leave your mind throbbing with thought for at least the next 6 hours after viewing. This film will change your life.Michael Cimino has done a terrific job with ""The Deer Hunter"". It's hard to draw fault to any aspects of the film.

461,ortyepefy,One of the most superficial movie on Vietnam war,3,30 December 2005,"I really dislike this movie for several reasons. First, because, from an historical point of view, it seems to me highly politically incorrect. In fact, it describes Vietnam war in a too partial and superficial way. Partial because Vietcongs (vietnam soldiers) are always and only seen as bad and cruel, whereas us soldiers are all somewhat heroes. Other movies, by other (us !) directors, like Oliver Stone, describes THAT war in a very different manner, showing heroism (sometimes) and cruelty (so often !) on both sides. In my opinion, the movie is also superficial because, talking about war in general, describes war as some sort of a ""hard competition"" between adult men. I am wondering if not only Vietnam war but only one of modern wars fits this description. I am afraid that all modern wars, Vietnam war included, are better described as long sequences of useless massacres involving innocent women, babies, old men and women. As a last observation, in my opinion some sequences are really absurd. Which is the probability that one survive Russian roulette FOR MONTHS ? Which is the probability that two caught soldiers get free from their enemies without any help from outside by simply taking the guns from their enemies trousers ? In this respect, I think a mistake concerning the chosen genre has been done. Some sort of things MAY happen in adventure movies like ""star wars"" or ""raiders of the lost ark"", but not in a dramatic one, where events shown needs to be believable.",The Deer Hunter

463,faust-48,"A Real Piece Of Dramatic Art, I Was Blown Away!",10,13 August 2008,"Where can I possibly start? The Deer Hunter is truly a piece of art. It is hard to say this is the best war movie, because I find it to be more of a character study and the war involvement is coincidental. I enjoyed getting to know the characters in the beginning of the film, and I also enjoyed the aspect of getting a closer look at not the war, but the mental feel of the war. If I may be so frank to say, I literally crapped my pants in the final Russian roulette scene. I can personally relate to this movie, and I'm sure everyone else can at a time or two throughout their lives. There are so many ways for you to become someone you don't understand. There are so many different aspects of ourselves that we don't even know are there. But there comes a piece of art such as TDH that comes along and touches you personally. This film has taught me that there doesn't have to be a point made across to entertain or enthrall or even relate to you, but simply show yourself. And this is what the characters in this film did, they showed themselves and opened up such dark and mysterious parts of their personalities that becomes all too human. Films like these show us how dysfunctional our society is, and what a complicated world it is we live in. The film itself is slow moving, but there is no ""big point/climax"" in my eyes that you have to get to. The point of this film is for us to understand that not everyone is a perfect product of society, and it gradually teaches us at a rate we can fully learn. As for the performances, this film has given me great thought into thinking of Walken as one of the greats of our time. He is uncontrollably amazing, even if it seemed too simple. De Niro gave one of the performances of his life, which isn't his norm to do a roll like this, but he was perfect for it. Streep and Cazale are fine supporters, just not at Walken's level at that time. All in all, this film deserves every award out there, and for it to show us such a problem of our own, it rightfully has won. See this movie, see it again, and give thought to it.

The story is brilliant, the haters of the movie are actually the people with low IQ fit only to watch Rambo series with only bullets and no story.The scene with Di Niro and Christoper Walken in the bar is one of my favorite scenes ever.

465,jtmudge,How is this in the top 250?,1,30 July 2004,"How did this movie get to be in the top 250? Why is it rated so high? If you have sat through this three hour movie you may be asking yourself this same question. Movies from this era tended to move a bit slower, take their time, and deliver some sort of message on the meaning of life. I have patience and can sit through many slower films. But what drags this film down is that the protagonist Michael (Robert DeNiro) does not hold your interest for 20 minutes, let alone 183. Long scenes such as the wedding reception where we watch the guests dance for 20 minutes leave you wondering, why? What does this have to do with Michael? Does he want to get married? Does he wish he had the life of his friends? Do they envy him? How does this move the story forward?In contradiction to the long scenes, there are several shorter ones that seem to have no point at all. Why was Linda (Meryl Streep) beaten by her father and what did this have to do with the story? At times the movie moved forward too fast, leaving the question, what just happened? I continually felt that I was being left out of some crucial plot points that would move the story forward, or at least keep me interested.Nick (Christopher Walken), would seem to make a far better protagonist than Michael. His character actually went through the most change and his story held the most interest. My guess is that this movie spoke more to the times of 1978 with Vietnam being not to far behind. In that way, one who saw it then might rate it higher. Seeing it today, however, one wonders, ""8.1 stars?""",The Deer Hunter
466,veturisarma,If only this wasn't so long....,6,3 May 2012,"I saw The Deer Hunter for three reasons1. It was on IMDb Top 250 List 2. It is a 70s film starring De Niro when he was at his absolute best in every role he played 3. It had 5 Oscars including the Best Picture4 Oscar nominations thrown in for good measure too.It was a good film but I was not totally satisfied with it to be very honest. It had no business being so long for starters. The first act and the third act could have been trimmed for about an hour more in the former than the later(40 in the first 20 in the third I guess would have made the film a world of good). Especially the first act was not doing much and in its entirety it shows the bonding between the friends amidst of a overtly long wedding scene at the church. True, the camaraderie and their relationship needed to be established, but an hour devoted only for that aspect of the film is a little demanding on the patience all the time promising of better things to come.The second act was brilliant and is dearly and deservedly remembered by everyone who saw it. The acting, direction, cinematography were absolutely top notch and everyone was in command of their craft. This segment itself might have won this film all its Oscars. It culminates at a point where the three friends at different stages of exhaustion, escape from the prison camp and were rescued.The third act traces their life back to their home town in Penssylvania where Mike who survived the war is welcomed enthusiastically back into his friends' lives but he has no idea of his other two buddies. He learns of their survival ,meets one of them(Stevie) who got his legs amputated and brings him back to his family. He finds his other friend Nick (Christopher Walken in an Oscar winning role) to be somewhere in Saigon and leaves to rescue him true to his word. The ending shows the survivors and friends singing God Bless America. Somewhere among this, there was Linda (Meryl Streep), Nick's fiancée with whom Mike seems to develop a relationship.The direction and acting are quite flawless and deserve all the accolades. There were some real poignant moments in the film but they were not few but certainly far between. Also, the film occasionally seems to spell out the emotions for its viewers specially towards the end of the first act. The film has a large heart and important things to say, and I wanted to like it better than I had but sadly it did not have the kind of brilliance, intrigue and drama that I was expecting out of a film that has achieved what it had. A 6 out of 10",The Deer Hunter
467,jdmorris,The only perfect movie ever made.,10,20 June 2004,"Why do I say this movie is perfect? If you pay attention through the terrific acting and the devastating drama you'll not only be blown away by the characters and the story, but you'll realize that every scene was absolutely necessary - and absolutely on target. It might not seem that way for the first half of the movie, but when it's over, there's not a scene you would or could delete. Necessary for what? Necessary for understanding how the 3 very different friends handled the stresses and horrors they faced in Vietnam. De Niro the loner: socially uncomfortable, even awkward, but with a strong, primitive sense of honor and clarity - ready to face what comes. John Savage, the opposite: dependent on civilization and his friends for comfort and for his sense of self - needing the courage supplied by a last-minute marriage to give him strength for what's coming. Christopher Walken with a foot in both worlds, but not completely of either world: the only other person De Niro will hunt with - but he prefers the trees to the killing; the socially deft yet unable to commit love interest to Meryl Streep. The character of each is fired in the kiln of a brutal, sadistic Vietnam, and who they were inexorably predicts who they become. You won't find it done better, or ringing more true. There are other highlights, as well. The transition from the quiet, melancholy bar scene on the night before they leave for Vietnam to mid-assault, complete with roaring helicopters and plumes of napalm fire, rates as the best scene cut I've ever seen. Not a jump out and scare you cut, but a brutal juxtaposition of arguably the most and least human of human activities. The hopelessness of the common people in war is poignantly depicted by the exhausted, destitute refugees trudging in endless lines down dusty roads while frighteningly impersonal metal monsters, chuk-chuk-chuking their rotors, pass scant yards overhead. From peace to war, from touching tenderness to fierce determination, this movie is simply an amazing statement of what humanity is about.

Most are by folks who have not the slightest idea about what the Vietnam War was like, but are quick to call this one of the ""best"". Cimino 's choice of backdrop for the characters in the movie was very well done...However, he miserably fails in many aspects of the military service of the three characters. From Michael's full beard, to the inaccuracies of his uniform, to the amount of time lapse in the movie, it is all bothersome to me, not to mention the ""russian roulette"" sequences with Nick near the end...there doesn't seem to be evidence that this ever happened in real life. All the above having been said, I believe Meryl Streep gives a wonderful performance as someone who was left behind during the war and suffered from the effects.

Afterwards, take in a Stiller game, an' that.It's good for a couple of things: one, it's good essay on what Vietnam soldiers had to deal with, especially for being so soon after the war. (Only 3 years after Saigon). It does a very good job of demonstrating the effects of post-traumatic stress, and the different ways that different people cope with it (or don't cope with it). After watching it, I hope you have a renewed appreciation for what our soldiers went through over there. Whether or not you agree with the purpose of the Vietnam war, our boys deserve our respect and admiration for their sacrifices.Another thing that it's good for is seeing the legendary Pittsburgh steel industry shortly before it collapsed in 1979. There are still a few mills running near Pittsburgh, but nothing like in the past (keeping in mind that Pittsburgh, which is not a large city, produced more steel than Germany and Japan combined during WWII, and the ""Smokey City"" was often dark at 3:00 in the afternoon). Pittsburgh natives will find a bit of nostalgia in this movie, at least, those who are old enough to remember the steel era. There is also a fairly good look inside the Polish culture that is very much alive in Pittsburgh. Polka music is common at large events, like air shows.All in all, a very good movie that provides good insight on several different aspects of life: trauma, culture, love, and loss.",The Deer Hunter

""Coming Home"" which was one of the contenders for Best Picture for that year should have won as it was a far better movie and quite possibly may have won if Jane Fonda wasn't in it. In any case Deer Hunter was a big disappointment, for me anyway. DeNiro as usual played over the top when he should have been low key but then again I was never a big fan of his. Chris Walken on the other hand is one of the greatest actors of out time and his supporting Oscar was well deserved. In fact the movie could have been edited down by an hour with more concentration on Walken's character. Another thing that bothers me is the way they dressed DeNiro up as though he were Audie Murphy. He was drafted along with his buddies which meant a two year hitch and he wears a three year chevron on his arm and the ""time in combat"" hashes on his other sleeve show at least three years of combat???.

It is void of all these facets. Instead, it explores only the ugly facts, aftermaths and most importantly the running theme : the mortality of man (""one bullet is enough"" for the deer and the Russian roulette) that can not be compromised by our generic protagonists performing heroic acts in slow-mo. Whether the Russian Roulette scenes are accurate portrayals or not can be argued; if the credibility of the these scenes bother the realists amongst us then that is certainly a point that needs to be respected. On the other hand, if we are to perceive this game as an allegory (as I think was intended, judging by the lack of any actual war scenes of substance), we have an all-encapsulating notion of war as a game of chance that our characters are subjected to and the traumatic affects it has on their perception of life (Nicky needing to repeat this action).

478,zephead,De Niro's best; a breathtaking film that must be seen,10,21 July 1999,"The Deer Hunter is perhaps the greatest De Niro movie ever made, and that is saying a lot.  However, it is so much more than a De Niro movie.
Once you see this Cimino masterpiece (the only watchable movie by the one-hit wonder director) you will have a irrepressible urge to see it again, despite it being three hours long.  Thankfully I was not in 'nam , so I cannot comment on how realistic the film's portrayal of war is, but I can comment on how realistic the characters in the movie are.  Seldom do films take you so deep into a character's personality and make them as real as this movie does.I have never watched a movie scene as haunting as the roulette scene in The Deer Hunter.  De Niro was at his absolute best, so if you are reading Deer Hunter reviews because you admire De Niro's work, you cannot be a fan without seeing this scene.  This movie also contains Christopher Walken's undisputed finest work as well.The Deer Hunter is very well written, with every minute of every scene being crucial to the viewer's final take on the movie.  Watch this movie in an environment that allows you to take in its breadth and magnificence without distraction.  I've talked to some people who found the wedding scene to be boring, but to say that is an atrocity!  The wedding scene is so important to the rest of the movie (especially the conversation with the 'nam vet) that I cannot possibly describe it in words.If there is such a thing as a perfect movie, this would be it, along with the likes of Bridge on the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, and Five Easy Pieces. If you like good movies, you have know choice but to see The Deer Hunter.",The Deer Hunter
479,godmovingoverwater,One Shot,8,3 October 2002,"Brilliant and depressing film.  This isn't intended to be a 'Summer Blockbuster' or 'War Movie' - rather it's a character study showing the effects of the Vietnam War on a group of small town steel workers.These Vets didn't go on to be ping-pong champions, or shrimp boat captains. They died, were left crippled, and were emotionally traumatised.
Many reviewers have dismissed the film on the basis of a very long intro scene.  Without the wedding scene, we would have no idea what the lives of the characters were like before the effects of the war.  The wedding is simply a vehicle that allows us to explore in depth the characters lives (even if a few of the characters are quite shallow).  It is a complete circle, De Niro becomes the Vet he meets at the wedding.The ending scene at the wake, where everyone sings ""God Bless America"" is one of the most gripping scenes in modern film history.  The loss of youth, innocence, and idealism fully explored in a film made only 5 years after the fall of Saigon - when the wounds of the war were still all too fresh on the American psyche.A great film, but perhaps too complicated for a modern audience looking for a series of spectacular actions scenes packed into 90 minutes.",The Deer Hunter

481,Altmaniac,Great Movie,9,3 April 2001,"The Deer Hunter is a fairly unique movie.  This is because, unlike several films I could mention, it makes you care about the characters before getting into the plot.  That makes the Vietnam scenes all the more harrowing. Not that the Russian Roulette scene isn't horrendous enough as it was. Michael Cimino struck gold here and Streep, Deniro, and Walken are all quite good (I don't necessarily agree with Walken getting the oscar but that's another story).  One thing to remember is that this movie isn't *just* about the Vietnam war, however, it's also about community and friendship (you'll notice that comparitively more aciton happens in the town then in the war itself) as well as an excellent portrayal of the sense of isolation that hte returning vets had.  This movie isn't really for everyone but if you have the time (it's just over 3 hours long) it's definetly worth at least a look.",The Deer Hunter
482,stuartandrews-1,Not a classic in the 21st century!,5,4 February 2007,"There are some films that you can appreciate 30 years on, and there are others that tell of an era and of an opinion that is no longer transferred to subsequent generations. For me this is neither a tale of Vietnam action , and the extreme effect it has on the innocent like Apocalypse Now; and neither a tale of the homegrown American who leaves behind their romantic but humdrum mid-western existence only to be thrown into the worst of people's nightmares like Platoon. The Deer Hunter stays too long on the home life of the main characters, and for me fails to explain their true relationship, because not all of them go to war! The beginning of the film really drags on once you realise that the wedding scene is played out in full detail. It felt like I'd spent a whole day at the wedding. Yes we'd discovered some new revelations about the characters, but for a film that was 3 hours long, the beginning could have been more succinct. It is the fact that the script labours too long on the home life and not enough time on the war, and the aftermath that leaves me thinking that this ""classic"" piece of cinematography doesn't really cut it in the 21st century. If you take Gone with the Wind (some 68 years old), the script is so strong that you can relate to the individuals, feel the tension throughout the whole drama and come away feeling emotive. But with The Deer Hunter, (sarcastically) it was neither an intense Deer hunting film or a good Vietnam Movie. It just did both interpersonal relationship and Vietnam war OK, but neither exemplary. I recommend watching it for some classic movie moments, mostly in Vietnam. But be prepared to be distracted with boredom until you get to those scenes, some 1.5 hours in. 5/10.",The Deer Hunter

Many people criticise the wedding scene lasting so long, but it is exactly because of this you build up an understanding,raport even loathing of the characters.And the scene in the bar just before they go to war, is this not what celluloid was invented for? No, this not a war movie , its a movie about the depths and heights of humanity.And De Niro has never been better.An out and out classic, miss it at your peril.",The Deer Hunter
484,sulaymen,A Human Heritage,10,15 September 2008,"The experiences of war and of killing and of an individual's life after having lived through the decision to die are things that the vast majority of us cannot have an intimate knowledge of. At the moment, our society is too far removed from that kind of direct experience. Nonetheless, a good film cast and crew has the capacity to remind the viewer that such experiences are part and parcel of our human heritage.I have to say heritage because without immediate experience, what else could it be that allows us to be so moved by a film like The Deer Hunter? Whether we, in our relatively safe and sanitised society, are able to recognise it or not, our pasts are filled with the violence of those who survived. Perhaps this is the source of our intense reactions upon watching The Deer Hunter. That is to say, the costs of violence and death have been embedded deep into our human psyche.This is a movie that transcends any notion of film genre. It is most certainly NOT a movie about the 'Vietnam War'. Don't be mislead by those who would lead you into thinking about and judging this movie on the basis of their own quasi-political message. Small minds see small facts. The facts of The Deer Hunter are the performances of it's actors and actresses. In a movie like this, these are the only facts worth considering.The Deer Hunter is about consequence! Forget the critics who decry the almost hour long wedding scene and claim that such a scene serves no narrative purpose. Fools, those critics be! The lot of them. Anything that creates space for the heart to be able to reflect serves the narrative purpose. This film explores the contrast between ignorance (innocence?) and the finality of death. It explores the decision to die - and to live. Far be it for the director to have to sanitise the movie by colouring death's finality for us. Action from the very first eliminates the space for reflection and without such reflection we find the fatal error of so many war movies.How many reading this review (and more importantly, watching the movie) are prepared to voluntarily end their own lives for the sakes of their friends? I shuddered when this question was thrust upon me. A lack of honesty at this junction of the film will serve to remind the viewer of The Deer Hunter's value.Consequences exist for all of our actions. Some of them, or should I dare say, the majority of them, are seemingly inconsequential or at the least, are easily hidden. The Deer Hunter reminds us that some of the consequences of our decisions have a long history and cannot be so easily forgotten.",The Deer Hunter

Maybe I am not nuanced enough to pick-up on the intricacies of the plot, or seasoned enough to appreciate the film – I mean with devoting a major scene to pulling over to pee – it might have just went over my head Of course, I have heard about this movie for many years, and I assumed I had an idea of what it was about, then I realized I didn't really know. So, with great anticipation I starting watching, and waiting for this great masterpiece to unfold, however it NEVER happened. The movie seemed disjointed, and made little sense.

It is not a movie that you get the family together on a Friday or Saturday night to watch. It takes a great deal of maturity to sit and watch this movie. This movie is a classic. If you have never seen Robert DeNiro outside of Mob Classics and Comedies, this is excellent example of how great this actor really is at his craft. He was nominated for Best Actor and he should have won. The supporting cast is just as great.

To show prepare for his Oscar-winning role, he had a diet that consist of only rice and bananas(Can you imagine going through with that diet?.

490,scsemmler,Simply the greatest war movie ever made. 10/10,10,6 December 2003,"If there is one type of movie that I have grown critical of over the years, it would be the mass amount of war movies and their lack of substance. It seems as if every war movie that is released is competing in a game of trying to one up the last by showing a more fantastic way to kill someone. I find this quite sad; not because of the use of images to capture an audience, but because I feel we lose a real understanding of why wars are fought.  In the midst of all of these supposed great war movies critics throw at us every year, there are very few that have reached and tried to explain what war really is and how it affects humanity.  Not only do I believe that The Deer Hunter is the greatest war movie ever to do this, but I also think it has one of the most affecting scenes for the audience to watch in movie history.  This movie uses a symbolic device to drive the movie in an emotional way that never tries to preach, and instead gives the audience a glimpse of what war can do to humanity an many levels.  War movies are special because they can quantify so much about life and death that other types of movies cannot, but this also places higher expectations for the genre itself.  The Deer Hunter provides some of the finest acting that any movie will ever be able to offer, and will be sure to transform you in some way.",The Deer Hunter
491,Sentinela,Masterpiece movie scene,9,31 March 2007,"I am talking about the Russian Roulette scene, possibly one of the few individual movie scenes vying for ""best ever"" status. For me, Michael Cimino has reached film greatness in making this gripping, haunting and unbearably, emotionally charged episode. His direction is flawless, down to the minute facial expressions and body movements of even the least important of the secondary characters. The atmosphere of total despair, when the value of human life is brought down to no value at all, is suffocating. Perhaps only stories of survivors from the Nazi Death Camps carry a similar aura. And in the relatively short duration of this inferno-on-film, Cimino takes us through the unfolding stories of his three heroes: Stevie/Savage cracking down under the immense and inhuman pressure, Nick/Walken beginning the process of being gripped by the black dog of madness, and then there is Michael/DeNiro. The viewer - no matter if male, female, straight or not - cannot help but fall in love with this on-screen person, this tower of strength and humanity. If you are ever to be in real dire straights, if you are ever to walk in the valley of the shadows - you pray to your creator to send a Michael/DeNiro to stand by you. I have rated this movie a 9 because it is not a perfect movie, however the Roulette scene reaches beyond perfection, and into the realm of true greatness.

The fact that the steel town scenes and especially the wedding would have taken place around 1967-69 but every one's dressed in late 70s fashions has late 70s haircuts. I know there's such a thing as artistic licence but this goes way beyond that and surely this type of film needs realism and accuracy to make it work.Ironically I liked the first few minutes of them working at the steelworks and knocking-off into the half light - very atmospheric and well done but from then on in - what a waste of time.",The Deer Hunter
493,llegacyl,Fiction is Stranger than Truth,7,13 June 2020,"Deer Hunter is one of those movies that I had heard about since I was a teenager in the 1990s, yet one I had not seen till now for no real reason. It is often heralded, along with ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), ""Platoon"" (1986) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), as one of the quintessential movies about the Vietnam Era. However, while all those movies are acclaimed as classics for their innate authenticity in one way or another, ""Deer Hunter"" is not. Especially the central motif of the movie -- Russian roulette -- which the film uses as the metaphor for the entire Vietnam War experience, is just as concocted as the alleged military service of the once-acclaimed-but-now-lampooned director, Michael Cimino. According to the co-writer Deric Washburn, Cimino's lies about both his service time and his involvement in the Vietnam War were at least partially responsible for the movie even getting made in the first place. However, this lack of actual experience, and the lack of desire to find out, also colored the film's portrayals of the Vietnam War and the entire era surrounding it.To the movie itself, this is a quintessential three act play. The first act sets up the characters. It does this wonderfully by showing the main characters interacting with their environment, mainly through the community at the wedding of one of the main characters, Steve (John Savage), and then with groups of friends who go out into the woods for some good old titular fun (as in deer hunting). Here, the movie points out that not everyone in this idealistic working world is a ""good"" person as Stan (John Cazale) is shown to be unorganized and a jerk, who likes to point his unloaded gun at people. This motif recurs frequently in the film.The second act flips this narrative on its head and sends three of our six boys (well actually men, and, to be frank, men too old to play the characters they are playing, but the acting is so good it doesn't really matter) off to Vietnam. The Vietnam segments, where Viet Cong act like the most stereotypical ruthless, maniacal villains that have ever been put to celluloid, are really only decent in the sense that they provide the perfect foil for the first act. In terms of almost everything that happens, however, it is purely a fiction of the mind of Cimino. This is a place where the people are savage, the savageness can infect even the most ""civilized"" westerner, and the consequences are either a ruined life or death. This can be seen briefly with the interaction with The Green Beret that is drinking at the bar during the wedding sequence in the first act. The most informative scene in act two is just about half way through the movie's 3-hour run time -- the infamous Russian roulette torture scene. The three main characters are captured and forced to play the deadly game against each other and other South Vietnamese troops. The Viet Cong are then tricked to give enough bullets in the gun to initiate their own ruin and the escape of our heroes. They are eventually saved, but they are broken and battered.Thus we enter the third act. The trials of the characters through this figurative hell leaves one of the friends with PTSD (presumably, though it is not noted in the film), another with the loss of his legs, and the third with a loss of his mind. Michael (Robert De Niro), who seemingly has PTSD, is mostly functional; however, his life is completely upside down -- he doesn't want to go to his ""Welcome Home"" party, he is unable to kill a deer when he is back hunting with his friends, and he nearly kills Stan because he is tired of him messing around by pointing what he thinks is an unloaded gun at the other friends. Steven is broken physically after losing his mobility, he feels he is not accepted anymore in society and resists returning home, instead desiring to stay in the hospital. But, while the first friend may have lost his personality, and the second lost his body, it is Nick (Christopher Walken) who is most broken. He completely loses his mind and becomes a different person. He winds up playing Russian roulette for money in Vietnam. When Michael goes back to retrieve him, he hardly registers that Michael is standing in front of him and he continues to perform his duty of playing the suicidal game. The movie inevitably ends exactly where you think it will.Once into the third act it is more about the way the characters are interacting with each other rather than what is happening in the plot. This is probably the best part of the movie and provides some of the best performances throughout the film. The characters are well-crafted, and, despite some of the stereotypes, they still provide interesting societal commentary and insightful character arcs to delve into. The length of the movie is somewhat necessary as it gives enough time for each character arc to breathe and adjust as their stories unfold. However, the hour long wedding scene seems extended for no other reason than they had the footage to provide a full hour.I'm not going to lie, there are some extremely racist tropes in this movie, and it certainly feels outdated in this respect. However, while the movie is certainly not a historical document that can give the particulars of the era, it is a movie that provides a character of study for war time and shows how traumatic experiences affect people differently. If you want to see a good Vietnam War movie, then go watch one of the three movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. If you want an interesting character study, and can understand the context of the movie with the times in which it was made, then click on this one and give it a go.",The Deer Hunter

I grew up in a household where I was not allowed to watch Jane Fonda or watch Joan Baez when she sang on the Muppet Show. My dad was not a gung-ho warrior but instead, he never really spoke about Vietnam. This film defines the grim ironies of what it was to be an American in 1978. Our politicians led us down a tangled path of atrocities in Vietnam, Chile, Cambodia, and yes, even our own country. Ultimately, so many people's lives were destroyed in the process. The enduring friendship of these people in this film is the binding theme which is the ""heart"" of the story. However, each individual is forever changed by the Vietnam War. One loses his life, another his limbs and the third, his innocence. The rest of friends left behind in America are faced with a variety of bewildering circumstances. There are broken lives which may never be pieced back together.

I dated Viet Nam vets who one even to this day, have nightmares and flashbacks of the carnage they experienced. One who is 61 years old, was spat on when he returned from the war by a anti-war college student, and called a baby killer. I didn't watch this movie when it came out, because I heard it was an authentic portrayal of the war, and it was. It was gripping, well acted and disturbing. Just like I knew it would be. The acting was top notched. The scarred bodies and psyches of the soldiers was authentic. The effect was disturbing. I fight back the tears as I write this. I score it a 9 only because I did not watch the whole film. I think about how only recently the President finally welcomed these boys home, 37 years after the fall of Saigon.

499,chrisgcomputers,Deep Emotional Impact',9,22 August 2013,"Watch this film. The film speaks to the lives we live and i think the director is making a point about free will, or the concept of it. There are choices we get to make in life, and there are situations that are thrust upon us that we have no control over. Going to Vietnam, Getting married, Being the type of hunter who is majestic and believes in a principle ( one shot ) or runs around like a sloppy drunk shooting nonsense into the air... these are the choices that we make in our life. Then there is the gun. You have no choice on if the bullet is in the chamber, or if it is not. The only choice you should have is if you play the game, that choice was taken from these young men which effected them all differently. 1) De Niro plays the idealistic character, the type who believes in things more important than hedonistic pleasure. This is why when he hunts, he uses the one bullet belief, and there is a moment between him and his prey. 2) Walken plays the agnostic type view, he neither hates nor loves the idealism of De Niro, but instead takes no stance on it at first and simply reflects on the beauty of the tree's and wondering if he is an asshole or not. 3) Steve: forget the actor's name, but he represents the boy who never really became a man, his thoughts are never deeply explored, but his actions reveal his thoughts, that he neither holds idealism or can rely strictly on self reflection and earthly delights. the effects of Gun on each:De Niro: De Niro's idealism goes out the window when presented with life or death questions, he is the closest to being a theist in his views and becomes an atheist in that murky rat filled water. We know this when he tells Walken they are going to abandon Steve. De Niro throws any sense of idealism out the window from then on out, and realizes that we cannot make and uphold our's or anyone else's ""rules""... that we only have choices and reactions to our situations. De Niro's abandonment of his idealism is what saves him, and why he does not kill the deer at the end, he has learned that life it's self, or the joy of the hunt is the true purpose, and not the idealism of actually killing your prey with one shot. Walken: Walkens character at first can deal with the situation, but becomes stuck in that moment and cannot escape it. He has no idealism to loose, and now the beauty of the tree's has gone, and he has nothing left but self reflection. He cannot get past why the bullet was not in the chamber for him, and must repeat the situation until he feels he has taken control back over his life, of course he can only do this by ending his life. Steve: Steve being the eternal boy he is needs to be saved, cracks first, and is dependent on everyone else. In the end we realize our own traditions and idealism or lack there of lead us to certain points, some we can over come and some we cannot. De Niro comes out the best because he see's this and reacts to it, Walken and Steve are forever stuck in that moment. This is how the movie effected me personally.",The Deer Hunter

The only movie that even comes close to affecting you as much as this film is Requiem for a Dream. If you haven't seen The Deer Hunter, do yourself a favor and go see it. It's guaranteed to be one of, if not the most memorable film you will ever see.*The only reason i gave this a 9/10 is because there are some pretty glaring flaws with the realism of the war scenes, but they are so minor to the overall effect of the film that they don't really matter.",The Deer Hunter

Act 6: The burialThe movie is almost as boring as ""Dances with wolves"" as it is not able to tell a real story, but at least it has DeNiro and Walken (1 star for each of them). Sorry, but I have to take one star away for Meryl Streep. She was nominated for the Academy award - for this? No wonder she didn't win. Streep played but one role all of her life: Meryl Streep. She doesn't look good, her acting lacks depth, any third-class actress could play that. She is so... average.She really won 3 Oscars ? Wow, mediocrity awards, I guess. Okay, enough talk about bad actresses. I'll give the star back for Myers' wonderful score.

Choose one to write a response to in here and be sure to tell me what your user-name is so I can see your review.#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism. #2. The different personalities of the three men (Steve, Mike and Nick) before they go to Vietnam and how it serves them as soldiers. Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently?#3. What's the deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon? What is this character suppose to symbolize?#4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick?

There are problems with the pace of the film, making some moments feel unearned. And the representation of the Vietnam war is ludicrous, not an ounce of truth to be found. I suppose that it is not the film intention to be a war film but the thing is that it fails miserably at its true objective. There are films like Born on the 4th of July that have made a perfect role in translating the scars and social rupture of the war in the USA landscape.",The Deer Hunter

So, naturally, i was delighted when my dad bought it me.I sat down and watched it but to be honest i found it never really got going. It looked professionally done, the portrayal of Vietnam and the conditions the US troops faced were superb and i accepted for almost the entirety of the movie that we were being built up to a superb ending, only to be throughly underwhelmed when i realised it was over.De Niro worked well with what he was given and his performance was riveting in some of the Russian Roulette scenes, as was Walken's. However, in general i thought their roles weren't backed up properly and instead were dragged down by a lacklustre plot and a slow pace with unnecessary segments of script.Overall, a good idea just not pulled off properly and i feel it's true potential was never really released.6/10.",The Deer Hunter
506,hudsonclarksmith,A Superb Piece of Filmmaking,10,12 November 2016,"""The Deer Hunter"" is a superb film with great emotional prowess and courage. It is a story of three friends in a rural town and their lives, from wedding to funeral, and the impact the Vietnam war had on them.For proof that Robert De Niro is one of the greatest actors of his generation, look no further than the Russian roulette scene in this film. This scene is terrifying, gut-wrenching, and magnificently acted. Very rarely in film do you see the kind of emotional power that De Niro brings in this scene. His hatred towards these soldiers who kidnapped him are real, so real, in fact, that it makes you forget that these are all just actors.The film realizes that to make a great war film, you do not focus on the war but the characters. The characters are who we connect with through the chaos. I suppose most war films are about pushing regular people to their limits, whether it be physically or emotionally. The Deer Hunter is so great because it does not go right into the action. It takes its time to set up the characters and setting so that when they are thrown into Vietnam, we understand who they really are, not just some soldiers. They are real people with real lives and real friends and real homes. This makes everything that happens on the battlefield more emotionally impactful.The way the film's world is perceived is a very interesting aspect of the movie. In the film, we view the world completely from the characters' perspective. We get to see the world exactly as our characters do. We see nothing of any other place besides their little town until, of course, they are taken into the war. It's an extremely smart choice. The exclusion of any place other than their small Pennsylvania town really brings us into the characters' lives. And when they are dropped off into the unfamiliar, unforgiving land of Vietnam, there is no smooth transition. We are brought there without any preparation or warning, just like the characters in the film.One of my favorite things about film in general is that it can be interpreted in so many ways. When Robert De Niro's character gets back from Vietnam, he still wears his uniform wherever he goes. You could think that this means that he hasn't really come back from the war, he's still there emotionally. Or maybe you could just interpret it as him being proud of serving his country. Or you could think of it as him feeling like he has nothing left. No matter how you interpret it, there's no right or wrong.If I had to point out some kind of flaw, it'd be that the pacing is a little off at times. What I mean by that is at some points the film feels boring, like nothing is really going on. Perhaps that's just because of its age, but the film is 3 hours long, a very long run time even by 1978 standards.In the end, ""The Deer Hunter"" more than deserved its 5 Oscar wins. Its performances are real, gritty, and emotionally powerful. A film that I would highly recommend, it is a masterpiece of filmmaking.",The Deer Hunter
507,souvik_das_pwc,An excellent movie (Vietnam shown or not),7,20 September 2005,"Be Vietnam in focus or not, it is an excellent movie on life's changing faces. From a life full of fun and daily doses of sobs, to a life of distress and death - it has aptly covered it all with a vision. Could have been shorter in length. Could have been more crisp in the first part. The marriage ceremony was dragged a bit longer. However, the director might have wanted to show the slow pace of life in a small town. Could have evoked more emotions (like Life is Beautiful) with more human touch on the central characters.Robert De Nero's performance is flawless. Same complements go for all others. Perhaps the best scene was De Nero's inability to shoot the deer after he came back from the war.",The Deer Hunter

There is no character development and not that much character revelation. The time sequence makes no sense in terms of what is omitted except for the cut to the next intense scene, however improbable the sequence. Because the intensity is pointless, it is boring. The hunting scenes are a farce -- trust me, there are no deer in mountain goat territory. There are 20 seconds of re-watchable violence. Apparently, it was always winter in Pennsylvania back in those days. The 'Russian-American culture' wedding scene was fun. The only likable character is a bartender.It is Hollywood all the way.

510,apm7,It is hard to imagine a worse movie!,1,29 December 2006,"Those other negative comments that suggest that maybe this movie was good when it came out, but hasn't aged well, are dead wrong! I waited in line to see it on Opening Night in 1978. As a Vietnam veteran and a huge DeNiro fan, I was really looking forward to the first big movie about Nam. And it was as hideous, boring, exploitive, senseless, and unrealistic that night as it is now! They're going to Nam the next day?!? Without any kind of basic training or anything? The Walken character survives how many years playing Russian roulette?? How does DeNiro get away with that beard in Special Forces? I knew many soldiers from Western Pennsylvania steel mills, but not one with Walken's blow-dried hair-do that not even New York dancers were wearing till the late '70s! Okay, so let's suspend disbelief and not criticize its lack of anything vaguely realistic. In that case, we are left with a boring, long, boring, disjointed, boring, meaningless, exploitive piece of crap that had nothing whatever to do with the Vietnam War. And did I mention boring? For those who want a movie about the Vietnam War, I recommend Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and a wonderful almost-unknown Burt Lancaster movie called Go Tell The Spartans that also came out in '78. Almost every Vietnam vet I know liked Apocalypse Now -- almost all thought The Deer Hunter was crap. And Cimino's later career supplies ample evidence for that point of view!",The Deer Hunter
511,Mr_Royalewithcheese,The Deer Hunter Is Quite Possibly One Of The Greatest Movies Ever,10,22 January 2006,"The Deer Hunter takes place in Clairton, PA and follows three hometown heroes as they enter the war in Vietnam. At first, each one of them can't believe that they're actually going and are excited. But when they reach the war, each one of them gets a whole new outlook on life.Walken as Nick does an outstanding job. Nick's character changes greatly from start to finish and the last scene is the most intense in the movie.Cazale as 'Stosh' does a commendable job and it's amazing when you find out that he was sick in real life and died a few months after shooting. Cazale was a real pro in this movie.Savage as Steve has a very emotional part and one part that might be one of your favorites.Streep as Linda is the love interest of two men in the story and she does a pretty good job with her character, but nothing outstanding.Robert De Niro as Michael just stole the show. De Niro's intensity, his moxie and his desire to make the part of Michael good, shows. This is the best performance of his career beating Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, GoodFellas and The Godfather Part II. You just want to see Michael on the screen at all times, whether it be hunting or fighting for his life in Vietnam. It's a horrible shame that De Niro didn't win an Oscar for this character because he deserved it more than anyone.The Deer Hunter takes great acting, great emotion, great intensity and great sadness and puts it all into one simply amazing movie and a movie that you'll be talking about later.

Ask yourself a question: when was the last time you were so touched by a movie, that by the end of it tears started to roll down your cheek? Well, that one did it for me! Like so many people before me I got to say, this story will move you inside.From the great wedding scenes, where we meet with the characters, just to see that these boys are no different than you or me, until they go to war, and then the aftermath. I really felt for the character of Michael, played by ever so great Robert De Niro (Analyze this; Ronin); who gives performance of his life (like he doesn't every time anyway!). And don't even get me started on a character of Nick so dramatically played by Christopher Walken (remember Captain Koons in Pulp Fiction?). The most unforgettable scene is in war prison where the two best buddies from back home are put in the middle of horrifying Russian roulette.The only reason that I reached for this title was the fact, that I am a new addition to the ""cult"" following work of Robert De Niro. I am glad that I did, because coming from Europe that movie gave me that extra angle on happenings of the Vietnam era in this country.

516,jamese_uk,"Over-Hyped, Over-Long and Over on eBay Soon !!!!!",1,12 October 2002,"I purchased ""The Deer Hunter"" on the rumours of it being a ""classic"" and ""one of the greatest films ever made"" etc.People who have passed these comments can surely only be accused of jumping on the bandwagon.  Never having been a bandwagon jumper, here's my realistic assessment.It is AWFUL.  There is nigh on a hour at the beginning that could have been filmed in fifteen minutes tops.  The Vietnam war scenes are painfully brief with some appalling editing of real footage inserted willy-nilly.  The last, very long, third hour, is if anything worse.  As for the infamous Russian Roulette scenes I began to feel that the Director thought he was on to something interesting and literally ""did it to death"".Recommend it to someone you hate.  It is a TRULY poor film which the artsy-fartsy brigade have adopted as one of their own.  Well they can buy my copy from a famous online auction site from Monday.1/10 (Only 'cos there is no zero on the voting.)",The Deer Hunter
517,snake-48,Pretty good and quite original,8,20 March 2000,"That's what I call an original movie! The director chose to split the movie into 3 separate sections (before/during/after the war) and the result is very interresting to watch. Actually the 'during' part may disappoint some people, because it almost does not contain any fighting scenes (if you're one of those ""action-movie"" fanatics, go watch Saving Private Ryan instead). The movie's originality comes from the fact that it's not focusing on the war itself, but rather on the effect it has on some ordinary people.The russian-roulette scenes will remain in your memory for a long time and will produce some interesting thoughts about the very definition of war.Overall it's a good movie with incredible performances by DeNiro and Walken. However I think it would have benefited from some editing - its 3-hours length has some hollow moments and I believe that shortening it by at least 15 minutes would have been quite nice for the spectator's sake.I rate it 8/10 and highly recommend it along with such classics as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and The Thin Red Line.",The Deer Hunter
518,crumpler,"Good, very good, very long, but good.",8,28 July 2001,"The Deer Hunter lopes along like so many films from the 70s, and at first, at least for me, I felt like this one was cut long simply so that it would fit the trend of 70s film lengths.  However, if you can sit through the entire wedding reception scene and others like it, you'll start to see that Michael Cimino did in fact have a purpose.  I think it can be best understood when you take into account how short most of the Viet Nam scenes are by comparison.The point I finally got from the dragging first 2/3 of the movie was that these characters are people.  Real ones, with real lives.  It's a statement that's quickly said, but not easily made on film.  Moviegoers know to (at least on some subconscious level) expect that the characters they watch are just that-- characters.  The effect of this is that when a conflict is presented, there is only a certain amount of emotional involvement that a person is willing to forfeit to the characters.  Michael Cimino's goal here seems to be to enforce the idea that these people have real lives.  They're not over the top or ""hollywoodified"", they're just lives, and anyone who watches The Deer Hunter, if nothing else, will certainly feel like they've known these characters their whole life.  So in that sense, he does succeed.For me, The Deer Hunter, is really all about people, not Viet Nam.  Some of these people happened to go there, and they're lives were derailed because of it, but what makes it important is the fact that it happened to these people and not random soldiers.  You're thinking about these specific people and what they're going through when you watch this movie.  If Michael Cimino was making a political statement of some kind I missed it, and that, combined with the fact that the vast majority of the picture doesn't take place in Viet Nam, causes me to believe that this is not a Viet Nam movie as so many seem to classify it.Whatever it is, it's well executed.  The cast is first rate.  Christopher Walken of course won an Oscar for his role, and Deniro, Streep, & Savage all became their characters to that Nth degree necessary to make the slow pacing of the first part worth while.   So while I think it is often very shallowly classified as a Viet Nam movie (which means what exactly, anyway?), it is nevertheless an outstanding film.",The Deer Hunter

The only part of the movie worth watching was the 15 minutes actually spent in Viet Nam.  DeNiro and Walken are fine actors.  They are not to blame for my opinion of the film.  They simply were the victims of a very thin plot based upon, of all things, ""Russian Roulette"".  I feel that I need not expound on this further. If I were to continue this review any further, you might feel as though you were watching the 30 minute wedding reception contained within the movie. For heaven's sake, the tape of my wife and my wedding does not contain this much reception footage.Please spare yourself the 3 hours and 3 minutes if you have not yet seen this picture.

Definitely Walken's best, and possibly De Niro's best (Maybe tied for first with like 10 others!). I'll remember De Niro's performance and dialogue for as long as I live. (""This... is this!"")

The Vietnam War is such a dark period in American culture, one that is seldom mentioned in society today. This film does not attempt to show lots of intense war scenes that are typical in war films. This movie is so much more than a war film. It shows the results of a war gone wrong on families. And how the war not only changes the people that fight in it, but those back at home as well. Robert De Niro plays another excellent role in this film. Why he did not win an Academy Award for Best Actor is beyond me. No one can play the role of a quiet leader the way that De Niro does. Although Godfather Part II possibly will be remembered as his finest moment, to me he accomplishes more in this film because he shows his diversity as an actor. Christopher Walken is also excellent. One of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. He pulls off a very complicated role and should be remembered as one of the best supporting actor roles ever with his part as Nick in this epic. The Deer Hunter is certainly one of the Top 10 movies of all-time. It is not necessarily a film that children would like or anyone wanting to see a good action film, that is not what The Deer Hunter is about. This is a movie about the effects of war.

Platoon and Apocalypse Now gave us a good picture of what it was like to be in the war, but Deer Hunter shows us what happened after. If you are wondering whether or not you should see it, then I would definitely recommend it, just for the comparison.But The Deer Hunter is also worth a watch for just for its merit as a film. It deserves a place on all top 100 lists. I have not been this moved by a film in awhile. It's one of those films where, at the end, the credits roll and you cannot seem to stand up or turn off the TV. You have to sit there.Also, watch out for the acting. Every character is masterful, even those with only a line. You will remember them. Deniro is as great as ever. I don't think he changes his expression the entire film, and yet he makes you feel what is going on in his head. And Meryl Streep... well, she's Meryl Streep.

Not only because a great cast like Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken do such a great, highly believable acting job (which also is due to Michael Cimino's excellent directing) but also because the story about those people touches you so directly. Simple small town people with friends and family and rituals and traditions like we could have them, too. Like when we get to participate at length a wedding party, get to know the five men and their women, the focus becoming stronger on the two unlike brothers, Michael and Nick Vronsky (played by De Niro and Walken), who do share their affection for the same woman, Linda, played with great feeling and freshness by Meryl Streep. The five men enjoy their ritual of occasional deer hunting, presented in a touching scene when they quarrel over a banality, but it shows who is seriuos about himself and who isn't. And when the Vietnam War begins, it's only Michael and his brother Nick, and their friend Steve (gripping performance by John Savage), who go to fight for their country. This is when it get's uncomfortable. The psychological pressure, the damage to their souls and their all over health the audience is going to witness is undescribable. It's not a horror movie, but a psycho-thriller for sure.A perfect portrait about what Vietnam did to those three small town men, that we got to meet (like it used to be in the good old movie times, hint, hint!) and feel for and therefore get touched in a way you hardly get touched without a lot of tear-quenching, boo-hoo, violin-impregnated slo-mo-crap nowadays.

Wars sometimes have to be fought, but this piece of art work ended the myth that war is noble and about glory.

In a recent very popular TV show, one character comments to another about the reasons for our ever extending exploration of space and the universe. (Paraphrased) ""We came out of the woods, crossed the hills, saw the mountains and crossed them to go on and jump to the moon and planets, and eventually to the stars.""  It's a noble sentiment, our becoming more and more civilized and our thirst for exploration, etc., but this movie reminds me that maybe we haven't really come out of the woods yet.  -The pentimento of man.",The Deer Hunter

Did they deserve better than this contrived film? Yes.As for the Russian roulette scene? Did anything like this ever occur? Why invent something so outlandish to ""illustrate"" the atrocity of warfare. It's borderline offensive.In my final assessment, I generally don't give much weight to a movie being boring, but seriously this movie drags. The movie is weighed down by so much self-indulgence.",The Deer Hunter
533,dwlarsen,Truly Inspired Wedding Scene(s),10,15 December 2006,"There are many things to praise about The Deer Hunter. I will always treasure the lengthy wedding scenes, Cimino's ability to inspire and capture authentic drunken and emotional behavior of many characters. The ethnic charms and foibles of the community are very crisply drawn. If there were just 20 minutes of film to watch, this would be it for me. If you had ever been to such a wedding at such a time in our history, this film sends you back there with the fondest memories.This was a time of great confusion in America, and the Pennsylvania town presents a microcosm of the the spirit across the land. Too often films are set on the coasts to represent the passions of our culture. Here we have a story that draws everyone back to their personal experiences of early adulthood and the horrors of Vietnam. Characters have truly awkward experiences with each other, and communications among best friends become guarded, private and threatening. Deniro delivers an heroic performance in the pivotal role. Always see this movie with no commercial interruptions!",The Deer Hunter
534,MetOtter,quite possibly the best movie ever made,10,23 December 2001,"The Deer Hunter is a beautifully filmed and written movie.  The layers and textures of the locations, dialogue, and characters are forever burned into my memory.  While harsh and abrassive to the ears at times, one must remember the lifestyle that the movie is portraying. Robert Deniro turns in one of his top five performances of all time while Christopher Walken and John Savage still have not eclipsed their magnificent work in this film.  Meryl Streep proved she can play a plain Jane and hid her beauty so as to keep her character attainable to the steelworkers of the close knit community.  One only can wonder what wonderful work John Cazale would have continued to do if not for his untimely death. Clear three hours from your schedule and rewatch this masterpiece, and if you've never seen it...be prepared for a moving and memorable experience.",The Deer Hunter

An ornate Polish wedding is shown as a time of great celebration between all these friends we come to love so fast. The very display is reminiscent of the love that the community shares for one another.The three embark on the uncertain future, making promises before they go and to the ones they wish to return to.There is no more a powerful montage than that of the pain which is experienced by these three men over the course of their tour.The pain which follows Michael home is only magnified when he encounters Linda and his feelings for her are overwhelmed by his guilt for the broken promise to Nick.I can't imagine a story that hits home more with a newer audience. Especially now with the conflict overseas so much we see our American troops coming home jaded after a dance with the devil just as displayed in this movie. Unable to adjust, mixed feelings from a war that no one wanted. All the while trying to keep together what little pieces of their life remain after such daunting circumstances.This movie should leave you wanting for these characters and embracing the beauty around you.",The Deer Hunter

The Movie Takes The Time To Let You Know Enough About Them, So Even If A Character Name Is Mentioned, You Know Exactly Who It Is.. This Takes Place During Vietnam. And As I Said.. It's About The Affect On The ( Incredibly Believable ) Characters Portrayed.. I Like It.. But Hey.. Find Out For Yourself..",The Deer Hunter
537,HyperionM,What a fake!,1,21 April 2008,"This movie is just awful. Take away 1 scene (De Niro shooting the guards) and the average rating for this movie would probably drop 2 to 3 points. And that scene had nothing to do with the actual Vietnam war but was just sort of 'COOL'. I enjoy war flicks and Apocalypse Now is one of my all-time favorite movies.. But this movie just didn't make sense.The editing is terrible.. The wedding scene just goes on and on. I suspect it was the best footage they had shot and they just couldn't bring themselves to cut any of it. Then the war starts.. We see a brief helicopter scene and next thing we know our heroes are in a POW-camp? Excuse me?! What just happened? After that point the movie just gets progressively worse.The plot is just outrageous. You don't have to be a statistician to understand that Walken having a successful career in Russian roulette is absurd.. His successful streak ending just the moment his buddy comes looking for him makes it even more silly. I guess many people see good symbolism for war in the Russian roulette theme and thats part of why this movie scores so high... but come on, you cant reduce the Vietnam war to something that never happened in it..This movie insults my intelligence! Its a silly Hollywood action flick posing as a meaningful war drama.. and quite possibly the most overrated movie of all times!",The Deer Hunter
538,SunstreakedGirl,Thirty Years Later,9,9 October 2008,"It's 30 years now since The Deer Hunter came out. On cable (uncut) today and this is the first time I've seen it in 20 years. What a difference time has made for me.I grew up in McKeesport, about 20 mins. from Clairton (the setting of the film) is located, so I watched the beginning scenes and saw my life, my parents, their parents and so forth. In the late 70's, I was only third generation American  all four grandparents were immigrants. My great-uncles and uncles worked those steel mills. The women lived their lives to get married and have babies. The guys were a unit both from work and their fun times and the women were the same from their marriages and families.Those men and women could have been all of us  any of us  and they were. In the mid 70's this country was torn up almost beyond recognition by the Vietnam War. Never before (to my knowledge) and thank God never since have the men who served this country been so vilified over the actions of those who never had to experience the consequences of their decisions.These soldiers (used generically here) were spit on, cursed at, screamed at, and called ""baby killers"" after My Lai, in addition to things I will never even know. Yet they faced an enemy and a ""cause"" that ripples down still. They fought a people in which they could not tell friend from foe, in a language unknown to them, in a world unlike anything they could imagine, with weapons ranging from guerilla warfare to children wired as bombs.This changed them. How could it not? In fact, the above (with the exception of how returning service personnel are treated) describes what is happening today in Iraq. How depressing is that? There are comments regarding the mountains not being in Pennsylvania, that Russian Roulette was not played, that the wedding scene  a deeply bonding situation for friends, family, neighbors, i.e., LIFE, was too long  who bloody cares? It was a movie, not a documentary.Back then was when we as a country (for my generation anyway) lost its innocence and realized that to many (too many) of our leaders, we were expendable.And, by the way, when they sang God Bless America it wasn't for cheese, it was because back then and until then, we still BELIEVED. Since then we love our country but no longer with that innocence.",The Deer Hunter

Who could ask for a better cast?  This film is defintely on of my favorites. Brilliant direction by Michael Cimino.  Brilliant acting by Robert De Niro, John Cazale, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken along with John Savage. Just a good, all around, moving film.",The Deer Hunter

542,joyfullfunk,A brilliant and powerful film,10,3 May 2003,"One of the most brilliant and powerful movies I have ever seen. Astonishing performances by Robert De Niro, Chrisotpher Walken, Merryl Streep, and John Savage. De Niro steals the show. He creates a character that is totally believable, seemless and humane. One of the great flawed protagonists of all time. He's not the epic hero that many moviegoers demand. He's human, he's in love with his best friend's girl, he doesn't know how to save his friends, yet everyone looks to him as the leader of the group. This is my favorite and, in my opinion, the best of De Niro's incredible career. This movie is at times a celebration of life, a powerful anti war movie, a story of tragic loss and true friendship. The scenes with the Russian roulette are some of the most intense scenes I have ever watched. De Niro takes acting to new heights in these scenes. And the ending of the movie, with everyone singing God Bless America is touching and the perfect way to conclude. The movie will stay with you long after you have viewed it. Great direction by Michael Cimone. 10 out of 10 without a doubt. One of the greatest not only war movies but overall dramas of all time.",The Deer Hunter
543,rocker79,just the best,10,9 March 2003,"This sure is supreme movie;movie gives you a main detail about vietnam, not like the other vietnam movies;except Platoon! I like it all from the first minute to the last ,lot of people says that marriage scene is too long...that is not true!!You can see how mindless were three friends before going to nam, you can see their happiness because they didn't know where will they go! Specialy wedding is important because movie have a lot of moments which you wouldn't undestand if wedding would be shorter;when Angela lose a drop of wine....because if she wouldn't everything maybe wouldn't be so black in the future;and you can see that Michael like Linda(Merly Streep) for the first time....and don't like other girls ..all this is shown on the wedding! I like scene when Stan wan't to borrow Michael shoes and his last answer is:""hey stan....i said no!""..here you can see that Michael really has his own sense of ""surviving""!! Everything Michael do have meaning!!I like it also Christopher Walken as Nick;i like him at the wedding when he approach linda and says:""if...when we'll come back"", i like when he correct him self first if then when...i think that in this moment he fell (just a little) that maybe would be better to stay home in clairton. And scene about russian roulette is just beautiful ,where also John Savage as Steven shows what he do in this movie. When Michael come back from nam you can see resemblance with the gren bare man at the bar. When Michael come back to the Nam to look out for Nick....you can remember the promise which Michael gave to the nick just after the wedding. So i can easily say that a like all actors from this movie specialy de niro(i relly think that he DEFENETLY deserve Oscar for this movie too,Walken,Meryl Streep and John Savage)At the end all i can say about that movie is one simple word:PERFECTED",The Deer Hunter

The best scene from wedding is definately when Angela lose a drop of wine,where you can already expect problems in Vietnam. Michael have much thoughts about Linda at the wedding but i don't mean just when they go to a drink but only their looks in the dancing crowd. When Nick ask to marry Linda he asks:""if....when we'll come back"";i like this sentence because he corrects himself, and there you feel that maybe he found out just for a moment that maybe he would be better to stay home in clairton.I just think that all this couldn't be shown in 15 or 20 minutes.",The Deer Hunter

Nick tells Mike that he loves the town they live in. He makes Mike promise that he won't leave him over in Vietnam. Mike promises to bring Nick back whether he is dead or alive. These men are as close as brothers.In Vietnam, the men get separated and then met back up. Mike gets Steve and Nick out of the prisoner of war camp with his sheer strength and brain power. When the men get separated again, Mike sees Nick playing Russian Roulette, but Mike cannot get Nick to stay with him. Mike goes home without Nick and feels extremely bad about it. He knows he broke his promise to Nick and he has a hard time facing his friends.Mike realizes Nick is still alive when he goes to visit Steve and sees all the money Steve is receiving in the mail. Right away he knows it is Nick sending the money he has won in Russian Roulette to Steve. Mike goes back to Vietnam because he made that promise to Nick and he feels the guilt of breaking the promise. He knows Linda needs Nick and he needs his friend too.When he finds Nick, Nick is still playing Russian Roulette. Nick has been doing drugs and is pretty messed up. He doesn't seem to remember Mike at first. The only way Mike can talk some sense into Nick is if he plays him in Russian Roulette. They play and Mike is too late because Nick finally has reached the end of his luck and he shoots himself in the head. Mike has to live with the guilt of leaving for the rest of his life, but at least he knows he went back to try and save his best friend. At least he kept the promise to bring Nick home even if he was in a casket.",The Deer Hunter
546,katriona-1,Greater than the sum of its parts.,9,7 November 2010,"I have seen The Deer Hunter 7 or 8 times over the years, and have grown into middle age while it's characters (and actors) remain eternally youthful, and the film always leaves me shaken and near tears. Reading some of the reviews of people who were less than impressed with it, I can see many of their objections as valid. The film is very long. The script is sometimes inchoate, incoherent, and clichéd. The pace lulls you, then yanks you forward. Some plot points are certainly in the realm of coincidence,and the ending is very ambiguous.But the film becomes a country in your mind. The slow start allows you to know these people in the most intimate way. If the script is clumsy and clichéd, it is because the characters are small town people, not adept at tossing off bon mots, and their own experience of movies informs how they express themselves, in ways that are no less sincere for being derivative.The disjointed pacing makes the viewer struggle to follow the story, experiencing the same dislocation and alienation as the three men. And coincidence does happen in life, which is what makes life remarkable.( Charles Dickens used coincidence continuously to great effect!)I think the Cimino's genius in this film was casting superb actors, and giving them the opportunity to breathe in these roles. He shot tons of coverage, and you have the impression that the actors lived, breathed and dreamed in character. Their commitment to the characters they inhabit bridge the gap created by a less than ""perfect"" screenplay--in fact it makes you feel that every second in this long, lurching movie is absolutely inevitable, totally right and completely necessary to a proper understanding of these people.In fact, the spare script is a simply a vessel that holds these burning performances, and allows the actors room to live in the film. I had the same feeling after the first time I saw this film, as I did with Manon of the Spring, that I had known these people all my life. They take up a very large place in my psyche. I love them, with all their faults and their dreams. They simply don't make films like this anymore! As far as ambiguity is concerned, I'm comfortable with that. A friend of mine from Australia once described his view of American films:""First, they tell you what they're going to tell you, then they tell you, then they tell you what they told you."" Kudos to Cimino for leaving his characters, (and us) on the razor's edge of uncertainty, after everything they believed in (except each other) has been devastated by war and loss.The tenderness the characters show each other in the final scenes of the film is transcendently beautiful and poignant, and more important than a well-formulated conclusion.There are no lessons to be learned here, just life unfolding itself in front of you. A very rare experience in cinema.",The Deer Hunter
547,harper131,Opened my eyes,10,7 April 2013,"Recently re-watched this film. It remains truly awesome though inevitably time has changed things. I first saw this as a 17 year old, some 30+ years ago. My views on the world, war and conflict were naive and immature, informed upon by films/movies and not history or fact. The side of the good we're always good and justified, and the side of the bad the opposite. When I saw this film I did not speak for 3 days afterwards. And I was a talkative individual! It metaphorically blew my mind and I did some rapid growing up. It was almost a coming of age moment.To see the film again reminds me of that experience more than the film itself remaining as hard hitting. Not sure in the present age this film could achieve for a teenager as it did for me. The violence, both physical and emotional, is often over represented in modern features such that the images portrayed in The Deer Hunter would not have the same impact. The truth of bipartite atrocity in conflict is well recognised. Society appreciates, though not always with sympathy, the lifelong impact of conflict on both protagonists and those left behind.This will always be a 10 out of 10 film for me but I can appreciate why anyone under the age of 40 might fail to understand why!",The Deer Hunter

I will admit however that I found the first hour to be overlong and uninteresting, therefore causing me to knock my grade down one notch. The film picks up and becomes interesting as it moves on though. The Russian Roulette scenes in the film are some of the most intense moments in film history. Keep that in mind.Michael Cimino's Academy Award winning Vietnam epic presents us with an atmosphere of realism. Everything just seems so real; the characters, the emotions, the dialog, everything is real and very intense. This more then just a Vietnam war movie though, it is a film about friendship and courage... Under stress.",The Deer Hunter
550,crzyjeb84,More than just a War Movie,9,20 July 2005,"When I saw this film I thought that it was a movie just about the Vietnam conflict. I was wrong. The film is about how the Vietnamn War affected those who fought in it. It shows how even if you were not killed or wounded you came back a different person. It was truly one of the Best films of the 1970's. It deservingly won 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also had a incredible cast featuring break through performances from Christopher Walken as Nick, and Meryl Streep as Linda. Also not to mention a Great performance from Robert De Niro as Micheal. Another Performance which is sadly forgotten is that of John Cazale who died shortly after the film was finished. This film is truly an epic and a must see. But beware their are two Russian Roulette scenes in the movie and they are scary as hell.",The Deer Hunter
551,MitchTacyMusic,#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences,9,11 December 2012,"While this is a war movie, there are very few bullets fired, and even fewer are fired at others. Much of the film is spent playing Russian roulette, and while the American POWs weren't really forced to do this in Vietnam, it does stand as a terrific metaphor for the chances taken in wartime. During the draft, citizens were forced into the army, like the gun was forced to the characters' heads, and the longer you played the game, the less likely you were to live. You did have the option of refusing, which would get you sent to prison (symbolized here by ""the pit""), where you would eventually die anyway (spiritually, since taking that path would be giving up many privileges as an American once you got out). The last option, the one Mike and co. took, was to say no and flee before you could even put that gun to your head. To some, this may be a disgusting discrepancy to the real experiences of the war, but I find it easily forgivable; the metaphor is wholly justified, and it still gives a well-performed (if completely fabricated) account of the grim brutality of war.",The Deer Hunter

554,Whitesox400,Moved me to tears for the first time,10,25 June 2005,"This is the finest war film ever made. Rather, it is one of the finest dramas ever made that happens to involve war. Movies nowadays are more artistic than human. This was not so in the late seventies when people wanted to be brought closer to understanding people rather than be taken away on an adventure to what they never thought possible (of course 'Star Wars' changed that but that's for another story). 'The Deer Hunter' is one of the last of its kind along with 'The Godfather' where the audience is absorbed as one of the characters and winds up consoling in the end, moved by either tragedy, optimism, helplessness, love, desperation, or remorse, but I felt all of them in 'The Deer Hunter'.",The Deer Hunter

Close to the end, in the scene when George Zdunza is in the kitchen beating the eggs and he stands there crying alone, really makes my cry. He then joins the rest of the group, encourages them with his humming of God Bless America, and then he is followed by this admirable group of friends.

These scenes are unforgettable and you are on the edge of your seat for most of them. The rest of the film attempts to capture a slice of life about what it was like about living in this part of Amercia at this moment in time(during the 1960's with the Vietnam war the main issue of the times). It does this very successfully but it does so in a boring and mundane way. This film is over three hours long and I think that they could have sliced a hour off it or certainly a good bit of an hour. The filmmakers are to focused on ramming down our throat what it was like for these characters living in small town Amercia. We get what's it like. We don't need as much of it. This I think is an average film but the Russian Roulettes scenes are unforgettable. For them alone this film is worth watching.

558,oztrailyan_guy,Excellent War Time Movie,9,16 May 2005,"This movie is defiantly one of the best war time depictions that I have ever seen. I found the acting excellent. Christopher Walken's performance was superb and really brought the viewer to feel his melancholy emotions brought on by Russian roulette torture. Robert Di Niro so too played his part brilliantly showing the rapid pace of change in his characters life brought about by the Vietnam War. I found that the movie itself had an excellent build up and really provided an insight to the emotional strain that the Vietnam War had on such towns as the one featured in the film. Though the movie sometimes felt as ""slow"" at times it was not so, the movie provided an in-depth background into the comradeship of the friends. This camaraderie was shown greatest when escaping from the Vietcong and returning to Saigon at the end of the film. The cinematography was outstanding, the movie portrayed years of friendship and misfortune in just 180minutes. I particularly enjoyed the fact that original Vietnam War film footage was inserted into the movie. This brought you back to fact that this actually did happen so too that peoples lives were ruined and others left to clean up the pieces of it. The ending would also have to be one of, if not the best endings of any movie that I have viewed. All central characters are brought together and sing an American Ballad, this I believe symbolized the fact that unity was achieved through the end of a life and/or the war. Although an Australian citizen myself this movie appeals to all who had ties to the war and gives and accurate and descriptive depiction of what was the Vietnam war. I would strongly recommend this film and give it 9 and 1/2 stars.",The Deer Hunter
559,ironmetalsteele,It lost me...,1,15 July 2005,"I hired The Deer Hunter after a number of people recommended it to me. I thought they were serious. I honestly cannot believe this film is so highly regarded when nothing actually happens. There is three whole hours of nothing. I haven't been so full of hatred for a film since I was forced to watch ""the Piano"" (another very boring and overrated waste-of-space).Alright, it started out looking good and interesting, showing the very harsh conditions of a Pennsylvania steel mill. It captured my interest. That was in the first five minutes.Then, we are treated to about 55 minutes of a mind-numbingly boring wedding scene. God knows what happened to the editor, but he must have been drunk or on strike or something because what should have been a five- or ten-minute brief explanation became a drawn-out and long-winded dance scene! Next there's maybe fifteen minutes of the main characters going out into the wilderness and murdering a few animals for their own entertainment.Now we finally get into the ""war"" scenes. When I hired this film I was led to believe that it was in fact a ""war"" movie. No, it really isn't. Vietnam may be involved and feature part-way through the story, but this is definitely NOT a war movie. All we get is a few seconds of Viet Cong brutality, then a flamethrower and some American choppers dropping off a squad or two of well-equipped soldiers.All of a sudden, we are transported into some kind of Viet Cong mobile water torture station, where unfortunate American (and other Vietnamese, probably South Vietnamese) soldiers are forced to play Russian Roulette for entertainment and gambling purposes. They get slapped around, thrown into rat-infested, half-submerged pits and generally mistreated by the evil VC.Don't get me wrong, the first Russian Roulette scene was very tense and I did hope that Robert DeNiro would blow a hole in the head of the VC leader.However, this is all that happened in the film. After that, nothing at all happened. I gave up just before the two-hour mark. It was just too much tripe for me. I could not believe it was rated so highly. Nothing happened in two god-damn hours! A long-winded wedding, a boring hunting scene and a very poor attempt at a war scene.I stopped watching after two hours. The garbage was finally beginning to get to me. So, to all those who adore and blindly praise this film, I have to ask you: Did you actually watch it, or were you just jumping on the Every-Academy-Award-Winner-Must-Be-Good train? It may well have been a great cinematic work in 1978, but today it certainly doesn't stand up against other older war movies.If you haven't watched The Deer Hunter yet...don't bother. Instead go watch a decent Vietnam film - such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. Otherwise, you're just wasting three hours of your life.",The Deer Hunter
560,mikeand1-1,It's about character development,10,21 May 2005,"A comment re the other comments: A lot of the comments criticize the first half hour as being too long. In my opinion, these comments miss the point of the movie.Of course many of the scenes in the first hour don't advance the narrative. They're not supposed to; they're for character development.The whole point of the movie is to show us how the various characters were affected by the war. It wouldn't have worked nearly as powerfully as it does had the first hour been trimmed down. We have to sense the careless and frat-boy-like immaturity of these young men. That's why the scenes all revolve around frivolity and seemingly senseless boyish behavior; it creates such a stark contrast to the devastated characters of the three who went to war (and the relatively unaffected personalities of those who stayed behind, like Stanley).The strong points of the film are the outstanding performances of nearly every actor in the movie. Yes, there are technical deficiencies in the sound, but it hardly matters. This is nitpicking compared to the overall construction of the film.",The Deer Hunter

Unfortunately, it was very hard for Nicky to keep that promise considering the circumstances. In a scene where Michael is playing Russian Roulette, Nicky enters the room. The viewer is ultimately confused as to whether or not they see each other. until Mikey chases after Nicky.Later Mikey goes back to find Nicky because he ultimately feels guilty for and goes back to get him. Mikey has an obligation to at least keep his one promise.

566,jabeckwith,not necessarily a war movie,9,12 January 2006,"First off, I'm sorry to read many reviews where the reviewer felt the first act unnecessary. That the Vietman war plays a part in this film doesn't necessarily make this a ""Vietnam war movie"" in the traditional sense- i.e. Platoon etc. It really could've been any war where a small and ethnically tight community deals with the ramifications of something much larger than itself that threatens it's existence.In this case it's a town of predominately first and second generation Russians who face the price of what being American really is. The first act (Wedding) is integral in establishing who these people are and how they identify themselves culturally within American society while the third act shows how they must cope with the new reality they face after the war. I don't believe it's an accident that these characters are so full of life in the beginning yet seem so dead in their identity at the end- i.e. truly Americanized.In this light Michael's rumination on deer hunting (""One shot is what it's all about. A deer has to be taken with one shot."") takes on new meaning. It's only after we hear the doctor call Nicky by his Russian name (Nikonar)in the hospital that he embarks on his suicidal mission that ends in one shot to the head. Then when Michael goes hunting after he returns from the war he can't seem to fire that one bullet that will kill the deer which at that point represents his cultural identity.Perhaps if this film was about an Irish community it might have been more widely accepted as a cultural examination. For those who are of Russian, or Eastern European, descent this is a treasure of what it must have been like to be ""American"" during the Vietnam era.",The Deer Hunter
567,jmsg-40295,A Pretty Damn Good War Film,8,1 May 2018,"I recently saw The Deer Hunter for the first time not to long ago and I thought it was great. I heard it was a good film before I went into it but I was surprised by how the story went into the issues of post-war life and PTSD.The performances of Robert De Niro was well done and I'd probably say that this is his second best role (my favourite is Raging Bull) in my opinion. I also liked Meryl Streep in the film and I'm not a fan of Meryl Streep. She plays her character really well and it really shines through during the second half of the movie. However the role that steals the show for me is Christopher Walken. He really knocked it out of the park with this role. The emotions he played were strong and his death by the end of the movie really hits hard. Not enough to drive me to tears but still hit quite hard. He totally deserved the Oscar win.The scenes in Vietnam have to be some of the most intense scenes I've seen to date. The Russian Roulette scene was really intense and it left me quite on the edge of my seat (or bed since I was watching this at night). (I'm also aware that some scenes aren't historically accurate, specifically with the Russian Roulette scene where there were no documented cases of Russian Roulette being played during the Vietnam War but honestly that doesn't change my opinion). I also really like the scenes with Mike trying to reconnect to society were also really well done. You can tell he wants to reconnect with the world again but the horrors of the war haunt him. However my favourite scene is the ending when Nick dies and everyone is at the table ready to honour him. The silence that surrounds the scene is almost too real. As if you were there with them. A perfect way to end the film.However I do have some issues with the film. One problem I have is that the other side characters aren't that interesting. They didn't really add a lot and didn't leave that much of an impression. I'm not saying they were bad characters it's just that they weren't that interesting. Some scenes drag on for a little bit, specifically when Nick returns to his home. I felt they could've been cut shorter but honestly that could be considered a nitpick. But my main issue with the film is with the beginning. More specifically with the wedding. The wedding scene lasted for way to long and it honestly brought me out of the experience a little bit. I know they're having this huge celebration before they get sent off to war but it really did drag. Also the run-time can also be considered an issue as it's way over 2 hours long and I did feel it's length. Overall I thought the film was great and I'm glad I watched it. I liked how the film dealt with the topics of post-war life rather than romanticising the what happens after a soldier's done with war. The characters struggles and emotions feel real and really brings to life the tragedies that war can bring not onto a country but into citizens outside the war. But while I did like the film it's probably going to be one of those films that I won't see for a very long time. I really liked it a lot but there isn't much re-watch value for multiple revisits. It's definitely a one-and-done type of film for me. Also the run-time and the wedding scenes can be enough of a turn off for me to not want to watch it again. But I still think the film is really amazing and definitely worth at least one viewing.",The Deer Hunter

570,frog-7,The true meaning of the film!!,10,15 July 1999,"The Deer Hunter is one of the most brilliant films ever made but it is about much more than the horrors of war and how Vietnam screwed up a group of friends. The war is about the death of the spirit of all individuals. In the film the characters lose thier belief in America. Going into the Vietnam war most Americans believed that their country was a beacon of justice and was an international do gooder. The Vietnam War destroyed that myth for millions of Americans, both civilians and soldiers. The war exposed the U.S. as the imperial-capitalist exploiter that it is. The loss of faith by the community is most beautifully shown as every sings God Bless America after Nicks funeral. They are all deadened and flat -- what a lie the song is! Even more beautifully displayed however is the personal loss, by Nick played by Christopher Walken. Going into Vietnam Nick and Mike (Robert DeNiro)both believe in America, but more symbolically they both believe in the perfection of shooting a deer with one shot in the mountains close to god when all is perfect in the world. But after Vietnam the belief is gone, Mike can not shoot a deer in one shot. And Nick is unable to live after Mike reminds him of one shot. Its the lie Nick was trying to avoid in Russian Rollette parlors all over Saigon but then its there in front of him, How can he live, he must die!! One Shot was a sham! - America is lie! The world is ugly and there is no truth there is no god there is nothing!!!Besides the beautiful metaphor of the film and the powerful message the movie is well acted, directed, and filmed. DeNiro, Walken, Savage, Streep, and even the V.C. Russian Rollette referee all give amazing performances. The scenes are both powerful and sensative, every action is subtly touched with true emotion. Also some of the shots are just incredible. This movie is definitely one of the all time greats.",The Deer Hunter
571,pikkie,Great acting by De Niro and Streep,10,19 October 1998,"This is the best movie ever made of the Vietnam war. Realistic shots made of the Prison camp (e.g Cassavetes put in the cage, the Russian roulette etc... made this an unforgettable movie).  Also the title song is still known by thousands today. This movie deserved a lot of Oscars. Streep (always with a crying face) and De Niro gave an extra dimension to the success.",The Deer Hunter
572,Robby-19,The Most Perfect Film ever made,10,9 May 1999,"The Deer Hunter is the most perfect film ever made because: * It's a movie about four pals before,during and after the war in Vietnam.* The war in Vietnam is important in America but the movie shows us a place what happened before and after with the people who were in the war.* You can ask the question, what happened in the war and why was the war so intense.* This all seen by me from a European way of life.",The Deer Hunter
573,sai-5,simplistic and blatantly one-sided look at Vietnam,4,2 May 1999,"To be honest, I was disappointed to see how people were so in love with this movie.  I found it generally to be uneven, boring one moment and deeply disturbing the next.  However, my main problem with the film is more with its mythological take on the war.  The fact that its re-interpretation of Vietnam has been so easily accepted by the vast majority of viewers makes it scarier.  I don't want to write my dissertation on the danger of cinema remaking history, but when you watch this film ask some critical questions about what it is saying to viewer about the past.  E.g. Why are the Americans always the victims of Asian aggression?  Why is the political/social/historical aspect of the conflict completely excluded (We see Saigon falling, but are not asked to see our role in the ensuing chaos)? Why is the tragedy of Vietnam exclusively its corruption of innocent American boys, over and over and over again? Just thought I'd add this perspective because movies, if they choose to deal with heavy subjects and want to be taken as a serious artistic statement, have to then accept the responsibility of affecting peoples understanding of history.",The Deer Hunter

Everything changes, three men went to war, but no hero comes back.That's the reason because for me this is the only real anti-war-movie. There is NO hero at the end. Everybody looses, nobody wins.

575,Jackal65,A shocking portrayal of the horrors that war inflicts on real people.,10,26 January 2003,"The Deer Hunter is a true masterpiece.  It shows the horrors of war and how they affect real people.  It primarily focuses on three young men preparing to go to Vietnam, and a number of their extended friends.  De Niro plays the introspective and spiritual natural leader of the group, Michael. For Michael life is about the wilderness, and the hunt. The three young men eventually go off to Vietnam and end up in a POW camp where they are subjected to the torturous will of their captors. The Viet-Kong force the prisoners to play Russian roulette with each other until the only three left alive are Michael and his friends.  When they finally escape they become separated before they make it home.The guilt of the separation and not knowing whether the others made it home drives the three in separate directions.  Walkins character, Nick, ends up falling out of site into the underworld of Vietnam, voluntarily participating in Russian roulette for money.  Michael goes home and tries to resume life as usual, however the pain and guilt makes him feel distant from everyone he knew.  When he goes back to the mountains he still doesn't feel at home, and even chooses not to drop a buck when he has the chance for the `one shot.'  Steven, played by John Savage, is the most seriously physically injured of the three, losing both legs and the use of one arm.  Steven refuses to go home to his family, preferring to stay in the VA.  When Michael visits Steven he finds evidence that Nick is still alive, and goes back to 'Nam to bring him home.  The reunion does not go well, however, and culminates in the performance that won Walkin the Oscar that year.The pain in this film is so real it elevates it from its celluloid medium to a true work of art, it is a modern masterpiece.",The Deer Hunter

The scenes of torture, physical and mental, is gruesome, and one of the most stirring scenes ever captured on film. The scene is revisited throughout the film and each incident is even more harrowing than the original. Christopher Walken deserved and earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film was truly the Best Picture of 1978, though one award it missed was Best Actor for De Niro. See this movie at all costs. Several movies that impact one so much that come to mind are: American History X, Apocalypse Now (my vote for best war movie), Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and Shine.

The first hour is what makes the film.  It develops the characters and gives them a place in your mind, makes you think of them as real human beings.  Without that the rest of the film would be below average.  The fact that you (should) care about the characters is what makes the film give you a horrible feeling inside.  This movie performed the rare action of evoking emotion in me.  I hardly ever care about the characters in a movie, because hey, it's just  a movie.

580,VagabondGuru,"Classic Film, Matchless Cast, Timeless Themes...",9,6 April 2006,"1978's Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, 'The Deer Hunter' is one of the finest American films about the Vietnam War and stands apart as an observational masterpiece - it takes no stands and renders no judgments, only tells a story about little lives caught up in grand themes. Michael Cimino enjoyed the brief acclaim of being a 'the next great director' (his writing was also masterful) based on this film until crashing and burning with the costly failure two year's later of 'Heaven's Gate', a flop that effectively derailed his career. Brilliant performances run through every featured role with a who's who of the past thirty years in the cast...Robert DeNiro gives an electric performance as 'Michael', the controlled, precise tough guy who all admire but who cannot fit in with the 'regular' guys and 'nice' girls in his Pennsylvania steel-mill town. Christopher Walken (Academy Award winner for Best Supporting Actor) and John Savage (Lydecker in season one of 'Dark Angel') both give disturbing and nuanced performances as Michael's fellow soldiers from the same town, and show the range of talent and unique personality that we have all come to depend upon from them as fine character actors ever since. Meryl Streep is a revelation as the pretty local girl taking on the pain of seemingly everyone in the story and trying to keep the tears contained behind her thin smile. Her emotional intelligence and sheer decency jump off the screen and give the town of 'Clairton, PA' it's heart. Character actors John Cazale (Fredo from 'The Godfather'), George Dzundza (Priest on season one of 'Hack') and Chuck Aspegren capture the uncomfortable sense of being the ones who get to 'stay home' as the boys head to Vietnam. Much of the criticism of the film related to the Russian Roulette theme that plays through the film's final two thirds with the argument centering upon whether or not such 'games' were actually played in the war. This is essentially meaningless as the metaphor of random death aptly mirrors the lives of these men and provides a context for telling their tale. Others have criticized as being cynical, a group singing of 'God Bless America' during a painful moment but, once again, this is simply an echo of the ambivalence ALL of us felt during the period and about the war and are still facing today. To this reviewer, this scene is beautifully rendered and holds true to an uncertain group of people juggling pain of loss with their faith, love of country and each other. It's powerful stuff, all the more so as a new war and debate rages, reminding us that whoever is right or wrong, it is those who welcome home the body bags and the damaged warriors who bear the burden for the rest of us.The film contains endless classic lines and did wonders both for the Frankie Valli song 'You're Just Too Good To Be True' (which found new fans from the movie) and for the local PA brewery, Rolling Rock, which capitalized on DeNiro telling Streep at the Wedding Reception bar 'have a Rolling Rock, it's a good beer' - thirty years later, the world is still banging them back.See the 'Deer Hunter' and show it to anyone who wasn't born or doesn't know of the period.",The Deer Hunter

Now, I would not whitewash the Viet Cong; war is hell and they could play the devil. But it was their country; we had no business being there. When I left the film, I told my friends, ""I guess General Westmoreland was right.""(the General in an interview had pulled out that old cliché that Asians have no regard for human life). As I watched the film, I kept thinking where is Lieutenant Calley right now? This film is the most politically incorrect interpretation of the war that could possible be made, and all the critics at the time were blinded by the effective performances and depiction of the terror inflicted by those ugly, perverse Asians.

588,adamd-8,Cinematic Brilliance,10,19 April 2007,"No movie before or after has effected me remotely as much as ""The Deer Hunter"" has. It is without a doubt the most emotionally driven, heartbreaking film I've ever experienced. The plot with it's simplicity instantly draws you into the lives of these characters which can easily be adapted to persons we all know or have known in our lives. The film opens to a small working class factory town seemingly isolated from the rest of the world. Main characters are established and we discover the underlying truth that seems to hang over everyone like a dark cloud. It is the middle of the Vietnam War, and three of the friends are volunteers to leave everything they know within the next few days. I break this movie into 3 parts, before, during and after the war. Before the war we see character development at it's best. We see 1 friend get married and experience a traditional Russian wedding. At one point DeNiro and Walken's characters encounter a soldier at a bar and when asked a response about their departure the soldier replies simply ""fuck it"". I thought this was a brilliant suggestion for things to come. The start of the second part begins by blowing your mind with a scene jump that is comparable to that of 2001:A space Oddyssey. Here we experience a game of forced Russian roulette onto the 3 friends. I remember the first time watching this scene barely able to keep control when placing myself in their position imagining what it would be like to play live and die with someone so close to you they are like your blood. When Robert DeNiro laughs in the face of his captors, sweat and tears streaming down his face, pleading his best friend to pull the trigger, it is without a doubt the most extreme example of raw emotion a movie has ever been able to produce. The final part of ""The Deer Hunter"" we see the aftermath that a war can bring, not on a nation, but of the families and friends and their relationships with one another. Whether drawn in or ripped apart, the impact on such a tightly knit group of individuals is devastating. In all,my favorite part of this movie is the message that I got from it. To me The Deer Hunter tells us that no matter what happens throughout our lives, we always have a home and there will always be someone there to lick our wounds and recover from the horrors that the world sometimes has. This is not an anti-war film and for those who may say it is have missed the picture.

My father is Vietnam vet, and no matter how much he enjoys DeNiro, he refuses to see the movie.

593,alyssasands,response for Mr. Craven,7,14 December 2006,"Response to question #4: Why does Mike go back to find Nicky?The easy response to this question is that before being sent overseas, Nicky tells Mike that if he 'doesn't come home, don't leave him over there'. However, I believe that it is deeper than this request. Mike and Nicky are best friends. They share many things in common. Before being sent to Vietnam, they both worked in the steel mill, they shared the same trailer, they both loved to hunt, and they both loved the same girl. Always looking out for each other, they escaped from the POW camp and survived combat. In many ways, they are like brothers. This connection helps solidify Mike's need to go back for his 'brother'.As strange as it seems, I think being with Linda affected Mike and made him go back to find Nicky. He knew that Nicky and Linda were to be married. While, he loved her and wanted to be with her, he could see her unhappiness and realized that he could not live with himself if he did not go searching for Nicky. When he returned to his friends, Mike felt different. He was no longer the steel mill worker-- he was now the Vietnam Veteran who had scene many gruesome battles, many people die. He could no longer enjoy bowling or other normal activities. Even hunting, his favorite past time, was no longer enjoyable. He knew that life would never be the same, but if he found Nicky there was hope that it could return to normal.When he finally finds Nicky, Mike is dismayed to learn that his best friend, the man he came searching for, no longer remembers him. Nicky has been playing Russian Roulette for money and it is in a game that the two find themselves. Mike desperately tries to bring out the person he remembers in Nicky. Nicky takes one shot, as does Mike; however, it is the third shot that kills Nicky. In an instant he is gone and Mike is left to return to his friends alone.",The Deer Hunter
594,lilthomp3714,Response for Mr. Craven,6,21 December 2006,"I believe that Mike went back to Vietnam to find Nick because before they left home to go to war, Nick asked Mike to not leave him over there. Would he come home dead or alive he didn't care. He loved working at the steel mill, he loved living in the trailer with Mike and more importantly he loved Linda and had proposed to her, before they went off to Vietnam. Mike and Nick were obviously close. They lived together and had a lot in common. Even more, they were in love with the same girl! So Mike promised that he wouldn't leave Nick over there.Things that Mike had been doing started to irate Nick. However when Mike forced Nick to play Russian Roulette it had pushed him over the edge. He lost it. After he got on the helicopter and Mike Stevie fell into the river Nick couldn't remember his own mothers birth date. When Mike got back from Vietnam and Nick wasn't with him he couldn't bare to see his friends. They had a huge banner hanging outside the trailer and where waiting for him and Nick to come home. When people found out that Nick was still over in Vietnam everyone was upset, especially Linda. In a way everyone had a part in making Mike want to go back to get Nick, especially Stevie. Nick had been sending money to Stevie to help him out. When Mike found this out he went straight to Vietnam.When Mike got back in Vietnam, he found the guy that convinced Nick to play Russian Roulette. The guy didn't want to really talk to Mike. I think it was because he knew that Nick was going to die that night. Mike didn't care he needed to find Nick and bring him back to their town so everything would be like they were before Vietnam.

Vietnam was a war that affected everyone. young people who were drafted, were unwillingly sent into Vietnam. the families and friends of those who fought and died in Vietnam were affected. the American economy was greatly affected, and the country of Vietnam was affected as well. i think the Russian roulette sequence showed how the Vietnam war was a losing situation. if you didn't want to ""play"", you lose, if you play long enough, you lose. no matter what you do, you will lose. in conclusion this is my opinion of why the Russian roulette sequence served as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.",The Deer Hunter
598,brnger,deer hunter journal entry,10,22 December 2006,"#3. What's the deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon? What is this character suppose to symbolize?France was in ruins after World War II. Its citizens had been abused by the German occupiers, its landscape blasted apart by bombs, and its finances drained by the early war effort. To return to normal it needed to rebuild, to rebuild it needed to refinance, and to refinance it needed its colony of Indochina. So, the French pumped Indochina for resources, but this was not well received by its inhabitants. In the 1950's the French suddenly found themselves facing an organized rebel army intent on revolution. After several years of fighting, the French found that this new war was costing them more than they could ever hope to gain from the colony, and so, facing massive defeat and a larger debt, the French packed up and got out. The French character in the film represents this France, cynical, exploitative, and unsentimental. Much as the Frenchman drags Nicky into the dangerous underground game of Russian roulette, France dragged the United States into Vietnam. Using the United State's fear of communism, the French used us for industrial and financial support in their war. Of course this is only after they exploited the Vietnamese as best as they could, before having the docile servants turn into a National Liberation Front that is. The French guy does the same thing. Once he sees that Nicky could be useful to him in his Russian roulette gambling, the Frenchman eagerly milks him for all that he's worth, emphasizing the French desire for revenue as well as their unscrupulous attitude towards obtaining it. In the end of the Deer Hunter, as Saigon is falling down around them, the Frenchman is still exploiting Nicky for all that he's worth. The end scene is where the symbolism is truly harped upon, as the Frenchman is getting ready to flee the losing battle, the Americans, Nicky and Mike, are still as entrenched as ever. In the raw sense, this is what happened at the start of American involvement in Vietnam as well. As the French backed out, they left a clear path for Americans to walk straight into hell, and as they do, they feign ignorance over the knowledge that the war is a quagmire. This is symbolized by the characters charade of speaking only French, when in fact he's fluent in English as well. With so many obvious parallels, the French character is, without a doubt, the embodiment of French influence in Vietnam: snooty, dishonest, and immoral. It doesn't sound like all that much has changed. Les petites salopes.",The Deer Hunter

The reason why Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nickey is because before they left to Vietnam, after Steve's wedding Mike is sitting butt naked on a basketball court and him and Nickey both promise each other that they won't leave each other in Vietnam and that they will come home together. Well, Mike and Nickey meet up at a small village and get captured and they have to play Russian roulette against each other and they both survive but then they get split up again. Mike sees Nickey at a Russian roulette club where people bet on people playing and Nickey doesn't see Mike and a french guy takes Nickey away and basically brain washes him. So, Mike goes back home and he almost starts to fall for Nickeys girl, and when he goes hunting, he can't shoot a deer because that is what him and Nickey used to do, and when he goes to visit Steve, Steve shows him a drawer full of money and Mike knows that money is from Nickey so Mike feels like he has to go back to fulfill that promise. But when he gets back, Nickey is basically brainwashed or too far gone from drugs that he doesn't remember Mike, so Mike plays Russian roulette against Nickey and right before Nickey shoots himself, he remembers the phrase ""one shot"" because that is what Mike always said how to hunt deer, is with ""one shot"".",The Deer Hunter

603,Shathaniel,Film Studies,7,7 January 2007,"1. The Russian Roulette is pretty clearly symbolic of the random, senseless nature of the Vietnam War. Each of the three characters sent to Vietnam were fighting for their lives every day, never knowing if today would be their last day on earth, just like they never know which chamber will contain the bullet.2. I'm not sure that anyone could have predicted what happened to Nick, but Mike was obviously the strongest of the three characters. He was entirely self sufficient and cold, which made it easier for him to shrug off the horrors of Vietnam as just a part of war. While I could probably have predicted that Steve would be the one to come out of the war much worse for the wear, that is mainly because he was a newlywed, and, in the movies, you just KNOW something nasty is going to happen to a newlywed.3. The French were originally the country in power in Vietnam, but they eventually left in order to let the United States take care of the war effort. The French simply sought to exploit the Vietnamese for financial gain, which is what the Frenchman in the movie does with his gangster-esquire behavior around the Russian roulette table.4. Mike promises Nick that he won't leave him in Vietnam. After Steve's marriage reception, he swears that he won't leave him behind. When he comes back home and realizes that Nick is AWOL, he is horrified that he has broken his word. Even though it isn't particularly realistic that the military allowed him back into the country, it is important to show that not only did Mike and Nick have a strong bond, but that Mike was a man of his word steadfastly determined to live up to his responsibilities.-Shane",The Deer Hunter

Unfortunately, he's ultimately unable to do this. On the one hand, this isn't necessarily a bad thinghe's able to become closer to Linda without Nicky ""getting in the way.""

Additionally, perhaps he feels that bringing Nicky home safe and sound will win him brownie points with Linda (to whom he succeeds in becoming closer when Nicky isn't around, though a gulf seems to open up between them when the manner in which he brings Nicky home is in a casket.) Also, he feels a need to fulfill the promise to restore the unit comprising of himself, Nicky, and Steve. He and Steve have both returned, and only Nicky will complete the trio. Without him, there's something missing, and Mike feels the urge to full that hole.In the end, Mike does bring Nicky home.

612,cj_2407,The Russian roulette sequence,4,16 May 2007,"The next comment is on the Russian roulette sequence of the film ""Deer Hunter.""In the movie, the main characters are drafted into the Viet Nam war. Captured and tortured, these characters are made to play games of Russian roulette. None of these characters die, however, they become mentally, and physically abused and will never be the same again. The idea of Russian roulette, though highly explored in the movie, has no relevance in the the actual Viet Nam war and was never plaid. So why add the gruesome details of this game into the story? The point of adding this game is so simple, it is easily disregarded. The game was added for symbolism purposes. The fact of Viet Nam is that there are three ways one can return from the war. A man can return dead, psychologically disturbed, or Physically maimed. The entrance into the war is literally a lose, lose situation. In the game Russian roulette, it is also a lose, lose situation. If a man plays long enough he can die, if a man doesn't play very long he can still become mentally hurt, and in Steve's case, in the film a man can also be wounded by the gun by just grazing his head.Personally I believe this sequence of Russian roulette playing is stupid. If they didn't actually play the game in Viet Nam, why add it? The symbolism purposes that the director uses are very interesting, but I believe there are other ways that it could have been done without adding something that wasn't even in the war.",The Deer Hunter
613,devonheisler-1,a good film.,7,29 May 2007,"#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.In preparation for their last deer hunting trip together, Nick and Michael are getting ready in their shared trailer on the outskirts of town above the factory where they work. Michael is a true heroic and serious sportsman who takes pride in his self-imposed, ""one-shot"" spiritual philosophy. He expresses reverence for the hunt with its various rituals. His all-male code, expressed in sexual slang, emphasizes the quickness with which the prey, or enemy target in life is taken ""with one shot"" Ironically, Nick is the one who dies at the end of the film due to the one shot of Russian Roulette. Michael went back to Vietnam to help him, but unfortunately did not make it. Russian Roulette is a game of chances, like hunting, and one shot can make all the difference. It's the one shot that kills you. While hunting, one shot can end the deer's life. It is kind of like Russian Roulette because it's the deer dodging the bullets instead of pulling the trigger. It's the humans playing the game with the deer. Russian Roulette is the Vietnamese playing a game with each other. I agree with what the director is trying to portray here.CRAVE THIS IS DEVON! obviously.",The Deer Hunter
614,jess-davies,Deerhunter,10,1 March 2007,"I thought the direction of this film was very good. I particularly liked the way the director did not try to portray any of the characters as heroes,especially within a subject matter where there are no winners. I thought the title ""deerhunter"" was particularly apt when, on Michael's return from the war,he could not bring himself to kill the animal after experiencing senseless killing. I felt the backdrop of,an American industrial heartland, as opposed to a, John Wayne type Califonian beach one, gave more creditability to the movie. Some of the scenery in the deer hunting scenes was excellent. Another credit to the movie is the fact that, there cannot be many movies where so many of it's actors go on to make such long and successful careers for themselves. I am somewhat disappointed to see this movies current position in the top 250 because in my opinion there are a great many of, a lot less calibre than this in a higher position.

First off, I think that he is just not happy back at home. He has been completely changed in Vietnam, while his friends back at home expect him to be exactly the same as when he left. Michael would like to forget his experiences with the war, but everywhere he goes, someone is there to shake his hand and remind him. It is also easy to see by the way he purposely skips his party and by the way he stays in a hotel that he just wants to get away.The second reason that Mike goes back to Vietnam is that he promised Nicky he would not leave him over there. I think that at first Mike tries to put his promise out of his head, telling himself that it was Nicky's choice to stay. However, Mike is unable to do anything without thinking about Nick. Even though (in reality) it is not Mike's fault that Nicky is still there, hunting with the guys and sleeping with Nick's girlfriend begin to make Mike feel guilty about leaving Nicky in Vietnam.

Howver, Mike doesn't really seem to have a choice. His ability to assimilate back into normal society seems to be dependent on his bringing Nick home- dead or alive. This is most evident when Mike first returns without Nick and attempts to go hunting. Though one could argue he doesn't slay the animal due to a new respect for life after seeing so much death, one could just as easily attribute this lack of will to kill the deer as being Mike's inability to continue his life knowing Nick should be back home with him.",The Deer Hunter

Steve was one who seemed to go with the flow, and by simply marrying a woman knowing he was off to war was a sign of weakness. He did it to either experience marriage before he died, or to distract himself from the reality of the situation. Michael is the exact opposite, where he is quite and sets certain expectations for himself and holds true to them, such as killing the deer in one shot. If you can't do it once, don't try. He obviously has the best shot of all the men but respects what he is shooting at the same time. Nicky is right in the middle where he is a little bit immature like Steve, he is willing to learn from Michael.

618,mary-devlin,#1,7,14 May 2007,"I believe that the director wanted you to understand that playing Russian Roulette is a lose- lose situation in the end. This directly correlates to the 18 or 19+ year old that were forced to go into the war because of the draft. Many of the men who served in Vietnam had fathers who were WWII veterans, so they were looked down upon if they coward their way out of the draft. In turn though, if they were drafted and went to war, it was a death sentence. In the movie, Russian Roulette was played to see who had enough ""guts"" to kill themselves by chance. It was a risk with a great reward, but the risk was death. The draft worked in the same way. You could go to war and be killed or have psychological/physical damage, or stay home and be looked down upon from your family. America is built upon our patriotism for our country and if one is a coward because he finds a way to not be drafted then he is immediately disowned in a sense. America doesn't want our men and troops to die, but we rather have them fight for our freedom then sit back and watch other men die.I didn't at first realize that this was what the director was aiming to make a point of, but once I did realize it, I agree completely. The concept of Russian Roulette and the draft fit together especially since Russian Roulette seemed to play a great part of the movie, it separated life and death as did the draft in America.",The Deer Hunter

Nick and Mike have been friends for a long time and share a close bond which ties them together. nick once promised Mike that he would never leave him in Vietnam no matter what...and now Mike realizes the significance of the promise and realizes that he must rescue Nick from what Nick once promised him .There is also the thought of leave no man behind... these guys go way back they have hunted together and everything...so it makes Mike's rescue attempt much more meaningful. However Nick refuses to accept Mikes rescue and carries with the game showing that he has been corrupted by a psychotic game which has now become an addiction.,The Deer Hunter
620,sunsetridge,Nicole Wurm,7,17 May 2007,"#1 Russian Roulette is a game of chance. Anyone who plays is at risk. Being picked from a draft is also by chance. If you are drafted it is like being sent to your grave in Vietnam. However, if you choose to be patriotic and go to Vietnam you are compared to Nick, willingly risking his life, in a game of Russian Roulette. In this game of chance it does not matter how good or bad of a fighter you are, it is all statistics. Also, to play Russian Roulette you must have a large amount of mental strength which is also a problem with Nick. It shows Nick when he is under Vietnamize capture mentally breaking down. I believe the director means to show how mentally unprepared many of the soldiers that went to Vietnam were. Also, after the war when Nick was at a point where his life was of no meaning to himself, he would play Russian Roulette almost TO Die and not being forced to, because of the mental trauma he faced in the war itself. When he does die from the game the director shows that even if the war itself does not kill you, the effects of the war will, OR you mine as well be dead. I agree with the director that the soldiers were not mentally prepared for the war, and that who died in the war was more likely by chance than anything else. I am not sure how much i agree or disagree with how much the soldiers life meant after the war, i think that depends on how mentally strong a person was before the war. I can only imagine that far too many people were unable to move on with their lives after the war. As far as patriotism i don't think the director was against it or particularly for it, but simply acknowledged that those who went for those reasons were willingly putting their lives on the line and those people should be honored(song at end of movie). #4. Shawn Collin's Comment: There were several reasons that Mike went back to Vietnam to find Nick. The first, and most important thing was the unique relationship that they shared when they were in their hometown. Their relationship was different from the relationships that they had with their other friends, even Steven. Mike only trusted Nicky. Mike didn't trust steven nearly as much as he did Nicky because he thought Steven was a wimp. When they were in Vietnam it proved Stevens weak mind even when his life was at risk in the POW camp.In the Russian Roulette scene Nicky ran off and Mike could not find him. Later, Mike went back and felt guilty for leaving Nicky after he had promised not to go back without him.",The Deer Hunter
621,brittersweet16,day 2/block 1,6,15 May 2007,"#1. I think that the symbolism of the Russian Roulette scenes did not accurately portray the Vietnam War. It was supposed to symbolize that regardless how lucky or fortunate you may be throughout the war, eventually your luck would come to an end, and basically just wind up killing you. Similar to Russian Roulette, if you were to go into the Vietnam War it was technically a lose-lose situation. You may win some money and not get shot but you're never going to be completely safe. If you were a Vietnam soldier, you would either end up dead, or severely mentally or physically ill for the rest of your life. Nikki, for example was mentally and physically stable prior to playing Russian Roulette. However, after playing more games and not shooting himself, he became emotionally 'sick.' He didn't even recognize his life-long friend or want to return home. Russian Roulette, much like the war, had taken over his body and soul and he was never going to be the normal, sane individual that he once was.I do in fact agree that Russian Roulette is very similar to the Vietnam War, however, I don't think that the majority of the film should have been based on this game. Although the three men suffered greatly from the war, the majority of their depression and anxiety was from the Russian Roulette game. If Russian Roulette was not truly played during the war, the director should not have made it the main theme, or idea of the film. It's harder to compare this game to the war if it was not actually played by the men at POW camps.",The Deer Hunter
622,vmcmanus2001,The Deer Hunter Questions,8,15 May 2007,"1) The director used the Roulete sequences as a metaphor. When Mike, Nicky, and Steve played the director showed how each were unraveling due to the war. I agreed with the director's use of the roulette scenes, because they showed how each of the three men reacted to the intensity of the game, and inadvertently the war. 2) Steve is by far the most unstable, which we see even when the men are at home. When he tells Mike that he hasn't slept with his fiancé' you know something is off about him. Nicky is also somewhat unstable, due to the fact that he is always willing to bet. Mike is the most stable, which is his strongest characteristic. He has a concrete way of doing things, and cannot complete a task unless it is done step by step. And, because of Mike's strong and stable will he gets through the war affected, but not to the degree of Nicky or Steve. 3) The French character is suppose to represent the image American's had on the war in Vietnam. The French where thought to have lured America into Vietnam and then left when we needed them. 4) Mike goes back to Vietnam, because he told Nicky before they left that he wouldn't leave him. Also, because of Mike's personality he would have had to bring Nicky back home because he was obligated to.",The Deer Hunter
623,b_man-2003,# 4 from Bdog,8,17 May 2007,"i feel that mike went back for nick because he felt that it was his duty and he made that promise. Before they went to war Nicky asked mike one thing, to bring him back. Mike left without Nicky and saw what the world was without him. When mike went and saw Steven and saw all the money nick was making from Russian roulette he saw that he had made a bad decision and felt it was his duty to go back and try and save Nicky before something bad had happened. He probably also felt a little guilty because now he was living with Nicky's girlfriend and that only happened because mike left without Nicky. The worst part about Mike going back for Nicky is that now he has to live with it being his fault that Nicky died because if he had never made Nicky play he never would have gotten ""hooked"" to the game.",The Deer Hunter

He remembered promising his best friend that he wouldn't leave him and he broke that promise. Mike ended up going back because he couldn't live with the fact that he left his best friend in Vietnam. Mike was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was ruining his life.Mike Shepard",The Deer Hunter
625,ldadvantageinc,"A veteran's impression of ""The Deer Hunter""",10,22 August 2012,"I will not repeat much of the comments in the previous positive reviews, but will stick mostly to how the movie affected me. First off, I am an Army veteran of the Vietnam War. Thus there is much in this picture that deeply moves me. I still can not listen to the theme music piece played by John Williams, ""Cavatina"", without choking up and weeping.I identify much with the characters in this movie. I grew up in a very small town and come from a working class ( Norwegian, Scots-Irish, English) background. Two weeks out of high school and at the age of 17 I enlisted in the Army. Like the men in this movie I came from a tradition of serving one's country in the military. Both my brother, two cousins and my future brother-in-law also served in the Vietnam War.I identify with Michael, played by Robert DeNiro in his sense of honor in going back to 'Nam and trying to bring back his buddy Nick. Additionally I admire Mike when he visits Steven in the VA hospital and brings him back home. Honor is, as mentioned in the movie ""Rob Roy"", a gift a man gives to himself. Michael (and the movie) doesn't waste time on whether the war in Vietnam is right or wrong. Michael just does what he thinks is right with respect to his buddies. Ask any one who has served in the military and they will tell you that you're sense of commitment to your comrades almost takes precedence over your commitment to your country.I do not see this movie as either pro or anti-Vietnam War. To me the movie portrays how war affects three individuals. It is a movie about character, honor, loyalty------what you are when everything around you is falling apart. I will continue to see this movie many times as I hope that the values depicted in it will still be reflected (albeit weakly) in me.In closing, I can not help to remember that the politically anti-Vietnam War movie ""Coming home"" starring Jane Fonda and Jon Voight was also up for the same Oscars. When Jane Fonda was asked what movie would win the Academy award that year, she sneeringly replied that she hoped it wasn't ""The Deer Hunter"". In the years since Jon Voght has transitioned from being a Liberal to a Conservative. Parenthetically, Jane Fonda has never apologized for her pro-Viet Cong actions. At the age of 66, I am still proud that I served my country and volunteered for the US Army and the Vietnam War.",The Deer Hunter

627,djmtm,Micheal's strength in the face of adversity,9,2 August 2007,"One underplayed point that makes this film so powerful is the subtle complexity but resounding strength and dignity that emotes so well from De Niro's incredible performance as Micheal. The film is about trauma that the inhumanity of humans action(in this case the Vietnam war) causes it's victims, but also reminds us that many are at their strongest when they are most weak.Micheal is clearly principled which we first learn in his seemingly callous refusal to lend Stosh his boots, but throughout the film his adherence to his principles and honour is what makes The Deer hunter one of the most inspiring and crushing films of all time. Micheal's loyalty to those he loves sees him repeatedly acting selflessly to save those close to him- ""I love you"" he says to Nicki before pulling the penultimate trigger in that famous scene. De Niro's captures this display of human strength remarkably- Micheal is a genuine hero in which we emphatically see his quiet fortitude emphasised by the horrors of the human evils that provide the films narrative.",The Deer Hunter

630,megangeer,Response to Question#3,8,19 December 2007,"The French man represents the French government. The French economic interests in Vietnam cared little for civil liberties just as he cared little for the welfare of the players he recruited. Their eyes were only on the profit; no matter what the cost was to others. In America's attempt to keep a safeguard against communism, by preventing the domino effect in protecting the French allies, they paid the bulk of the price with the sacrifice of American soldier's lives. Nicky's (the American soldier) good-hearted attempt to protect and provide for the future of the one's he loved back home, proved trivial in his downfall as it took away what home wanted most which was to have Nicky back. Thousand s of young draftees came back from the war changed or not at all. In the end Nicky's effort shown through money wasn't even useful to injured Steve, just as the American soldiers' death did not gain any progress in Vietnam. More Americans died in the war than the French, just as the middleman simply exchanged the cash and was never really in any danger himself as he did nothing of consequence or influence. The French caused a draft of American soldiers like the Russian Roulette French man drafted players to their unnecessary deaths; all for the game of global economics. Had the French given up what was not theirs, being hypocrites in a ""post-imperialist"" World War II world, the Americans would not have had to die helping their friends to stay alive financially, which is like if the French man had not kept Nicky in the game (even though it was obvious to anyone with soul that Nicky needed out if he was going to survive), Nicky would not have shot himself in the fruitless attempts of trying to financially assist his friends in Clairton.

632,brianfayhockey,Film Study Response,8,7 December 2007,"#1.During the Russian Roulette sequences the director wanted the viewers to feel the pains of war. He wanted to strike panic in the minds of the viewers. Also it reveals a truth about Vietnam, that it was not only about men being shot and killed and the only injuries were the means of pain and suffering. Many of the troops suffered mental injuries that effected the rest of their life's. This is shown in those scenes.#2.From the begging Mike was prepared for everything. He took responsibility for his actions and always had a plan. He is a strong willed character who takes everything with him to the grave. He shows these traits in Vietnam, being the one to come out on top. Nick is less prepared for the future compared to Mike and goes with the flow. During Vietnam he cracks and shows that he is mentally unable to stand the memories of his past.

633,GriffinPBlock4,Answer to question 4,8,7 January 2008,"My answer is for the last question. Mike went back to Vietnam because he found that Nicky had been playing Russian Roulette and sending his winnings to America. Mike wanted Nicky to come home because they were best friends, and he didn't know anything about his whereabouts, or even if he was alive. He went to save Nicky, but his attempts proved futile, as Nicky shot himself in the head anyway. He went to get answers, and hopefully to bring his best friend home. So much for that. After all of the trouble and horrible things they had seen in Nam, Nicky started showing signs of Shell Shock (or Post Traumatic Stress Disordr), and then he stopped acting like his old self. He was like a robot, and he could do nothing but play Russian Roulette. Again, we all know how that worked out.",The Deer Hunter
634,Carey21,The tricky french man.,8,6 December 2007,"The French character in The Deer Hunter, is suppose to symbolize the French Army. Before the United States joined the war in Vietnam, French had been there occupying most of the country. The French were starting to get over taken by the Vietnamese and they wanted some support in upholding there ""leadership"" there. The Frenchman in the movie is showing Nicky into the Russian Roulette den, as if the French were showing the Americans into Vietnam, all they wanted was for us to come and help them and have a little fun. By the end of the movie when Mikey goes back to Vietnam to save Nicky and bring him back home, the Frenchman pretends to not know Mikey. He does this because he knows it is getting far too dangerous and that Nicky and Mikey have already met their fate. They cant do anything about Nicky playing Russian Roulette, just like America can't stop the violence in Vietnam, and that the French did not want to be blamed for it, just like the Frenchman doesn't want to be blamed for getting Nicky into trouble.",The Deer Hunter

At first I was skeptical as to whether or not I would think the film was interesting and could get into it, but I soon became attached to the characters and interested into what would happen next. The Deer Hunter really summed up Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the effect it can have even on those who aren't suffering from it. The movie did a good job of making the character's story realistic. I had never seen Robert Dinero in any of his earlier films and really enjoyed seeing some of his early work.

Vietnam was a money game, taking chances , hoping to luck out. all the principles between the two line right up. and at the end when you see nick's waste of a life as a RR player, its symbolic as to mental and physical injuries suffered by the vets of Vietnam, going there and what one experienced changed the soldiers and not for the better.",The Deer Hunter

I really think it shows what happened in Vietnam even though it may be graphic it's a pretty decent movie. I really liked how Mike went back for Nick, I thought that was probably the best part of the movie, because it showed how much their friendship meant to him, I'm sure other people would have just left him there. I also feel like he went back to make Nick realize that if he stayed there longer, he would honestly go insane. One thing that kind of didn't work for me during the film was when Mike and the other guy fell off the helicopter, i thought that was pretty random, but it still fit with the story line. I think the music for the film kinda of made it seem more dramatic than it really was, so that was probably the only bad thing about the movie, for me anyways.",The Deer Hunter

What is this character suppose to symbolize?,9,21 December 2007,"In The movie The Deer Hunter the character Nick has been released from the military hospital into the city of Saigon for some R & R. Nick hears some gun shots coming form a house off of the main drag. He goes to investigate the sounds only to find a slick talking Frenchman dressed in white and sitting in a nice white car. The man talks to Nick while some bodies of men sporting red bandanas are carried out into the street. Even though nick is initially resistant he it convinced to enter the building and view the Russian roulette game. Nick becomes consumed with the game and plays it leaving to such an extent that he goes AWOL and drops off the face of the earth. Later on Michael and Steve find out that Nick is still alive and Michael returns to Saigon. When Michael finally finds the Frenchman at the roulette den and asks him for help the Frenchman is unhelpful and stubborn.The Frenchman symbolizes the interactions between the United States and France leading up to and during the Vietnam War. France, who was originally involved with the war asked the US for help and even though we were unsure and leery France persuaded us to help out, just like the Frenchman persuades Nick to enter the roulette den. Once entering the war things fall apart and The United States is found in the midst of a war with no way out just like Nick and his ""game"". Finally when Michael goes to the French man for help he is turned down and met with an ungrateful and stubborn front. When the war started to take its toll on the United States, they asked for help from the ones who got them into that mess.

It seems that such a nationally acclaimed masterpiece could not have been complete without a subtle stab at a foreign power. And no, I'm not talking about North Vietnam. The frenemy of which I speak is none other than the noble, supportive, enticing, and faithful comrade in our constant fight for liberté: France. But wait, why then does the charming coward with a penchant for cash and an idling car portray the French? Perhaps, we a need bit of a history refresher. Didn't the French originally colonize Vietnam? Didn't they implore our help under the false pretense of the ""domino effect""? Didn't we send our troops over to maintain control with a state of police action? And, when the conflict turned for the worse, wasn't it the noble France who fled from the jungle? Yes. Yes it was. You see, the charming Frenchman is truly a symbol of the French involvement in Vietnam. He waits in the alley, capitalizing on the profit of the Vietnamese people. He lures Nicky into the deadly game of Russian Roulette, an act of blind patriotism. And, as Saigon begins to fall, the Frenchman hops into his idling car and tries to flee, leaving behind the gullible American. Luckily, Mike stands in his way and is able to bribe the Frenchman with cash and guilt into helping him. But, the gruesome effects of war, coercion, and abuse have taken their toll on Nicky.

After the character introduces him to the den, he is relatively uncooperative, especially with Mike when he goes back to get Nicky. This is comparable to the behavior of France after the US gets involved in Vietnam. The French ask why we are bothering the Vietnamese even though they were the ones who asked for our involvement.

642,achase448,4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nike? Be specific with this one and use examples.,6,18 December 2007,"I think Mike goes back to get Nicky in Vietnam for a couple of reasons. The first being that Nicky told him one night before they left that he didn't want to be left in Vietnam alone, and he wishes that Mike would come and get him if that problem ever comes up. Also, I believe that Mike seeing Nicky's girlfriend so messed up from the possiblilty that Nicky might be dead made him want to go rescue him. The third reason I believe Mike went back was a sense of companionship. Even though Mike and Nicky had their disagreements they were great friends, both in the factory and at home. They did everything together, from getting drunk to weddings to hunting. The final piece that made Mike want to go back to Vietnam was when he saw all the money Nicky was sending to Steve. He wondered how he was getting all of the money, and realized it must be from a game called Russian roulette. Mike knew that Nicky was mentally unstable from seeing horrific events in Vietnam, and especially from the game of Russian roulette. The sad part of Mike trying to rescue Nicky, of course, is that Nicky is either so messed up that he can't, or he doesn't want to recognize Mike. In Nicky's final game of Russian Roulette he almost recognizes Mike, but it's too late and he fires the gun into his head. -- Alex Chase",The Deer Hunter

Mike came home alone and wondered if his other two friends were home. He found out that Steven was in a rehab center because both of his legs were cut off. Mike went to go Steven and he could see that he seemed angry about what had happened to him. Mike convinced Steven to come back home. Mike then figured out that Nike was still in Vietnam. Linda was hurt that Nike didn't come home with Mike. So I think Mike went back to Vietnam to find Nike partly because Linda was depressed and he wanted to help her. Even though he definitely had a crush on Linda, he knew that Linda just wanted Nike back. Mike went to Vietnam for the second time now and paid a lot of money that he got from Steven to find Nike. When he found him in the Russian Roulette. You could tell that Nike was not that happy to see him. He looked horrible and was acting like he never even knew Mike. Mike and him sat at the table against each other and Mike kept saying ""Nicky, don't do it."" The first time it was fine but the second time Nike shot himself in the head.

It symbolized a very large piece of this film. When they first had to play, they were very scared and understood that this could be the last time the men would ever see each other. It brought the men closer together and they went through something that changed what they think of when talking about war. When Nicky was taken back to that room where he first saw Russian roulette being played for money, he was shocked and after he saw Mike in there he became very angry. Mike went back to Vietnam after he came home, to get Nicky to come with him and understand that playing this game for money is wrong and not a way to live. I believe that the director was trying to show that the war was a scary time and that the two characters went through a lot because when they had to play each other in the Vietnam torcher camp, it was the hardest thing they have ever had to do and when they were at the table ready to play again it was like doing it all together and right before Nicky died he started to remember home and the earlier part of war.

He thought clearly throughout the Russian roulette seen and he was the one who allowed them to escape and had to help the others along through Russian roulette. In war you need to have psychologically strong to be able to take in the horrors you see and Mike was one of them. After the war when mike came home he seemed a lot more quiet. When he went hunting again he wasn't able to shoot the deer. Mike also seemed more serious when it came to everything like when stosh was pointing the pistol after hunter mike came over and shot it and then threw it into the woods.Another character from the deer hunter was steve who was played by john savage, and out of the three of them who went to war he was the most psychologically unstable. Before he went off to war he was kind of a push over and seemed kind of shy sometimes. This personality was not a very good one to go off and fight a war with because when things started to get bad he couldn't handle it. When they were captured and forced to play Russian roulette he just broke down and couldn't handle it. I wasn't surprised that he was the one to get seriously hurt in the war because he had a weak mind. Even if they didn't get captured I think he still wouldn't have been able to handle the images from war.The other main character who went to war was Nick who was played by Christopher Walken. Nick was between Mike and steve in his personality. He was wasn't as stiff as mike and he wasn't as soft as steven. This made him an O.K soldier. When in battle he seem fine, but when they ended up in the prisoner of war camp he seemed a little on edge. When he was forced to play mike in Russian roulette was when Nick lost it. He started crying and had a hard time doing it and mike had to walk him through it. After the war he went AWOL. He was in a hospital and was going to be sent home. He ended up being talk into going into the Russian roulette den in Saigon where he kind of lost it took the gun and put it to his head. Nick then just left with the french guy. He completely forgot who he was by the end of the film. His mind wsn't ready for Vietnam. Mike found him but couldn't get through to him and just as you thought he was he dies. Nick was very psychologically unstable at the end of this film. I thought his life did serve as an accurate prelude to the end of the film. He could have come home but I think that he didn't want to.",The Deer Hunter

(assumed it could only be Nike that would be sending money). So Mike goes back to Vietnam, and with the help from some Frenchman Mike finds Nike at a high stakes Roulette club. Mike soon notices that Nike has no recollection of his friends, family, or home. This is mostly the result of heroin, Nike has marks on his arms and is all doped up playing roulette. Mike then pays the people who run the roulette club to face Nike in Russian roulette. Both of Mike and Nike make it through the first two rounds, and at the start of the third round Mike starts to speak of Nike and Mike's hunting trips. Mike also reminds Nike of Nike's hunting philosophy: by only taking one shot. Nike smiles and begins to recollect everything. Nike then says to Mike, ""One shot,"" and shoots himself in the head.

It provides a different perspective to the war and those who were affected by it: soldiers, family and friends....In regards to why Michael returns to Vietnam to retrieve Nick, I think it is simple. Michael feels rightfully obligated to do so. He promised Nick that if anything happened he would not leave him in Vietnam. (This promise was made under the basketball hoop, after the streaking incident after the wedding). Besides that, I think it is obvious that Michael and Nick are best friends and have been for a long time; Michael couldn't live with himself if he left Nick there.",The Deer Hunter

But there I think that there is some symbolism behind it all. I think that the director was trying to say that if you were to go to Vietnam you were gamboling with your life because you would come home being traumatized, dead, or injured. So it was basically like if you went into Vietnam for long enough you would loose like Russian Roulette. I guess it worked in the film only because I was told that it was symbolism. But the first time I watched the film I thought that it was true events and that they really did play Russian Roulette. I wish that they did keep it truthful and didn't show that. Im not one to like symbolism in movies. I like to watch movies that have no in depth meaning behind them.",The Deer Hunter

The Deer Hunter is one of those films. This is one of the best films ever made. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances of his career as the lead character, Michael. Christopher Walken also gives a career defining and Oscar-winning performance as Michael's best friend Nick. The story is one of the best of this century. It follows a band of friends as half of them venture into the horrors of the Vietnam War. This then splits them up and changes them both physically and emotionally. Michael Cimino's brilliant direction and amazing story, coupled with some of the best acting ever, gave this film the resonance that it has received. The Best Picture of 1978 was a well deserved award for this film. I recommend that all see this emotional journey about friendship.",The Deer Hunter

I like how it showed the torture that the prisoners of war had to go through it really gave me a sense of how scared and hopeless those people must have felt. The Russian roulette stuff scares the crap out of me i cant believe people really play that game. When the war heroes come home it makes you wonder how much different your life would be when you got back like it was for those soldiers. The movie did a really good job of getting you to think about this stuff. when you see the way that the people have changed from beginning to end you really think about the people you are close with and it really is depressing to think that this stuff actually happens to people. Thats what it was made for so it gets an 8 out of ten and i thought it was an excellent movie!,The Deer Hunter
657,kylepetrillo,Symbolism,7,15 May 2008,"Russian Roulette symbolizes the Vietnam war in a way which there is no chance of winning. If the three main characters chose not go fight in the war, they would have been sent to jail or would have been humiliated by their families for bailing out of the war. This left the characters and anyone else who was drafted for the war no choice but to fight or face the punishment of not going.Anyone who came back from the Vietnam war was either physically hurt or emotionally hurt. Their families would be proud of them but they would never have gone through the pain that the soldiers did. For the main characters, this is what happened to them. They chose to go and only one of the characters came back in full physical health. But even he was emotionally hurt by the war. Going to the war was just like Russian roulette. If you keep on playing, eventually you will lose and die. Nike, who sends money home by playing Russian roulette eventually loses when his best friend comes all the way back to bring him home. The Deer Hunter proved that even if you go to war and come home alright, you will still be emotionally hurt.

The director chose to include many elements in the film symbolizing several different things. For example, the Frenchman... In The Deer Hunter, the Frenchman is symbolic of French involvement in Vietnam. The first time we are introduced to him is in Saigon when he lures Nick into the game of Russian Roulette. That is symbolic of the French originally drawing the United States into Vietnam. The second time we see him is towards the end of the film as Mike is searching for Nick in Saigon to bring him home. Mike finds the Frenchman who pretends not to know what is going on and has no involvement. The same happened to the United States struggles towards the end of the war while the French claim they had no connection. The Frenchman can also be blamed for the death of Nick because he lured him in. Much like the United States losing the war.",The Deer Hunter

Be specific with this one and use examples.Mike goes back to Vietnam to save Nicky for many reasons. One reason is they are best friends. Mike cannot live with himself knowing that Nicky is still back in Vietnam risking his life by playing high stakes Russian roulette. Mike knows that Nicky is playing Russian roulette because of the great sums of money he receives in the mail from Vietnam. Mike uses this money to travel to Vietnam and bribe people to find his friend. Before they left for Vietnam at the wedding Mike and Nicky made a pact to make sure they didn't get left behind. They agreed no matter what happened that they would not leave the other one in Vietnam. Mike isn't the type of person to break his promises, especially his best friend Nicky. Mike was distraught and disturbed by the fact that Nicky was still back in Nam. He couldn't live with himself knowing that Nicky was still there and sending money home. Also when they were in the prison camp Mike motivated Nicky to take the risk of using three bullets and motivated him to pull the trigger. Mike knew he wasn't going to die in a Vietnamese prison and wasn't going to let his friends die either. Also another reason why Mike went back is because he knew how much Nicky loved the trees in the mountains when they went deer hunting and couldn't let his friend die in that way.",The Deer Hunter
661,scarltbegonias18,The three main characters and how the war changed them.,6,14 May 2008,"#2) In the beginning of the movie the director chose to show the three main character at a wedding. The wedding if Steve's and he is marrying a girl who is pregnant with another mans child. Steve knows this but decides that he doesn't care and is going to raise that child as if it were his own. This event shows how innocent Steve is and how sensitive and emotional he is. It is those qualities that get him in trouble when he goes to fight in the Vietnam war. He is too weak and basically has a mental break down. He ends up almost dying in the pow and then after Mike saves him he breaks both of his legs because he couldn't hold on the the rescue helicopter and falls into the water. At the end of the movie Mike finds him in a hospital. Steve had lost both legs and one of his arms. Mike is shown in the beginning of the movie as this guy who always follows the rules. When he is talking to Nike he mentions that when he goes hunting, he has to kill the deer with one shot. That was how he was taught and that was the way he was going to do it. The movie also shows how Mike has this connection with his best friend's girl. Mike would never be with her though because he felt as though it was wrong to take his friends girlfriend. There is also a scene where one of Mike's friends asks him to borrow his extra pair of hunting boots. Mike won't give them to him. His reasoning was that they won't be together when they go to fight and that they need to learn how to fend for themselves. Mike is the only character that was able to withstand the events of the war and then come back home pretty unsecured and able to go on with his life. He stayed strong throughout the whole film, even though most men couldn't. The last character, Nike, was shown as the one who loved his life and was very open about his feelings. He was always trying the help other people. When they were hunting the first time, Nike wanted Mike to give the other guy his boots. He couldn't understand why Mike wasn't giving them to him. He thought he was just being a jerk. At one point before the they leave, Nike makes Mike promise that he won't leave him over there no matter what. Nike was afraid and wearing his heart on his sleeve. The stress of the war eventually makes Nike snap and he just loses it. He leaves the war without permission and start to play Russian roulette for money. He is a completely different person and won't go home. When Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nike, he sees that Nike had been experimenting with drugs and had completely lost his mind. Nike ends up losing the game and Mike watches him shoot himself.Brianna Block 4",The Deer Hunter
662,ksb53,Assignment for Craven,8,14 May 2008,"#3. What's the deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon? What is this character suppose to symbolize? In The Deer Hunter, the French man could be seen as representing the government of the United States. Just as he lured Nick into competing at Russian Roulette with his fancy car and promises of money and fame, the U.S. government was luring in young men by glamorizing the war, and the benefits. However, behind the glamor of the romanticized view of war provided by the government lurked the dark truth of the matter, just like with the Russian Roulette in the movie. Like the shooting game, the war was also a lose-lose situation for the drafted soldiers. They had two options. One was to fight, and be either killed, wounded, or emotionally scarred and traumatized. The other option was to dodge the draft, probably be labeled a coward, arrested, and generally shunned by society. Even though it could seem like an opportunity at first, any way you look at it, a soldier was pretty much screwed.Just in case you haven't figured it out by now, this is Alex Bates.",The Deer Hunter
663,luckyrunner,Deer hunter review,6,15 May 2008,"Crave this is Meaghan Cunningham from 4th block.#1. The Russian Rulette symbolizes ""one-shot kill"". It somewhat refers to the place, the USA, that becomes completely destroyed and changed for the men and women who come home from the war. It ties in with the happiness that the men get when they shoot guns (ie go hunting) The hunters in essence become the hunted, and death has an all new meaning. I don't really agree of disagree with this concept, there are many types of patiotism that we talked about. None is better than another, at least that's how I feel.#2. Michael, in the beginning is the strong one. While Nick and Steven fall apart, Michael is the strong hold keeping them together. He actually is so strong that he makes his friends rise to the occasion, and when he fails to be strong anymore Nick becomes strong, even though he's a little bit crazy at the time. But it turns out that even when one of them is strong, he can't carry the others and the can't save one another. I don't think it could have really happened differently..#3.

664,xcrunner-2,Predicable Personalities,7,18 May 2008,"Mike, Nick and Steve have three very different personalities before they go to Vietnam, and it is these pre-war personalities that determine their actions during the war and their personalities after it. Before Mike's Vietnam experience, he is a quiet, powerful, and thoughtful man. He is the type of man who enjoys the solitude and challenge of hunting that is his element. On the other hand, he is somewhat jealous of Nick because of Nick's ease with the ladies and his skill in dancing that Mike does not possess. Inside, however, Mike is ultimately a good man, who only wishes the best for his friends even though he may be jealous of them. Nick is a man who is small in stature, but big in confidence. He has good social skills and more emotion than Mike that allow him to be popular with the ladies and his friends alike. Steve possesses less confidence and respect than either Mike of Steve, yet he is the one who is to be married. He is a good man at heart, but not a man made for war. After understanding the personalities of these three men, it can be better understood why they act as they do during and after the war. Mike becomes the leader of the three men because his strong nature allows him to be less affected by the torments of the war, such as the Russian roulette, that hinders the actions of his friends. He is also the one who has the easiest time returning to his life before the war because he can hold the horrors of the war inside him and know that he did what he had to do. At first, Nick fares okay when forced to participate in the awful game of Russian roulette and manages to work with Mike to kill their captors and escape, but deep inside this face-off with Death takes a toll on Nick. At the end of his participation in the war, he is unable to move on and ends up continuing to challenge fate in ongoing 'games' of Russian roulette until he finally loses and dies. This is because Nick's sensitive emotions are crushed during the war, and as they are smashed out of him, so is his identity and the essence of who he is. Steve, on the contrary, is unable to to challenge Death in a game of Russian roulette and his conscience is destroyed by the war as soon as he gets there. He then becomes more of a risk for Mike and Nick to bring along than a help, especially after he is injured. He has much trouble returning to his life before the war, because of his huge loss in confidence that went when he lost his legs. He would rather try to disappear than make the best of his situation and support his family, but Mike comes and brings him home.All in all, the war was bound to have the same mental effects on each person regardless of the series of events because mental consequences are dependent on the character of each person, and not of the specific series of horrible events experienced during the war. The physical effects of the war are variable, however, as they are largely based on chance and luck. In the Deer Hunter, the most evident and cutting effects on each person are mental, so they could not have happened any other way.",The Deer Hunter

668,amichelewicz,Question #4,8,11 December 2008,"Alina Michelewice Block 2 Day 1 #4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nike? Be specific with this one and use examples.There are many reasons why Mike might have gone back to get Nick. First of all they were great friends. He and Steve are already home and they're just waiting for Nick to get back. He knows that Nick has probably gotten into some kind of gambling because of all the money that he is sending to Steve and the situation in Saigon is getting worse and worse. It is only natural for him to try to go back and save Nick. It is a huge decision though because it is hard for him to even get into Vietnam and the scene when he drives out of the embassy shows how bad the situation in Saigon really is. In the beginning of the movie, before the wedding, Nick makes Mike promise that he will take Nick home with him. You assume that he means that if he dies he means in a body bag but Mike takes it very seriously and he goes back to Vietnam to take Nick home with him out of the terrible state that he's in. Mike might also be trying to make Nick's girlfriend happier. He loves her too and he wants to see her happy even if that means bringing Nick home and losing any chance of getting together with her. He saved both Nick and Steve when they escape from Russian Roulette and he saves Steve again. He seems to value their lives almost above his and I think it is only natural for him to go back to save Nick. I don't think that he would be able to live with himself if he knew that he broke a promise to Nick. It would always be on his conscience that Nick died in Vietnam and that there might have been a way to save him.",The Deer Hunter

However, it's easy to get caught up in this game when you are told you could suffer an even harsher death if you do not comply. I think the director was trying to express that no one is ever safe in war, and that if it's not you who has a bullet in your head, it could be the man beside you.

What is this character suppose to symbolize?if you are really brave and lucky, i can make you very, very rich -julien.Known as Julien Grinda, the Frenchman who appears twice throughout the Deer Hunter represents how France managed to lure the US into the Vietnam War Just as Julien lured Nick into the twisted game of Russian Roulette. As the United States begins to take over the situation, risking the lives of thousands, France began to step back and watch the horror unfold. Nick proved to be the perfect candidate for Julien Grinda's twisted game. Nick, who was already plagued by the horrors presented during Vietnam was already beginning to lose his touch with reality. PTSD began to dominate his everyday life, clouding any joyous thoughts, disorientating his mind and judgment.As many soldiers did during the war, Nick resorts to drugs in hopes to relieve his mind; primarily Heroin. His arms soon become scarred with needle lines, serving as a constant reminder of no matter how much heroin he'll take, it'll never be enough to erase all the damage that took place. Believing that his best friends, Mike and Steven, have been killed by enemy forces, he feels that there's no point in living. he could careless if hes alive, or if hes left for dead.Hearing the sounds of Gunshots in a nearby building, Nick asks Julien what was going on. Julien responds, ""Wanna see what's inside?""; Nick agrees to, and from that point on the old nick is gone. He learns that they're playing Russian Roulette; the same exact game Nick and Mike played when they were held by a POW camp. Fueled by addiction, depression, PSTD, desperation, and not caring about his existence, Nick is lured into the game; soon becoming addicted.Amazingly, Nick manages to survive each of the rounds; raking in large amounts of money for both himself and Julien. Nick sends his money to Steven in hopes that he's alive. Mike visits Steven, and soon learns that Nick is actually sending him money. Determined to save Nick, like he promised on the night of the wedding, Mike ventures back out to Vietnam.After roaming around in the red light district of Saigon, Mike manages to find Julien; but this time he pretends to not speak good English. Mike, determined to find Nick, tries to bribe Julien with large sums of money. Hesitantly, Julien agrees and takes him to the club where Nick plays Russian Roulette. Mike desperately tries to reconnect with Nick, constantly reminding him that he can come home and everyone's okay; he paid the club owners for his release, so he doesn't need to continue anymore. When Mike discusses about deer hunting, Nick suddenly realizes who he is, and says ""one shot"". He immediately reaches and points the gun at his head, instantly killing himself. It's evident that Julien didn't care about Nick's well being. He was more worried about the amount of money that he a human life. Julien was even trying to come up with a plan to escape. If France wasn't involved in the Vietnam war, it would be extremely unlikely that the United States would be involved as well.",The Deer Hunter
673,ari_b,Answer to #4,7,21 December 2008,"Q: Why did Mike go back to Vietnam for Nick? First off, Mike had promised Nick he wouldn't leave him in Vietnam. So, it was an unspoken consent that he would take him back dead or alive. Second, Mike surely needed closure. He had no idea where Nick was exactly, or whether he was alive. He had to find out the truth. He cared about him a lot, considering the friendship we see among the man before they leave for war. They depend on each other, and Mike seems to have always felt responsible for the men. He seemed to have the most clear mind, and wanted to fix whatever mistakes had been made. His method of living is to do something right the first time, but of course his friends didn't act in exactly the same way.",The Deer Hunter
674,rafferty2891,#2,7,21 December 2008,"The different personalities of the three characters definitely lead up to what happens to them in Vietnam and afterwards. Mike is by far the most prepared for Vietnam. Before they leave, he doesn't seem apprehensive like Nick or terrified like Steve. He seems stoic and prepared. This leads to him being the the most normal after the war. He is also the most productive soldier of the three of them in Vietnam. To me, Nick seemed like he was very emotional, and prone to more emotional damage than Mike. He couldn't deal with what happened, so he turned to opiates and playing Russian Roulette. Steve was the least prepared to be a soldier. He was clearly scared out of his mind about going to war, and this was most evident when he was forced to play Russian roulette. He was crying and could not bring himself to shoot at himself directly, unlike Mike and Nick. He also could not keep himself on the helicopter, which lead to the amputation of his legs. Of the three, Mike was the only one who even remotely belonged in Vietnam.",The Deer Hunter

Stevie, one of Mike's friends, lost both of his legs during the war and Nike was still in Vietnam. Although he was still in Vietnam, he was sending high amounts of money to Stevie. Mike found out where his friend, whom he missed a lot, was and the money he had been sending to Stevie. I believe not only did he want to see want to bring his long-lost friend back home, but was also concerned about how Nike was getting so much money in Vietnam. I also think Mike knew Nike would be a danger to himself because of what the war did to him and didn't want him taking his own life.",The Deer Hunter
676,rdearth-1,number one.,7,22 December 2008,"Hey! It's little Donzie! :) #1. The Russian roulette was a shocking scene but was describing the Vietnam War. In the Russian roulette that the POW's were forced to play, there was one bullet in the gun and they had to shoot themselves and hope they didn't kill themselves. The idea of Russian roulette is similar to the Vietnam War because soldiers in the war only came home with a couple of options; The soldiers either died in the war or were psychologically scarred for the rest of their life. This is a similar concept to that of Russian roulette because if you survive Russian roulette you may struggle with psychological problems for a long time. This ties into patriotism because the soldiers wanted to fight for their country and be patriotic but it was at a huge cost because they were either killed or mentally scarred for life.",The Deer Hunter
677,tbeeler09,Film's agenda gets in the way,7,23 December 2008,"There are many things that The Deer Hunter does well. For instance, it does an unparalleled job of showing the emotional aspect of Vietnam. However, the director's agenda seems to get in the way of the film's overall outcome. It seems the point of the movie is being forced on us. And while it is a perfectly legitimate one, and one that needs to be made, it is often awkwardly implicated. For example, the very last sceneintended to be ironic and morose, it comes off as an almost laughable and completely unbelievable end to a story based on truth. It is no secret how the filmmakers feel about the war. From the graphic depictions of violence to the intense emotional transformations of the characters, it is clear from the first shot how we, the audience, are supposed to feel.A film The Deer Hunter is often compared with is Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The latter is by far the superior film for several reasons. Leaving aside the obvious superiority in the story itself, Apocalypse Now, acts first as a film, with a purpose of entertainmentthe war's impact is secondary. In Coppola's film, the audience makes their own conclusions, and therefore they are more meaningful.The Deer Hunter is a film with an agenda and no audience member enjoys being force-fed. Perhaps this is why so many people have grown to hate films like Fahrenheit 911, most Americans don't want to have one person's opinion forced into notoriety. This is not to say that the creators of The Deer Hunter were ""forcing"" a poor opinion, as it is one that is held by the majority of the population. The problem is that it is presented in such a way that detracts from what should be their primary goal: making a good movie.",The Deer Hunter
678,jeffparrott-1,Russian Roulette,8,23 December 2008,"The whole idea of Russian roulette in the Deer Hunter, is to show the audience that the Vietnam War was a ""life destroyer"" if you went to war or if u dogged it. If you play Russian Roulette you either shoot yourself or if you don't play, the Vietnam soldiers with eventually kill you by torturing you. The game symbolizes the sanity of the men forced to play or in actuality to go to war.The scene also helps capture the fright and the violence the Vietnam War had without showing an actual war scene. The film makers did not want to show the whole ""war film,"" thats been done before so by showing just a little clip of the American soldiers in a game of Russian roulette, symbolizes the everything about the Vietnam War. You either went to war, or escaped to Canada and would not be able to ever go back to normal life.",The Deer Hunter
679,bajunis,#4 Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nicky?,7,30 December 2008,"I believe that this sequence goes back to when Nicky, at Steve's wedding, demanded that Mike bring him back home, no matter what happened. Mike made the vow in that scene, and eventually kept it by the end. But, the idea of ""no matter what happens"" goes back to the scene where Mike and Nicky face off in Russian Roulette and Mike decides that there needs to be more bullets. Nicky immediately thinks that Mike is insane but he manages to get Nicky and himself up out of the pit. So they get the three bullets and begin the roulette, but there is a reason. Mike is willing to do anything to get out of the P.O.W. pit and save his friends (i.e. wedding scene) because that was his mission. ""One shot"". He only had that one chance to get out of there.",The Deer Hunter
680,C_Pratt64,Review for Film Studies,9,5 January 2009,"I loved this movie. It was an interesting look at the war and the repercussions it had on a small urban area. The steel mill created a feeling of real life working people being shipped off to the war without any experience. I felt connected with each character because they showed their lives, jobs and women. Once they got to the war it showed that they were split up. They met up again through coincidence and ended up being captured. Mike helped to keep the composure of the others while they are forced to play Russian roulette. After retuning home mike goes back to get Nicky and ends up having to play him in roulette. Nicky ends up killing himself and after mike returns to his home and the movie ends. I enjoyed this movie a lot and i think it was one of the best that we watched this year. thank you Craven",The Deer Hunter
681,rayboulay20,film studies review assignment,9,12 January 2009,I thought the Deer Hunter was a nine out of ten to me because I liked the whole idea behind the three friends all going to war with each other and to represent their country. After one in counter with the game Russian roulette Nicky becomes addicted and stays in Vietnam. Mike returns to America and decides that he needs to go back and get Nicky. When Mike finds Nicky he is playing Russian Roulette against a Vietnamese man. Mike tries to get him to leave but he won't. So Mike plays Nicky in Russian Roulette. This movie has a lot lore than just action in it. It has a lot of emotion behind it and trying to show the stress level of the war back in the day and the different affects it has on other people.,The Deer Hunter
682,con-man420,Connor's Deer Hunter assignment,8,14 January 2009,"Mike went back to go get Nick because they were buddies from the beginning and he wanted to be buddies until the very end. When Nick got all caught up in the roulette and all of the drugs he was taking, it made Mike really want him back to save him and hope that they could live forever together. When they played that final game of roulette, half way through it, it seemed like Nick was starting to come through, but then the gun shot and poof, he was dead. So somewhere in Nick, something wanted to come out and go home, but it was at the wrong place at the wrong time.Throughout the film, it seemed like it was fore-shadowing the Death of Nick. It would leave you hanging at the end of some scenes towards the end of the movie. When it showed that everyone came back and Nick didn't, right then we knew something bad had happened, whether it be death or not, but something is not wanting him to come back. Mike was a good friend to the end, he tried hard to get Nick to come back, just like they promised each other at the beginning. During the movie, it left you with the impression that Nick needed someone to go along with, he wasn't as much of a leader as Mike was, so that there could be an outlier. Mike was the leader of the group, and as the leader, he couldn't leave any men behind. He had to step up to take control to get Nick back. So if he did get Nick back, everything would be all goodie good, but their had to be some type of dramatical twist in the movie, something to leave you thinking ""dang, that sucks"".",The Deer Hunter

684,tshemilt,disappointed,4,12 April 2009,"i consider myself a movie fan, and was slightly embarrassed that this movie slipped through my net. So i bought it cheap from amazon. At last i finally get to see this 'masterpiece'. i consider the film to be in 3 parts. The first part i thought was slow but introduced us to the characters well, and the scenes of the town where these people live, show us perfectly why the thought of going to war appeals to them.Then all of a sudden we are transported to a village in Vietnam, no hint of training or preperation. Then it jumps from scene to scene, to where we find our 3 characters captured.....together, just the start of too many coincidences. There escape is far too easy, Michael managing to carry Steve to safety.....when in reality the prison camp would have a lot further away. The horrors they live with are based on the roulette scene, the shots in Vietnam should have been at least 30 mins longer, and showed a hint of the true horrors witnessed. in truth, at some points i thought i was watching a Vietnam spoof film.the third part of the film is the heroes return, which were OK with some convincing scenes, particularly The scene where Michael goes to collect Steve from the VA Hospital, but again i was disappointed. By the time Michael returns to Vietnam to fulfil his promise to Nick, i had lost interest.I am going to watch Born On The Forth Of July again........and i know i wont be disappointed",The Deer Hunter
685,tyleriosue,response to question 4,9,19 May 2009,"Mike goes back to find Nicky for three main reasons. First, he loves him and wants him to come back home. Second, he feels responsible for getting him involved with Russian roulette. Finally, he knows that Nicky is in serious danger because he is sending money back to the United States that he could have only gotten if he was risking his life playing Russian roulette.Mike has been good friends with Nicky for a very long time. He cares about him very much and wants him to come back home. The group feels incomplete without Nicky there and it feels like they lost him in the war even though he is still alive. Mike feels like he can bring Nicky back to life if he can convince him to return home. Unfortunately, Nicky really is lost and passes up the opportunity to save his life.Mike was the one who convinced Nicky to play Russian roulette for the first time. Even though it was in order to save their lives, Mike still feels a little responsible for the path that Nicky chose to take with his life. He also feels extremely guilty for leaving him behind after promising that he wouldn't. He wants to try to save him before it is too late. Nicky was very against playing Russian roulette when they were imprisoned so Mike probably thought that he could reverse Nicky's thinking again to try to save his life again.When Mike finds out that Stevie is receiving money from Nicky, he immediately knows that Nicky is playing Russian roulette to earn the money. This is a huge concern for Mike because he knows how dangerous it is. He has seen many people die from the game and he knows that he needs to stop it as soon as possible. In the end Mike's worst fears are confirmed when Nicky dies playing Russian roulette right in front of him.",The Deer Hunter
686,rpfilmstudies,Mike Returns to Vietnam,8,26 May 2009,"In The Deer Hunter, Mike returns to Vietnam to find Nike as he promised Nike that he would not leave Vietnam without him. When Mike initially comes home, Nike stays behind in Saigon to play Russian roulette. Mike goes on a hunting trip, yet he does not shoot the deer he finds, because he is a firm believer in doing things to the best of his ability, and he is haunted by his conscience for leaving Nike. He feels as though he has violated this principle by leaving Vietnam without bringing Nike home. Thus he returns to Saigon at a great personal risk and financial cost to find Nike. When Mike finally sees Nike, he finds that Nike has gone insane from the stress of combat and torture. In an effort to bring Nike back to his senses, Mike plays Russian roulette with him, which ultimately culminates with Nike's suicide. Feeling a great debt to his friend, Mike brings Nike's body back home for burial.",The Deer Hunter

As they leave for Vietnam Nicky tells Mike to make a promise that no matter what, he wouldn't leave him over in Vietnam. But Nicky and Steve end up in the same platoon and Mike is left a loner. The three of them reunite only to be capture by Vietnamese soldiers and forced to play Russian Roulette. They narrowly escape and are rescued by an American helicopter, Nicky climbs aboard, but Mike and Steve end up plummeting into the river. Mike stays with Steve until he comes across a group of fleeing Vietnamese citizens, at which point he gives Steve to the medic and continues wondering in search of Nicky. Mike ends up seeing Nicky in the Russian Roulette den in Saigon, but as he tries to talk to him Nicky rides away with the Frenchman. This is where I think Mike went wrong. He leaves for home without Nick even after he promises that he wouldn't. Even though it is never said in the film I believe that Nicky knew Mike had left without him. Mike falls in love with Nicky's girlfriend but can not allow himself to be intimate with her until he either talks it over with Nick or finds out that Nick is dead. He then goes back to Saigon and finds Nicky playing Russian Roulette. After much negotiating and a heavy fee Mike sits across the table from Nicky. Both of them knowing that one of them is going to die. Sadly Nicky ends up shooting himself, at which point I think Mike is grief struck, but somewhat relieved. He returns home with Nicky and the services are held, but in the end it seems that Nick's girlfriend has somewhat of a grudge against Mike, as if it were his fault that Nick was shot. So in the end Mike went back to Saigon to keep his promise and bring Nick home, but if you ask me I don't believe his home life will ever be the same after this happening.",The Deer Hunter

When Nicky tells him that he doesn't want to be left in Vietnam,Mike obsesses over finding out where Nicky is or at least what happened to Nicky when they are separated. Mike takes this to the point of avoidingintimacy with Linda and eventually traveling back to Vietnam when he suspects Nicky is sending money to Steven.

695,jaktrip,A brave de Niro is not anti war,1,7 May 2012,"War movies are in a dilemma. On the one hand, they need to show war as what it is: a hopeless and devastating human drama that many can't mentally survive if they were lucky enough to survive it physically. On the other hand, the watchers like action and bravery. These two things hardly match, because if you want to show the reality of war, there is not much space for superficial statements like ""trust me, I know what I'm doing"" or other showcases of bravery. And de Niro is shown just like that. He has a clear mind, does the right things, he has the plan how to shoot down the enemies that hold them captive (and what plan does he have? He wants to shoot down 5-10 Vietnamese that all watch him closely and are in the same room with ONE bullet hitting someone with a gun and then he can take the gun and finish the others off - yeah right, that certainly works out in most cases if it is real...). That is not war, that is Hollywood. End the enemies? The Vietnamese are shown as aggressive, simple-minded and perfidious people who love to play with the lives of men and who kill helpless women carrying children - while the US soldiers are like your neighbors or best friends. A little unbalanced? I think so. Definitely this movie is not going to help people get more tolerant towards different cultures (which I think is a necessity for reducing war). On the positive side this movie does show how, in a subliminal way, war depresses the whole community at home. But I just can't forgive the unrealistic glory moments and the mean way the Vietnamese are displayed, because on the emotional side these things promote war, instead of unmasking it.",The Deer Hunter
696,DLam33,craven's class,9,18 December 2009,"*** The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.I believe that the director is trying to show his audience the lose lose situation the Vietnam soldiers had to be a part of. The fact that no matter what you will die eventually in Russian roulette, is just like the feeling for the soldiers. They can go for a short tour and come home and be called a baby killer. or in the long run not come home at all, and if you are lucky and do come home, you will never be the same. Same with how you play the game, if you get lucky and get a blank chamber, you will end up keep playing until you get the loaded chamber. You can't win. I agree with this concept because it seems to make sense. You can see the toll that the game takes on Nick throughout the movie. He takes that long trip that turns him into a completely different person. Because the longer you play the game the worse you become. Exactly like the war. the longer that you're on tour. The worse you are going to end up. Personally I do not see the connection between this and patriotism, nor do I remember the discussion we had about it. All i can think of is that by going to war they were showing their patriotism. but that is all i can recognize.",The Deer Hunter
697,bbbrittanny,Film Studies Assignment,10,17 December 2009,"Question #4 : Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick?I believe Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, and as far as I'm concerned, most importantly, Mike returns for Nicki because he made a promise to his best friend. Because of his ""by-the-book"" personality, there is no way Mike can continue on with his life, knowing he has unfinished business across the globe; not only does Mike do this for himself because he needs to, but he also does it simply because Nicki is his best friend and Mike gave him his word. Another reason Mike returns to Vietnam is because he has experienced coming home from war, and life is too different without Nicki, despite his efforts and attempts to live normally. Examples of this would include: the fact that Mike does not want to attend his own homecoming party, because he is nervous, embarrassed, and returning alone (even though everyone already knows it is just Mike coming home, secretly they are hoping and preying Nicki will be by his side). Another would be the complete changes Mike experiences due to Nicki's absence. He can't do anything he used to without being constantly reminded that his best friend is not with him - he can't go back to work, because the two of them worked together. He can't go hunting, because it simply isn't the same without him. He can't stay in his own house because he shared it with Nicki, and it is nearly impossible for him to be comfortable there without his friend. The third reason I believe Mike returns is because of Linda. Though he so desperately wishes things were different, they aren't, and Linda is Nicki's girlfriend. The two grow closer because they are all each other has without Nicki, and Mike becomes frightened of the possibility of a developing requited love. But because of his personality, Mike knows he could never do that to his best friend, despite whether or not he would ever find out. Lastly, after Mike learns Nicki has been sending Steve money, he recalls the underground bar in which he played Russian Roulette for cash. In my mind, Mike is essentially the one responsible for psychologically destroying Nicki when he forced him to pull the trigger during their first encounter of the twisted game. I think deep down Mike too has realized this, and returning to Vietnam and finding Nicki is the only way he can prove to his friend he is sorry.",The Deer Hunter

But I had loved the way that they had shown the deer in the movie. Also I had hated the fact that Nike, Mike, and Steve had to play the stupid games that the Russin Rouletts had made them play. I believe the reason why Mike had went back to Vietnam to get Nike is because before that they had went to Vietnam they had said ""Don't leave me there! You better come back and get me."" So when they had made that promise Mike knew where Steve was so he had figured out that Nike was still there he had to go back and get him. But when he had found Nike he had tried to convince Nike that he had to go home. But Nike had refused because he was just so use to the Russin Rouletts that Nike was basically brain washed that he just didn't realized who his friends were and where home really was.

Nobody chose to play, but regardless they were forced. If your name was picked you got the letter in the mail, go to war or go to jail. Like pull the trigger or we will kill you anyways.#2(as you put it) Mike was a lot more squared away than the other two. i felt he was at peace with what was happening and while worried didn't let it get to him. I feel this served him well as a soldier because he took things as they came and didn't freak out about it. In a way he made the best of things.Nikki, on the other hand seemed very nervous throughout the whole movie. He was someone I feel had a problem with all kinds of addictions, and while he was nervous about playing Russian roulette the first time, he clearly got addicted to something there. The money, the rush, I don't know exactly what though.Steve, clearly a bit more ignorant, to nervous, not ready to be involved in a war. He lost his cool and it cost him his legs. I don't feel he has any redeeming quality about his personality that would have helped in a combat zone.#3(if thats what we want to call it) I feel the french guy was just a politician who wanted to make money, nam didn't concern him at all so hes just like all the other politicians who wanted to walk away better than where he was when it started.#4(last and ahh, well really the easiest question.not bad) When drunk Mike mad a promise to Nikki saying he wouldn't leave him there. I feel he needed to fulfill the promise. On the flip side, at the end of the movie I'm not sure if its trying to indicate Mike and Nikki's were going to be together with Nikki out of the way, but i got that impression. Maybe Mike in a way was hoping Nikki was dead so he could perhaps feel better about being with his wife.This has been a Block 3 production.",The Deer Hunter
701,cminer149,why mike goes back to Vietnam for nikki,8,17 December 2009,"I think the reason why Mike goes back to see Nikki, is because he knows he is alive and has a sense about where Nikki is getting the money to send to steve. So he goes there to try and have him come back to the States and get out of there and go back to old times with each other. And the fact that they are best friends and live together. But when he gets to Vietnam he sees Nikki, but Nikki doesn't recognize Mike at all and i feel it hurt Mike, especially when Nikki spits in his face, it was pretty intense. Mike also knew you cant win at Russian Ruelet forever, and that something bad would eventually happen to Nikki and he didn't want that at all.",The Deer Hunter
702,wapplet,Question #1-Russian Roulette,7,18 December 2009,"The sequences of Russian Roulette in The Deer Hunter were the directors way of representing the no-win situation that those facing the draft for the Vietnam War encountered. If they avoided the draft, they were called unpatriotic cowards, and if they followed their orders, they were ""baby-killers"". In the short term, one could avoid these options, but, like in the game of Russian Roulette, you will eventually lose. I agree with both the stylistic and ideological reasons behind using an unpredictable gun as a symbol for the horrible options placed before a generation. Although there are no documented records of American's being forced to play this deadly game, it does an excellent job of expressing the directors outlook on the Vietnam War without having to explicitly state them. Those views coincide with everything I have learned about the war, so I completely agree with the directors views. There were really no good options for those involved with the war.As with any war, or time of crisis, there is an issue of what exactly patriotism means. In the Vietnam War, it meant following their given orders no matter what for some, and for others, it meant defying hollow edicts sent down by a temporary figure head in order to honor the more permanent values that the American Government was founded upon. As is probably evident from my language concerning the choice, I would agree with the latter position-that patriotism means upholding a set of pre-determined values, and not straying from those, even when our country is in a time of stress, like in the Vietnam war. Of course, not everyone holds similar views on the elusive definition of patriotism, and that is exactly why those up to be drafted could never win. No matter what they did, they would always be condemned by some large group, for there was no majority consensus on which option was the right thing for the country. It was a fatal game of chance, like playing Russian Roulette.",The Deer Hunter

Mike soon realizes that Nick is still over in Vietnam and he wonders about his health and safety.He is concerned for his best friend who soon becomes insane while in Vietnam.

Be specific with this one and use examples Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nicki because he is a man that sticks to what he says. Before he left he said that he wouldn't leave without Nicki so he didn't. Throughout the movie, many examples of this are portrayed. Before their friend gets married, Mike reminds the groom that he needs to iron his tux. Mike has always and will always follow the rules and follow through with what he says. Another example is how the viewers of the movie know that Mike has feelings for Nicki's girlfriend, but like usual, he would NEVER do something like that to Nicki and take her away, so once again, he does nothing about it. Mike is the type of guy who, if made a promise, will completely stick with it. He is very all too himself, and strict. Nicki is one of his best friends, and with his type of personality, if he promised he wouldn't leave Nicki in Vietnam, you better believe he wouldn't even dare to NOT go back. Mike is a rule follower and very much so sticks to his word. These examples show that.",The Deer Hunter
705,kosei_carty,"Question 1: Symbolism, Many Hidden Themes",9,18 December 2009,"Like others before have reiterated, there was no good way to come out of the Vietnam War unscathed. The Russian roulette sequence provided me with a very keen sense of what the film was about. When the POW's play the game--some of them dying immediately, others later on, etc.-- one can deduce that every single one of them will come to a demise sooner or later. It is a game that quite simply cannot be won. Symbolically speaking, every option that a drafted soldier had could not lead to good long-term results. Draft dodgers were looked down upon and couldn't return to the U.S., and those that did go to Vietnam never came back the same, with emotional, psychological, and/or physical scarring. One brilliant way that the director illustrates this is the connection that is created between the Russian roulette playing experiences of Nicky, Steven and Mike, and the future in store for them near the end and after the war. When Steve plays, he narrowly avoids death as the bullet barely grazes his head, leaving him visibly injured, but alive. As punishment for surviving, he is thrown in a cage, left to maybe die. After the war, Steven's legs are amputated, and he is ""caged"" to a limited, undesirable life he is forced to live, in a wheelchair. When Mike plays the game, nothing visibly harmful happens to him, and he helps everyone escape alive, but ironically, he suffers excessive emotional stress issues after the war. Emotions were pent up and problematic for many people after the war, even though they were physically well. Lastly, Nicky survives POW-Russian roulette to play another day, and again, ironically, he appears to suffer the most trauma playing the first time, being unable to pull the trigger on many occasions, but he strangely continues to play Russian roulette after the war is nearly over. He psychologically unravels as his rather long career progresses, until he goes for ""one more shot,""--something Mike said to Nicky before they ambushed the Viet captors-- and ends up killing himself.",The Deer Hunter
706,MeganDoane,Deer Hunter Review,6,18 December 2009,"#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.The game of Russian Roulette symbolizes the Vietnam war and how it can be won in the short run, but if you play it long enough you'll suffer it's consequences. Those who survived the war rarely came back unharmed, most were physically or emotionally scarred. The director uses Russian Roulette to show that the Vietnam War left none without torment. Like the game, the war left it's soldiers with three fixed options: death, emotional or physically devastation. Unlike other wars many didn't know why the US went to war. Other soldiers can justify there war experience with there pride for their country, they had something to fight for. The Vietnam veterans had nothing to explain why they did such horrible things, or why they had to endure such horrible conditions. When the soldiers came back they were in some way harmed from the ""game.""",The Deer Hunter

When you go to war, if you're there long enough you're bound to come back scarred emotionally, physically, or psychologically. you can't be at war and it not have some sort of effect with you. Same goes for Russian roulette; if you play the game long enough, you're going to die. When it come to patriotism, in almost all wars one is going to fight for a reason to defend & fight for their country. In Vietnam, the war was so ambiguous that when the soldiers came back, they were tormented not only by their own thoughts but by the thoughts and opinions of fellow Americans who had no problem expressing themselves.",The Deer Hunter

This is a movie I will be watching over and over...",The Deer Hunter
709,vora-1,The Deer Hunter: Great?,5,16 September 2005,"This film is occasionally beautiful, but mostly embarrassing. There are shots with the crew in. There are shots with the boom in. There are inexplicable zooms and re-frames. The zoom removes us from the reality of the film because it draws unrealistic attention to the mechanics of the medium by distorting perspective with no clear cinematic purpose. There is inter-cut stock footage - 16mm!?- that is supposed to pass as principal photography, and no care whether there is match in color or texture with the surrounding picture. There are great shots - no doubt! the hunt, the river, the bar - followed by shots drowned in graininess. Was there a consciousness of continuity on the set AT ALL? With a great story and a great cast and a great crew, this film makes so many basic mistakes it is enraging.This measurement of Deer Hunter (and other films) by its performances, in my view, misses the central point of the medium. Film, as Kubrick noted, is not theater. It is not the actors. An evaluation of a film must consider the technique of the filmmaker.Film-making cannot ignore details. This film depicts a broad dramatic swathe, a canvas with parts that are very beautiful and moving and devastating, but with other parts where the painter couldn't care less whether the canvas had paint, or even whether the canvas had gaping holes - which The Deer Hunter definitely has. It patently ignores details. It is at best a first cut. It appears to me that Cimino could not control his materials (cast, crew, story). The first section of the film has problems even if you accept the radical dramatic purpose so often tauted, characterization. I definitely agree with those that say it could be much much tighter. An Oscar for editing? I'm amazed. I got the sense of the characters within 20 minutes. Why do we need 1.5 hours of that? We know what is at stake much much sooner. I would have done this in 3 parts, not 5. Remove the section where Mikey returns to USA, then goes back. Keep the hero in Vietnam, have Mikey and Nicky do their thing in Saigon. Then Mike comes back, tries to adjust, etc. Struggle for meaning, struggle to grieve, struggle to discover love, rediscover, etc. Then, the 2nd hunt: Mikey can't find the internal means to slay the deer, the shot goes astray. Then, the bar. Keep Johnny making the eggs in the kitchen, have him stay there, breaking down after humming a little of God Bless. Cut to the friends in the bar, they've overheard him. Exchange glances, no dialog, no glorification of America and total deflection of its potential for making a deeper statement against war. Just eyes, glances. Feeling. Visuals. Credits. 2hrs, tops. Remove the stupid stock footage. Keep it about Mike. I'm not convinced this film is anti-war at all. The dramatic impact the effects of the war had on Steve are deflected into a denigration of Bingo and the VA instead of the horror that Mike's seeing Steve could have been (""...the horror...""). I would have upped Steve's role in the wedding, let us see him, how vital, how physical he was. Let War itself be on our minds when Mike sees him again. We admire Mike and his medals, his noble and dutiful achievements, how gorgeous he is in uniform, how he does the right thing. ""God bless..."" It is insulting. Like Private Ryan. IMO, a film that does not come down against War, is ultimately endorsing ""some"" war, and is therefore possibly pro-War.An anti-war film is not a film that is anti-some-particular-war- filmmaker-doesn't-like-or-decides-to-use-as-a-cool-backdrop. It is a film that is against War, period. All War. No War is worth fighting. None. Anti-war also is not about hating bad wars that hurt Americans (witness Paths of Glory, Come and Behold, Stalingrad, Das Boot). This movie ends up not dealing with War (it deals with ""a"" war) and becomes some people missing their friend who dies.",The Deer Hunter

711,thhammer-729-925518,deer hunter question 1,6,4 May 2010,i think that the Russian runlet part of the movie is showing the risk that is taken when you are in a situation where a war like Vietnam is going on. What i mean by this is that if you are drafted and you do not go you risk jail time and being looked at as a traitor which can cause a lot of emotional and mental damage. Although if you did go you would see things that could cause you to loose your mind or worse kill you. Where in a game of Russian runlet if they did not play they were killed but if they played they would eventually be killed by the bullet. Also at the end of the movie where he is playing it shows that some one who went throughout the ordeal that they did could just give up on life and not care what happens to them. It also shows that some of the people were unable to live with them self to the point where they don't even want family or friends to ever see them the way they are and will choose death over life.,The Deer Hunter

When Mike got back to Vietnam, he found Nick (after spending a lot of money to find him) and tried to bring him back. Mike then find out that Nick was doing drugs and he played him in Russian Roulette, he tries to snap him out of the trance he is in and he is unsuccessful at it, Nick then kills himself, but Mike still felt the need to keep his promise and brings his body back.

After losing Nicky in the underworld of collapsing Saigon, Michael returns home. Although not acted upon before leaving for war, Michael's romantic relationship with Linda becomes more real and physical with the absence of Nick. However, Michael feels uncomfortable being in a relationship with Linda since she was Nick's girlfriend and the condition of Nick is unknown.

They need the risk, the possibility that their life could end for a simple game. Nick thrived on that concept. If their lives could be worth that little, and could be thrown away so easily, it was in their own power that they controlled what went on around them. To the point of life versus death. The game taunts the horrors that the men went through while in POW camps. Because they were forced to play by the prison guards, and risk their lives for the amusement of a bet, to them, their lives became a little less meaningful. If these men, who only wanted their death for amusement, could have that much power with so little thought, then why couldn't the men do that themselves? For they would rather have at least a little control and take the risk on their own, play the game for their amusement, and wash their own lives down the drain.",The Deer Hunter

Either they go to war and die, or they come back to suffer from physically or mentally debilitating conditions for the rest of their lives.

I thought they did a good job showing how much hell the soldiers went through and that using the game really showed the darkness of everything. I agree that it did help to show the darkness but am not sure if Russian Roulette was actually used as a means of turtour during the war or even if it was used for just pure enjoyment.Steevy was kinda the outcast because you could tell from the start that Nick and Mike were basically brothers. Mike was the strong one who never gave up. Steevy was never very strong but didn't ever really give up. Nick acted like he was so string and secure but in the end he lost it and completely lost all hope and just gave up on everything.Nick made a deal that he would stay and play Russian Roulette only if it meant that he would make a good amount of money in return.Before leaving for war Nick made Mike promise to not leave him over there no matter what..dead or alive.

Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently? Between the three of them they all had different personalities. Mike was a brute. He was loud and outgoing. He wanted things done right the first time and he wanted them done his way. Mike was strong willed and determined. At times he seemed to be a jerk but he was ultimately very nice, he just had a rough exterior. Nick was kind. He was gentle and in my opinion not built for war. He sort of went with the flow of things and just followed what everyone else was up to. Nick was strong but not in the way Mike was. Steve by no means was built for war. He was a very emotional guy. He just wanted to have fun and that's what he liked to do. When put into the Vietnam war, he got a overwhelmed with things. He wasn't emotionally strong and he couldn't handle the trauma. With each personality it showed how they dealt with going to war and the outcome of their time served. Mike was strong all the way through. He knew what he had to do to survive and he was willing to do it. He made the plans and Steve and Nick went with it. He told them what they had to do in order to survive. Mike was what kept them both going. He had his mind set on getting out so he created ways to escape. Nick was cautious with the plans Mike had, but he did them because he knew what Mike said was probably the safest bet. Steve didn't want to do it. Once they got captured and had to play Russian Roulette the first time he wanted to give up. His personality wasn't made for it and it showed as he cried. of course it is a horrible situation to be in and I would cry as well, but most people who now join the army are prepared to do those things. Although it's not certain whether any of them chose or not, Steve was not prepared. Mike was the leader and that is what his personality was. He told them what to do and they followed it even though at times they questioned him. They all suffered in the end. Mike was just angry after. He tried hard to stay calm and not show weakness but, he had enough and it was hard for him. Sometimes he exploded but it was usually kept under control. He just wanted to find his friends and find out they were okay. The way Steve ended up didn't surprise me. He was the weak link from the beginning and I at first didn't even think he'd survive. The War broke him and you could tell. He was both physically and mental different. Nick tried hard throughout the whole war to be strong. He almost forced his courage and in the end when they were out he went crazy. It was almost like he pushed himself off the edge.

The scene depicts the men changing and adapting to better their chances at surviving Vietnam. Using this particular means of torture, created a picture of how intense and violent the Vietnam War really was. The director wanted to capture this along with showing th ways in which the characters have changed. It was Mike's quick thinking that got the unlucky trio out of the POW camp. His by the book attitude, needed to quickly change if he was to survive his capture. His choice to try and fight his captures was unorthodox, as P.O.W's usually try to wait for help to arrive. Nick who is usually laid back and easy going must assist Mike in his attempts to kill his captures. Nick realizes that the only way to survive is to control your own destiny, and not to wait for the help of others to bail you out. Steve is the one member of the trio that doesn't quite adapt to the Vietnam lifestyle. It is only by Mike's will, that Steve survives his Russian Roulete game.

The guys knew from the start that most likely they were not all going to make it back and the game is a game of chance except in the end almost everyone dies..which is every realistic because so many lives were actually taken. So i think the director was trying to show how horrible it really was over there and how much the soldiers were put through..but also that almost 50% of the men that left never came home. I agree with the fact that he used the game to represent the war..it was chance you go and return or you go and die just like pulling the trigger you either live or die.Mike was the leader he was the most physically and mentally strong one of the three men. Steevy was kinda shaky..he acted strong in the beginning but obviously you could tell when they were captured how weak he really was mentally. Nick you could tell was mentally weak but you had to read between the lines to get it because he never showed himself having much weakness.Nick made a deal that he would stay and play Russian Roulette as long as he could make lots of money..which he latter sent to Steevy who had been brought back home.Before the men left for war Nick told Mike that he loved where the lived and he loved the mill that they worked at and he made Mike promise that he would bring him back there dead or alive..he didn't want to be left over there no matter what.,The Deer Hunter

Many Patriots who fought in the war began to question why in fact they were there. To many it seemed like playing a stupid game where you might not come home. It was impossible to win. I don't think that Russian roulette was a wildly popular as it was depicted in Saigon. Regardless, the message sent to the viewer is astonishing.

Right off the back he knew it was Nick. He wanted the three boys to be together again and close as they were when they first went to Vietnam. He knew that Nick would play the gun game and he thought that if he was there talking to Nick then he would of never played that game. Mike had a feeling when Nick played he would get killed because of something he said before and he tried stopping him but it was to late because once the bullet got but in the gun and Nick put the gun up to his house he knew it was going to go off and it did.

726,t-istara,Russian Roulette,9,12 May 2010,"I am responding to the first prompt, regarding the motif of the Russian Roulette. In The Deer Hunter it serves as a precise and powerful metaphor for the lives of soldiers involved in the war. Everything in the Vietnam War had a degree of randomness to it; even the draft system relied for awhile on birthdays drawn like a lottery. The idea that the men had no choice but to play the Russian Roulette symbolized how they had to fight even if they didn't agree with it. They had to put their lives into the hands of fate with no obvious cause. In the first Russian Roulette sequence, when Mike has to encourage Steve to pull the trigger, even though he knows it might kill his friend, he exemplifies the part the government played in sending young soldiers over to fight, with no guarantee of their success. This system appears to be set in stone, but the way Mike and Nick manage to escape seems to give the impression that the rules are all imaginary, and no one is playing by them. In order to maintain their own survival, they change the game, and use the put themselves in more danger in order to kill their captors and escape. The rules can be broken in the name of survival, and in that way the Vietnam War was gorilla warfare, with every man for himself. The loyalty soldiers were expected to give their country is directly symbolized in the Russian Roulette. Patriotism meant putting their lives up to chance. The most powerful scene in the movie, and perhaps in any movie I've seen, was the final Roulette scene with Mike and Nick. It showed how brainwashed Nick had become on account of the war. Even though he could leave, he was so psychologically changed by the system of the war that he could not regain control of his life. He instead left his survival in the hands of fate, and lost the game of chance he had been playing all along.",The Deer Hunter

Mike finally becomes exhausted and stops at a local basketball court, there he lays down against the net's base and looks at the stairs. Nick catches up to Mike and joins him against the net's base. As they begin to finally talk, Nick begs Mike to not leave him over there, in Vietnam, if anything were to happen to him. Mike, as a good friend, promises Nick this. Mike protects Nick in time of despair throughout the movie. Mike saved Nick from being a POW and got him to US Forces after, however they are unable to join up and Mike has no idea if Nick is still in Vietnam or back in the States. Later, Mike spots Nick at a Russian Roulette game, and rushes through the crowd to meet up with Nick. This is unsuccessful as a wealthy French business man escorts Nick out and drives away. Mike goes back to America, without Nick, and feels like he failed his friend because Nick is not there with them and Nick is thought of as AWOL and could be dead.

I am vietnamese and as other vietnamese people, we love our people, we love our country and Never, Never, Never made fun in killing my own people or other, we killing because American push us to do so, we have no choice. the story is turn up side down, from black to white , the Vietnamese people have tried with all their ability to fight the invade then as in movie they become the evil. on the other hand, the US come and invade VN and killing 5 millions Vietnamese people and become heroes, victims of the war. How many people have died because of B52, Napalm bombinng, orange agent.... the most evil thing is they use Vietnamize war, using Vietnamese fighting Vietnamese. If Vietcong are evil like in this stupid movie, how come they win the war? how come they got the strong support from the Civilians? Most Vietcong are the farmer, their life is their land, their ancestor. as the war go on, Us bombing, killing innocent people, these farmer had no choice, they need to fight for their life, for the land, for their country.

730,mpro1993,Film Studies Thing.,10,12 December 2010,"1. I thought that adding Russian Roulette to the plot was a good idea because it showed that no matter what soldiers who went to Vietnam did it was a losing game. If they stayed then they betray their country and if they left and came home then they'd be criticized for going. They could die or be captured in Vietnam. With Russian Roulette it's kind of the same thing, if you play it you may win but eventually you'll lose, and in losing you'll die. 2. Stevie, Mike and Nick are all very differently. Stevie, is mama's boy who is kind of portrayed as weak for marrying a women who is pregnant with another man's baby and just in general. Mike is the opposite, he is strong-willed and very by the book. Nick falls in the middle somewhere, he's sociable and probably the most uneasy about going to Vietnam as shown by his confession to Nick about not wanting to be left there. Their personalities really reflect how they'll turn out as soldiers. Especially with Stevie and Mike. I think their personalities outline perfectly their ability as soldiers. Nick's fate was a little more unexpected because I thought of him just as courageous as Mike, but a little more easy going. I think Nick easily could've been a hero in the film.3. The French character in the film who introduces Mike to ""Professional"" Russian Roulette symbolized France during the war. At the start of the war France convinced us to go and as the war carried on they turned their backs on America, much like the French man in the film with Mike.4. Mike goes back to find Nick because at the start of the film he promises to make sure Nick comes back, whether he dies or not. Mike and Nick get separated after they escape the camp. Mike goes back to America and realizes that he broke his promise. Mike is unable to function for the entire time while he's home and after he visits Stevie and is reminded of Nick he decides to go back and try to help him.",The Deer Hunter
731,amead22,No Way Out,8,13 December 2010,"The Dear Hunter is an excellent film that depicts the Vietnam war. It shows a good amount of pre-war, as well as during and post-war. The pre- war scenes are to get to know the various characters, the war scenes are to depict the brutality of the Vietnam war, and the post-war scenes are to see how the war really effected each individual in various ways. The various Russian Roulette sequences was one of the directors's ways of showing that no matter what, there is no way of getting out (of the war as well as the game) without being severely mentally traumatized or dead. I agree with the director's concept. It seems to me as though the Vietnam was so traumatizing, so fierce, so brutal, so grotesque, that it would be wrong for someone to survive unaffected my it at all. (Just like a game of Russian Roulette). If you play long enough, you die, but even once is enough to change a life forever. The tension of pulling the trigger and not knowing if it would be your last moment on earth... Men feared everyday in Vietnam that every day would be their last. The men knew the dangers of going into the war. They knew that they could die, be held captive, or survive and come back to their friends and families as completely different people. They knew that nothing positive could come of it but they knew that it was their duty to serve their country. They were patriots who gave it all for their beloved country.",The Deer Hunter
732,beesamstone22,"My Opion of ""The Deer Hunter""",3,14 December 2010,"""The Deer Hunter"" was a very informative film about the Vietnam War. During the beginning of the movie, one could never tell that the movie would end so tragically. It started with four friends, Michael, Steven, Nick and Stan. The four friends worked together at the factory and enjoyed their simple lives by partying and hunting together. Mike, Steven and Nick end up in Vietnam and undergo many challenges such as playing Russian Roulett at the POW camp and trying to escape. This part of the film was very graphic and I didn't like it. I don't understand why such an enormous part of the film was about playing Russian Roulett considering that there wasn't any evidence that this game was played for sport or combat in Vietnam. I wish that there was more historically accurate occurrances in the film. I was also surprised when Mike wanted to leave Steven at the POW camp trapped in the underwater cage because I thought that Mike would want to save his friend. I'm glad that Mike and Nick got away but things didn't end up well for Nick because he became MIA and got into really bad things in Saigon. Nick was my favorite character and it made me very sad to find out that he was taking opium and couldn't remember Mike. The worst part of the film was when Nick loses Russian Roulett to Mike and Mike has to watch his best friend die. Everything was so different after the men came home from the war. Mike was sufferring from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder while Steven was missing a majority of his limbs and sanity. It is a shame that Nick had to lose his life to sport in the war rather than making it with his friends or fighting for his country.",The Deer Hunter

Their personalities vary a lot and cause conflict and dispute between them cause of it. Mike wants to do things by the book and be precise. Nick is sort of a ladies man who likes to have fun and be with friends. Steve tries to be independent and he has issues with commitment. The men go to Vietnam and their personalities lead them in the beginning but slowly their personalities start to change and they have to change because of the environment they were dealing with in Nam. Nam starts to change them and this becomes apparent in every scene after the scene where the play Russian roulette. After that point the men begin to break down and change and all of them change completely as Nick becomes distant and sad ,Mike becomes lonely and desperate, and Steve looses his independence.",The Deer Hunter
734,hayleymadden,Russian Roulette,7,14 December 2010,"#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.Though Russian Roulette was not used as a form of physical and mental torture in the Vietnam war, it can be argued that the game is used as a metaphor for the outlook some soldiers in Vietnam may have had. Russian Roulette is all about playing the odds; wagering on survival and chance. However, if you play the game long enough you are bound to lose - which was the same case with the war in Vietnam. The way the Vietnamese set up the game in the POW bungalow created a lose-lose situation for the POWs. If the prisoners refused to play, they were drowned. If they did play, one of the players would be forced to kill himself and the other would proceed to the next round. It is more than likely that all the prisoners would die at their own hand. After being forced to play (perhaps a metaphor for being drafted into the war) Steve did not make it out of the first round of Russian Roulette unscathed while his friends survived. Next, Mike and Nick play each other with 3 bullets in the chamber; a highly risky move on Mike's part. Again, the men luck out,but Nick does not come out of the match completely unharmed. Playing Russian Roulette (fighting in the war) changed Nick - he became a junkie and detached and addicted to the fear and risk of Russian Roulette. Nick ended up killing himself in another game against Mike as many veterans killed themselves after similar psychological damage after the war was over.",The Deer Hunter
735,montecalvo-mike,#1,7,15 December 2010,"The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences were to show that the Vietnam War was a ""lose-lose"" situation. It was commenting on how no matter what if you went or were picked, you were going to get screwed in the end. Like how if you came home from Vietnam you would most likely have some disability, either mental or physical. Or, you would come back and the general public you were trying to protect would spit on you and call you a baby killer. So it shows that if you play Russian Roulette long enough nothing good would come out of it.This is also related to patriotism because of what would happen if you were drafted. If you went, all that bad stuff would happen to you, but if you stayed you would be deemed a non-American, couldn't go to college, parents and relatives would hate you, and you might have go to jail.",The Deer Hunter

737,cashin52,Deer Hunter,8,13 January 2011,"Response to mcraven 1. The Russian Roulette scene symbolizes the similarities between war and the game itself. I agree because when you are enlisted in the war, it seems like you are, at the same time, a prisoner of it and do what you must to survive. It is said a lot that most of you of won't come back alive. That is straight honesty and it is more serious when it comes to a game like Russian Roulette.2. Michael is mostly the leader of the three and is basically the most serious. Nick is the sort of quiet one who loves to hunt and Steven is nicest and most caring one of them all. Nick and Steven had suffered the consequences for the worst and it could have changed for Nick if he just didn't take the last shot.3.I'm not sure but my belief is that he is symbolizing evil because he basically introduce Nick to the thrill of drugs and money.4.

Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.There is no evidence that Russian Roulette was used to torture prisoners of war in Vietnam, and yet this concept is essential to the film. The director used Russian Roulette to symbolize the uncertainty of the war. The characters' chances of getting the bullet were the same as their chances of returning to America unscathed (both physically and mentally). This game was also symbolic of their enlisting options prior to entering the war. When an American man was drafted, that was pretty much it. If he ran away, he would be labeled a coward and be charged with a fine. If he went to war, he knew that he would never be the same again upon his return. And yet, even though these soldiers had little choice in the matter, they did not come home to a victory parade. Instead, they were viewed negatively as veterans. Add this anti-patriotic homecoming to their Post-traumatic stress, and the soldiers really couldn't win--just like Russian Roulette. I liked the director's use of this concept and found it to be a strong way to convey the problems that Vietnam soldiers faced.",The Deer Hunter

Be specific with this one and use examples.Mike goes back to Vietnam because he promised Nick that he wouldn't leave him there.

At this time Nick tells Mike that believe it or not he loves that town, he loves his job, and he loves going hunting with the guys.

I watched it for the first time recently after hearing many good things about it, however I was a little disappointed, mainly because of the over hype I read and heard, it's not a crap movie, just a long drawn out tail of a couple of guys who get married, go to Vietnam, and get messed up etc....The movie starts out fine but moves very slowly, even when you reach the wedding scene you are beginning to get bored, but that's not it, next they go on a deer hunt which is really exciting (not!).  I'm not looking for action and violence I just want something that keeps the viewer interested, I can hear someone shouting at me right now, your missing the point of the movie!!!!, maybe I have if only it would keep the interest of the viewer for long enough to GET IT.  If this was watched in the theatre, you would have to view it from start to finish and that's probably why a lot of the mature generation get the point of the movie when they saw it for the first time, it was a real first when it came out back in 1978, and must have deserved all of 5 Oscars it received.  I have to say when I watched it, I used the fast forward button a lot, not because I was in a hurry to finish it, but because I was bored of the sometimes pointless dialog.  The Russian roulette scene sums up a lot about the movie and the acting is quite simply excellent and convincing, this scene is very tense and worth just renting it out just to watch this scene.""IF"" you are serious about watching this movie, watch it right through (unlike me, who is a little impatient).

Mike is the stronger friend that they all look up to or lean on, he is able to get them out of horrible situations. Steve is pretty nervous about going to war, even though he really would rather not go he still does. And Nick being the youngest is really nervous but just deals with the situation. I definitely think that they different personalities of each character play a role on what eventually happens to them.

Steve doesn't say what's on his mind as much in a group setting, but rather pulls one of his two best pals aside to tell them what's bothering him. Mike and Steve are both older than NIck, though, and Nick doesn't seem ready to go to war yet at the start of the film. He goes anyway, and the three get separated after the Russian Roulette scene. Later in the film, you find out that Steve is in a hospital for veterans with no legs, playing Bingo day after day. Mike goes to visit him and brings him home, even though Steve wanted to stay at the hospital. MIke is the only one of the three who comes out of the war with no physical deformities. Nick, unfortunately, dies; he's in Saigon, gone AWOL, and lost a game of Russian Roulette.

Mike did everything he could to make Nick remember him, but in the end, it didn't matter. Nick died anyway, shooting himself in the head.

When Truman decided to send aid to the South Vietnamese, he declared that the French must give Vietnam and it's neighbors independence in order for the aid to continue. However, it is projected through the movie that there was still some French people in Vietnam during the war.The movie lost one stars because I felt the beginning could have conveyed each soldiers personality before the war in a shorter sequence.

754,silentg_17,Craven's Assignment: Why Michael Returns,8,12 June 2011,"It's late in Act One of Michael Cimino's ""The Deer Hunter"" that Robert De Niro's Michael runs drunk and naked through the small town of Clairton to escape the crowd that has gathered for his friend Steven's wedding reception. Michael's longtime best friend and coworker, Nick (Christopher Walken), follows him on his run and covers Michael in a towel after he slows down. The two begin to talk about their futures, and their impending trips to Vietnam. It's here that Nick begs Michael that, no matter what happens, Michael not leave him over there. Nick's request weighs heavily on Michael in the film's final act.There are a variety of reasons why Michael returned to Vietnam in pursuit of Nick, but most of it can be chalked up to guilt. Guilt because Michael wasn't able to stay with Nick during the helicopter rescue. Guilt that Michael couldn't reconnect with Nick after the two show up at the roulette den in the red-light district. Guilt that Michael has always secretly envied Nick's long time love interest. And most importantly, guilt that Michael has failed to stay true to his promise.When Michael returns to America at the beginning of Act 3, this guilt is constantly haunting him. He is withdrawn and disconnected, his body in Pennsylvania, and his heart in Vietnam, so to speak. When he discovers that Nick is still alive, he pounces on the opportunity to redeem himself, only for his whole plan to fall apart again, leaving him to return home with guilt that will likely plague him until death.",The Deer Hunter

Another reason is that Mike was also in love with Nick's fiancé Linda, and he couldn't bring himself to make a move one her if there was the slightest chance Nick was alive because that is the kind of person Mike is. In a way I think Mike was both happy and sad when he actually finds Nick because on one hand his best friend is still alive after all this time. The other side is that means if Nick does come back he loses any chance he had with Linda though he was glad to find him if there reunion was brief.",The Deer Hunter

Be specific with this one and use examples.Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick so Mike can settle the pain and loss of losing one of his best friends. In the middle of the movie, Mike returns back home (from Vietnam) without Nick. Mike, however, promised Nick's wife (Linda) that he'd bring Nick home for her, and his loved ones. Due to loss of communication during the war, Mike doesn't bring Nick home like he said he was going to. Mike can hardly face doing anything in his and Nick's hometown without feeling guilty. He can't even hunt deer properly without it affecting his aim. Mike could barley bring himself to face Linda and tell her that Nick didn't come back with him. Because Mike is so distraught by this awful guilt of not bringing Nick back, he goes back to Vietnam. While he's back there, he does whatever it takes to find Nick, including handing over $1,500 to the Russian roulette men. When Mike finally gets to enter the building where Nick is, he's crowded by all the betters of Russian roulette. The next game is about to begin when Nick appears in the room wearing a red headband. He seats himself at the roulette table, as Mike takes the opposite seat. Mike got lucky, however, Nick was not.",The Deer Hunter

Even though mike knows that when they leave for basic there going to be in different units. And this is shown when mike was fighting and nick and Stevie landed and you could tell they were fresh out of basic and mike has been fighting for some time now. Now Mike is sent home and they have a huge party for him but he chooses not to go because you know there all going to ask about nick and he knows that he is still over there. He stays around town for awhile and becomes closer to Linda but he knows nick is still alive and he cant seem to make a pass at Linda. And when hes home we see this bugs him that nicks over there. when he goes to see Stevie Stevie shows him the package that someone from Saigon sends him every month.

It is clear that they were great friends, and Mike could not live with himself if he just left him there. Also, Mike specifically made a promise that he would not leave Nick in Vietnam before they left. Mike is the type of person that if he says he is going to do something, he is going to do everything he can to get it done. We already know that Mike is the leader of the group, so he probably feels somewhat responsible that Nick was left behind in the first place.

759,njfiel15,#4 Why Mike goes back to Vietnam,8,18 December 2011,"The main reason why Mike went back to Vietnam is because he made the promise to Nick that he would go back. After going through everything with the Russian Roulette at the POW camp and being separated from each other; there was no way Mike could do that to Nick. You can definitely tell how strong their friendship is because Nick trusts Mike when they play Russian Roulette. The amount of trust that is needed to agree on something in a situation like that is unreal. Both of them easily could've been killed if Nick had not agreed to put in the extra bullets. When Mike finds out about Nick's whereabouts, he knows that he must go back to save his friend. Since Mike is familiar with the area and situation Nick is in, he knows Nick will soon be in trouble. When Nick sends the money from his winnings to Steve Mike knows that he is still alive and there is a chance to save him. I think that Mike also feels guilty that he couldn't do enough to get his friends to come back to America with him, especially Nick. Steve is one of his good friends but Mike and Nick clearly are closer. I think the fact that Mike goes back to America and is also living with Nick's girlfriend, Linda, puts some guilt on Mike. Mike also has feelings for Linda but will never try and get in the way of Linda and Nick because of his friendship with Nick. Even when Mike is in America living with Linda, he won't try to act on anything even though it's obvious that Linda is attracted to Mike. Mike is very loyal to his friends and he had one responsibility when he went to Vietnam and that was to make sure Nick, Steve, and himself come back alive. He feels as though he lost a friend when Nick isn't in America with him, even when he didn't know the status of Nick. When he ends up going back to Vietnam, they show how much Nick means to Mike because of the situation Mike puts himself in to save Nick's life. Mike could have died right there at the table but it was too late. Nick clearly isn't emotionally healthy but Mike tries so hard to fix that before Nick ends up leaving him.",The Deer Hunter
760,snowman8220,Deer Hunter by Adam P,8,3 January 2012,"The Deer Hunter is a great film that follows the journey of Roberto De Niro, or Mike in the film, to fight in the Vietnam War. But along with him is his best friend Nicky. Towards the end of the war, Nicky gets separated in Saigon and meets up with a rich Frenchman who runs an underground Russian Roulet den. This French character gets rich of running this gambling hall. Since colonial times, the French have had a major influence on the region and took over most of southern Asia. The French have always held power over the Vietnamese, so this is why the French man has power over the rest of the people. This character symbolizes the fall of a French Vietnam. One of the reasons that the United States entered the war was to help out France, but it the end it just back fired. This is the same thing that happened to Nicky in Saigon. Overall, I think this is a very good film. Rober De Niro did a great job in this movie.",The Deer Hunter
761,emmamagee14,Answer to question #4,9,18 December 2011,"In the film 'The Deer Hunter,' Mike, (played by Robert De Niro), is a very interesting character to analyze. He is trust-worthy, more serious than the rest of the guys in his group of friends, sensible, smart, loyal and very linear in his thinking of the way things ought to get done and how the world works around him. After his friend Steve's wedding, Mike, drunk as a skunk, streaks down the streets of Clairton, Pennsylvania, only to be chased by his best friend Nick, (played by Christopher Walken). After exhaustion finally sets in, Mike collapses and Nick catches up to him, putting his jacket over Mike's naked body and sitting down with him to discuss his fears of going to Vietnam to fight in the war. At one point, Nick makes Mike promise not to leave him in Vietnam, to which Mike half-heartedly promises, not knowing anything about what might happen or where the pair of friends will end up. Once in Vietnam, a series of horrendous events ensue, and their friendship is put to the test. Mike and Nick escape their captors, who forced them to play Russian Roulette for the first time against each other, and then were separated when Nick made it onto a rescue helicopter and Mike did not. That was the last time they saw each other before Mike travels back to Vietnam to look for Nick, who never actually made it home and hasn't been seen since. Mike goes back for Nick because of his linear thinking and the promise he made to him before they left to fight in the war. Mike believes that a person should perform tasks in order, and finish a task before going on to the next one. When he comes home and the gang goes hunting a second time without Nick, he lets a buck, who he could've easily shot and killed, get away because of his guilt for leaving Nick over in Vietnam and the realization that the buck isn't really meant to be shot just yet, since he made the promise to Nick first. Nick is also his best friend and he knows that the right thing to do would be to go and find out what happened to him and bring him home if he's even still alive. It's part of Mike's personality and he would never let Nick stay in Vietnam when he promised he'd never leave him there in the first place.",The Deer Hunter

763,mattdroppa,Why Mike went back,9,18 December 2011,"Mike went back to Vietnam to rescue Nick for one reason: they were best friends. A friendship as strong as their's is a bond that cannot be broken by distance, time , or any other obstacle. Mike would never leave Nick in Vietnam. Furthermore, he had promised he wouldn't. When Nick told Mike he couldn't abandon him in Vietnam, Mike promised he wouldn't. It turned out to be an empty promise, as they were separated during the war, and Nick was left behind while Mike went home. Mike didn't give up, though, and went back to Vietnam to find Nick. Mike had a very linear way of thinking, and he couldn't leave this particualar order of business unfinished.

770,cynthiat-bennett,#2 Personalities,8,14 January 2012,"The different personalities of Steve, Mike, and Nick definitely give a prelude to what is going to happen to each one of them in the war in a sense.Steve from the beginning of the film was engaged and got married. This told me that he needs someone to lean on and is very dependent. So during the war he would not be leader or the bold. For example, when he was capture with Mike and Nick and they were playing the empty/non empty chamber game he could barely shoot. Then he had to be rescued and carried along the way. All throughout the war he was leaning on someone else.Nick is a very emotional character and this showed through with many different things. He randomly proposed to a girl right before he was about to leave for war and at times was overly cautious and others the complete opposite. He handled himself through the war but I am surprised he made it because he was so distraught, especially when he pulled the stunt in the den. He took the gun with a couple empty chambers and shot a guy and then himself taking a massive risk because he was in a high emotional state. He balanced Mike out because Mike was the opposite of him.Mike was a very cautious and controlled man. He would rather hike on his own because he could control himself. He couldn't control everyone else around him and that was just too much risk to deal with. In his group of friends he was the dominant leader and everyone looked to him for guidance. Throughout the war the same thing was apparent. To get through tough situations such as being held captive, Mike was the one who got everyone through it. He was the glue that held everyone together, sort of the father of the group.",The Deer Hunter
771,tonyscronys,De Niro and Walken at their best,9,1 February 2012,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!! The Deer Hunter is definitely my favourite film.This is my favourite film because the actors are fantastic, it is very well directed and the theme music is on another planet.Christopher Walken won an Oscar for his role in this film and it was a well deserved Oscar. We see him transform as a person throughout the film who at the beginning is a guy who lives in the moment he can dance and really enjoys his life he is sad to leave but is ready to go to war. At the end of the film he seems like a person who is disillusioned with life and the events that occur in the war camp have changed who he is. After the Russian roulette scene it seems like he couldn't live normally again after what he had witnessed.Robert De Niro is also fantastic he plays a man who is level-headed, doesn't open up much and is clearly stubborn. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walkens characters have an understanding between each other they look out for each other and are very close friends. The events in Saigon affect Michael (Robert De Niro) as well. He comes back with very little to say and goes berserk at his close friends as he struggles with his feelings.John Savage is very good in this film as well he doesn't get anywhere near the same credit as De Niro or Walken but he plays a big part in this film. Steven gets married at the beginning and then goes to Nam with Michael and Nicky. Steven is clearly the weaker one out of the three and he is absolutely terrified in the war camp. He can barely breathe as Michael comforts him you can't help but feel sorry for Steve it is a very touching moment.There are some fantastic scenes in this film it really is a spectacle. The landscape is unbelievable looking to me because I see nothing like that in Belfast. The director does a fantastic job where he gets everything right not a bad thing to say about this film. The film shows us how going to war and being captured has changed these three men and if you think the Russian roulette scene in the camp is tense you should see the second last scene it will blow you way.",The Deer Hunter
772,JPGSSkg,'The Deer Hunter' was and is the motion picture that elucidates the understanding....,10,16 June 2004,"President Lyndon Johnson's decision to bomb North Vietnam and expand the war in Vietnam will go down in history as the 'high point' in the history of the United States. After we lost the Vietnam War, the United States began to decline as a major power and continues to slip slide away even today, during the Iraq War. The Vietnam War was that time when the U.S. forgot and then awoke to the terrible mistake of not only war, but 'wrong war.''The Deer Hunter' was and is the motion picture that elucidates the understanding of how the average American saw and initially misunderstood the Vietnam War. But it is also the motion picture that most explains the understanding by those who fought in that war, understood it for what it was, and returned home to disclaim it.The three principle characters in the movie spent only a fraction of the movie in the war, but that may well be the key to the story of the movie, that this motion picture carefully examines both the naiveté and the awakening of the principal character, played by Robert Deniro, who comes to understand the mistake of that war, but retains his hope for America.As history passes and the motion pictures are reviewed by history, this movie will probably move up in both the 'ratings' and in how many see it and remember, or see it and newly understand the significance of the Vietnam War in the history of the United States. I highly recommend this movie, both for its excellence in production and as a work of art, it's entertainment value, and it's place in American history.",The Deer Hunter
773,TheDeerHunter-TheMovie,Beautiful Blue-Collar Movie,9,9 March 2004,"Prior to my brief comments, I just want to say that the classical guitar themesong(i.e. Cavatina As used in the film The Deer Hunter,Composed by Stanley Myers with John Williams) is an emotional and soul stirring song that perhaps captures in music what many returning Vietnam Veterans, God bless them, felt.The part of this movie that grabs me the most is the wonderful and accurate depiction of a hard-working, working class small town and the strong bonds of friendship that exist in such places.  The small town is a dying entity in America and this movie shows the lives of faith, friendship, and fun that exist in them.  The circle of friends each having their own unique personality and problems, the one bar that they flock to and that one of them runs, the friends all cleaned up for The Orthodox Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, etc. all testify to the pure quality of this movie.Additionally, DeNiro, as Michael, gives a performance equal to his role in The Godfather.  The Russian element and the beautiful clips of The Faith of The Russian Orthodox was splendid, and had it not been a part of the movie the film would have lost much of its flavor.  The Russian Roulette with the VC screaming GUN ZU MOW is a scene that you'll always remember.There is so much more to say about this movie that I am absolutely inlove with, but this shall suffice.  In Conclusion, SEE THIS MOVIE, it is a true CLASSIC.",The Deer Hunter
774,cmbark19,Russian Roulette Symbolism,8,15 December 2013,"#1. The symbolism for the Russian Roulette sequences. What was the director trying to get at? Do you agree or disagree with his concept? Nick's infatuation with Russian Roulette comes from the game of Russian Roulette he played with Mike to save their lives. After the two become separated, Nick is left in Vietnam with nothing to do. Suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, he becomes interested in playing Russian Roulette for money. In a sense, it becomes the only thing he knows, and something he is used to, thus he keeps playing. This symbolizes America's quest for war, because Post- World War II America was still shell-shocked, but had grown accustomed to war. Therefore, America tried to spread Western Democracy to places where we didn't necessarily have to get involved. Yet, just like Nicky and Russian Roulette, America keeps loading the gun, and putting their lives on the line, because it's the only thing America knows. I completely agree with the concept, because our infatuation with patriotism becomes a mandatory quest to prove ourselves in the only way we know.",The Deer Hunter

Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed. The movie lacked substance and was void of any real character development. One hour into the movie, and I had no better understanding of how these small-town Pennsylvania steel workers lived.We were shown their poverty, their simple way of life, and their vibrant Russian Orthodox culture, but it was nothing more than a voyeuristic trip. We didn't get beyond the stereotypical surface. This being the equivalent of a movie trying to capture the essence of Washington, DC life and merely showing politicians in front of monuments.We didn't get a feel for who the characters were, what they stood for, and how Vietnam affected them besides making them nearly mute.In addition: Why were the hunting scenes that were supposed to take place in the Allegheny mountains of Pennsylvania, shot in Washington State? Strange considering they actually did most of the small-town scenes in PA and Ohio.Also, Oliver Stone's ""Born of the Fourth of July"" makes the Deer Hunter look like a B-movie.",The Deer Hunter

This movie did a good job of provoking thought and emotions and managed to tell a story that flowed poorly. What this movie didn't do was entertain. In fact, this has to be the most boring movie I'll ever watched in its entirety. After seeing this movie, I almost feel like I could go back and watch the final 70 minutes of Birth or the last hour of The Master of Disguise....but I won't.It was an hour into the movie before I could pay enough attention to learn a characters name. It actually managed to be interesting enough for around 20 minutes during their captivity and escape for me to not turn it off then. It also verged on entertaining the 10 or so minutes right before Michael found Nick up until the point Nick lost the game of Russian Roulette. I can't see putting maybe 30 minutes of sub-par entertainment in with another 2 1/2 hours of extremely hard to watch storyline and call it a movie.On the upside, the acting was very good (as most have come to expect from De Niro and Walken).",The Deer Hunter
778,mandinoel,**May Contain Spoilers**,8,27 July 2012,"The Deer Hunter is a film about a group of friends in small town America whose lives are forever changed as a result of the Vietnam War. This movie explores the emotional and physical repercussions of war, without taking a political stance on war itself. There is also a reoccurring theme of inhumanity in this film. Robert De Niro (Michael), John Savage (Steven), and Christopher Walken (Nick) play the three friends who join the Army and leave for Vietnam.This film appears to be almost equally divided into three parts. The first segment of the film is spent focusing on Steven's wedding and providing the viewer with insight into the normalcy and intimacy of their small town lives. The movie then moves into the war and we are first introduced to the brutality and insanity of Russian Roulette. Finally, we are brought back to America and begin to explore the impact the war has had on this group of friends. I felt the final scene between Michael and Nick was the epitome of emotional devastation. It was gut-wrenching to watch. The only other scene I can compare it to is the scene from Revenge when Miryea dies in Cochran's arms. Michael and Nick's characters represent the struggle between two sides of human nature. They each have very different responses to the war. Michael stands as a pillar of strength and courage. Nick, on the other hand, gives in to the brutality of the war. As we see Nick's character in the final scenes in Saigon, we see that he has completely lost himself. I also felt this film represented a strong sense of loyalty. We see this when Mike drops off the helicopter to stay with Steven and again when he returns to Saigon to bring Nick home.I felt there were several techniques used to reinforce the sense of inhumanity during the war. First of all, the angles of the shots when they were held prisoner and forced to play Russian Roulette were very effective. It was hard to watch the close up scenes when they were preparing to pull the trigger. The torture and fear on their faces was evident and it had a strong emotional impact. Secondly, I felt the lighting was effective in contributing to the tone. During the hunting scene, it was bright and sunny and contributed to the pure naturalistic feeling of the scene. When they were held captive it was very dark and gloomy. The sense of inhumanity was clearly expressed.",The Deer Hunter

Niki and Mike were friend and room mates they went hunting together and drank together and also said that they would die together if they had to. so he had to go and help Niki. the only problem was he had been on a lot of drugs so he couldn't remember who Mike was. Mike tried to save him but couldn't. If both Mike and Niki came back they would have been different and would react different to things.,The Deer Hunter
780,mistermagoo12,Absolutely not the best Vietnam movie,10,27 April 2008,"I'm just responding to the claim that this is the best Vietnam movie... There are plenty of other movies about Vietnam that are better than ""the Deer Hunter,"" ""Full metal Jacket,""Apacolypse Now"" Are two I can think of off the top of my head. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing movie. The only problem I have is that the beginning of the film, where the director is trying to establish what a small industrial town is like. is very long and drawn out. However, in the end, you do end up understanding why that was done. This film is not the best Vietnam movie because it doesn't really have much about the war and how U.S. soldiers treated the Vietnamese, which did vary. Overall, this is a great film, and I do recommend it!",The Deer Hunter
781,kingofny,A great movie about friendship and psychology in war,10,13 July 2004,"Most people criticize this movie as inaccurate, racist, and drawn out. On all three of those criticisms they are mostly correct. However I do not think this movie could've been made any better. I myself am a soldier, I have fought in Iraq. In my opinion this movie captures the relationships of friends before, during, and after the war. This movie isn't about the Vietnam war, the war is merely a backdrop. After decades of WW2 films, especially considering that most were cheesy action flicks, Hollywood directors needed a new war to use for their pictures. Vietnam made the most sense because most of the movie going public was old enough to identify with that war. I think this movie does an excellent job of showing the emotions of these great characters. One critic on this page noted that these guys really had nothing to go home to. Just a s**t job in a mining town. Most guys in today's wars don't have anything more than that to go home to but home is still paradise in their minds just like it was for Michael, Nicky, and Stan.The movie may not be the most realistic depiction of combat, but neither was The Dirty Dozen and that is still a great movie. The movie may not give you the best impression of the Vietnamese but I can't think of too many war movies that do. If you want a bare bones realistic experience of war, especially the Vietnam war check out Platoon. That movie covers perfectly what it's like to be in an Infantry platoon not only in Vietnam but in any war for that matter. If you want a great story about friendship and war I highly recommend the Deer Hunter.",The Deer Hunter
782,moc23,This movie made no sense.,1,5 July 2004,"Heavy handed and manipulative. You can make a statement about the horrors of war without inventing new atrocities about Viet Nam. This film insults the Vietnamese by suggesting some cultural fascination with Russian Roulette. There are no documented cases of U.S. Servicemen being forced to play this brutal game. Were the Viets really that depraved ?The ""combat"" scenes were ridiculous. One minute the guys are jumping off a helicopter loaded for bear and the next scene they're in some ramshackle, riverside, POW hut. And the ""rat pit"" they threw Stevie in for not playing the game was a joke. It was in the middle of the river ! How were the rats able to congregate there ? And if that was the punishment for not playing the game, it sure appeared a better alternative. Do you really think the helicopter would have taken off before Stevie and Mike were secure ? With no food, water, or boots, Mike was supposed to have humped crippled Stevie through the Jungle to ""civilization"", only to dump him on the hood of a jeep and walk away ?And really, what did Mike, Stevie and Nick have to come back to after the war anyway ? A stinky, polluted, industrial neighborhood destined to become another notch on the rust belt when the 70's economy tanked. (Billy Joel's Allentown). Since when is being a drunken steel worker a vision of paradise ? With or without Viet Nam, they were nonetheless doomed.You want to learn about Viet Nam ? Then don't trust the brain candy from Hollywood to be your teacher. I recommend ""About Face"" by Col. David Hackworth and ""A bright shining lie"" by Neil Sheehan. When you've finished those books, re-watch the Deer Hunter and you too can write your own scathing review.This movie has not withstood the test of time. It is never mentioned among the true classics.

The first hour moves a little slowly, but once you get to the end you'll realise that all this background was necessary.Quite simply, The Deer Hunter is emotional and gripping. De Niro and Walken are fantastic, and the film's final scenes rank up there with any I have see. There are many great Vietnam movies, but this is quite possibly the best one. It is not as much of a typical war film as something like Full Metal Jacket, but instead focuses more on the human aspect and the impact the war had on normal people who got caught up in it.

Include with this our discussion as related to patriotism.To me, the Russian Roulette scenes, especially those at the PoW camp, symbolised the risks and dangers that soldiers during the Vietnam War faced every day. There are no documented cases of prisoners being forced to play this brutal game, instead, the screenwriter was trying to show us how Mike, Steve and Nick put there lives on the line just by going over there. He is trying to show how a soldiers life isn't in his own hands while engaging in war, but instead is in the hands of dumb luck. Cimino showed us that the Vietnam War was one big Russian Roulette game and that everyone had to pull the trigger.The movie to me is patriotic on one level in the sense that it pays tribute to the troops by showing the horrors they went through and the impact it had on our lives, the movie showed very well the struggles many veterans went though trying to assimilate back into society at the end of the war. On the same not it showed how pointless and unnecessary the war was and that the US did more harm than good over there.",The Deer Hunter

This character study is important to subtly establish traits of the three main characters that later demonstrate why they all fared the way they did in Vietnam. Steve's kind and accepting personality is demonstrated by his marrying Angela, a woman that is pregnant with another man's child. He also shown to still be under some kind of influence of his mother. This would explain why he doesn't fare well in combat and why he regresses to a child like state, hoping that Mike will protect him. Nick is shown to be a risk taker in the wedding arc. This obviously explains why he becomes so invested in playing Russian Roulette. Mike is shown to be the leader of his group of friends. They come to him for help and he generally has the last say on issues. Mike refuses to act on his feelings for Nick's girlfriend due to his dedication to their friendship. These traits display themselves in Vietnam when Mike assumes his role as leader of the three and protects both Nick and Steve.

Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently?I think that, as sensitive and impressionable as Steve was, it was no surprise that he broke down like he did as soon as he discovered the bleak and terrifying reality of what Vietnam really was. The same goes for Mike. He was clearly the strongest of the three friends, and there was no doubt in my mind that he would pull through Vietnam valiantly, and with at least most of his mental and physical health in tact. However, what really surprised me was what happened to poor Nick. He was clearly not as flimsy as Steve was, nor was he as tough as Mike, and yet I think he was the most profoundly affected by the terrors of Vietnam.

The first and most obvious reason is that Mike and Nick are friends. The next reason is that Nick asked him not to leave him in the scene after the wedding. Mike and Nick were at a basketball court and after a bit of drunken conversation Nick gets serious and pleads to Mike that no matter what happens to please not leave him. The final reason is that Mike feels bad. He feels bad that he left Nick there. He feels bad about the fact that he has had a thing with Nick's girl. He feels selfish for knowing what is probably going on with Nick and not telling anyone. He also knows that Linda wants Nick back and because he loves her which means he wants to make her happy he will go back to get him.,The Deer Hunter
791,m-manning56,Russian Roulette--Inherently 'Nam,9,11 December 2012,"The use of Russian Roulette in the film may at first appear as only a nominal detail, something to move a plot simply by its usage as a torture device; it may appear no different than other tortuous actions such as starvation, solitary confinement, or water torture. However, Russian Roulette has qualities that express the fundamental nature of Vietnam, making it a device that is not only gripping, terrifying, and animated, but also thematically relevant. In the context of the film, Roulette is a lose-lose situation. In the presence of captors, a POW is expected to perform the action of Roulette on oneself, with two obvious outcomes. The prisoner either fires off a shot without ammunition, remaining physically unharmed (although psychologically wounded) or fires a bullet into their head. If the prisoner ""wins"" at their game of Roulette, they are only expected to do it again. There is no way to overcome the challenge. The same applies to the adopted veteran mentality for Vietnam. A soldier has two outcomes: become a casualty or not. If so, well--the negativity is apparent. If not, a soldier was to return home disillusioned, an object of disdain or uncertainty that was judged for voluntarily contributed to an immoral cause. As with Roulette, a veteran's fate was faced either physical or mental harm. It also faced repetition; if a man survived the difficulties of Vietnam, he had to face the difficulties of a scornful existence at home. If a man survived a round of Roulette, he had to endure the challenge of the odds yet again. The director is attempting to demonstrate the helplessness, the raw brutality and lack of morality that the war went down in history for. It was not a gentleman's war; it was not one of compromise, prediction, or historical relevance. This was a new warfare, one that Americans (both those serving and those viewing the action on television, which occurred for the first time) had never witnessed before. It is a brilliant representation, both memorable and gripping attention, but also applicable to the core conceptual characteristics for which this hellish war is known.",The Deer Hunter

Nick, who enjoyed the small town aspect of Clairton, has a pretty good thing going back in the states, and begs Mike not to leave him ""over there"" should anything happen. Mike, who is overcome with grief and guilt due to the events that occurred overseas, feels as though he owes his friend a rescue attempt. Obviously the battlegrounds of the Vietnam War are not a very welcoming place, so this was not a light decision. Mike, who was convinced by Nick earlier in the film to lend Stanley his boots, shows character development by making the choice to return for Nick; it indicates that he now cares enough about his friends to risk his own life.",The Deer Hunter

Him introducing Nick to the roulette den symbolizes the french presenting this opportunity to stop communism, as well as gain resources from them. The fact that he no longer deals with that scene or will even show Mike where Nick is. This represents the fact that the French, despite their recent conflict with Vietnam sort of turns a blind eye to the American conflict in Vietnam and even criticizes it. Basically the Frenchman introduced Nick to the conflict then and then turned his back and walked away, just like the french did in Vietnam to the Americans, hence the french nature of the Frenchman.",The Deer Hunter
794,gage-gonsalves,"Finger on the trigger,",7,12 December 2012,"the Vietnam war was perhaps the greatest example of savagery. The game of Russian roulette is a perfect example of such dehumanization. The deer hunter uses Russian roulette as a symbolic metaphor for the Vietnam war itself, no matter who pulls the trigger somebody will always end up dead in the end. During the hostage scene while Robert Deniro (mike) and Christopher Walken (nick) are forced to play at gun point. Nick goes into a panic attack as he is forced to play, he was always a risk taker but now that he realizes his life is in danger he buckles under the pressure and cant take it. Mike tries to talk him through it as the gun is forced into nicks hand and the trigger is pulled. The directors choice in sound is a fantastic feature, the much anticipated click of the hammer, followed by the thump of the barrel rolling into place adds an extreme amounts of suspense that you can know will build up to a sudden and untimely demise. The director uses this scene to display the cruelty and dehumanization in guerrilla warfare. cruelty that can be used for recreational purposes amongst the ranks. Later on in the film when mike travels back to Vietnam deep into the center of an underground gambling facility he finds nick playing the same game his captors made him play, for sport. nick never could resist a gamble as a risk taker and decides to do risk his life night after night for large payouts. It is assumed that Nick is high on opium or some sort of narcotic because when mike approaches him he has no prior memory of his best friend.Nick ends up blowing his brains out and mike takes his body home from Vietnam to America.the director uses nicks death as an example that if you keep testing your luck it will eventually run out and end in horrible circumstances.",The Deer Hunter

There are a few reasons for why he does this. One reason is that Mike made a promise to Nick during that one scene where Mike runs down the street naked after Stevie's wedding. He promised Nick that he wouldn't leave him behind in Vietnam. Mike felt obligated as a friend to venture back into Vietnam and find out what happened to him and bring him home. Another reason he wanted to bring Nick home was because he wanted to make Linda happy. Even though Mike was in love with Linda, it was against his moral code to just leave Nick in Vietnam so he could be with her. It was apparent to Mike that Linda still had strong feelings for Nick, as shown in that scene where Mike stops at the grocery store and sees Linda crying in the storage room. I think Mike cared more for the well-being of Linda and Nick than his hopes for a relationship, and I think Mike knew Linda could never be happy unless he brought Nick home to her.",The Deer Hunter

Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently? Ohhh man, these three men are so different, and yet I love each one of them! Stevey, clearly the young, sensitive, and even fragile man of the group showed his personality as early on as the first scene when he is hanging out with his friends. His mother comes into the scene telling Steve what he can and cannot do and telling him to get home. He then divulges to Nick, at his own wedding, that his wife is pregnant... The problem is obvious when Steve explains that him and his wife have not yet slept together. Later, in Vietnam, Steve seems to be more affected by the torture of the Vietnamese than the rest of the gang, as he struggles to fight back his panic attacks.Nick, the more fun-loving friend, professes his love to his friend, Linda, at Stevey's wedding... He is spontaneous! He is sweet and a great friend, (He comforts Stevey and Mike/balances them out a few times in the beginning). When he is in Vietnam, the Russian Roulette reallllyyy messes with his head, and I suppose leaving Mikey behind did too. While he is missing, he begins to play Russian Roulette for money and seems to have P.T.S.D. Buuuuut he sends Steve the money he makes, which shows he still had intentions of looking after him. Although we are supposed to see the huuuge connection with his character at the beginning to the character we see later on; I did not.. The only biiigg connection I see is that Nick and Steve depended on Mike throughout the whole movie.. He was sort of their rock.Ohhhh Mikey. He was the best hunter out of his friends.. Deer hunter.. Ha! Mike is always very calm (disregarding one drunk scene), and is usually the level-headed one of the group, but there is a slight sense of resentment in everything he does at the beginning.. I believe that Mike felt as though he was being taken advantage of, but then again he knew he was the unspoken leader of the group. This showed as the three buds progressed through Vietnam. Nick and Stevey depended on Mikey for the answers and their next move, and when he wasn't there, they were lost.

It was a story about people who lived, worked, and drank together in a Russian Orthodox community where a few men were drawn into the war and how that war affected their way of life.I was 21 years old at the time and in the Air Force when The Deer Hunter came on HBO. For the times, it was as critically acclaimed as The Exorcist was in the early seventies. But yet, people seem to gain disappointment over a movie when they see it 10, 20, or more years later.

However, after many years it now seems this movie is a typical liberal distortion of what really happened in Vietnam. While I'm sure some were deeply affected by their experience, the notion of being forced to play Russian roulette is absurd. All veterans I've heard discuss this say they never ever heard that being done. One veteran i talked with told me that ..""think about it..if your captured in war, your captures are not gonna put a loaded weapon in your hand"".

800,ddamato95,Response # 2,7,8 January 2013,"Michael, Steven, and Nick are three friends who work in a factory during the Vietnam war. Surrounded by other friends and a familiar group and town, they live life relatively carefree, until they enlist and are sent to Vietnam, shortly after Steven's wedding. Nick is easygoing and relaxed, all about having fun and taking life as it comes. He is the only character that really understands and respects Mike's quiet, surly manner, and Mike went as far as to say that NIck is the only one he would trust to take deer hunting. Mike is by far the most serious. He may laugh or joke at times, but he knows what needs to be done and who needs to do it. Steven is more of a nervous fellow who cannot stand up under pressure. The wife he married was already pregnant, and he did it more for her sake than his. Entering Vietnam, these differences definitively shaped their experiences and reactions to those experiences. After being assigned to separate units for a while, the three meet up after a town has been raided in the jungle. Unfortunately, they are captured and brought to a Vietcong camp nearby on the river. Here the prisoners are forced to play Russian roulette (while not historically accurate, this serves to show the chance-like quality of the war). Under the pressure, Steven snaps and is left to die. Mike argues with Nick and convinces him to risk his life in extreme circumstance to try to escape. After a painful round of Russian roulette, they escape and are rescued by an American helicopter, but split up during the recovery. Mike goes home without Nick, and although he has certainly lost his innocence he is able to still move on. Steven refuses to leave his hospital bed, and can no longer face the world, just as he has never been able to stand up to things outside of his control. Nick stayed in Vietnam and continued to play Russian Roulette until it eventually killed him. He always was the most optimistic, innocent, and willing to take risks, and Vietnam killed him, if not physically, in the end. Innocence was lost with the war and Nick symbolizes the loss of innocence and optimism, only the methodical and strong such as Mike were able to survive.",The Deer Hunter

Another example of Mike possibly feeling guilty is the fact that as soon as he heeded that Steve was alive, he rushed to find him and ask him if he knew anything about Nick.

MICHAEL makes it painfully clear in the early scene when he tells NICK: (paraphrase) ""If it weren't for you, I would go it alone."" ""ONE SHOT, ONE KILL"" -- an extended metaphor? Whether in the mountains of PA, or the back alleys of Saigon (shooting deer, or shooting oneself), life is portrayed as tragically transient -- something to be protected and cherished, rather than squandered and taken for granted. Should Michael have done more to get Nick out? Should he have not tried at all? To what lengths will one go to protect what one holds dearest? When viewing this film, one might try and put oneself in Michael's position, and honestly assess how such fragility can be protected.",The Deer Hunter

Now at an age where I can understand the themes and power of this story I have fully realized its greatness.The acting in this movie is some of the best i've ever seen period. Robert De Niro is perfectly cast as the mentally and physically tough natural born leader, Michael. As well as Christopher Walken completely deserving of his best supporting actor award. Meryl Streep also turns in an extremely powerful performance. But for me the stand-out performance is John Savage. His acting in this film perfectly illustrates the horror of war and harrowing nature of it's affect during and after the war.As previously stated by the title this is a film for the senses. Cimino has perfectly directed and co-wrote this masterpiece. He seamlessly leads us from monotony to horror to sadness. Having us feel for the characters and in turn questioning our own endurance.Overall the Deer Hunter is an extremely unique film experience with standout performances, powerful soundtrack and direction which all combine to make this one of the most powerful films of all time.",The Deer Hunter

I agree with other people here who have noted that this is not a war movie as we usually define war movies. War movies focus on war, battles and war-based story-lines, and I like many war movies, but this movie is not that at all. It is much more a story of friendship and what happens to this group of friends when traumatic events enter their lives. I have never been moved by a movie as I was/am by this movie. It is not the Russian roulette scenes or war scenes that do it to me, but instead the way the actors pull off their parts in such a moving and phenomenal way. This is the best movie I have ever seen in terms of its strength and emotion that it creates. It is not particularly a great plot or storyline, but that is not important for it to be great. It just amazes me!",The Deer Hunter

In the movie, The Graduate, Mike and his friends go to Vietnam. Throughout the movie, Mike ends up going back to Vietnam to find his close friend Nick. This was a very brave and loyal thing for Mike to do, because he could have easily just left. Mike did not leave his friend behind because Mike promised Nick that he wouldn't leave him. Nick asked Mike not to leave him because he is all he has. Mike found Nick and tried to help him get out as well. Even though Nick had broken legs from falling into the water, and hitting rocks, Mike still proceeds to help him. Without Mike, Nick has nothing.

811,hchen9696,Russian Roulette #1,8,15 December 2013,"Whether one likes to view The Deer Hunter as a drawn-out war film or a huge allegory to the dehumanization of a conflict that had the logical premise, the concept and action of Russian Roulette is a huge part of the film. Russian Roulette is a lose-lose situation. No matter how long you survive, you will die eventually. The first sequence of Russian Roulette was shown through Mike and Nick's perspective as they were forced to play against each other. It was eventually Mike's swift actions that allowed him and Nick to escape with Steve. The symbolism of Russian Roulette is exactly the same thing for the United States. If we went to war and we ""won"", we would lose so many lives in the process for the title of victor in a pointless war of attrition. If we lost, we would still lose many American lives in the process and the trust in the government from the pubic's perspective would heavily damaged. What the film was trying to depict was that Vietnam was a long drawn-out version of Russian Roulette, especially for the veterans. The veterans that sacrificed everything would be scolded and criticized for doing something they had no choice in. In both Russian Roulette and the Vietnam War, whether the prize is winning a war between Communism and Democracy, or in Nick's case-making money and getting high-there is no true victory; there is only loss.",The Deer Hunter

The last night before the war, the men all attend Steve's wedding as a final goodbye. The men consume much alcohol and enjoy themselves while they still can. The following morning, they plan to go hunting together for the last time before the war. It is here in the film when the men express affection they have towards one another. Nick, being the sensitive one, opens up to his boys. He explains how much he loves his average life and his average income. Additionally, he states his love towards his friends and towards the life he lives. He loves working with his friends, hunting with his friends and so on. He then asks Mike to make a promise to him. The promise is that no matter what, he will not leave Nick in Vietnam. Mike accepts. Once Steve leaves the war on injury and Mike gets shot in order to return home, Nick is stranded in Vietnam playing Russian Roulette for money. He doesn't do this consciously however.

813,dckane34,"Different Personalities of Nick, Mike and Steve",8,12 December 2013,"Nick, Mike, and Steve all played somewhat archetypal characters in their roles as members of the tightly knit friend group The Deer Hunter follows. Mike plays the left brained, organized, orderly, powerful leader of the group. Mike is well respected by everyone, hes somewhat quiet, and hes the best hunter of them all. In general, what Mike says, goes. This serves him very well as a soldier in Vietnam. He is able to keep a level head when in extreme situations, such as when he was a POW and used Russian Roulette to evade his captors. Mike was the only one of the three men to come out of Vietnam whole, and that makes sense when you look at his strong personality. Steve was quite the opposite. It was evident from the beginning that Steve wasn't as strong as Mike or Nick. He married a woman who was pregnant with another mans child, which would have been a sign of shame and weakness in those times. He also seemed very uncomfortable with going to Vietnam and freaked out when he was taken captive. It also makes sense that Steve would be the one to lose his legs, given his weak personality. Nick fell somewhere in the middle of the two. Nick was gregarious, funny, very well liked, happy and charming. He told Mike that he loved his life as a steel mill worker ,and made Mike promise not to leave him in Vietnam. Nicks strengths and courage kept him alive for a while with a little help from Mike, but ultimately he succumbed to the extreme circumstances. Nick was the most psychologically damaged of the three after the war. It makes sense that Nick, the one who loved the beautiful life he lived before, would be so traumatized by all the atrocities he witnessed and took part in. The games of Russian Roulette drove Nick to the point that he didn't value his life and was willing to keep playing for money. His Heroin use also probably played a role. I know you said in class that there was an alternate ending where Nick and Mike switch roles, but i definitely prefer it the way it is. It would be out of character for Mike to be the one who goes crazy and needs to be rescued. Although the ending was terribly sad, (as was the entire movie), I really enjoyed watching it and wouldn't want to see it changed.",The Deer Hunter

At first, the man lures Nick into the den and gets him to join, like how France, being an ally of the U.S., brought America into the Vietnam war. However, when the den becomes dangerous, the man abandons it and, in a way, leaves Nick for dead. While it's not necessarily true, the film is essentially saying that France got the U.S. into Vietnam and then left without trying to get them back out. I'm not entirely certain if the director was trying to blame France for the troubles in Vietnam, but it certainly seems to be the case. One way or the other, once Nick (America) is in, the only way out is to lose.",The Deer Hunter
815,jsdfilm4,Long but Worth It,7,14 December 2013,"I went into The Deer Hunter expecting it to be another war movie but left very shocked. The Deer Hunter starts off very slowly in America and follows the three main characters Mike, Steve and Nick. A large portion of the movie is spent outside of Vietnam and is used to develop the three characters which the audience soon grows attached to. The majority of said development takes place during Steve's wedding and a hunting expedition. A major part of the development of their characters is used to point out their character flaws. Steve's flaw is the most obvious and can be seen during the wedding sequence. Steve marries a pregnant woman and admits to his friends that the child is not his. While it may not appear like much, in the context of The Deer Hunter, Steve's naiveté will prove to be a weakness during war. Nick's also exhibits his character flaw during the wedding when he proposes to his girlfriend. By showing the audience Nick's compassion, it is implied that he will have other things on his mind which could get him killed. Mike appears to be the only character without a major flaw. He is independent, which can be seen in his interactions with his friends during the deer hunt. He appears to hold enough responsibility which foreshadows his success in Vietnam. Due to their traits one can assume that Steve and Nick will suffer from some sort of physical or emotional pain during the movie. Unfortunately, this foreshadowing proves to be true. Steve suffers from a crippling injury which leaves him restricted to a wheelchair. Nick suffers from a psychological injury which is a result of playing Russian roulette in a POW camp. It is clear that it troubles Mike to see his best friends suffer and the director does a good job of making the audience feel the same way. The long and tedious opening scenes initially appear redundant but it is not until the end of the film that the audience appreciates the strong development of the three characters that occurs during this time. If The Deer Hunter had not spent as much time on the character development, Nick's death would not have shocked me as much as it did.",The Deer Hunter

We Americans do not realize that just fighting in the war was the beginning of a long and stressful game of Russian Roulette. The revolver was counting down to that last bullet. We lost more money in that war than any war, that was also another factor in our loss. Another factor is that in Russian roulette your going to lose either way, and when Mike was playing with nick in the end of the movie, he realized that Nick had died for nothing because we had later lost the war. All around I thought that this movie was great because it revealed that any man can be broken by war in their way.",The Deer Hunter
817,evilleneuve18,Symbolism for the Russian Roulette Sequences,7,15 December 2013,"By including the Russian roulette sequences in the film among the prisoners, the director was trying to make a political statement about the war in Vietnam. If you went, there was a very good chance you could die. If you went and somehow survived, you would have psychological wounds (such as PTSD). If you did not go and stayed home, you would be jailed. If you ran away from home, to Canada for instance, you would have to leave your life and family behind. All of these scenarios are undesirable but you had to choose. The Vietnam War forced men to play Russian roulette with their own lives. The director included this to give the viewer a feel for how it might have felt for someone in the time period.",The Deer Hunter

Before they went, Nick gave a little speech expressing that none of their friend group would ever leave one another behind. The harsh nature of battle left Mike a little scrambled mentally as he showed when avoiding going straight home when he first got back so he clearly still had the tragedies of war on his mind. Another reason he went back was for a sense of closure seeing how the last time Mike saw Nick, he was indeed alive and then the money that was coming to Steve from Nick acted as the road flare to Nick's life. On top of the friend to friend obligation comes the more complicated affair including Nick's girlfriend Mike's desire for her.

Steve was a complete mess during the war and Mike had to take care of him because Steve was mentally and physically unsuitable for war. Nick seemed to be strong like mike in the beginning of the war, but everything changed when he was forced to play Russian Roulette.

The different personalities of the three men (Steve, Mike and Nick) before they go to Vietnam and how it serves them as soldiers. Did their different approaches towards life serve as an accurate prelude to what was to happen? Could it have happened differently?Before going to the Vietnam war, Nick has trouble taking care of himself independently. He mostly relies on his friend, Mike, to take care of him. Mike is very responsible, and loyal. Steve is a bit naive, and it shows when he marries a woman who is having another man's baby. The wedding scene also shows how naive Steve is when other people are dancing with his wife. During the war, the three men are forced to play Russian Roulette. Steve pulls the trigger, but chickens out just in time to have the bullet only skim his head. This shows that Steve has been sheltered, and living a naive life. He has never been exposed to such a dangerous game before. He is then put in an underwater cage as a prisoner. Mike is the one who comes up with a plan to escape. Mike and Nick are left to play Russian Roulette against each other. Mike keeps encouraging Nick to pull the trigger. Mike asks to play the game with three bullets instead of one. The Vietnam soldiers are intrigued by his bravery that they agree. Mike ends up using the gun to shoot the three Vietnam soldiers, and escape with Steve and Nick. Steve looses his legs in the process from an accident.I think that their different approaches towards life serves as an accurate prelude to the events to come during and after the war. Nick forgets his boots, and he forgets his identity after the war. He sort of becomes out of touch with reality, and irrational. Steve is very naive, and he can't handle playing Russian Roulette. He seems to have thought the war would be different. Mike is very reliable, and loyal. He seems to be the one who comes up with good ideas. He is the most rational of the three. Mike ends up going back to Vietnam to save Nick. He stays with him until Nick kills himself. Mike cares about his friends, and is very loyal in the beginning of the movie. His actions show that he encompasses these qualities through the entire film.I think the beginning of the film could have been better if it showed more of Steve's personality. His character was not as developed as Mike and Nick's. Mike and Nick are opposites in some ways, so it was easy to differentiate the two. Steve's character seemed more questionable because he was hard to figure out. His character becomes more developed when he is at war. His outlook on life is more prominent if you watch the movie a second time because you'll have seen his personality a bit more. Overall, I think the movie was pretty good. The beginning of the movie really shows the men's different approaches towards life do serve as an accurate prelude to what is to happen next for the most part. I'd say that all of the characters were well-developed at least by the end of the film. Their actions really reflect who they are and their personality traits.

Before the war, Michael seems very well- gathered and self reliant but after the war he is a bit more disoriented because of all that happened to him, yet he still remains pretty close to what he was like at the beginning. Stan was not self reliant and always needed the help of his friends, so things were hard for him during the war when he didn't have anyone to help him. Steve was weak to begin with which was shown when he married a girl who was pregnant with a child other than his own. Him losing his legs during the war did however seem to make him a bit more self-reliant, however he was a broken man.

This game is where you put one bullet in a random chamber of the handgun, spin it, and you then raise it to your head, and pull the trigger. You then take turns until there's only one man left standing. I believe the point of this game is to prove ""who is man enough"", and either way--if you didn't take part in the game, you were killed anyways. The director was probably trying to prove that whoever participated in the game was ""manly"" and not perceived as ""cowardly"".

824,matthewjamesphillips,"Artistic, and beautiful film.",10,26 April 2014,"I was thoroughly impressed with 'The Deer Hunter', having seen the film years ago as a young boy, I never appreciated the depth of the story, and the characters. The film starts by showing the bond of friendship between men who live and work in Clairton, a small working-class town in western Pennsylvania, in late 1967.The friends, of whom a few are to leave for Vietnam also go hunting together, and in these scenes we see the bonding and conflict between the friends. Part of the film focuses on Stevens wedding, Steven will later join Michael and Nicky in going to Vietnam. The film is brilliant, in that the action moves from the focus being on the sending off of the friends to Vietnam, moves very quickly to the dramatic (and brutal) part of the storyline, where the friendships are tested to the limit, when they are captured by the Vietcong. The emotion, and atmosphere in this scene is electric, and I can honestly say I have never experienced such a 'nerve jangling' moment, while watching a movie.The escape of the three friends and their separation while being rescued by US helicopter, to Michael losing Nicky in Vietnam is also made incredibly well, in these scenes, we arguably see the full affects of PTSD. Michael returns home to Clairton, and struggles to adapt to life having left Nicky behind, Steven, being paralyzed from the fall during the rescue, is a shell of the man he once was, and Nicky, believing Michael and Steven to be dead, falls into the dark world of 'Russian Roulette', something his Vietcong captors forced him to take part in when he was taken prisoner.The climax to the film is also excellent, Michael and Nicky are once again face to face, and Nicky by this stage is a completely changed man, corrupted by war, and the experiences he suffered while a Vietcong prisoner. Nicky and Michael play Russian Roulette, and Michael begs Nicky to come home, it is during this scene where it seems Nicky starts to remember his friendship, and remember Michael, all of which he had forgotten while becoming a key player in the Russian Roulette underworld. Nicky proceeds to shoot himself in the head with the revolver, to Michaels devastation. The ending is symbolic, in my opinion, of the toll of war on humanity, as Nicky is returned back to Clairton for burial, as he had requested of Michael before going to Vietnam. The ghostly and sorrowing ending, focusing on the funeral of Nicky is brilliantly captured by Cimino.This film is well worthy of cult status, the array of human emotions, the exploration of the affects of war on small communities, and the bond of friendship is shown in a respectful and beautiful way by Cimino, I'd strongly suggest this film to anyone.",The Deer Hunter

Watching the lives of people changed in a Pennsylvania Steel Town after the Vietnam War. Makes for an interesting movie. The problem with this movie is we see no back story on any of these characters on why they are who they are. We spend all this time on watching a wedding where nothing of significance to the rest of the movie really transpires. We see just a glimmer of the Vietnam War that these men were in and other than the small screen time of their Russian Roulette torture we don't understand the horrors these men must have endured. The characters don't develop and don't have dialog that allows them too. I think Meryl Streep was the only one who conveyed anything of her character in this movie. A lonely woman who is clinging to whatever she can to survive this post war country. I am a huge Robert Deniro fan but I am in the minority in finding this film a wasted opportunity for all involved.

They are both drunk and stumbling through the streets when Nick suddenly tells Mike not to leave him in Vietnam. This foreshadows the idea that Nick wont be leaving Vietnam. Throughout the first part of the movie, Mike is sort of the strong, responsible father figure to his group of friends, seen when he taught Stan a lesson in responsibility when he forgot his boots. It makes sense then that Nick trusts Mike to make sure he gets out of Vietnam, back to the home they both love.So when Mike returns home from Vietnam, after seeing Nick get lost in the Russian Roulette gambling scene in Saigon, he is welcomed home by Linda. They are both mourning the loss of Nick, and find comfort in each other. But when Mike finds Steve in the Veterans Hospital with lots of money in his sock drawer from Saigon, he knows Nick is still alive. He remembers the promise he made after the wedding, and realizes he broke the one pact he made with his best friend. So Mike goes back to Vietnam to try to get his friend out of there. The driving force behind Mikes attempted rescue mission is his promise to Nick. Nick from the start knew he might not be strong enough to make it back home without the help from his best friend. Mike also knew that Nick must have been changed by the war experiences they went through, when he didn't come back to the home he loved so much. Mike realized he let his best friend down when he left him in Saigon, and was willing to bring him back at all costs. Even when Nick didn't recognize him, Mike was still trying to keep his promise, and even risked his own life to try to fulfill it.",The Deer Hunter

I had never realized that Walken was so hot when he was younger. He still looks great and is still acting like a champ.

829,travsturable,Deer Hunter,8,28 November 2014,"1.) I believe the director was trying to make the Russian Roulette sequence a symbol of each of their lives and how it touches the sanity of those who play it. I liked how the director incorporated it into the movie. It shows just the difference the 3 friends became since that event. Ever since the Russian Roulette game in Vietnam, the three friends never looked at a gun the same way again. For example, when Stan had a loaded gun aimed at Axel for fun, Michael took it seriously and even played a roulette game on himself and Stan. It seemed as though he wanted to make himself clear that playing with a gun is not a game and can lead to serious consequences. Nick became psychologically disturbed after having been forced to cheat death with the game, and went on to cheat death multiple times afterwards. It seems as though he cracked and was no longer aware of what he was doing or anyone else around him. Life just became a game. 2.) I don't believe that their different approaches to life served as an accurate prelude as to what was going to happen. Anything could have happened in the War to anyone. It just so happens that Stevie ended up having both legs amputated while Nick ended up psychologically damaged. Michael was the only one to come out of this with the least amount of damage physically or mentally. I believe any of this could have happened to either one of the three. 3.) I believe that the French character represents the darkness. He basically leads Nick into more darkness. The scene where Michael sees Nick but Nick doesn't see him and goes off with the French guy is really emotional. Nick could have been saved by Michael at that exact moment, but instead goes off with the Devil himself as it was too late to stop them. I believe the French guy represents the evil that leads Nick to delve deeper into his out-of-state mind. 4.) Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick after he found hope that Nick might still be alive there. When Mike went to visit Stevie in the hospital, Steve notes that someone has been sending him money monthly from Saigon, at the time very dangerous. Mike concludes that it couldn't have been anyone else but Nick, and so he set forth to find him. Unfortunately, it ended in disaster as Russian roulette ended Nick's life in the hands of a grieving Mike.",The Deer Hunter

He had feelings for Nick's girlfriend but he couldn't do anything with her because he broke a promise to his dear friend Nick. I think it also had to do with Nick being his best friend and knowing he didn't try to find Nick when he was still in Vietnam haunted him. Another theory could be that Mike knew he could not stay in the states until Nick was found, so he went back home to see if Nick beat him home, and to see if Steven made it home. With the knowledge that Nick wasn't back home he could knew he had to go back but he also had to find hint and clues on Nicks where about. In the long run it was clear that Mike was going to bring Nick home, dead or alive.",The Deer Hunter
831,Haleybeann97,Review of the Deer Hunter,4,1 December 2014,"#1 What was the director trying to get at? He was trying to explain how bad Russian Roulette was, Also he was explaining how much it went it was played back in the old days during the war. Do you agree or disagree with his concept? I agree because it was really bad. It was a kind of patriotism because it was a common game that the Vietnamese play, for fun or for sacrifices of desperate lost and sad souls. Souls of people that are rich but want to die. #2. After they got out of the war their personalities changed, All of them. Mike used to be an honest, straight-forward friend, But after the war Mike loses his masculinity and becomes more sensitive throughout his experience in Vietnam. Nick is an easygoing, fun loving, introspective and somewhat quiet man who values friendship, community and love. But after the war he went to a Russian roulette game, and was there for a long time. He was there for so long he turned up to be brainwashed. Could it have happened differently? Possibly if they stayed together and all got on the helicopter. Instead of one getting on the helicopter and two not get on it. If they all got on Steve wouldn't of broke his legs. (they were amputated). #3. What's the deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon? He introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette so the men can get more money. And more people (Nicky) would continue the game. Plus Nick had a lot of money on him. What is this character suppose to symbolize? He was there to symbolize a man that forces people to do things they don't particularly want to. #4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick? He goes back to find Nick to make Linda happy. Mike was Nicks best friend. Linda was all emotional when Nick wasn't with Mike when he arrived back at the house. But when he gets to the Russian Roulette game place (where nick was) Mike found out that nick was brainwashed. That concerned Mike, so he joined the game. When Mike was trying to get through to Nick it wasn't working. He tried telling Nick about all the memories they had it didn't work. So Nick ends up shooting himself in his head.",The Deer Hunter
832,nichter11,Film Studies Review Assignment,7,1 December 2014,"Response to #3The French character who introduces Nick to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon symbolizes France persuading the US to go into Vietnam in 1955. France had been fighting in Vietnam for 7 years, and began to lose control in 1954. They wanted to the US to help them, so they persuaded them to come fight the war to stop the spread of communism. The French character in The Deer Hunter represents France in the Vietnam War because he shows Nick a place to play Russian Roulette. He shows Nick that it is possible to win a lot of money. This is emotionally scarring for Nick because he had been forced to play Russian Roulette in the Vietnamese war prisons. Nick plays in the den, and gets hooked. When Mike returns to Saigon to bring Nick home, Mike finds the French man again. This time, the French man says he does not know where Nick is, and says he wants no part. Mike pays the French man to bring him to Nick, and the French man shows him the Roulette Den. Once they get to the den, the French man returns Mike's money and says he wants no part in getting Nick back to America. This ordeal represents France at the end of the Vietnam War. When it was clear the US wasn't going to win the war, France pretended like they had never tried to bring America into the war. Mike attempting to bring Nick back to America represents the US trying to get out of the war without looking bad. The French character represents France before and after the Vietnam War, and shows their feelings toward the US and the War in general.",The Deer Hunter
833,gmangoulet,Film Studies Review Assignment,7,1 December 2014,"#3 The deal with the French character who introduces Nicky to the Russian Roulette den in Saigon is the directors way of showing Frances role in the Vietnam War. The story is based on the three Russian American friends who are steelworkers and go to Vietnam to fight on the behalf of the Americans in 1955. The movie then fast forwards to the three friends finding themselves in a POW camp and are being bet on to play Russian Roulette. When they are free from Vietnam they all don't keep in touch. It shows Nick walking on a street when a French guy comes up. He shows Nick the game of Russian Roulette which is hard for Nick to watch because he played Russian Roulette in the POW camp. The French character continues to talk to Nick about the game and the money that he could possibly win. At this point in the movie Nick is emotionally unstable because of the events that had happened in Vietnam. Mike had forced Nick to play the Russian Roulette game in Vietnam because if not they would have been tortured and killed so it was their only chance of survival. But here in Saigon they were playing for money. Later in the movie Mike goes back to find Nick and talks to the French guy. The French guy then says he doesn't know where Nick is and gives Mike his money back. This is showing how the French don't want to be part of the Vietnam War even though at the beginning of the war they were all for it an encouraging us. This is exactly how the French guy acts. The French guy ultimately ends up cooperating and shows Mike where Nick is, who is playing the Russian Roulette game. France's role in the Vietnam War was portrayed identically in the movie by the French character and his association with the Russian Roulette game.",The Deer Hunter

America became involved with the war at the request of France, and the French-speaking man in turn invites Nick to the Russian roulette game. When it became clear to them that the war was neither a noble effort or something that they were likely to win, France distanced themselves from it and disregarded their ties to America. Likewise, when Nick's friend comes searching for him, the French man at first claims to know nothing about the situation and pretends that he can't even speak English.",The Deer Hunter

However, the beginning of the movie was incredibly boring, slow and some what confusing. There are a lot of different relationships and history behind each character. Once they reach Vietnam, the pace changes and it becomes faster and more intense. But, the Vietnam sequences are only about 30 minutes. Most of the time is spent back at home with Mike and the turmoil there. That was interesting because it revealed more about the personality of Mike and even a little but with Nick. Personally, I wish that they spent more time at the end of the movie looking at Steven and how he changed with his experiences in Vietnam. However, they nailed Michael's character and Nick's transformation throughout the whole movie. I also thought that the movie was too long.",The Deer Hunter

After Saigon fell and the French realized that they couldn't win the war, they pulled out of Vietnam, pretended as if they had never entered Vietnam in the first place, and patronized America for committing atrocities there. This is why the first time the audience meets the Frenchman he is inviting and sly, but the second time we meet him- when Mike goes back for Nick- he pretends he can't speak English and says that he wants nothing to do with the Russian Roulette den.",The Deer Hunter

Be specific with this one and use examples.""",7,8 December 2014,"I believe Mike went back for Nick because he could not carry on with an unkept promise to his best friend. Before they went to Vietnam Nick made Mike promise that he would not come back without him. Mike made that promise thinking he could keep it, but sadly he could not. They were separated during the helicopter escape when Mike did the right thing to save a friend that had fallen, but in doing that he abandoned Nick. He saw him later in Saigon but reluctantly left him once again because he could not convince Nick to come back. When Mike is back in the US, the promise that he made to Nick eats at him. His relationships go to hell because Nick is the only thing on his mind. Being back home without Nick just feels wrong, he cannot even go to his coming home party because of the guilt. He cannot hunt without Nick, he spies a buck but doesn't pull the trigger. Eventually he realizes that he must return to Saigon. In his second time in Vietnam he risks his life to show Nick that he cares for him, and wants to bring him back to the safety of small town America, but by that time Nick is too far gone. He is addicted to the danger and thrill of Russian roulette, and eventually the game takes his life against his former best friend, Mike.",The Deer Hunter
838,delaneybilodeau,Prompt #3,9,8 December 2014,"The French character in Saigon is all about symbolism. Cimino was illustrating how many Americans felt (and still feel) the French have acted towards the US when it comes to war, especially Vietnam. Nam had its own internal issues, and the French decided to get involved (sort of). Once they were involved, they sought aide from the US, dragging us into the war. At first, they seemed grateful for the help, but as the war turned against us, they backed out, leaving the US to take the brunt of the damage (casualties, poor publicity, etc.). So in many Amercans' eyes, the French dragged us into a bad situation, and then proceeded to desert us once things turned ugly. In very much the same way, the French man in Saigon dragged Nicky (of the US) into a risky situation in the roulette rooms, before bailing when Mikey came calling after things had continued their downward spiral (especially for Nick). The Frenchman did to Nicky exactly what the French did to the US: He used his vulnerability( or perhaps generosity, it's really rather sad that those two would ever get mixed up) to lure him in for his own profit, then abandons him to fate after the going gets rough.",The Deer Hunter

Steve left into war with marrying a pregnant woman whose child wasn't his and was going into war a little messed up and he came out worse, being disabled from the war. Nick was a guy that was suspicious a lot it seemed mostly of his friend mike and it seemed to me that him going in like that the way he was and leaving how he did in a state of shock was maybe resembling him always being so protective looking out for his girlfriend but now he is in this state of shock where he feels like he owes something to Steve and is being protective of him by going to the roulette bar and eventually killing himself.

Or even how wartime brings out the very best and worst in us.Mike acts like an almost father figure and thus as a soldier attempts to keep everyone safe. This is a major reason for him jumping in after Steve to save him. Nick loves his girlfriend and Mike very much. So much in fact, that when Mike fails to bring him home it breaks him, driving him slightly mad. Also when Mike makes him play Russian Roulette it has a lasting affect so much so that when mike leaves him Nick plays Russian Roulette for money. Steve is the most fragile of the three and the Russian Roulette has a very negative affect on him.The French character symbolizes the fact that the French were a major reason for the US involvement in Vietnam. Mike goes back because Nick is like a younger brother to him and he realizes that he let him down by leaving him. He knows Nick was counting on him to uphold his promise to bring him home. Mike also realizes Nick is in real danger when he sees the money he had sent Steve. Mike knows exactly where Nick would get that much money so fast.",The Deer Hunter

What is this character suppose to symbolize?The relationship between the French character and Nicky is supposed to represent France and the United States during the war. Int he movie, the French character is trying to get Nicky to play Russian Roulette, speaking good English and being relatively friendly. This represents France trying to get the United States to help them in the Vietnam War. Like Nicky, the United STates wasn't sure, but they ended up helping in the end. Then, when the war started going poorly, the UNited STates asked France for help. France pretended like they didn't know what was going on and refused. They didn't want money, they didn't want anything. They just didn't want to be associated with the war anymore. This is represented when Mike goes to ask the French character for help on where to find Nicky, and the French character pretends like he doesn't even understand English.

Then, towards the end of the film, the French man tells Michael that he doesn't speak English, and then later, that he has no interest in money anymore. The French did very similar things toward the end of the Vietnam War.

843,emilybd12,#2,7,11 December 2014,"#2 Mike, Steve and Nick are all great friends before leaving for Vietnam. Mike is a strong character that shows his loyalty to his friends throughout the entire film. From making a promise to Steve after Steve's wedding to traveling back to Vietnam to find Nick, Mike's actions show that he really cared about his friends and was willing to do a lot to save them and help them both. Before Steve left for Vietnam he got married to his girlfriend that was pregnant, and he knew she wasn't pregnant with his child. I think Steve's situation and relationship made him more susceptible to becoming mentally ill. Maybe if his new wife had been pregnant with his child he may have felt stronger and would've tried to survive and fight his way through it all to make it home to his child, not another man's. Nick seemed to be a really carefree guy, easy going and was friends with most people he was around. I think his personality reflected his outlook on the world and life itself, and that all changed quite a bit when he realized just how messed up the war is and how it can effect his closest friends and himself.

844,mr-blonde-vic-vega,F***in' A!,10,16 July 2005,"DEER HUNTER (1978) A 3-hour epic about a group of buddies from Industrial Town, USA, and the Vietnam War, The Deer Hunter manages to capture camaraderie in every sense of the war. Following our central protagonist, Mike (Robert DeNiro), effectively the leader of the group, and his journey to, and journey through, the Vietnam War. The Deer Hunter manages to immediately connect to the audience, Mike and his friends (Nick, Stan, Axel, John, and Stevie) are you're buddies across the street... the ties you've had since you guys have been together in grade school, these guys are you're friends, the average Joe's, a group, the good-guys. These are closely knit-people who'd help each other through any mess... ""blood brothers"". The journey begins a day or so before Mike, Nick, and Stevie have to go to war, we can see that Mike and Nick (Christopher Walken) are best-buddies within the group. We see that Stevie (John Savage) commits to marriage very hastily, and so on this day before War, we see the major exposition: the wedding.The wedding is the center-point of the Russian Community in this small neighborhood, it is a ""hello"" to the union of two, and at the same time, a ""farewell"" to those heading off to war. It's a way for everyone to gather and celebrate, and it manages to show the relationships of characters. Stan (John Cazale) is the sleezy guy who gets a woman every night, Axel (Chuck Aspegren) is a big-friendly bear type, John (George Dzundza) is a man of celebration, Nick is the best friend of everyone, and Mike seems and feels out of place. He doesn't want or like large crowds, he doesn't want to be part of something bigger, he'd rather sit back and think, he's the lone-wolf. He places his eyes on Nick's Girl, Linda (Meryl Streep) but knows he cannot have her.The next day is the Deer Hunt, a moment where the group can be alone, have one last personal goodbye, as oppose to the community one with the wedding. The Deer Hunt seems to be a weekend ritual for the group, it's a pass-time they collectively enjoy, without distractions from others. They are truly together, camaraderie.Vietnam is another test of camaraderie but that venturing into dangerous territory. (Spoilerville) Cinematography was stellar especially in the Deer Hunt scenes, and at Welch's Bar, where the atmosphere was friendly, (Think Cheers), and the treacherous Vietnam, a place filled with warfare and sin.Sound was excellent, and especially invoked feeling in the viewer, watching the cast sing together (camaraderie) and watching the wedding singer sing to the crowd. Listening to the classical guitar during the intimate moments.Overall The Deer Hunter is an amazing film of the 70's, a dramatic movie that connects to it's audience through the friendship of characters, through love, through loss, through life. You will laugh and you will cry, you will experience all the up's and down's of these characters' lives.10/10 - WATCH IT!",The Deer Hunter
845,lauranguyen,An intense and powerful movie,9,21 February 2015,"A strong friendship facing the horrors of war. The carefree pace of life of Michael, Nick and Steven, 3 steelworkers in the little town of Clayton is disrupted by the hell of Vietnam War. A dramatic movie, showing the psychological effects of war, which prevent the three men from fitting back into society.Definitely a strong movie which does not need countless bloody scenes to catch public attention. The film actually focused on life before and after the military period ; if the first part of the movie may seem quite long or even boring, it is with the aim of intensifying this contrast. As the first movie which openly tackles Vietnam war, Cimino's film definitely ended the time of heroic portrayal of soldiers. Although 'The Deer Hunter' did not show PTSD as clearly as Rambo will do, the apparent-return-to-a-normal-life scenes somehow accentuates the uneasiness and make it more real.Let us not forget several incredibly powerful scenes which widely contributed to the success of 'The Deer Hunter'. The shots of the deer hunting scenes combined with a beautiful soundtrack are absolutely praiseworthy and the tension of the notorious Russian Roulette scene is definitely unbearable. Nevertheless, this representation of Vietcong as the absolute evil torturing enemies through cruel games like Russian roulette -which existence has besides never been testified- lacks of realism and reminds the public that Vietnam war is viewed from the American angle after all.Anyway, 'The Deer Hunter' is a memorable film, which goes further than battle scenes but straight in the public mind and heart.",The Deer Hunter

Another reason I think Mike went back to Vietnam is because, he liked Linda. Nick proposed to Linda during Steve's wedding and Mike isn't one to try to sleep with his best friend's fiancé. Therefore, he went back to Vietnam because Linda hadn't heard from Nick and I think Mike would only feel OK going after Linda if they knew that Nick was either dead or never coming home.

855,bookluvr-54894,Response to mcraven-4,8,18 May 2016,"*SPOILERS**This review is a response to a question asked by another reviewer and not a full review*At the most basic level, Mike returns to Vietnam to find Nick because of his promise not to leave his friend behind. Mike was driven by this promise throughout the three men's time in Vietnam--in order to ensure that Nick and Steve could return home alive, he smothered his fear during the games of Russian Roulette and crafted a plan that was dangerous at best and fatal at worst. Nick and Steve, having made no promises to each other or to themselves, cannot match Mike's strength of conviction or action, so they suffer from their trauma in different ways. Nick's fragile psychological state leads to his going AWOL and initially encountering the Frenchman who spirits him away, despite Mike's attempts to reach his friend. When Mike returns alone, he feels the weight of his failed responsibility to Nick as a result of both leaving Nick in Vietnam and contributing to Nick's mental instability. Mike's promise haunts him wherever he goes, reminding him of Nick when he meets with Linda, when he wrenches Stosh's gun away from him, and when he finds Steve and is faced with the other soldier's injuries, different from Nick's but no less painful. Each of these reminders, most particularly finding the money sent to Steve by an anonymous donor in Saigon, causes Mike to return to Vietnam, since his conscience will not allow him to abandon Nick to an unknown fate. Mike's quest to find Nick does not conclude with discovering Nick's location, however--Mike also feels obligated to return Nick to his mind and memories, and although Nick dies after retrieving a piece of his past, Mike carries his remains back to America, the land Nick felt such affection for despite his Russian ancestry, a stigma during the Cold War, as evidenced by his retort to the infirmary orderly that his name was American. Mike's promise is thus fulfilled, not in the way he might have hoped, but in a way that satisfies his memories of his best friend.",The Deer Hunter
856,hgcackowski,Symbolism of Russian Roulette,8,19 May 2016,"Film Studies Review Concept #1: The chance of the Russian Roulette game not only symbolizes the chance in becoming drafted for the military, but the eventual outcome of the game represents the negative outcome for those who are drafted. By using the game as a symbol the director portrays the reality of Vietnam for both the characters in the film, and anyone in the US military. Continuous participation in Russian Roulette eventually results in death. In comparison, those who are drafted for Vietnam eventually end up with extreme physical, emotional, or social damage. If someone was drafted and chose not to serve, they were sent to jail or fined and criticized for not serving their country. If they agreed to fight in Vietnam they could die, become severely injured, or emotionally scarred, and if they did make it home they were scrutinized for participating in a unjust war. Regardless of the choice made, the outcome is most definitely negative. I agree with this concept and believe that the director's use of the game as a symbol for the terrifying and uncertain negative effects of war is well thought out and wonderfully effective. By comparing this situation to Russian Roulette the director shows the American view of drafting for Vietnam, especially later in the war. Not being drafted is equal to the empty chamber; you are safe from harm but must watch as others around you face a detrimental situation, and being drafted is equal to the bullet-- certain death. This view has a great effect on American patriotism, and this can be seen in the film. The scene of the wedding early in the film with American flags decorating the room and the banner reading ""serving god and country proudly,"" shows the support that the men feel for their country and their willingness to help any cause. By the end of the film this seems to have changed. After experiencing the violence of the war, being forced to play Russian Roulette in the prison (perhaps representing their forced participation in the war), returning to a country where they are unwelcome, and losing a best friend it is perceived that they don't know what to feel. In the final scene as the characters sing ""God Bless America"" at the wake they seem to still love their country in a certain way, maybe thankful for what is good about it and that they aren't living somewhere like Vietnam, but they are also sad and possibly disappointed at what a supposedly great country is doing to not only people from other countries but its very own loyal citizens. America's involvement in the Vietnam war left many devoted patriots at this time saddened and confused.",The Deer Hunter

Be specific with this one and use examples:,5,21 May 2016,"Mike's reasons for going back to Vietnam to get Nick goes beyond them just being friends; the primary reason was that he promised Nick he would bring him home. Mike could not face himself with the guilt of going back on his promise. When he goes home without Nick he can barely face Linda, Nick's fiancé, knowing that Nick is somewhere back in Vietnam. Mike decided to go back to Vietnam to find and bring back Nick, but when Mike found him, he didn't recognize Mike and he was about to sit down at the Russian Roulette table. Mike sat down in the seat across from him, trying to stop him but when he realized it was useless to reason with him, he played Russian Roulette with him.

By making a promise to Nick to never leave him behind, Mike feels obligated to keep his word when he learns that Nick does not return with Steve. Mike is a very serious person after the war, which helps influence him to honor the promises he made. Mike, however, is not only driven by his conscience. He feels a high level of guilt and remorse knowing that Nick has not returned. He struggles to connect with Steve and Linda, and to find some normalcy in his life. He hopes that bringing Nick back, or finding what has become of him, will give him the peace of mind he had been missing since he experienced war.

859,nicolecor-63604,Excellent Use of Russian Roulette,8,6 June 2016,"#1. Scenes from ""The Deer Hunter"" show a repetitive use of the game Russian roulette. This occurs while the men are held hostage in the Vietnamese POW camp, while the friends are deer hunting back in the US, and again in Vietnam as a means of entertainment and way to gamble money. Surely this recurrence is for a purpose.Without a doubt, director Michael Cimino uses it to increase the tension in the movie by pushing men to their wits end and testing the boundaries of their mental strength. For example, viewers become restless with anticipation when the soldiers hold the gun up to their head with one bullet in the chamber at random. For every time the gun 'clicks' without a bullet in the chamber, the odds increase that the next shot will result in the bullet through the skull.Though it seems that Russian roulette was never actually played during the Vietnam War, I believe the director used it as a tactic for fear and distress amongst the soldiers. In my opinion, it symbolizes the gamble that they took by enrolling (or being forcibly drafted) into the war. Though without a doubt, they could die in service, but truly any possible outcome was a bad one; even if they survived, the soldiers would continue to be haunted by injuries, PTSD, or other negative effects of the war.*Spoiler* The scene at the end when Michael (De Niro) returns to Vietnam to rescue Nick (Walken) is especially emotional as Nick has been stripped of his humanity by participating in these games of roulette for profit. Once they meet, Michael tries in futility to jog Nick's memory of their friendship, their time spent in the POW camp, and all they've been through. However, Nick's dead eyes show no recollection of these memories. Instead, Michael knows the last chance he has to rescue Nick requires him to put his own life at risk by playing roulette.In my opinion, Nick's glazed-over eyes symbolize the average Vietnam soldier--lifeless and emotionless after witnessing the senseless brutality of the war. The use of Russian roulette within ""The Deer Hunter"" serves to represent the Vietnam War as a whole, complete with the gamble and inevitable resulting violence and destruction.",The Deer Hunter
860,khubb-95041,Film Studies Response,7,3 June 2016,"The Deer Hunter at first is a bit static but progresses and develops throughout the film into an exciting and emotional experience. The movie portrays the negative affects the Vietnam war had on the vets. It also shows how important comradery is in war. Mike feels as if he did not keep his promise to Nicky that he made in the beginning of the movie, so he goes all the way back to Nam to rescue him. Unfortunately, for Mike, he could not keep his promise to Nicky as it was too late and Nicky commits suicide right in front of Mike's own eyes. The movie has a very psychological part to it, as it shows moments of PTSD and some of survivor guilt with the situation with Mike and Nicky.",The Deer Hunter
861,Tengu9000,Diddy Mao!,10,2 December 2005,"Question: Why did Michael go back to get Nick? Hey Mr. C.When Michael returned from Vietnam, he was still incomplete. He hesitated to go back to his friends without Nick, because he felt bad for returning without him. He knew he would be faced with many questions and congratulations, and Nick would not. This made him feel guilty of something, and lonely. He had survived a horrible experience with his friends, and when he returns home, they do not come with him. Naturally, he would want somebody to relate to, and he has no one. The only people that understand him are either dead, or far away. When he is with Linda, he even feels disconnected because she loved Nick before they had left, and now he feels like a mere replacement. He knows that without at least talking to Nick again he'll never have the same life he once did. He doesn't want to let go of his friendship even though his hope is nearly lost until he meets with Steven. Michael feels obligated to find Nick and return him to his home. It's obvious from a viewer's point of view, things will never be the same between the friends, but Michael has nothing left to do, so he attempts to rescue Nick anyway. It is ALL he can do. When Michael finds Nick and tries to convince him to return, he truly realizes his friend his dead. Unlike Steven who was happy to see Michael, Nick is stoic and hardly even acknowledges him. Though Michael still has hope now that he is right there looking at Nick, he still knows in the back of his mind that his friend will never be the same. But still he tries to remind him of their friendship. Nick finally says , ""One shot."" Michael's hope is at its peak then, as he is almost joyous to see that even a little piece of Nick's personality remains. But he also knows Nick could be going along with it humorously as he has been taking drugs and it seems by the look on his face there is nothing going on inside his head. Although Michael is ruined to see Nick kill himself, I think he is relieved he at least knows now what happened to his friend, and can put the search to rest. I think Michael would have been worse off to not find Nick, and continue with his life full of guilt and hesitation. Although Michael does have a life to return to back home, I believe he wants to lose at the table to Nick. He feels he will be better off dead, rather than living with the fact that his friend has died a ruined and forgotten soul. I think that Michael would want to die in front of Nick so he could see the death of his friend. It may be the only chance of getting Nick to ""wake up"". I know for myself, I would not want to walk away from that table alone. There is nothing more sad than seeing a friend die in front of you when that person is the only one left to relate to. I wouldn't WANT to die, but I certainly wouldn't want to walk away alone and burdened with the thought of losing my friends.I thought this scene was done very well, as it really puts the viewer in the movie. I thought the saddest part was that both Nick AND Michael had died in a small, dark room in Hell. It was truly the place where they had changed, and it's also the place where they die. The lack of ""recognition"" I feel toward Nick and Michael's experiences makes this movie. In reality, there are millions of people watching the film and seeing this happening and feeling for the characters. But when I am pulled into the movie, and have no knowledge of others watching, I feel a strong sense of reality. I get the feeling that I am right there with Michael and Nick and the biggest loss is that nobody else will know or understand what has happened. I try to think if the story were real and well-known then it might not be as sad. I truly think the most depressing aspect is the fact that nobody back home will know. I don't think Michael would express his full feelings but rather suppress them and let them destroy his character. And again, the saddest part is that nobody will ever know.If I had to handwrite this, I would have never rambled so much...¼¼¼¼¼¼¼",The Deer Hunter
862,jmatos-65456,No Vietnam movie compares,9,28 November 2016,"I just watched this film for the first time in probably 2 decades I think. I remember watching it as a young teen in the early 80's. Today, as I think of the fact that it was made within 3-4 years after the fall of Saigon I have a deeper,enhanced appreciation for it. Considering the onslaught of Vietnam movies that came out afterwards...not a single one can be held in comparison. It is a classic in its own right. To me it is simply a brush stroke of what millions of Americans experienced and were experiencing at the time of the movie...an impartial snapshot of America during its Vietnam tribulation. I tried to find the ""hidden"" undercurrent of pro- or anti-war bias but it just wasn't there. Sure, the depictions are all extreme or stereotypical (drinking, abuse, war atrocities, PTSD, etc) but they are all also very real. What I see, what I feel, what I surmise from this movie is simply this: Here we were, there we went, some came home, others not. Life for us, our friends, our family has changed and now we must adjust. I also believe it was sort of a message in a bottle, if you will, except this message was saying to American families: ""You're not alone!""",The Deer Hunter
863,giannawilson-11385,Mike Going Back For Nick,9,13 December 2016,"This film places a great emphasis on the idea of family being not just those blood-related, but those that never leave your side and are always there for you. This is perfectly demonstrated by Mike's return to Vietnam to find and bring home one of his best friends, Nick. Mike is built as a character that all others depend on and go to for help and advice. He returns to Vietnam because he recognizes the faith that his friends have in him and knows he cannot let down Nick. The night before the group of friends had to leave for Vietnam, Nick asked Mike to make him a simple promise: he asked Mike to bring him home from Vietnam. Nick stated that it did not matter in what condition Mike brought him home in, as long as he was brought home and not left in Vietnam to die or decay. This was Nick's only request for his best friend before entering the war and being separated from him. As a result, when Mike returned home he did not feel complete. He knew that Nick was still somewhere in Vietnam and was most likely in danger. He needed to keep his promise and bring Nick home to safety, preferably while he might still be alive. Mike knew that if he did not at least try to find Nick and return to the United States with him, he would never forgive himself for letting down one of his closest companions. With Mike's ceaseless attempts to help everyone. he knows that he can't stop with Nick. He returns to find Nick playing Russian Roulette for money and realizes that Nick's trust and love for him has already disappeared; it disappeared the day Mike went home and Nick stayed in Vietnam.",The Deer Hunter

Nick is confused on who he is and what his life will actually be. Initially in the film, nick enjoys life, but as time passes he changes. The scene later in the film where Nick and Mike forcibly play a game of Russian roulette is what mostly affects Nick psychologically, taking away his happiness. This traumatizing experience makes the case of Nick being a confused person that much more intense. I feel that Mike knows how he has changes and thinks seeing him might make him come home. But Nick is to far gone in his own darkness and can't be saved.",The Deer Hunter
865,bdrakedeese-50736,Direct Look At PTSD,10,12 December 2016,I found this top be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I think that it really brings more attention to PTSD among veterans and the serious issues it can cause. When Mike first comes home it is just interesting to see him struggle with wanting to go outside or see his or even just sleep. When he is in the hotel just trying to find a way to make himself comfortable or at the very least calm down. Steve also has been effected greatly due to the loss of his legs. I think in a way that symbolizes that they will have to deal with what they are feeling for the rest of their lives because literal parts of him will never come back. I also think that after Nike dies Mike is a little more relieved. I think that because that was the thing that he had left over there and the fact that he had broken his promise. I think that this movie was very well done and gives an intense look into the inside of a PTSD ridden mind.,The Deer Hunter
866,izzygc,"Lifelong friends Mike, Steve, and Nick are enlisted in the Vietnam War and pay the ultimate price.",5,12 December 2016,"By definition Russian Roulette is the practice of of loading a bullet into one chamber of a revolver, spinning the cylinder, and then pulling the trigger while pointing the gun at one's head. Directly proceeding the definition is a disclaimer that it is an activity that is potentially very dangerous. In the film The Deer Hunter, Russian Roulette is played on several occasion and is symbolic of the Vietnam War itself. The Vietnam War was horrific and detrimental for all involved. The nature of the war is revealed in The Deer Hunter because of how it impacts each of the character. No matter what, if one went to fight in the Vietnam War they were going to be impacted in an extremely deep way. This is just like Russian Roulette. No matter what, the game will not end until someone has blown their brains out with a bullet. The film maker uses the symbolism of Russian Roulette to comment on the nature of the Vietnam War. He was saying that there is no way to win the game as there is no way to win the war. One will either leave Vietnam will deep emotional, physical, and psychological scars or will not leave at all as they are dead. In The Deer Hunter, Steve leaves without his legs, Mike leaves with permanent emotional scars, and Nick comes home in a coffin.In regard to patriotism, it has historically been considered a noble and patriotic act to go overseas and serve one's country. However, in the case of the Vietnam War, veterans coming home, such as Mike and Steve, had the realization that they were not actually fighting for anything of substance. These two men, along with other Vietnam veterans, began to question if their patriotism and loyalty to their country really meant anything at all. Mike and Steve lose their best friend, their peace of mind and all they can do is wonder what for ?The characters of The Deer Hunter rolled the dice and played the game of Russian Roulette. As expected, the game won and the men lost everything.",The Deer Hunter
867,breanafinnell,Film Studies Response,9,13 December 2016,"4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick? I think that there are many reasons as to why Mike went back. For one, Nick was one of his best friends. Anyone would want to save the life of someone close to them. Another reason is because Mike made a promise to Nick that all of them would come back together, whether they were dead or alive. Mike felt responsible for keeping his promise, and wouldn't be able to live with himself if he didn't even try and thinks he could have done something to save Nick. As Mike was like the big brother of the group of men, that added to the responsibility factor that he felt. As though it was his duty and he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't go back. Even though Mike was unable to save Nick's life, the fact that he traveled back to Vietnam at all, let alone put himself in another game of Russian Roulette to try and save his life, showed just how much he cared for him. Nick acted as though he didn't know who Mike even was when he saw him again. He was so far gone and there was nothing Mike could have done to bring him home alive. Nick knew what he wanted, and it wasn't to come back to America where his life would never be normal like it was before the war. But what it comes down to I think is the fact that Mike cared deeply for Nick and just really wanted him to come back and get better.",The Deer Hunter
868,RubyDupuis,film studies promt #1,10,13 December 2016,"The symbolism of playing Russian Roulette is representing the horrors of war in its random, senseless brutality. All it takes is ""one shot"" to kill someone, or yourself. Being drafted into the war forces men into dangerous situations where they could be possibly killed. Its not a definite outcome, but a possibility, just like there is a possibility of the bullet being in the chamber when pulling a trigger. I think the director was trying to symbolize how the war can break people, and in particular, Vietnam left man shell shocked, and to the point where pulling that trigger might not be that hard anymore. I am not the kind of person who completely disagrees with war, I don't really have a view at all on it. However I do agree with the message that the director was trying to convey with its message about being drafted, or forced into a war that is not necessarily yours to fight.",The Deer Hunter
869,makeuswhole,For Film Studies,10,13 December 2016,"The symbolism of Russian roulette within the film is that the Vietnam war itself was a huge game of Russian roulette. Going to the war was like putting a semi-loaded revolver to your temple- maybe you'll pull the trigger and be fine. But maybe you'll come out dead, wounded, or severely mentally scarred.The three men's personalities define their wartime actions. Mike was the strong, trusted leader back in Pennsylvania. As such, in Vietnam it was his responsibility to keep the other soldiers such as Nick and Steve safe. Nicks personality was mysterious, and he didn't seem to care too much about anything. This comes back in Vietnam when he decides to go completely AWOL in Saigon. Steve is, from the start, a weak and dependent figure. The movie drives this across with things such as his mother ordering him around and his wife being pregnant with someone else's child. In Vietnam, he is the one who needs Nick and Steve to literally hold him up and help him along. It could have only gone differently with Nick, who's character is much more mysterious than the other two.The French character represents how Americans viewed the French in light of the war. After encouraging America to join the fight, they left it alone completely. In the same theme, the Frenchman coerces Nicky into the gambling Russian roulette ring but later when Mike comes he takes no responsibility and is no longer with him.Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick for three major reasons. One, Nick is his best friend. Two, Mike can't be around Meryl Streep without being reminded of Nick. The third most prominent reason is that in the beginning of the film, Nick makes Mike promise to bring all three of them back to Pennsylvania, even if it's in a casket.",The Deer Hunter

This Was the alienating factor for the veterans with no one understanding why they did the things they did and people only hated them for it.

The first time it happens, the intensity is set to 11, and along with the audience's job of feeling just how intense the war is in this scene, the audience is forced to infer something else.The prisoners and the three main characters playing Russian Roulette is supposed to be a metaphor for how the war (like the ""game"") is a lose- lose situation.

If you get the 5/6 chance of no bullet, the fact that you could have killed yourself leaves psychological trauma. The director is trying to show that no one can escape the war in Vietnam unscathed.

Since I was also under the recently corrected, 20 year misapprehension that ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" was also vastly overrated, I decided I owed it to myself to give it another chance. This time I found it overlong and overwhelming.It is an extremely powerful piece and fully deserving of the esteem in which it's held, although I still feel a bit of trimming would have made it even better. That's not like me as I'm usually of the opinion that (in film) you cannot have too much of a good thing. Also I found the pacing a little odd: The wedding is covered in real time (ok, slight exaggeration) then blink and they're in 'Nam and blink again and they're in the cage. No doubt this was deliberate but I didn't think it worked that well.Of course, what made it were the performances.

One could say that the United States government was the French man offering the men to win some money. This is also very telling to how far the government was willing to go to fight communism during the cold war era.

However, Mike did not have anyone, or really anything to return to. The one relationship that was truly mutual and meant something to him was following him to Vietnam, his friendship with Nick. This is why Mike was able to deal with war and being face to face with death so well. He is able to be a complete individual and put all other situations from home and other places aside, look at the situation, and realize ""this is it"". He was so used to being an individual and almost cold that it was much easier for him to focus and think clearly in Vietnam. Nick and Steve both fell apart and were only held together at all by Mikes support. At home Nick seemed to be a follower of Mike, almost weak. When in Vietnam, the adrenaline of Russian Roulette pulled him in and he was not strong enough to overcome the pull that it presented him with. Steve showed a different sort of weakness, he seemed passive and naive. He married a woman who was having a baby even though he knew it was not his. This showed a mental weakness and is consistent with the state that he was in when in Vietnam and upon he return home. I don't believe that this could have turned out differently. Each situation that the men ended up in were accurate to their personalities. Though the directors were at first going to have Mike stay in Vietnam, it fits Nick's character much more and it would not have been consistent with Mikes strength in character.",The Deer Hunter

The biggest reason is that before they left for the war, Mike had promised that he wouldn't leave his friends in Vietnam. When Mike came home and the other two guys weren't with him he felt guilty. He knew where Nick was because he had seen him there before. Nick had changed so much that it was hard for Mike to deal with it. Also, Mike had always felt that you do it right the first time and in order. Going to war may have changed how he felt about that, and not bringing his friends back did as well. He felt like a bad friend and a failure for not doing what he said he would.",The Deer Hunter

The first of which is that he promised Nick that he would not leave him, dead or alive, in Vietnam. NIck is Mikes best friend; he is the only one that he likes to go hunting with. its just not the same with any of the other guys. Mike could just not leave his best friend in Vietnam. He also went back because he realized that Nick was in trouble. When visiting Steve in the veteran's home, Steve showed him a drawer full of money which is being sent to him from Veitnam. At that moment, Mike knows that the POW camp and the Russian Roulett has had sever effects on Nick and that he is trapped in the fatal game. Mike would not be able to handle the loss of his best friend and he would not be able to handle what it would do to Linda if Nick died. Linda is working hard to cope with the changes in Mike and is wait hopefully for Nick's return. Mikes return to Vietnam also brings closure to himself. Since his return, Nick has been at the back of his mind, along with everything they went through in the POW camp. By bring Nick home, Mike can finally leave Vietnam behind.",The Deer Hunter

887,stef_er_loo,Stefanie's film studies,6,21 December 2005,"Steve, Nick and Mike all had very different varying personalities, that most would think to clash, but actually their unique personalities helped pull and keep them together. Mike was the leader, he was strong and forceful with a bad temper, but he knew how to keep his cool which helps out in sticky situations. Mike is the foundation of the group, everyone depends on him for advice, help and boots. Nicky was the easygoing, reasonable friend who seemed to get along with anyone. I think Nicky tried to be strong like Mike, but he just wasn't as emotionally stable. Steve was sort of the baby of the group, everyone took care of him and made sure he was okay. Mike was clearly made for the army, he was not only brawny, but he had a hard mind set, he knew what he needed to do and how to do it. For example when he, Nicky and Steve are trapped in the POW camp, he plans, on the go, to escape with his fellow comrades. Nicky and Steve could not deal with war, it was more psychological and emotional than physical for them. Steve's needy personality caused him to not be able to go on without support of the others. Steve ends up losing his legs and being transplanted in a veteran's hospital. Nicky's personality allows him to live on his own, just not in a physical safe way. He was very malleable, he could become what other people wanted. By the end of the film, he is a mindless zombie, only living, because he could not die. All three of their personalities foreshadowed how they would act in the war, but I was surprised that Nicky died. I thought that it would have been Steve who died, because he seemed to have a weaker mind set. This could have happened differently, I don't think Mike would have died, because he couldn't. He was too much of a leader and it would have ruined the film if he had died. Nicky was my favourite character so when he died, it made me sad. I think that Steve should have died, not because he wasn't a likable character, but because he was so much weaker than everyone else in the film. Overall, I liked the ending and series of events, because it still portrays Steve depending on others and Mike being the leader, it was continuous in following their personalities.",The Deer Hunter
888,calibombshell,connection of the Russian roulette scenes,7,11 December 2005,"Overall, I enjoyed the film. I thought it was well done, but was a bit slow in the beginning during the wedding scenes. The scenes of Russian roulette were very intense and seemed to connect to the big picture of the film and the idea of our involvement in the Vietnam war. In the game of Russian Roulete, it is really a no win situation. If you keep playing the game for long enough, you will eventually die. The scenes of Russian Roulete in the film seemed to say that our involvement in the Vietnam war is much like this game in the way that it is a no win situation. If you were an American sent to Vietnam during the war, you either had to go there and likely be killed or at least psychologically damaged, or go to jail. Even if you came back to America, you would be called a baby killer and looked down upon. I also thought it was very interesting that during some of those scenes a real bullet was placed in the guns to heighten the tension of the actors.",The Deer Hunter
889,midibabe_13,Deer Hunter,8,12 December 2005,"2) The three main male characters have extremely different personalities and outlooks on life. This helps Michael but I believe hurts Steve and Nicke in the war. Mike is very uptight, by the book, type-A personality. He likes things done perfectly and quickly so he can move on to the next job. I really liked his character. He was my favorite. He was a very strong character with a lot of heart. Nicke was a good character as well but not as strong as Mike. He sort of leaned on Mike for support and when he didn't have him he crumbled. I could have guessed that was going to happen because he was the middle guy. He wasn't the weak one like Steve, so they didn't make sure he was taken care of, but he wasn't strong enough to survive by himself. In the war, he survived only because Michael guided him. Steve was a very sweet but weak character and it should with his performance in Vietnam. He only survived by the help and sacrifice of Mike and Nicke. This movie was really well done and I enjoyed it a lot.",The Deer Hunter

Stevie had been receiving hundreds of dollars sent to him in socks in the U.S. and was storing them at the hospital. Once he showed Mikey, Mikey immediately realized they were being sent from Nickey because he had seen Nickey right before he returned to America playing Russian Roulette for money. Mikey had been feeling awful for leaving Nickey there in Vietnam in the first place because he promised him that he wouldn't, and after being home for a while without him he was realizing how different everything was having a core member of the friends missing. It was hard for Mikey to be happy with such guilt lying on his shoulders and especially because he could see pain in Lynda's eyes from missing Nickey. Once he found out that Nickey was still alive, it created glimpse of hope for things to return to normal and was an opportunity that he couldn't surpass. He hadn't gone back earlier because chances were high that Nickey would be dead, but he wanted to.

891,rockymonet-56177,How A Foreign Game Killed Us All,10,13 December 2017,"#2 The three main characters in ""The Deer Hunter"" have very different personalities which leads to different effects of their time in the war. Mike is a very linear, organized character which serves him well while he is in Vietnam. He manages to stay alive, unharmed physically, and protect the other characters to the best of his ability. When he returns from the war he is changed mentally. Mike had failed to bring Nick back with him as he had promised not to do. Between this broken promise, and the horrors he had to endure himself, Mike goes through minor mental changes when he returns. He holds a gun loaded with one bullet to his friend's head after he had been messing around with the loaded gun. Mike seems to have a minor case of PTSD involving guns. This is also seen when he purposefully misses shooting a deer. Nick was an emotional character from the beginning of the film. This trait served him well at home, but not in the war. Nick lost it when he was forced to play Russian Roulette for his life while he was a prisoner of war. This event had a severe impact on his life because it was his best friend, Mike, who forced him to do it so they could survive. Because he was such an emotional character, Nick was affected by the cruel game more than the others. Nick, unfortunately, did not make it home from the war. He spent his last few months at a Russian Roulette den in Saigon. He experimented with drugs and played the game because he was so far gone. in the end, it was the game that killed him. Steve was the third friend who went to Vietnam. Steve was a childish character before the war. He wasn't extremely mature or even aware of the world around him. This effected him terribly in the war. While playing Russian Roulette, Steve was crying and freaking out because it was so horrific to him. He was corrupted by the war and was forced to see and experience things he wasn't ready to experience. Steve was physically effected as well as mentally. He lost his legs and part of his arm during the war. All of these things that happened to the men because of the war could have been predicted to an extent. Mike is strong emotionally and physically, so he wouldn't be as effected by the war as most. Nick was emotional and therefore would be effected mentally. And Steve was the childish friend, so he would come out of the war different in some way. I don't think it could have happened another way. I wish Nick didn't have to die, but that was critical to the plot and outcome of the war on the men.",The Deer Hunter

When Mike comes back to town he avoids a party at his house and then goes in on his own when only Linda is in there. Linda then reminds him that he hadn't brought Nick back with him and that they think he is AWOL. After being back in town for a couple of days he realized life was too different without Nick, for example he didn't feel right working without him or living in their house with Nick's girl. The last straw is pulled when Mike and the other guys go on a hunting trip and Mike just can't pull the trigger on a deer who had accepted defeat. Mike misses on purpose and realizes that he needs to fulfill his promise because that is the type of guy he is, point A to point B. So, when Mike gets back from the trip he plans to fulfill his promise and try to bring Nick back home, but little does he know Nick has gotten himself in a very dangerous business.",The Deer Hunter
893,legocyd,Broken People,8,14 December 2017,"As a whole, The Deer Hunter feels less like a war focused film; instead, Vietnam and the war serves as a backdrop and an influence on the three main characters at least. This is important to note up front, because this makes The Deer Hunter an interesting study of the main characters before, during, and after the war.The beginning of the movie is long and slow, but it works to show the details of Mike, Nick, and Stevie. We get a good idea from his wedding and the circumstances of his bride, Angela's, pregnancy that he is a naive, but faithful and well meaning young man, who sees a big future ahead of them. Nick shows himself as an optimistic romantic, looking to work in the best of his friends' actions in the hunting trip and at the same time, play by Mike's rules. He also spends much time showing how much he cares for Linda, and openly comments about how he loves the small steel town he lives and works in. Mike, on the other hand, is much less of a romantic, and despite his naked run after the wedding, is shown to have a set of rules he lives by, and this includes his dedication to his friends, and the promise he makes to Nick to bring him home.Being in Vietnam changes things, especially the russian roulette scenes. Stevie, with his emotional naive nature, handles it poorly and winds up in a cage full of water and rats because he misses his head with the bullet. Mike, with his strict rules and self compass, fares better because he is the one who can steel himself against death, and ultimately is mostly responsible for their escape. He tries with Nick, but... Nick can't handle it. Having to play russian roulette against Mike while being encouraged by Mike to do it for their escape breaks him, and this impacts his portrayal from then on.By the end, Stevie is paralyzed and missing both legs, Mike is living with psychological trauma from both his experiences in war, and also the results of his attempt to rescue Nick, who was playing russian roulette professionally in Vietnam. Being forced to do it by Mike has left him in a broken state, and when Mike comes to rescue him, he blows his brains out in a russian roulette match in a disturbingly tragic way. ""One shot"" indeed. The line shows just how far he had fallen from before, and how much spite he had for Mike inside for the entire experience. Despite Mike's best efforts, he couldn't bring Nick back, even if he technically kept the promise and brought him home. That ending sort of broke my heart too, and I think it was a great way to hammer home the emotional message of the movie. Good movie overall. Would recommend.",The Deer Hunter
894,madelainephaneuf,DeNiro and Walken: The Dynamic Duo Needed for The Deer Hunter,9,14 December 2017,"""The Deer Hunter"" tells the story of three friends, Mike, Nick, and Steven, as they endure the Vietnam War and its aftermath. However, while the ending of the film is climactic in all aspects, I found the plot to be rather slow-paced otherwise. The most noteworthy portions of the piece are Robert DeNiro's portrayal as Staff Sergeant Mike Vronsky and Christopher Walken's Academy Award winning performance as Corporal Nick Chevotarevich. I believe DeNiro and Walken accurately highlight the difficulties faced both during and following combat by the American soldier. The Russian Roulette scene especially moves its viewers and, in my opinion, is the best scene in the film. By showcasing the camaraderie of servicemen through Mike's ultimate promise of ensuring Nick returns home in addition to featuring the lack of support for soldiers who face mental health issues as seen through Nick's declining stability, audiences understand more of the 20th century America's flawed view on warfare: fight, win, and return to normal.  Though the film is saved by its two leads' impeccable acting, I will say I preferred ""When We Were Soldiers"" (2002) as a means to better understand the Vietnam War. ""The Deer Hunter"" more beautifully displays war's impact on its soldiers but if needing to gain a full grasp of the war itself, ""When We Were Soldiers"" is a must-see. We watched the film in my AP United States History class last year, and it was undoubtedly among the better ones we watched. Mel Gibson perfectly portrays the classic American hero, Lieutenant General Hal Moore, and audiences gain insight on what American soldiers' wives face on base throughout the entirety of warfare through Madeleine Stowe's performance as his wife, Julia Moore. I love both films, but I would base my recommendation as to which is better on for the viewing's purpose.",The Deer Hunter

When Mike first returns home, he is unable to face his friends without Nick with him. Eventually he meets up with them. But when he goes to visit Steve, and sees him unable to take care of himself, he feels even worse. Steve then shows him the money that Nick has been sending and he knows that he is still alive. He takes the money and goes to Siagon to bring Nick home, to fulfill his promise and save his friend. Unfortunately, Nick has been brainwashed and barely recognizes Mike.

896,maggiemcgauley,The Deer Hunter,9,13 December 2005,"Even though there are no documented cases or reports of the deadly Russian Roulette game in the Vietnam War, director Michael Cimino included it in The Deer Hunter to symbolize the deliberate, random violence prevalent in war. Russian Roulette had the power to make anyone go crazy, and it was shown firsthand with a once normal man named Nicky. It affected the sanity of all the men forced to play Russian Roulette. Besides the psychological damage Russian Roulette gives the player, its rules symbolize the American patriotism in the Vietnam War. War, Russian Roulette, and even patriotism is arbitrary. Each time Nicky pressed the trigger he had a chance of either dying or psychological damage- neither one being a good option. This game reflects the American response to patriotism and soldiers involved in Vietnam, they were either mocked for not fighting for their country or labeled as ""baby killers"" after fighting overseas.

899,yankeemovielover,Please give Ali an A,7,21 December 2005,"Steve, Mike and Nick all have very different personality types. Steve was shy, timid, and sensitive. He married Angela, even though she was pregnant with somebody else's child, he can see things from other people's point of view. Mike was forceful, responsible, and a driving force. People depend on Mike, his friend didn't bring boots because he knew that Mike always had an extra pair. He has rules about how to do things, that he can only take one shot at a deer. Nick was friendly and likable, but not quite as emotionally stable. Steve's sensitivity led to his downfall, he couldn't handle what he saw, he was nervous , he couldn't get a hold of himself when they had to play Russian roulette in the POW camp and he couldn't hold onto things when they were swimming. He ended up losing his legs, but one gets the feeling that no matter what something bad would have happened to him because he wasn't as strong as the other people were. Mike's personality allowed him to cope very well. When he and Nick were forced to play each other in Russian roulette, he was able to keep the presence of mind to realize that their best chance at escaping was to put more bullets in the gun, so that if they survived a couple of rounds, they could then use the gun on their captors. He also was able to stay calm and bring Steve to safety. He was able to deal with the terrible things that he saw and he remained mentally stable even after the war. Nick did well initially, he was able to play Russian roulette with Mike, but eventually the war got to him. He couldn't cope with it any longer, so he went AWOL and he ended up playing Russian roulette for a living and becoming addicted to heroin as a way to cope. When Mike comes back to get him, he doesn't recognize him until he plays against him, and then Nick dies. He was my favorite character so I was very upset when he died. I think that their previous lives makes all of this fairly plausible, but it could have happened differently. Steve was weaker emotionally, so it seems likely that he would have lost his mind, and perhaps wound up dead.

I totally agree with this because the Vietnam war was not the typical war, it was south vs. north, all the people looked the same we could not easily identify our enemy. These enemies were not the typical enemy, no more than Russian Roulette is the typical thing that prisoners of war play with their captures. When Nick and Micheal play Russian roulet in the end I think that one of the reasons that Nick dies is because he has spent the most days in Vietnam, he has gone through the most empty gun chambers. Micheal lives because in symbolism he has had as many days or empty chambers as Nick.",The Deer Hunter
901,buxton-painting,Still one of the best...,10,16 October 2007,"""The Deer Hunter"" is, quite simply, one of the best movies of any genre ever made. Though lengthy and a bit dated, you simply have to marvel at the intricacies. Western PA was represented about as well as can be - for the time period. The speech patterns and local jargon are masterfully used by the actors. The steel mills/communities that helped build this country/world are exemplified. It serves as a reminder to Hollywood that there's more to America than the over-used New England and New York stereotypes or the southern ""drawl"".There are three acts to this movie: I Pre-war, II War, and III Post-war. I'll admit that the wedding scene in Act I drags a bit. However, I implore you to just watch. Immerse yourself in it. It will be worth it by the time the ""action"" starts. DeNiro and Walken show us why they are who they are today: living legends. The Russian Roulette scene will trigger emotions of even the manliest man.Great as the movie was, it needs to be said: The ""deer"" were actually ""Red deer"" - native only to Canada. The mountains are definitely Rocky and not Appalachian. Please don't let these two minorities dissuade you.I, personally, need to tell everyone that - despite the political nature of the film - there really are times when we all need to grow up and just enjoy art. I am an admitted Republican/Conservative, but this movie was so good that I really never thought about the political controversies of the time. I truly got the feeling - as I was watching - that, despite your political/war beliefs, this was just a movie about normal people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.

In an interview I saw with the writer, he states that he had written a story depicting the experience he had as an Eastern European immigrant in the US, living (in a predominantly Russian I believe) industrial town. There is a certain sense of searching for an identity. I mean let's face it most movies about that time period do not depict such cultural traditions like we see in Deer Hunter; they are usually set in the background of suburban ""apple pie"" America. Notice that in one scene Nick is asked if his name is Russian and he sternly says ""American"". I think that's the kind of sense that the writer was trying to go with. The simplicity of the story, really reminds me of what the average blue collar guy goes through and it really is a tribute to that.",The Deer Hunter

Given how close production was to the war's closing, this was not what the producers aimed for.
Rather, the story is a human one, telling the fates of 3 friends from the same town who went off to Vietnam. And in a sense, it pulls off the mix of pre-tour escapades, the war and the aftermath masterfully.
The all-star cast includes young Robert DeNiro, Meryll Streep and Christopher Walken.From the 70s small town streets, to the forests of Pennsylvania, to jungles of Vietnam, to the streets of wartime Saigon, to scenes of joy and to scenes of great sorrow, the film through its 3 hours takes the viewer on a journey. The final scene, so simple, so poignant, brought me to tears.
10/10 without a doubt.",The Deer Hunter
